TI  - Optimal settings of near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green for intraoperative detection of lymph node metastasis in esophageal cancer
T2  - GENERAL THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphatic flow mapping using near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) has been used for intraoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in various cancers. Accurate prediction of LNM intraoperatively may allow minimization of the extent of lymphadenectomy. However, a consistent method and diagnostic ability, allowing application of NIR-guided lymphatic flow mapping to esophageal cancer (EC), have not been established due to the multidirectional and complex characteristics of lymphatic flow in the esophagus. Herein, we present a novel NIR-guided surgical technique for predicting lymph node stations potentially containing LNM in EC with high diagnostic accuracy derived from appropriately adjusting the ICG injection setting.

TI  - Integrated Landsat multispectral imagery and airborne geophysical data for enhanced litho-structural mapping: A case study of Adamawa Massif, north-eastern Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-7 ETM + satellite imagery integrated with corrected airborne geophysical data (radiometric, gravity, and aeromagnetic) anomalies maps, and field investigations were used to discriminate lithologies and related structures in Mayo-Belwa and Jada-Ganye-Toungo areas (Adamawa Massif), northeastern Nigeria. Field in-vestigations portray the granite-gneisses as the oldest rock units, and have sequentially been invaded by the syn-, late-to post-collisional Older granites. Subsurface linear structures in the area display dominant NE-SW, NW-SE, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW trends, reflective of variations in pre-existing structural orientations, and near-surface expressions of reactivated zones of weakness in the basement crust. The geodynamic systems revealed that most elongated lineaments are expressed as axial part of valleys trending NE-SW, ENE and NNW, forming diagonal grid to the NW-SE stresses. Abnormally high total radioactivity gravitates to areas of deflection (alluvium), and late-and post-tectonic granites. The gravity intensity provides a spectrum of anomalous responses including abnormally high positive gravity (volcanic rocks), moderately high positive gravity (granite-gneisses and late-to post-tectonic and syn-tectonic granites), background gravity and low negative gravity (granite-gneisses, alluvium and proluvium). Aeromagnetic anomalies discriminate the Older granites (intense positive anomalies), granite-gneisses, sediments (moderate positive, near background, and moderate-intensive negative anomalies), syn-tectonic granites (moderate positive anomalies), banded-gneiss and amphibolite (intensive negative anoma-lies), volcanic rocks (intense negative anomaly), and alluvium/proluvium (low positive anomalies). This present study led to the development of up-to-date and accurate litho-structural and geophysical maps of the geologically-rugged and hardly accessible Adamawa Massif, north-eastern Nigeria and further constrain the geochemical (High-K calc-alkaline, peraluminous) and tectonic (syn-to post-collisional) characteristics of typical Pan-African granitoids.

TI  - Investigating the land surface albedo trend in Iran using remote sensing data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent droughts in Iran have contributed to declining runoff, diminishing lake water levels, and rising salt levels due to lower runoff. This study aims to quantify how the recent changes affected to investigate the trend of land surface albedo in Iran between 2000 and 2018. Accessing field data from the Iran is difficult, and thus the common understanding of climate change in the region is strongly based on satellite data. We use remotely sensed data of land surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), number of snow-covered days (SCDs), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land cover type, obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results show decreasing trends in albedo and SCDs by - 0.02 and - 0.52, respectively, and upward trends in the LST and NDVI data by 0.07 degrees C and 0.009, respectively. Due to the recent drought condition in Iran, SCDs decreased significantly, which might explain the reason behind the albedo decreases in winter time in Iran.

TI  - Novel highly-multiplexed AmpliSeq targeted assay for <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> genetic surveillance use cases at multiple geographical scales
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the power of genetic surveillance tools has been acknowledged widely, there is an urgent need in malaria endemic countries for feasible and cost-effective tools to implement in national malaria control programs (NMCPs) that can generate evidence to guide malaria control and elimination strategies, especially in the case of Plasmodium vivax. Several genetic surveillance applications ('use cases') have been identified to align research, technology development, and public health efforts, requiring different types of molecular markers. Here we present a new highly-multiplexed deep sequencing assay (Pv AmpliSeq). The assay targets the 33-SNP vivaxGEN-geo panel for country-level classification, and a newly designed 42-SNP within-country barcode for analysis of parasite dynamics in Vietnam and 11 putative drug resistance genes in a highly multiplexed NGS protocol with easy workflow, applicable for many different genetic surveillance use cases. The Pv AmpliSeq assay was validated using: 1) isolates from travelers and migrants in Belgium, and 2) routine collections of the national malaria control program at sentinel sites in Vietnam. The assay targets 229 amplicons and achieved a high depth of coverage (mean 595.7 +/- 481) and high accuracy (mean error-rate of 0.013 +/- 0.007). P. vivax parasites could be characterized from dried blood spots with a minimum of 5 parasites/mu L and 10% of minority-clones. The assay achieved good spatial specificity for between-country prediction of origin using the 33-SNP vivaxGEN-geo panel that targets rare alleles specific for certain countries and regions. A high resolution for within-country diversity in Vietnam was achieved using the designed 42-SNP within-country barcode that targets common alleles (median MAF 0.34, range 0.01-0.49. Many variants were detected in (putative) drug resistance genes, with different predominant haplotypes in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt genes in different provinces in Vietnam. The capacity of the assay for high resolution identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis was demonstrated and identified a high rate of shared ancestry within Gia Lai Province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, as well as between the coastal province of Binh Thuan and Lam Dong. Our approach performed well in geographically differentiating isolates at multiple spatial scales, detecting variants in putative resistance genes, and can be easily adjusted to suit the needs in other settings in a country or region. We prioritize making this tool available to researchers and NMCPs in endemic countries to increase ownership and ensure data usage for decision-making and malaria policy.

TI  - Multiple crop yield estimation and forecasting using MERRA-2 model, satellite-gauge and MODIS satellite data by time series and regression modelling approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple crop yield estimation and forecasting have become essential because climate change and land degradation are deteriorating production of crops. The present study presents multiple crop yield estimation and forecasting efficiently and precisely using MERRA-2 model, satellite-gauge and MODIS-Terra satellite data by regression and time series models. Rice, wheat, maize, rapeseed & mustard, and millet crops yield data of India was used for crop yield estimation and forecasting using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Decomposition, Holt, Winters and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Models were developed using crops yield historical data, weather variables (temperature, precipitation, surface radiation) and pollutants (O-3, CO) data of 1982-83 to 2014-15. Overall best correlation (R = 0.96) and poor correlation (R = 0.56) was found between observed and estimated rice and rapeseed & mustard crops using Decomposition and MLR models, respectively. After rigorous skill assessment and out of more than 20 combinations of ARIMA models, the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) time series model performed the best with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 4.59%) for wheat crop estimation. Forecasted crop yields were successfully cross-validated using four years' data (2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19) for regression and time series models by comparing Relative Error (RE%) between observed and forecasted crops yields. Results were statistically analyzed using correlation coefficient (R), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), RMSE%, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE%), t-value and p-value. The crop yield estimation and forecasting results showed reasonably quantifiable information with the actual datasets. The outcomes of the present study have policy level implications for compensation to farming communities for the loss of crops.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few years, the world's urban population has significantly increased and it is expected to undergo a continuous accelerated growth. This urban revolution confronts us with real challenges to promote urban sus-tainable development and has significant effects on socioeconomic development and the urban environment. This research suggests an approach to assess urban sustainability (US) based on the integration of census in-formation, GIS, and remote-sensing data, which can support urban planners and decision-makers in broad environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. Five environmental indices retrieved from Landsat-8 imagery were coupled with eight general census socioeconomic indicators using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA produced three components, and each one was considered a unique urban sustainability aspect covering social, economic, and/or environmental dimensions. Furthermore, the obtained result was exploited to develop a synthetic US index at the commune level with the main aim to assess urban sustainability and its spatial dis-tribution. The outcome depicts that the US is adequate in 50% of Casablanca city, which contains nearly the third of the urban population. This research remains so promising and can be considered by urban planners as a reference to take necessary actions to improve sustainability, resilience, and well-being in the most vulnerable communes.

TI  - Land use change and its effect on selected soil properties in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence on land use/land cover (LULC) change and its effect on soil properties are important for sustainable land management interventions. Hence, this study was conducted to analyze LULC change over a period of 31 years and to evaluate the effects of land use on soil properties in the Ganzer watershed, northwest Ethiopia. Landsat satellite images (1988, 2002 and 2019) were used as a source of information image analysis and LULC classifi-cation were done using ERDAS imagine 2010 software. About 24 composite soil samples were collected from four land use types (natural forest, plantation forest, cultivated and grazing lands) at two soil depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm) to determine soil properties. Standard soil analytical methods were used in carrying out soil analysis. The result revealed that the study site has undergone extensive land use changes where cultivated and grazing lands declined by 5.4% and 22.6%, respectively. However, the settlement and forest lands increased by 7.9% and 20%, respectively (1988-2019). The soil physicochemical properties differed significantly (p < 0.05) across the land use types and with soil depth. Higher contents of clay, pH, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and CEC were recorded in the natural forest than in the other land use types. Similarly, pH, clay, BD and exchangeable bases increased with an increase in soil depth across all land use types. Generally, LULC change in the study area showed a significant increase in settlement and forest lands due to population pressure and expansion of eucalyptus plantation forests. These inappropriate land use changes have a negative effect on soil properties. Therefore, an appropriate and effective intervention in the land use systems should be implemented to amend soil properties.

TI  - Bathymetry retrieval from CubeSat image sequences with short time lags
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of CubeSat constellations could revolutionize the way inland and nearshore coastal waters are monitored from space. This potential stems from the ability of CubeSats to provide daily imagery with global coverage at meter-scale spatial resolution. In this study, we explore the unique opportunity to improve the retrieval of bathymetry offered by CubeSats, specifically those of the PlanetScope constellation. The orbital design of the PlanetScope constellation enables the acquisition of image sequences with short time lags (from seconds to hours). This characteristic allows multiple images to be captured during a short period of steady bathymetric conditions, especially in dynamic environments like rivers. We hypothesize that taking the ensemble mean of a CubeSat image sequence can enhance bathymetry retrieval compared to standard single-image analysis. Along with the existing optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) algorithm, we also use a new neural network-based depth retrieval (NNDR) technique to infer bathymetry from both individual and time-averaged images. The two methodologies are evaluated using field data from five different river reaches with depths up to 15 m and both top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance and bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) surface reflectance PlanetScope data products. Despite low spectral resolution and concerns about the radiometric quality of CubeSat imagery, accuracy assessment based on in-situ comparisons indicates the potential (0.52 < R-2 < 0.7 for the NNDR method) of PlanetScope imagery to retrieve depths up to similar to 10 m in clear water conditions. The proposed image averaging consistently improves bathymetry retrieval over single image analysis. The NNDR technique was found to outperform OBRA, illustrating the importance of leveraging all spectral bands through machine learning approaches. TOA data provided more robust bathymetry results than BOA data for the OBRA technique, but the NNDR technique was minimally impacted by the type of data product.

TI  - Canadian and Alaskan wildfire smoke particle properties, their evolution, and controlling factors, from satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical and chemical properties of biomass burning (BB) smoke particles greatly affect the impact that wildfires have on climate and air quality. Previous work has demonstrated some links between smoke properties and factors such as fuel type and meteorology. However, the factors controlling BB particle speciation at emission are not adequately understood nor are the factors driving particle aging during atmospheric transport. As such, modeling wildfire smoke impacts on climate and air quality remains challenging. The potential to provide robust, statistical characterizations of BB particles based on ecosystem type and ambient environmental conditions with remote sensing data is investigated here. Space-based Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) observations, combined with the MISR Research Aerosol (RA) algorithm and the MISR Interactive Explorer (MINX) tool, are used to retrieve smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD) and to provide constraints on plume vertical extent; smoke age; and particle size, shape, light-absorption properties, and absorption spectral dependence. These tools are applied to numerous wildfire plumes in Canada and Alaska, across a range of conditions, to create a regional inventory of BB particle-type temporal and spatial distribution. We then statistically compare these results with satellite measurements of fire radiative power (FRP) and land cover characteristics, as well as short-term climate, meteorological, and drought information from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) reanalysis and the North American Drought Monitor. We find statistically significant differences in the retrieved smoke properties based on land cover type, with fires in forests producing the thickest plumes containing the largest, brightest particles and fires in savannas and grasslands exhibiting the opposite. Additionally, the inferred dominant aging mechanisms and the timescales over which they occur vary systematically between land types. This work demonstrates the potential of remote sensing to constrain BB particle properties and the mechanisms governing their evolution over entire ecosystems. It also begins to realize this potential, as a means of improving regional and global climate and air quality modeling in a rapidly changing world.

TI  - A conceptual model for simulating streamflow in a changing snow-covered catchment: application to the data-sparse upper Brahmaputra River basin
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the hydrological processes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is increasingly important as the snow resources feed the demand for freshwater for a vast downstream population. Given the limited information available, the task of formulating a hydrological model that characterizes future streamflow at downstream locations is challenging. A flexible conceptual hydrological model is proposed relating snow cover fraction (SCF) and snow water equivalent (SWE) based on remote sensing data, with the aim of characterising flow in the region into the future where temperature profiles will be considerably warmer than they are at present. The model's novelty lies in its ability to simulate dynamically varying SCF, SWE and streamflow using limited available data. Results show the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of modelled SCF, SWE and streamflow are 0.82, 0.66 and 0.75, respectively, in the calibration period (1981 to 1992), whereas they are 0.78, 0.56 and 0.70, respectively, in the validation period (1993 to 2000).

TI  - Long transient response of vegetation dynamics after four millennia of anthropogenic impacts in an island ecosystem
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agents of global change commonly have a higher impact on island ecosystem dynamics. In the Mediterranean region, those dynamics have historically been influenced by anthropogenic impacts, for example, the introduction of invasive species and overharvesting of resources. Here, we analysed the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in sa Dragonera island, which experienced a large environmental change ca. 4000 years ago by the arrival of humans. Anthropogenic impacts, such as herbivory by goats and over-logging, ended in the 1970s, while in 2011 the site became the largest Mediterranean island where rats were eradicated. Invasive rats and goats played the ecological role of two endemic species, the cave goat and the giant dormouse, which inhabited the island for more than 5 million years and were rapidly extinct by humans. We used Landsat imagery to explore NDVI as a proxy of vegetation productivity over the years 1984-2021, orthophotos to assess changes in land and vegetation covers and historical plant inventories to study the dynamics in plant diversity. Results showed that those indicators steadily increased both in spring and in summer, while the noise around the trends was partially explained by climate variability. The regime shifts in the temporal dynamics of vegetation productivity suggested a transient from a perturbed to a non-perturbed stable state. Trends in successional dynamics, spatial self-organization and plant diversity also showed the same type of transient dynamics. Historical perturbations related to harvesting (mainly the synergies between goat browsing, burning and forest over-logging) were more important than rat eradication or the influence of climate to explain the vegetation dynamics. Our study shows the transient nature of this small island ecosystem after 4000 years of perturbations and its current path towards vegetation dynamics more controlled by ecological interactions lacking large herbivores and omnivores, drought dynamics and the carrying capacity of the island.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the ROLL technique to localize malignant mammary microcalcifications and the risk of local recurrence, we performed a multicentre prospective observational study to assess the application of the technique and progress of patients with a 10year follow-up.Materials and methods: Between 2007 and 2010, 64 patients were recruited. All the patients had been diagnosed with breast neoplasm due to microcalcifications on mammography and were treated with conservative surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. A technetium-99m injection was performed preoperatively, with a single or several punctures (> 3.5 cm lesions), guided by mammography or by ultrasound. In all cases, we performed a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, to assess contrast migration, and intraoperative mammogram to assess correct removal of the lesion.Results: In the 64 patients, contrast injection could be confirmed, and lymphoscintigraphy proved correct migration of the contrast to the sentinel node, allowing excision of the mammary lesion and of the sentinel lymph node in 100%. The intraoperative mammogram showed complete lesion excision in 100% cases. The patho-logy showed radicality in the first surgery of 84.4% and showed a disease-free survival of 84% at 10 years.Conclusion: The SNOLL technique (ROLL + SNB) is a feasible and accurate technique for the localization and surgical treatment of malignant microcalcifications with disease-free survival and a relapse rate comparable to the rest of the techniques. Likewise, we propose systematic cavity shave to reduce the need for reinterventions. (c) 2022 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

TI  - The use of remote sensing for desertification studies: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Review
AB  - The study and assessment of desertification and/or the advance or retreat of arid areas as a function of natural and anthropogenic causes is necessary for the prediction of future risks from climate change, and to support policymaking, action plans, and mitigation measures that can be taken at local and global scales. Remote sensing enables modelling, monitoring, and prediction of the behaviour of several elements of desertification. There have been numerous approaches to study desertification using remote sensing over the years. This research explored the timeline and global distribution of studies using remote sensing in studying desertification. Additionally, the review evaluated the key methods and variables that have been used to study desertification from remote sensing data. The use of remote sensing for desertification studies can be trace back to 1991. From 2015 to 2020, more than 40 articles were published per year, showing that there has been a recent increase in the use of remote sensing techniques and its availability for monitoring desertification. Most regions of the world affected by desertifi-cation are being studied using remote sensing, however, there is a marked geographical variation between the number of studies in various regions, with Asia having disproportionately high number of studies compared to America or Africa. The country with most studies of desertification using remote sensing is China. In terms of satellite data, Landsat images provide the bulk of data used to study desertification, especially the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor. Classification and change detection are the most used methods to study desert-ification from remote sensing data. Additionally, land cover/land use change and vegetation and its attributes (e. g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index -NDVI) are the most used variables to study desertification using remote sensing techniques. Finally, the review found major differences in terms of the ranges or thresholds applied to these variables when determining the presence or risk of desertification. Therefore, there is a need to develop thresholds and ranges of changes of key selected variables, which can be used to determine the presence of desertification.

TI  - Association of winter vegetation activity across the indo-gangetic plain with the subsequent Indian summer monsoon rainfall
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - For the period 2001-2020, the interannual variability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is investigated in connection to Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR). According to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data, the ISMR and the vegetative activity of the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) in the month of January show a significant negative association. We hypothesized that the January vegetation state affects the ISMR via a delayed hydrological response, in which the wet soil moisture anomaly formed throughout the winter to accommodate the water needs of intensive farming influences the ISMR. The soil moisture anomalies developed in the winter, particularly in the root zone, persisted throughout the summer. Evaporative cooling triggered by increasing soil moisture lowers the summer surface temperature across the IGP. The weakening of monsoon circulation as a result of the reduced intensity of land-sea temperature contrast led in rainfall suppression. Further investigation shows that moisture transport has increased significantly over the past two decades as a result of increasing westerly over the Arabian Sea, promoting rainfall over India. Agriculture activities, on the other hand, have resulted in greater vegetation in India's northwest and IGP during the last two decades, which has a detrimental impact on rainfall processes. Rainfall appears to have been trendless during the last two decades as a result of these competing influences. With a lead time of 5 months, this association between January's vegetation and ISMR could be one of the potential predictors of seasonal rainfall variability.

TI  - The chemical code for attracting <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquitoes use chemical codes to locate and discriminate among vertebrate hosts to obtain a blood meal. Recent advances have allowed for the identification of the chemical codes used by mosquitoes to locate and discriminate humans from other vertebrate hosts. Humans are incidental "dead-end" hosts for the West Nile virus, which is maintained in an enzootic cycle, primarily through its transmission between infected birds by Culex mosquitoes. Host-seeking Culex mosquitoes are attracted to the odor of chicken, which are used in sentinel traps to monitor West Nile virus transmission. Using combined gas chromatography and electroantennography and mass spectrometry we identify a blend of volatile organic compounds present in chicken emanates, including mostly salient bioactive compounds previously identified in human emanates. When released at their identified ratios, this blend elicits behavioral responses of Culex pipiens molestus and Culex quinquefasciatus similar to that to the natural chicken odor. Tested under field conditions, this blend attract Culex spp. and other species of mosquitoes using birds among their hosts. This study provides evidence for conserved chemical codes for resource location by mosquitoes, and highlights the intricate role of CO2 for host-seeking mosquitoes. The identification of conserved chemical codes, which drive innate preference behaviors that are fundamental for survival and reproduction, provides important substrates for future control interventions targeting disease vector mosquitoes.

TI  - Using SPOT VEGETATION for analyzing dynamic changes and influencing factors on vegetation restoration in the Three-River Headwaters Region in the last 20 years (2000-2019), China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the relationship between the dynamic changes of vegetation with the natural environment and anthropogenic activities will be critical for developing ecosystem adaptation strategies. This study is focused on using SPOT VEGETATION to reveal the spatial heterogeneity and driving forces on vegetation NDVI dynamics in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of China from 2000 to 2019, through a combination of factors regression and geo-detector methods to analyze vegetation NDVI dynamics at multiple time scales and explore the relationship between natural and anthropogenic factors with vegetation NDVI. The results of this study show that:(1)The vegetation NDVI of the TRHR from 2000 to 2019 showed a fluctuating upward trend with a linear tendency being 0.00326.yr(-1), which was mainly due to the increase of the land with high vegetation cover (mainly mountain forest and alpine scrub meadow);(2)Precipitation was not only the dominant influencing factor of the spatial distribution of NDVI in the TRHR from 2000 to 2019, whose average contribution of the precipitation to NDVI was 0.5573, but also determined the fitting accuracy of the regression function. The higher the precipitation coefficient value in the regression function, the better the fitting accuracy of the regression function. The annual precipitation and other factors when taken together strong enhanced one another;(3)In the last 20 years, the q values of most driving factors were relatively stable, and the q value distribution showed obvious stratification characteristics;(4)The precipitation gradient affected the interpretation degree of NDVI spatial heterogeneity in the TRHR. With precipitation increasing the explanatory power of the factors stabilizes, and the NDVI tended to be more influenced by elevation and temperature in the eastern part of the TRHR where precipitation was higher. As the climate has transitioned from warm and dry to warm and humid, and the implementation of ecological projects such as ecological restoration and protection, it is reasonable assurance that sustainable vegetation restoration in the TRHR will continue in the future.

TI  - Retrieving aerosols single scattering albedo from MODIS reflectances
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Single scattering albedo (SSA) is a key parameter to estimate aerosol direct radiative forcing. However, retrieving SSA from satellite observations is still challenging. In this study, a new method optimizing the aerosol optical model based on four basic aerosol components is developed for retrieving SSA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The new method takes advantage of the relationship between aerosol composition and reflectance at multiple wavelengths to derive SSA, which considers the variation of aerosol species with time and location. A sensitivity study considering the uncertainties from the top of the atmosphere (TOA) apparent reflectance, aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters is performed to test the stability of the proposed method. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of the new method. The root mean square error (RMSE) is within 0.03 at 470 and 550 nm based on the sensitivity study. The aerosol components used in our method show better representativeness of real aerosol components than that used in the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum - Vector (6SV) model. The aerosols SSA values are retrieved from real MODIS observations with the new method and compared with the AERONET SSA product at two polluted AERONET sites in Asia. A better consistency with the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.27- 0.55 and the RMSE within 0.04 at 470 and 550 nm wavelengths between MODIS SSA retrievals and the AERONET SSA product is obtained with the new method compared with that of deep blue (DB) SSA. The new method can help to better understand aerosol radiative forcing regionally and globally.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of flood disaster based on remote sensing data cube
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency dynamic monitoring of flood disaster using remote sensing technology is crucial for accurate decision-making of disaster prevention and relief. However, the current trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing sensors limits their application in high-frequency dynamic monitoring of flood disaster. To deal with this challenge, in this study, we presented an approach to conduct high-frequency dynamic monitoring of flood disaster based on remote sensing data cube with high spatial and temporal resolution. The presented approach included two steps: a, removing the cloudy areas in original MODIS data to construct the cloud-free MODIS data cube by using the information provided by GPM rainfall data; b, fusing the cloud-free MODIS data cube and Landsat-8 data by using the spatiotemporal data fusion algorithm to construct the high spatiotemporal resolution (Landsat-like) data cube. The approach was tested by conducting high-frequency dynamic monitoring of flood disaster occurred in Henan Province, PR China. Our study had three main results: (1) the presented cloud removal algorithm in the first step was able to retain flood information and performed well in removing clouds during consecutive rainy days. The differences between cloud-free MODIS data cube and original MODIS data were small and the cloud-free MODIS data cube could be used for constructing high spatiotemporal resolution data cube. (2) Our presented approach could be used to conduct high-frequency dynamic monitoring of flood disaster. (3) Testing results showed that there were two floods occurred in the study area from July 17, 2021, to October 16, 2021; the first flood occurred from July 17, 2021, to September 15, 2021, with maximum affected area of 668.36 km(2); the second flood occurred from September 18, 2021, to October 16, 2021, with maximum affected area of 303.88 km(2). Our study provides a general approach for high-frequency monitoring of flood disaster.

TI  - Study on forest fire risk in Conghua district of Guangzhou city based on multi-source data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire not only seriously affects the stability of forest ecosystem, but also threatens the safety of human life and property. It is very important to evaluate and forecast the risk of forest fire. This paper takes Conghua District of Guangzhou City as the research area. Based on Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data, Sentinel-1 data, nighttime light data, DEM data, the seven evaluation factors of fuel moisture content, land surface temperature, altitude, slope, proximity to river, proximity to road and proximity to settlement are calculated. The forest fire risk assessment index system is constructed by analytic hierarchy process. Data from 326 historical active fires obtained by NASA-FIRMS website are used to verify. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is used to estimate the performance of the forest fire risk map. The result shows that the value of AUC is 0.791, indicating that the forest fire risk assessment index system has good applicability to Conghua District of Guangzhou City, and it can provide scientific reference for the establishment of forest fire risk assessment index system in other areas.

TI  - Omission of Intraoperative Frozen Section May Reduce Axillary Overtreatment Among Clinically Node-Negative Patients Having Upfront Mastectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The growing use of postmastectomy radiation/regional nodal irradiation (PMRT) has resulted in many women receiving both axillary dissection (ALND) and PMRT, increasing lymphedema rates. After developing standardized PMRT criteria, we adopted a policy of ALND omission among cN0 patients with 1-2 positive sentinel nodes (+SLNs) requiring PMRT. We evaluated how often overtreatment with ALND+PMRT was avoided with this approach. Methods A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed beginning 1 year before policy adoption. Intraoperative SLN evaluation was routine pre- and post-policy. ALND was performed for SLN macrometastasis pre-policy, and selectively performed post-policy for 1-2 +SLNs based on PMRT criteria. ALND+PMRT was required for >= 3 +SLNs. Results From March 1, 2018 to November 30, 2020, a total of 2207 cT1-3N0 patients had mastectomy and 231 had +SLNs; 109 (47%) were treated pre-policy and 122 (53%) post-policy. Most (81%) had 1-2 +SLNs. There was no change in rates of ALND+PMRT (64% pre-policy vs. 58% post-policy, p = 0.09), including in patients with 1-2 +SLNs (61% vs. 51%, p = 0.20). Post-policy, ALND was omitted in 9 (7%) patients recognized intraoperatively as PMRT candidates; avoidable ALND was performed in 40 (33%) patients not identified as PMRT candidates until receipt of final pathology. Overall, had intraoperative SLN evaluation been deferred, only 5.7% of patients would have required completion ALND: 2.2% (n = 49/2207) for >= 3 +SLNs and 3.5% (n = 77/2207) for 1-2 +SLNs without PMRT indication. Conclusions Most patients could have avoided ALND+PMRT if decision making was deferred until final pathology was available. Selective intraoperative SLN evaluation in cN0 patients having upfront mastectomy may reduce avoidable overtreatment.

TI  - Is the flight and foraging activity of small-size stingless bee affected by the urban heat island? The case of <i>Plebeia catamarcensis</i> (Meliponini) in Cordoba city (Argentina)
T2  - JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) effect is considered one of the major drivers of changes in insect behavior within cities. Here, we evaluated the flight and the nectar and pollen foraging activities of the southernmost stingless bee, Plebeia catamarcensis, along a land surface temperature gradient in central and peri-urban areas of the city of Cordoba (Argentina), as a proxy for the UHI effect. Flight and foraging activity were recorded in ten colonies located along the temperature gradient in summer. We registered the bees' activity in three time-bands (morning, midday and afternoon) through video recording. The temperature gradient was obtained from Landsat 8 data in a buffer around each nest. Our results showed that overall flight activity as well as nectar foraging significantly increased with temperature. Pollen foraging, however, was significantly explained by time-bands with the highest activity concentrated in the morning, and independently of the temperature gradient. In addition, nectar and pollen foraging patterns were negatively associated. Whereas P. catamarcensis would take advantage of higher urban temperatures to forage nectar, the pollen foraging strategy may hide an avoidance competition behavior sustained by the limited pollen availability compared with that of nectar. As a first attempt to address the UHI effect on a stingless bee, our results address the potential ability of the southermost P. catamarcensis populations to overcome the negative effects of urban warming observed for other bees.

TI  - A Coordinated Sampling and Identification Methodology for Larval Parasitoids of Spotted-Wing Drosophila
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide recommendations for sampling and identification of introduced larval parasitoids of spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). These parasitoids are either under consideration for importation (aka classical) biological control introductions, or their adventive (presumed to have been accidentally introduced) populations have recently been discovered in North America and Europe. Within the context of the ecology of D. suzukii and its parasitoids, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of estimating larval parasitism levels using different methods, including naturally collected fruit samples and sentinel baits. For most situations, we recommend repeated sampling of naturally occurring fruit rather than using sentinel baits to monitor seasonal dynamics of host plant-Drosophila-parasitoid associations. We describe how to separate Drosophilidae puparia from host fruit material in order to accurately estimate parasitism levels and establish host-parasitoid associations. We provide instructions for identification of emerging parasitoids and include a key to the common families of parasitoids of D. suzukii. We anticipate that the guidelines for methodology and interpretation of results that we provide here will form the basis for a large, multi-research team sampling effort in the coming years to characterize the biological control and nontarget impacts of accidentally and intentionally introduced larval parasitoids of D. suzukii in several regions of the world.

TI  - Modelling the impacts of land use/land cover changing pattern on urban thermal characteristics in Kuwait
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization owing to population growth and economic development has made thermal environmentrelated studies increasingly prominent. This study aims to monitor and predict the changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and their impacts on land surface temperature (LST), urban heat island (UHI), and urban thermal field variance Index (UTFVI) in Kuwait from 1991 to 2021 for the very first time. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)machine learning algorithms were used to analyze and predict, respectively, using Landsat 4-5 and 8 images from 1991 to 2021 at 10 years interval. Results illustrated transformation of 27.24% bare land and 5.43% vegetation into the built-up area increased the mean LST by 5 degrees C, resulting in an upsurge of UHI values by 0.861 and the strongest UFTVI effects by 108% from 1991 to2021. Predicted LULC, LST, UHI and UTFVI distribution modelled using the ANN-based Cellular Automata technique for 2031 shows the declination of vegetation cover (44%) and water bodies (57%) during 2021-2031, resulting upsurge in built-up areas (38%) and higher LST (10 degrees C). Moreover, by 2031, 41% of the total study area will be covered by the strongest UTFVI affected zones. All the prediction was performed with a higher accuracy, and validated by RMSE and R2 values with predicted and real datasets. Assessing the predicted LULC, LST, UHI, and UTFVI distribution maps will help prospective policymakers and city planners to take the necessary actions by reducing heat stress impacts and make cities sustainable.

TI  - Vegetation changes in Yellow River Delta wetlands from 2018 to 2020 using PIE-Engine and short time series Sentinel-2 images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is the functional subject in the wetland ecosystem and plays an irreplaceable role in biodiversity conservation. It is of great significance to monitor wetland vegetation for scientific assessment of the impact of vegetation on ecological environment and biodiversity. In this paper, a method for extracting wetland vegetation based on short time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set was constructed. First, time series NDVI data were constructed using Sentinel-2 images. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used to classify the wetland vegetation types. The distributions of the main wetland vegetation in the study area in 2018 and 2020 were got. Finally, the land cover transfer matrix was calculated to analyze the spatial pattern and change of wetland vegetation emphatically from 2018 to 2020. Based on 46 Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2018 and 2020, the spatial pattern and change of vegetation in the Yellow River Delta wetlands were extracted and analyzed in this paper. The results show that: (1) The method for extracting wetland vegetation in estuary delta based on PIE-Engine platform and short time series NDVI data constructed in this paper can effectively extract the wetland vegetation information. The overall accuracy of the classification results reached 90.47% in 2018 and 80.30% in 2020. The Kappa coefficient of the classification results are 0.874 in 2018 and 0.739 in 2020 respectively. Compared with the results from the random forest classification method and the maximum likelihood classification method, the accuracy is improved by 6.40% and 13.04%, and the Kappa coefficient is improved by 0.055 and 0.069. (2) There were significant changes in vegetation coverage in the Yellow River Delta wetlands from 2018 to 2020. The Spartina alterniflora increased by 3.74km(2). The Suaeda salsa degraded seriously, and the total area decreased by 20.38km(2). In addition, the increase of Spartina alterniflora effectively guaranteed the stability of the coastline in the study area. This study can provide a theoretical basis for wetlands vegetation classificaton, and the classificaton results can provide scientific reference for protecting the ecological environment of wetlands and maintaining ecological stability.

TI  - Knowledge mapping of planetary boundaries based on bibliometrics analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The planetary boundaries concept has triggered a vast amount of pure and applied scientific research, as well as policy and governance activities globally. Indeed, it has rapidly become a centerpiece of sustainability study. It is crucial to review the scientific state of the planetary boundaries (PB) concept systematically. However, there is a lack of research on drawing a scientific investigation map of planetary boundaries. Therefore, to clarify the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics, research hotspots, and frontiers of planetary boundaries, a scientometric analysis was performed based on 530 academic publications on planetary boundaries from 2009 to 2021. This paper conducted the analysis by visualizing the social network, dual-map overlay, co-cited references, structure variation article, and co-occurrence keywords with CiteSpace. The results show that as a new achievement and paradigm in sustainable development research, the planetary boundaries framework is gradually getting global attention and promotion, which has increasingly become an interdisciplinary hot research topic. The most productive authors and institutions are concentrated in England, the USA, Germany, and Sweden. Relevant articles were mainly published in journals focusing on ecology, earth, marine, veterinary, animal, economics, and politics. In addition, we summarized four predominant research themes by clustering keywords: the calculation of single boundary threshold and present value, the integration with assessment methods such as life cycle assessment and footprint families, the downscaling of planetary boundaries, and the expansion to economic and social domains. For scholars who are interested in this topic, this paper would be a useful reference and guideline.

TI  - Rehabilitation planning in an oilfield in the Monte Austral: Mapping sand-sized sediment availability and assessing its effect on microtopography rehabilitation
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In drylands, the microtopography is formed by mound-shaped dunes of eolian deposition that occur around shrubs or other vegetation in clumps. These mounds are characteristic of the Monte Austral, which covers 20% of Argentina (approximately 50 million ha), has a strong water deficit and is subjected to land degradation by the oil industry. Considering the biogeomorphological approach, oilfield rehabilitation should begin with regeneration of the mounds as they provide safe sites for vegetation. Since rehabilitation success may be influenced by sand-sized sediment availability, we addressed two objectives: mapping the sediment availability in an oilfield and evaluating its effect on microtopography rehabilitation. We used a Sentinel-2 MSI scene and assessed three approaches to map the sediments: two expressions of the Normalized Difference Sand Index and the feature Brightness of the Tasselled Cap Transformation. We validated the three maps using a geomorphological map. Two maps showed the highest agreement with the geomorphological map and errors were associated with the detection of bright lithified or cohesive material not available for sediment transportation. Then, we evaluated the effect of sediments on microtopography rehabilitation. We compared the morphometric traits of mounds (height, maximum and minimum length) located in areas of low and high sediment availability, in both natural and scarified areas. We considered the time since scarification was applied (8-13, 4-8, or <4 years ago). The mounds in the natural areas were larger than the mounds in the scarified areas, so complete microtopography rehabilitation is not achieved 13 years after scarification. The mounds in high-sediment-availability areas were different from the initial condition 4 years after scarification, whereas differences took 8 years to become evident with low sediment availability. Sediment availability must be considered when designing rehabilitation techniques to ensure the success and sustainability of the project. Our results have implications for the development of a biogeomorphological model to guide rehabilitation planning.

TI  - Evaluation of different imaging modalities for axillary lymph node staging in breast cancer patients to provide a personalized and optimized therapy algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The reliable detection of tumor-infiltrated axillary lymph nodes for breast cancer [BC] patients plays a decisive role in further therapy. We aimed to find out whether cross-sectional imaging techniques could improve sensitivity for pretherapeutic axillary staging in nodal-positive BC patients compared to conventional imaging such as mammography and sonography. Methods Data for breast cancer patients with tumor-infiltrated axillary lymph nodes having received surgery between 2014 and 2020 were included in this study. All examinations (sonography, mammography, computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) were interpreted by board-certified specialists in radiology. The sensitivity of different imaging modalities was calculated, and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to detect variables influencing the detection of positive lymph nodes. Results All included 382 breast cancer patients had received conventional imaging, while 52.61% of the patients had received cross-sectional imaging. The sensitivity of the combination of all imaging modalities was 68.89%. The combination of MRI and CT showed 63.83% and the combination of sonography and mammography showed 36.11% sensitivity. Conclusion We could demonstrate that cross-sectional imaging can improve the sensitivity of the detection of tumor-infiltrated axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Only the safe detection of these lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis enables the evaluation of the response to neoadjuvant therapy, thereby allowing access to prognosis and improving new post-neoadjuvant therapies.

TI  - Applicability evaluation of multiple sets of soil moisture data on the tibetan plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the in situ data of the soil moisture-observation networks established at Maqu, Naqu, Ali, and Shiquanhe (Sq) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), and using five evaluation indices [Pearson correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean deviation (bias), standard deviation ratio (SDV), and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE)], the applicability of soil moisture datasets [COMBINED, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, ERA5, ERA5-Land (LAND), ERA-Interim (INTERIM), CLSM, and NOAH] was comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that, at the observation-network scale, ACTIVE exhibited the best applicability in Maqu (R = 0.704, ubRMSE = 0.040 m3/m3), COMBINED performed best in Naqu (R = 0.803, bias = 0.016 m3/m3), LAND displayed the best consistency with observations in Ali (R = 0.734, bias = -0.035 m3/m3), and ERA5 not only showed the best performance in Sq (R = 0.793, bias = -0.037 m3/m3) but also exhibited good results in the other three observation networks (R > 0.6). In a smaller-scale evaluation in Maqu, ACTIVE performed best, followed by ERA5. The COMBINED and PASSIVE products had serious gaps in Ali and Sq, and had the worst applicability in the western TP. In conclusion, considering the correlation results and temporal and spatial continuities, ERA5 is the most suitable soil moisture dataset for the TP.

TI  - Estimating crop type and yield of small holder fields in Burkina Faso using multi-day Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing affords the opportunity to monitor and evaluate data scarce regions where field collection efforts are costly. A particular challenge is monitoring and evaluation in regions with smallholder agricultural systems (-1 ha) that are often subsistence focused, vulnerable to food insecurity and data scarce. Using multi-day moderate resolution Sentinel-2 and Random Forest models, this study shows that crop type and rice yields in Burkina Faso can be predicted with greater than-80% accuracy in the rainy season. Model optimization using varying spectral and vegetation index inputs can increase crop type and yield prediction accuracy in the dry season where denser cultivation is a challenge for the 10-20 m resolution of Sentinel-2. However, there is a trade-off between opting for very high-resolution imagery (< 2 m) or the number of bands offered by Sentinel-2 as the bands that occupy and vegetation indices that utilize the red through NIR ranges were most important across all models. In addition, model type, linear Regression or nonlinear Random Forest, matters little when estimating yield in these landscapes, unless Har-monic regression is utilized for the linear model. This study also showed that a model trained with high quality 2019 dry season crop cut data can predict the subsequent dry season's interannual crop type with overall accuracy as high as 60%, comparable to crop type models trained with 2020 survey data and used to estimate crop type in the concurrent season, as the survey collection. This indicates some utility in leveraging the calibrated Random Forest models to make skillful predictions of interannual crop type and ultimately food availability of nearby commu-nities for years with no training data. Given increasing global food prices and restricted com-modity trade, understanding local agricultural productivity using affordable and timely remote sensing-based methods is essential for ensuring appropriate humanitarian interventions.

TI  - Chemical constituents of ambient fine particulate matter and obesity among school-aged children: A representative national study in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies show that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) contributes to childhood obesity. However, evidence on the effects of its constituents on obesity has not been explored.Methods: Using multistage stratified cluster sampling, we enrolled 41,439 school-age children (aged 6-17 years) from a representative nationwide survey of 30 provinces in China (mean age +/- standard deviation: 12.0 +/- 3.3 years). Weight and height were measured using a physician beam scale with a height rod, and covariates were determined using a standard questionnaire. The concentration of PM2.5 chemical constituents was estimated by a chemical transport (GEOS-Chem) model using input satellite data and ground-based observations. The constituents included black car-bon, ammonium, nitrate, organic matter, sulfate, and soil dust. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the association between the chemical constituents of PM2.5 and obesity.Results: A positive association between the constituents of PM2.5 and obesity were observed. Children were more sus-ceptible to black carbon than other species. A 1-mu g/m3 increase in black carbon led to a 0.079 (95 % confidence interval[CI]:0.028, 0.130)-kg/m2 increase in body mass index (BMI). This also increased the odds of being obese and over-weight to 1.174 (95 % CI: 1.111, 1.240) and 1.165 (95 % CI: 1.116, 1.216), respectively. Stratified analyses showed that the effects were stronger in girls and older children, as well as in urban and Northeast regions. The effect of the PM2.5 constituents on obese and overweight children from urban areas significantly interacted with that of rural areas. Conclusions: The PM2.5 constituents were associated with an increased BMI and childhood obesity. Further studies are warranted to validate these results and clarify their potential mechanisms. We suggest focusing on black carbon and Northeast regions.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evaluation of remote sensing rainfall data of TRMM satellite over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall estimation is the most important parameter for many water resource simulations and practices; therefore, precise and long-term data are required for trustworthy precipitation depiction. Recent advancements in remote sensing applications enabled researchers to estimate rainfall with greater geographical and temporal precision. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of a climatological satellite, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) in estimating rainfall, with ground-based gauge data for five years (2008-2012) across the entire Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In regional and station-based evaluations, many statistical performance metrics such as R-square (R-2), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative BIAS (R.B.), and correlation coefficient (CC) have been utilized. The southern, north-western, and south-western areas performed very well in the regression and correlation analyses. The problem of under and overestimating satellite data, according to R.B. analysis, exists across the Kingdom, with the southern, eastern, and north-western areas dominating (maximum over is R.B. =94.6% and minimum over is 7.5%, while maximum under R.B. = - 52.8% and minimum under R.B. = - 5.9%). The RMSE and MAE were higher in the Qassim, Jazan, and Makkah regions, whereas they were the lowest in the northwestern. In general, TRMM prominently identified rainfall in comparison with the ground-based data and performed moderately for the majority of stations and regions during the research period.

TI  - Perivascular infiltration reflects subclinical lymph node metastasis in invasive lobular carcinoma
T2  - VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is characterized by discohesive cells due to irreversible loss of E-cadherin expression and multiple satellites, where individual cell migration is evident without disturbance of the stroma. Neoplastic cells sometimes infiltrate the surrounding vessel in satellites. Here, we aimed to clarify the specific role of perivascular infiltration (PVI) and ameboid migration, characterized by nondisturbance of the background stromal structure, in ILCs. A total of 139 cases with ILC and 122 cases with invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (IBC-NST) were evaluated retrospectively. PVI was significantly more common in ILC than in IBC-NST (50% [70 of 139 cases] vs. 9% [11 of 122 cases], p < 0.001). ILC cases with PVI showed a larger pathological tumour size than clinical tumour size (p < 0.01), a higher frequency of pathological node status pN2-pN3 when limited to clinically node-negative cases (p < 0.01) and lower circularity of tumour morphology on imaging (p < 0.01) than ILC cases without PVI. In the pathological evaluation, the intensity and occupancy of tumour cells expressing phospho-myosin light chain 2, which is a hallmark of ameboid migration, were significantly higher in ILC cases with PVI than in those without PVI at the tumour margins (p < 0.05). ILC with PVI is associated with irregular, poorly defined tumour margins and lymph node metastasis without adenopathy, which is difficult to assess using imaging. PVI may be caused by ameboid migration, as shown by the positive expression of phospho-myosin light chain 2. The presence of PVI may be a predictor for clinically node-negative pN2-pN3 in ILC patients.

TI  - Is aquaculture development responsible for mangrove conversion in India?-A geospatial study to assess the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on mangroves in the last three decades
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture was cited as the primary factor for the reduction of mangrove area worldwide. But, there is no data available on the extent of conversion of mangroves for aquaculture in India, the second largest country in global aquaculture production. The present study assessed the factors of changes in mangroves area between the pre aquaculture period and recent years. Landsat TM images of 1988, Sentinel 2 A images of 2018, geospatial analysis, ground truth verification, post-classification approach, and accuracy assessment were used for the assessment. Comparing the extent of mangroves area in 1988 with 2018, the gain and loss was 278% and 30% in Kerala, 859% and 19% in Karnataka, 204% and 18% in Maharashtra, and 4100 and 20% in Daman and Diu respectively. Mangrove extent has increased due to restoration activities, while lost due to coastal erosion and other developmental activities. Combining mangrove statistics drawn from this study with available data from earlier study, indicate that the aquaculture has converted 2052 ha of mangroves, which represents 0.66% of India's mangrove area. The extent of mangroves increased by 20.72% in India between 1988 and 2018. There is a possibility that part of the mangrove -converted lands are privately owned. Besides, Coastal Aquaculture Au-thority Act of 2005 prohibits the use of mangrove lands to aquaculture. The present study proves that shrimp aquaculture is not accountable for the large-scale changes in the mangrove lands of India, except in Andhra Pradesh State. However, it demands the land use policy to protect the mangrove lands in private owned lands by allocating alternate resource space, and monitoring periodically.

TI  - Effects of changing climate on the groundwater potential: A case of Chongwe and Rufunsa Districts along the Chongwe River Catchment, Zambia
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the effects of changing climate on the groundwater potential along the Chongwe River Catchment of Chongwe and Rufunsa Districts, through the use of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS). The study area has since the year 2012 experienced water supply shortages, partly attributed to climate change, with the local utility considering the prospects of using groundwater for the area's water supply. The area's groundwater characterisation employed multi-parametric data sets that comprised of remotely sensed data and conventional maps, generated using a weighted overlay approach in geographical information system. A total of 12 general circulation models (GCMs) outputs for precipitation were used for the period 1980 to 2080 as one of the thematic layers for the prediction of the groundwater potential (GWP) zones. The GCMs predicted decreases in precipitation, with the EC-EARTH model being the best performing model in restructuring precipitation with NSE of 0.66 compared with the other 11 GCMs. The spatial-temporal GWP zones showed reductions in zones of high and moderate potential under decreasing rainfall amounts. For continued groundwater availability, the study advocates for optimal allocation of groundwater resources based on the spatial variability of groundwater potential and aquifer yields.

TI  - Combining L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar backscatter and TanDEM-X canopy height for forest aboveground biomass estimation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter based above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates are limited by the saturation of the backscatter-AGB curve. This work explores the potential of combining backscatter with polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) estimated forest stand height for improved AGB estimation. The models combining L-band backscatter and TanDEM-X height are compared with established backscatter based models. The models are also temporally cross-validated, i.e., trained on one acquisition date and validated for other dates. It is observed that with the input of height, the combined models perform significantly better than backscatter based models, with an improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) between 19% and 46%. The model utilizing HV-polarized backscatter and TanDEM-X PolInSAR height provide the best case AGB inversion with an R-2 = 0.78 and an RMSE of 27.1 Mg/ha or 22% of mean AGB. The results demonstrate the potential of the synergistic combination of L-band PolSAR (backscatter) and X-band PolInSAR (height) products for AGB mapping over a tropical forest range in India.

TI  - Detecting and mapping flood inundation areas in Fogera-Dera Floodplain, Ethiopia during an extreme wet season using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area, Fogera-Dera Floodplain, has experienced frequent flooding events in the past several decades related to the topography of the region, mainly during the rainy season. In this study, Four Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was utilized to detect, map, and analyze flood water inundations in the 2020 extreme wet season. Besides this, HEC-RAS 2D (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System) hydrodynamic model was utilized for result validation and comparison. Doing so, Sentinel-1A VV polarized SAR data sets were selected, and histogram-based thresholding method was applied to extract flood and non-flood inundated areas. The result showed that flood inundated area was about 32.02 km(2) on July 04, 2020, 79.96 km(2) on July 28, 2020, 127.48 km(2) on August 09, 2020, and 83.89 km(2) on August 21, 2020. Flood water expansion was linearly increased from 04 July up to 09 August, which was about 95.46 km(2 )and reached its peak stage on August 09, 2020. Afterward, from the period of 09-August 21, 2020, the flood was receded and decreased by 43.59 km(2). In contrast, the Hydrodynamic model was used to simulate flood inundations based on Ribe and the Gumara River time-series discharge data. The model simulation determines the flooding extent of the study area on August 09, 2020, and the result shows an inundation area of 135 km(2), which is similar to flood inundations extracted by SAR imagery. Generally, floodwater was expanded towards Ribe and Gumara river courses, on wetlands, depression areas, and along Lake Tana shoreline, where the elevation was extremely low. Therefore, a Time-based flood inundation map extracted from SAR images can give valuable information for the analysis of flood propagation and flood risk management.

TI  - The Landscape Fire Scars Database: mapping historical burned area and fire severity in Chile
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Achieving a local understanding of fire regimes requires high-resolution, systematic and dynamic databases. High-quality information can help to transform evidence into decision-making in the context of rapidly changing landscapes, particularly considering that geographical and temporal patterns of fire regimes and their trends vary locally over time. Global fire scar products at low spatial resolutions are available, but high-resolution wildfire data, especially for developing countries, are still lacking. Taking advantage of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) big-data analysis platform, we developed a flexible workflow to reconstruct individual burned areas and derive fire severity estimates for all reported fires. We tested our approach for historical wild-fires in Chile. The result is the Landscape Fire Scars Database, a detailed and dynamic database that reconstructs 8153 fires scars, representing 66.6% of the country's officially recorded fires between 1985 and 2018. For each fire event, the database contains the following information: (i) the Landsat mosaic of pre- and post-fire images; (ii) the fire scar in binary format; (iii) the remotely sensed estimated fire indexes (the normalized burned ratio, NBR, and the relative delta normalized burn ratio, RdNBR); and two vector files indicating (iv) the fire scar perimeter and (v) the fire scar severity reclassification, respectively. The Landscape Fire Scars Database for Chile and GEE script (JavaScript) are publicly available. The framework developed for the database can be applied anywhere in the world, with the only requirement being its adaptation to local factors such as data availability, fire regimes, land cover or land cover dynamics, vegetation recovery, and cloud cover. The Landscape Fire Scars Database for Chile is publicly available in https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.941127 (Miranda et al., 2022).

TI  - Pathologist initiated reflex <i>BRAF</i> mutation testing in metastatic melanoma: experience at a specialist melanoma treatment centre
T2  - PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Testing for BRAF mutations in metastatic melanoma is pivotal to identifying patients suitable for targeted therapy and influences treatment decisions regarding single agent versus combination immunotherapy. Knowledge of BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry (IHC) results can streamline decisions during initial oncology consultations, prior to DNA-based test results. In the absence of formal guidelines that require pathologist initiated (`reflex') BRAF mutation testing, our institution developed a local protocol to perform BRAF V600E IHC on specimens from all stage III/ IV melanoma patients when the status is otherwise unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the application of this protocol in a tertiary referral pathology department. A total of 408 stage III/IV melanoma patients had tissue specimens accessioned between 1 January and 31 March in three consecutive years (from 2019 to 2021), reported by 32 individual pathologists. The BRAF mutation status was established by pathologists in 87% (352/408) of cases. When a prior BRAF mutation status was previously known, as confirmed in linked electronic records (202/408), this status had been communicated by the clinician on the pathology request form in 1% of cases (3/202). Pathologists performed BRAF V600E IHC in 153 cases (74% of cases where the status was unknown, 153/ 206) and testing was duplicated in 5% of cases (20/408). Reflex BRAF IHC testing was omitted in 26% of cases (53/ 206), often on specimens with small volume disease (cytology specimens or sentinel node biopsies) despite adequate tissue for testing. Incorporating BRAF IHC testing within routine diagnostic protocols of stage III/IV melanoma was both feasible and successful in most cases. Communication of a patient's BRAF mutation status via the pathology request form will likely improve implementation of pathologist initiated BRAF mutation testing and may result in a reduction of duplicate tests. To improve pathologist reflex testing rates, we advocate for the use of an algorithmic approach to pathologist initiated BRAF mutation testing utilising both IHC and DNA-based methodologies for stage III/IV melanoma patients.

M3  - Article

CP  - International Conference of Pharmacoepidemiolgy
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Purpose It is a priority of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to monitor the safety of medications used during pregnancy. Pregnancy exposure registries and cohort studies utilizing electronic health record data are primary sources of information but are limited by small sample sizes and limited outcome assessment. TreeScan (TM), a statistical data mining tool, can be applied within the FDA Sentinel System to simultaneously identify multiple potential adverse neonatal and infant outcomes after maternal medication exposure. Methods We implemented TreeScan using the Sentinel analytic tools in a cohort of linked live birth deliveries and infants nested in the IBM MarketScan (R) Research Database. As a case study, we compared first trimester fluoroquinolone use and cephalosporin use. We used the Bernoulli and Poisson TreeScan statistics with compatible propensity score-based study designs for confounding control (matching and stratification) and used multiple propensity score models with various strategies for confounding control to inform best practices. We developed a hierarchical outcome tree including major congenital malformations and outcomes of gestational length and birth weight. Results A total of 1791 fluoroquinolone-exposed and 8739 cephalosporin-exposed mother-infant pairs were eligible for analysis. Both TreeScan analysis methods resulted in single alerts that were deemed to be due to uncontrolled confounding or otherwise not warranting follow-up. Conclusions In this implementation of TreeScan using Sentinel analytic tools, we did not observe any new safety signals for fluoroquinolone use in the first trimester. TreeScan, with tailored or high-dimensional propensity scores for confounding control, is a valuable tool in addition to current safety surveillance methods for medications used during pregnancy.

TI  - Remote sensing-based transformative crop insurance for rice
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - A robust crop insurance system is critical to limit the impact of multivariable risks and stimulate innovation and investment in the agricultural sectors. A genuine agricultural insurance claim is lacking in India due to unavailability of accurate data. Manual data collection of cropped area, prevented sowing, failed sowing, and flood- and drought-affected areas is laborious, time-consuming, cost-intensive and often erroneous. The existing insurance procedure is not transparent, accurate and fast due to the aforesaid issues. We can overcome these problems using satellite-based remote sensing. An alternative measure of paddy crop performance through crop health factor index derived from synthetic aperture radar remote sensing data can be utilized in place of yield data in the existing area-yield insurance scheme. Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have successfully implemented this technology, which can be applied across India to make crop insurance transparent, accurate and rapid.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of heat islands in the main urban area of Zhengzhou under the two-way influence of urbanization and urban forestry
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands are major factors hindering the quality of present-day urban habitats. The ongoing acceleration of the worldwide urbanization process is leading to an exacerbation of the urban heat island effect; however, urban forestry can mitigate it. For a sustainable urban development, it is particularly important to evaluate the dual effect of both factors on the urban heat island phenomenon. In this study, we focused on Zhengzhou City (China), at the center of the Central Plains Forest City Cluster. The spatial and temporal evolutions of the local urban heat island and vegetation coverage were measured from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing images taken between 2006-2020 and the effects of urban construction and urban forestry on the urban heat island effect were evaluated. The results showed that, in the past 15 years, the high-temperature zone in the urban area of Zhengzhou City has gradually spread from its center to surrounding areas. Within the same period, the whole urban heat island has deteriorated and gradually improved: its area increased by 138.72 km(2) between 2006-2014 and decreased by 135.66 km(2) between 2014-2020. Notably, the development of vegetation coverage occurred consistently with the improvement of the heat island. A quantitative analysis of the relationship between urban construction, the urban forest, and the urban heat island has shown that factors like population density (representing urban construction), urban planning, and vegetation cover (representing the urban forest) all have an impact on the urban heat island. Based on the dynamic changes of the urban heat island in the urban area of Zhengzhou City between 2006-2020, we conclude that urban forest construction strategies are beginning to bear fruit. Overall, the findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for future urban construction and urban forest construction plans; moreover, they can support landscape pattern optimization and urban heat island mitigation.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of gully erosion in anthropogenically modified forest and forest-steppe landscapes of the European part of Russia
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is a major soil degradation process on arable land. Therefore, it is important to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of this linear erosion process, considering the impacts of land use and climate change. The main objective of this study was to analyse the spatial and temporal patterns of permanent gully development in a study area of 123 300 km(2) located in the eastern periphery of the European boreal zone (southern taiga, mixed and deciduous forests and forest-steppe). In this study, visual interpretation of remote sensing data is used to detect changes in permanent gully channel length and density for each river basin between 1950/1970 and 2017/2021. Currently, 22 688 permanent gullies have been identified in the study area, their average length being 64 m, with the total gully network length reaching 1450.3 km. The average density of the gully network for 2017/2021 is 16 m km(-2); the maximum value reaching 471 m km(-2). During the period under study (c. 50 years), there was a widespread reduction in gully density by 184 m km(-2) on average (i.e. from 100-500 m km(-2) in 1950/1970 to <10 m km(-2) in 2017/2021). Linear and areal channel changes were determined for 304 active gullies over the 2009/2016 period. The average linear gully growth rate during this period is 0.6 m year(-1), whereas the areal growth rate is 28 m(2) year(-1). There is a clear reduction of gully erosion in the study area. Analysis of the gully network density in relation to land use changes (i.e. cultivated, forest and pasture area) did not reveal any significant relationship. It is concluded that the reduction of gully density in the study area is caused by the natural evolution of these linear erosion forms and their transformation into balkas (i.e. small, dry, flat-bottomed valleys).

T2  - JOURNAL OF REFRACTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictors related to the efficacy of epithelium-and Bowman membrane-penetrating femtosecond laser-assisted arcuate keratotomy (FSAK) in the treatment of preoperative astigmatism in patients with cataracts and to clari-fy the predictive role of the incision-to-limbus distance. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who un-derwent femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery com-bined with FSAK using the LenSX platform (Alcon Laborato-ries, Inc) at Beijing Aier-Intech Eye Hospital from March 2017 to December 2021. The Lenstar LS900 (Haag-Streit, Inc) was used to measure the horizontal corneal diameter, and ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to measure the vertical corneal diameter and incision-to-limbus distance. Finally, the measured values were converted. Changes in cor-neal astigmatism before and 3 months after surgery were an-alyzed using Alpins vector analysis. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were used to evaluate the factors associ-ated with surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) in preoperative ocular biometric parameters. RESULTS: The study included 94 eyes of 94 patients. The mean target induced astigmatism was 1.36 +/- 0.44 diopters (D), SIA was 0.82 +/- 0.43 D, and mean difference vector was 0.70 +/- 0.40 D. Pearson correlation analysis and univariate regres-sion analysis showed that preoperative corneal astigmatism, arcuate keratotomy arc length, incision-to-limbus distance, and astigmatism type were significant predictors of SIA. Mul-tiple variable regression analysis included parameters such as age, arcuate keratotomy arc length, and incision-to-limbus distance and established a multiple regression model of SIA (allP < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The incision-to-limbus distance was a signif-icant independent predictor of SIA, and inclusion of this pa-rameter may further improve the accuracy of the nomogram.

TI  - Temperature lapse rate estimation and snowmelt runoff simulation in a high-altitude basin
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key parameter of hydrological process modeling, the near-surface air temperature lapse rate reflects the vertical changes in air temperature characteristics in alpine basins but often lacks the support of sufficient ground observation data. This study estimated the lapse rate of the Lhasa River Basin (LRB) from the monthly air temperature dataset (2001-2015), which was derived based on good relationships between the observed air temperature at eight gauged stations and the corresponding gridded land surface temperature of MODIS. The estimated annual average air temperature lapse rate was approximately 0.62 degrees C/100 m. The monthly lapse rate in different years varied seasonally in the range of 0.45-0.8 degrees C/100 m; the maximum was in May, and the relatively low value occurred from September to January. The snow cover in the zones with relatively low altitudes showed seasonal variation, which was consistent with the air temperature variation. Permanent snow cover appeared in the area above 5000 m and expanded with increasing elevation.

TI  - A novel semianalytical remote sensing retrieval strategy and algorithm for particulate organic carbon in inland waters based on biogeochemical-optical mechanisms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations from satellite images can provide crucial spatiotemporal continuous observation data for the carbon cycle and ecological environmental governance. Here, we developed a novel inversion algorithm for deriving POC in inland water based on remote sensing and geochemical isotopes, which is summarized as follows. First, we developed empirical relationships between the phytoplankton absorption coefficient and endogenous POC concentration (CendPOC) and between the nonalgal particulate absorption coefficient and terrestrial POC concentration (CterPOC). Second, based on the valid re-lationships, semianalytical retrieval models were established to estimate CendPOC and CterPOC. Third, the pro-portions of endogenous POC (RendPOC) and terrestrial POC (RterPOC) to the total POC concentration (CPOC) were derived using a three-band empirical model. Finally, CPOC was obtained by dividing CendPOC by RendPOC (RendPOC & GE; 0.5) or dividing CterPOC by RterPOC (RendPOC < 0.5). Validation with field data shows that our proposed algo-rithm can accurately derive CPOC (0-20 mg/L), with a root mean square deviation (RMSD), median bias (MB), median absolute percent difference (MAPD), and median ratio (MR) of 1.15 mg/L,-0.05 mg/L, 24%, and 0.98, respectively. Synchronous validation based on Sentinel-3/OLCI images confirmed the accuracy, with RMSD, MB, MAPD, and MR values of 0.41 mg/L,-0.16 mg/L, 28%, and 0.91, respectively. The algorithm was applied to ocean and land color sensor (OLCI) images to reveal the temporal and spatial variations in POC in Lake Taihu.

TI  - A DNA Aptamer Targeting Cellular Fibronectin Rather Than Plasma Fibronectin for Bioimaging and Targeted Chemotherapy of Tumors
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fibronectin (FN) is a well-established hallmark of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and may serve as an omnipresent cancer biomarker regardless of the origins of tumor cells. An ssDNA aptamer (ZY-1) with highly selective binding affinity to mesenchymal stromal cells is previously developed, but the binding target of ZY-1 on the cells and the underlying mechanism is yet to be understood. Here, the identification of FN as the target protein of aptamer ZY-1 is reported for the first time and the mechanism of ZY-1 binding to cFN is explored. The data indicate that ZY-1 solely recognizes cellular fibronectin (cFN) rather than plasma fibronectin (pFN). The ZY-1 binding to cFN is explored through computational modeling and the competition of heparin in binding cFN owing to steric hindrance is confirmed. The in vitro assay and noninvasive in vivo fluorescence imaging results validate the specificity of ZY-1 in targeting cFN and sensitivity in detecting tumors. The ZY-1-mediated targeted cancer therapy using a proof-of-concept study with a ZY-1-based complex loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) is further proved. This study would facilitate more comprehensive studies of anti-FN aptamers in the imaging and treatment of tumors and other FN-associated diseases.

TI  - Perceived Parental Undifferentiated Rejection and Children's Personality Dispositions: A Meta-Analysis of Multicultural Studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENETIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior multicultural meta-analyses have shown that three of the four individual expressions of parental rejection (viz., coldness/lack of affection, hostility/aggression, and indifference/neglect) tend to be significantly associated with all seven of the personality dispositions most central to interpersonal acceptance-rejection theory (IPARTheory). These dispositions include hostility/aggression, dependence, negative self-esteem, negative self-adequacy, emotional instability, emotional unresponsiveness, and negative worldview. However, it was unknown whether the fourth expression of rejection (i.e. undifferentiated rejection) tends to be associated transculturally, as predicted by the theory, with this cluster of dispositions among children. Thus, this meta-analysis investigated 1) the extent to which children's perceptions of maternal and paternal undifferentiated rejection were related to these personality dispositions, and 2) the extent to which these relations varied by gender of parent. To address these questions, we performed a meta-analysis on 16 studies involving 12,538 children in 14 countries. Results showed significant associations between all seven personality dispositions and both maternal and paternal undifferentiated rejection. The results also showed significantly stronger relations between maternal than paternal undifferentiated rejection on five of the seven indices of children's personality.

TI  - Remote sensing based characterisation of community level phenological variations in a regional forest landscape of Western Ghats, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing for examining phenological variation in tropical forests is scarce. The major objectives of the study were to characterize the intra-annual variability of phenological cycle of the Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve (BRT) and the potentiality of these phenological metrices in defining species assemblages by classifying the forest. Sentinel-2 derived temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of 2019 was used to extract the vegetation trends and to derive phenological metrics using CropPhenology R package. Seasonal trends revealed that the highest greenness was associated with high NDVI values in September and October. We identified seven vegetation classes in the region and used Random Forest classifier to prepare a community level classification map with an overall classification accuracy of 68.9%. Our results revealed that incorporating the field sampling data and NDVI data can be effectively used for identifying, mapping and monitoring phenology of the BRT landscape..

TI  - Evaluation of Chlorophyll-a estimation using Sentinel 3 based on various algorithms in southern coastal Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to assess the potential of Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) over southern coastal waters of Vietnam. For that purpose, four chlorophyll-a ocean color (OC) algorithms (OC4ME and three new OC version 7 OC4, OC5, OC6) were applied based on water-leaving reflectance obtained from two atmospheric correction processors (C2RCC and DSF). To overcome high cloud coverage in the area of interest, full spatial data reconstruction was implemented using Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF). Numerical error metrics of in situ measurements (n = 49) collected in different ship-based campaigns has been assessed for Sentinel-3A (S-3A) and 3B (S-3B) as well as on the combined products built from these two later satellites. Results showed that products based on C2RRC significantly outperformed DSF. For chl-a algorithms, C2RCC-based OC5 gave the most accurate retrieval while applied to S-3A (R-2: 0.58, RMSE: 1.018 mg m(-3), MAPE: 49.4 %), S-3B (R-2: 0.75, RMSE: 0.776 mg m(-3), MAPE: 37.3 %), and synergy datasets (R-2: 0.70, RMSE: 0.844 mg m(-3), MAPE: 42.5 %). With > 50 % of observations missing due to cloud cover, DINEOF provides a promising solution to reconstruct the full spatial information. The successfully demonstrated retrieval of chl-a in our study presents potential for daily monitoring when combining observations from S-3A/B to further improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Multitemporal lidar captures heterogeneity in fuel loads and consumption on the Kaibab Plateau
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Characterization of physical fuel distributions across heterogeneous landscapes is needed to understand fire behavior, account for smoke emissions, and manage for ecosystem resilience. Remote sensing measurements at various scales inform fuel maps for improved fire and smoke models. Airborne lidar that directly senses variation in vegetation height and density has proven to be especially useful for landscape-scale fuel load and consumption mapping. Here we predicted field-observed fuel loads from airborne lidar and Landsat-derived fire history metrics with random forest (RF) modeling. RF models were then applied across multiple lidar acquisitions (years 2012, 2019, 2020) to create fuel maps across our study area on the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona, USA. We estimated consumption across the 2019 Castle and Ikes Fires by subtracting 2020 fuel load maps from 2019 fuel load maps and examined the relationship between mapped surface fuels and years since fire, as recorded in the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database. Results R-squared correlations between predicted and ground-observed fuels were 50, 39, 59, and 48% for available canopy fuel, 1- to 1000-h fuels, litter and duff, and total surface fuel (sum of 1- to 1000-h, litter and duff fuels), respectively. Lidar metrics describing overstory distribution and density, understory density, Landsat fire history metrics, and elevation were important predictors. Mapped surface fuel loads were positively and nonlinearly related to time since fire, with asymptotes to stable fuel loads at 10-15 years post fire. Surface fuel consumption averaged 16.1 and 14.0 Mg ha(- 1) for the Castle and Ikes Fires, respectively, and was positively correlated with the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). We estimated surface fuel consumption to be 125.3 +/- 54.6 Gg for the Castle Fire and 27.6 +/- 12.0 Gg for the portion of the Ikes Fire (42%) where pre- and post-fire airborne lidar were available. Conclusions We demonstrated and reinforced that canopy and surface fuels can be predicted and mapped with moderate accuracy using airborne lidar data. Landsat-derived fire history helped account for spatial and temporal variation in surface fuel loads and allowed us to describe temporal trends in surface fuel loads. Our fuel load and consumption maps and methods have utility for land managers and researchers who need landscape-wide estimates of fuel loads and emissions. Fuel load maps based on active remote sensing can be used to inform fuel management decisions and assess fuel structure goals, thereby promoting ecosystem resilience. Multitemporal lidar-based consumption estimates can inform emissions estimates and provide independent validation of conventional fire emission inventories. Our methods also provide a remote sensing framework that could be applied in other areas where airborne lidar is available for quantifying relationships between fuels and time since fire across landscapes.

TI  - An artificial intelligence approach to remotely assess pale lichen biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although generally given little attention in vegetation studies, ground-dwelling (terricolous) lichens are major contributors to overall carbon and nitrogen cycling, albedo, biodiversity and biomass in many high-latitude ecosystems. Changes in biomass of mat-forming pale lichens have the potential to affect vegetation, fauna, climate and human activities including reindeer husbandry. Lichens have a complex spectral signature and terricolous lichens have limited growth height, often growing in mixtures with taller vegetation. This has, so far, prevented the development of remote sensing techniques to accurately assess lichen biomass, which would be a powerful tool in ecosystem and ecological research and rangeland management. We present a Landsat based remote sensing model developed using deep neural networks, trained with 8914 field records of lichen volume collected for > 20 years. In contrast to earlier proposed machine learning and regression methods for lichens, our model exploited the ability of neural networks to handle mixed spatial resolution input. We trained candidate models using input of 1 x 1 (30 x 30 m) and 3 x 3 Landsat pixels based on 7 reflective bands and 3 indices, combined with a 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. We normalised elevation data locally for each plot to remove the region-specific variation, while maintaining informative local variation in topography. The final model predicted lichen volume in an evaluation set (n = 159) reaching an R2 of 0.57. NDVI and elevation were the most important predictors, followed by the green band. Even with moderate tree cover density, the model was efficient, offering a considerable improvement compared to earlier methods based on specific reflectance. The model was in principle trained on data from Scandinavia, but when applied to sites in North America and Russia, the predictions of the model corresponded well with our visual interpretations of lichen abundance. We also accurately quantified a recent historic (35 years) change in lichen abundance in northern Norway. This new method enables further spatial and temporal studies of variation and changes in lichen biomass related to multiple research questions as well as rangeland management and economic and cultural ecosystem services. Combined with information on changes in drivers such as climate, land use and management, and air pollution, our model can be used to provide accurate estimates of ecosystem changes and to improve vegetation-climate models by including pale lichens.

TI  - Do polycentric structures reduce surface urban heat island intensity?
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - City planners are increasingly captivated by the possibilities of transforming urban spatial structures as an important strategy for reducing heat island intensity. This study addresses the mixed findings of polycentric urban spatial structures on surface urban heat island intensity, using a multiple regression method and pathway analysis for the city region and city proper in China. We found that the polycentric spatial structure can reduce the surface urban heat island intensity at the scale of both the city region and city proper, although the reduction was economically insignificant at the city region scale. Path analysis explained the reduction in surface urban heat island intensity in the city proper: polycentric structures disperse industrial firms to the "rural " areas and centralizes green spaces in the "urban " areas. Our findings may serve as references for policymakers when optimizing urban spatial structures to improve the thermal environment.

TI  - Effects of Plasma Modification and Atmosphere on the Catalytic Hydrothermal Liquefaction of Chlorella
T2  - INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of third-generation biofuels from microalgae has been extensively researched over the last few years. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising route for producing bio-oils from wet algae. The major drawback in HTL is the high temperature and high pressure that result in the high capital cost of the process. To make HTL an economical process for bio-oil production, the temperature and pressure should be reduced, which can be achieved by adding alcohol to water for HTL. The efficiency of the HTL process can also be improved by using a suitable heterogeneous catalyst with additional modifications. In this work, we investigated the effect of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma (argon and hydrogen plasma) modified zeolite Y as catalysts on the yield and quality of bio-oils produced in a hydrogen atmosphere versus air at different reaction times (0 and 15 min) and temperatures (240 and 250 degrees C). The mixture of solvents (50 vol % water and 50 vol % ethanol) was used in HTL to increase the yield and quality of bio-oils. Two sequential extractions were used to extract bio-oils from HTL products using dichloromethane. Different analytical techniques, such as thermal gravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were used to understand the physicochemical properties of the bio-oils and for the determination of the higher heating value (HHV). The introduction of DBD plasma to modify zeolite Y improved the bio-oil quality and yield from HTL processes. The H2 plasma modified catalyst enhanced the bio-oil yield at 240 degrees C from 46.83 +/- 1.48% (240-0H2-ZY) to 50.04 +/- 0.88% (240-0-H2-ZY-HP) and from 50.24 +/- 1.96% (250-0-H2-ZY) to 53.01 +/- 0.73% (250-0-H2-ZY-HP) at 250 degrees C. The argon plasma modified catalyst reduced N-containing compounds from 29.42% (240-0-H2-ZY) to 2.94% (240-0-H2-ZYAP) and decreased O-containing compounds from 4.02% (240-0-H2-ZY) to 1.38% (240-0-H2-ZY-AP) at 240 degrees C.

TI  - FABIAN: A daily product of Fractional Austral-summer Blue Ice over ANtarctica during 2000-2021 based on MODIS imagery using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic blue ice areas are exposed due to erosion and sublimation of snow. At the same time, surface melt can form surface types that are spectrally similar to blue ice, especially at low elevations. These are termed melt -induced blue ice areas. Both types of blue ice are sensitive indicators of climate change. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful technique to retrieve the spatial extent of blue ice areas and their variation in time. Yet, existing satellite-derived blue ice area products are either mono-temporal for the entire Antarctic ice sheet, or multi-temporal for a limited area. Here, we present FABIAN, a product of blue ice fraction over Antarctica, derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) archive covering the period 2000-2021. A spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in Google Earth Engine, based on a careful selection of end -member spectra, accurately reconstructs the reflectance observed by MODIS in blue ice areas. Based on a vali-dation with contemporaneous Sentinel-2 images, FABIAN has a root mean square error in blue ice fraction of approximately 10% -20% in wind-induced blue ice areas, and 20% -30% in melt-induced blue ice areas across six selected test sites in the coastal East Antarctic ice sheet. FABIAN is challenged in regions with shallow melt streams and lakes, since their spectral profiles are similar to those from blue ice areas in MODIS bands. For further analyses and applications, FABIAN holds the potential for (1) deriving annual blue ice area maps, (2) distinguishing between wind-and melt-induced blue ice types, (3) evaluating and correcting (regional) climate models, and (4) analyzing temporal variations in blue ice abundance and exposure.

TI  - Short-term and long-term outcomes of indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Indocyanine green (ICG) is becoming a frequently used sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracer of breast cancer in China. However, there is still a lack of data on its safety. We reported the clinical outcome of ICG as a tracer of SLN over a median 67-month follow-up period to evaluate its feasibility in clinically node-negative patients with breast cancer. Methods A total of 194 consecutive patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with ICG, radioisotopes (RI) and methylene blue (MB), or with ICG and MB. The SLN mapping data by each tracer was recorded, and safety outcomes were analyzed through follow-up. Results With the triad mapping (N = 44), the identification rate of SLN by ICG was 95.5%, slightly higher than that of MB (86.4%) and comparable with RI (95.5%) and combined methods (95.5%, 100%) (p = 0.068). Analysis of all candidates (N = 194) demonstrated that the identification rate of SLN by ICG or by ICG and MB was 99%, significantly higher than that by MB (92.8%) (p < 0.0001). No tracer-related allergic reaction and permanent skin staining of ICG were observed. Local disease progression was reported in 2 of the 194 patients at the ipsilateral axilla. After remedial axillary lymph node dissection, no disease progression was detected at follow-up. Conclusions ICG as an SLN tracer is more accurate than MB and comparable to the combined methods and has good clinical safety. ICG can be considered a useful supplement or suitable alternative to traditional tracers.

TI  - An integrated remote sensing and biomarker maturity parameter-based approach to trace petroleum migration in a complex fault zone lineament of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin
T2  - MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper investigates the oil migration and lineament distribution in fault zones within a sedimentary basin, showcasing the results from an integrated use of geochemical, and remote sensing data along the Fazenda Belem Fault Zone (FBFZ) in the Potiguar Basin, Brazilian Equatorial Margin. Lineaments were detected from a LiDAR digital elevation model data set using the quantitative method of morphology recognition based on horizontal and vertical curvature calculation and mapping. The polynomial regression-based spatial distribution of 20S/(20S + 20R) C-29 steranes is successfully used in oils from offshore and onshore reservoirs of the Potiguar Basin, tracing field-scale oil migration direction. These multidisciplinary analyses revealed that the oil initially migrated from an offshore area along the NE-oriented fault zone, and then parts moved along the branches of this zone to finally reach the areas of the onshore reservoirs. In addition, NE-oriented lineaments enhanced the near -surface fluid circulation, while they commonly correspond to the topographic features and fault zones. Anisotropy tensors and slip-and dilation tendency calculated from the lineament map also indicate that the geometric complexity of the lineament pattern is influenced by present-day and partitioned stress fields in the Potiguar Basin. The integration of remote-sensing and geochemistry analyses at the FBFZ area proved to be effective in approaching the tectonic aspects of a fault zone in a petroleum basin, as well as in investigating the field-scale migration of oil along the fracture corridor in a fault zone.

TI  - The pattern of lymph node metastasis in peripheral pulmonary nodules patients and risk prediction models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: For peripheral pulmonary nodules, the regularity of lymph node (LN) metastasis has not been studied. This study aimed to evaluate the metastasis pattern of intrapulmonary and relevant mediastinal lymph nodes in early-stage lung cancer, and further selected patients who were of low risk of LN metastasis as potential population to receive sub-lobectomy. Methods: This study prospectively included consecutive patients with peripheral clinical T1N0M0 disease who underwent complete resection with LN dissection or sampling from August 2014 to July 2015. The patients were followed up to 15, May 2021. Univariable or multivariable Logistic analysis was used to identify the risk factors. Models predicting LN metastasis risk were conducted. The area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic curves was used to evaluate the diagnostic value. Disease-free survival and overall survival were compared between groups. Results: Finally, 201 patients were included in this study. For patients with negative tumor-bearing (TB) 13 and 14 station LNs, the positive rate of other lymph node stations was extremely low. Maximum CT value, pleural indentation and CEA level were risk factors for N1 station LNs metastasis. Besides, the factors above and lobulation sign were risk factors for skip metastasis beyond TB 13 and 14 station LNs. We constructed two scoring tables to predict N1 station metastasis and skip metastasis beyond TB 13 and 14 station. The AUC were 0.837 and 0.823, respectively. Based on the first table, 40.9% of patients suffered N1 station LNs metastasis and 27.3% had N2 disease in "high risk group " while the proportion was only 5.7% and 4.5% in "low risk group ". For patients with negative TB13 and TB14 station LNs, based on the latter table, 11.1% of patients had N1 stations LNs metastasis and 16.7% had pN2 disease in "high risk group " while only 2.3% patients in "low risk group " suffered this kind of metastasis. Conclusion: For peripheral pulmonary nodules patients, stations 13 and 14 LNs may be the sentinel nodes. For patients with low risk of N1 metastasis and skip metastasis, sub-lobar resection might be sufficient for those who were of negative TB 13 and 14 station LNs.

TI  - Errors in global cloud climatology due to transect sampling with the CALIPSO satellite lidar mission
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although cloud profiling lidars provide the most accurate data on cloud amount (CA), cloud top height (CTH) and cloud optical thickness (COT), they only sample cloud fields along a one-dimensional transect. This approach introduces uncertainty into studies that interpret cloud layers as two-or three-dimensional. The present study verified the accuracy of mean annual CA, COT, and CTH when calculated based on transect sampling, and when spatiotemporally averaged over grid cells measuring 1?, 2.5?, and 5? in latitude and longitude. The study evaluates the sampling scheme used by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) lidar mission. In this study for the very first time, transect observations are investigated globally, at the level of climatological means, and for actual cloud regimes. Lidar data were simulated based on MODIS observations for 2005, resulting in 3,762,678 individual laser transects, and 58,647 annual means for each parameter under study. The results of this study demonstrate that, for most locations on Earth, CALIPSO sam-pling does report "true' mean annual CA, COT, and CTH. At 1? resolution, statistically significant (alpha <= 0.05) differences in CA were only noted for 11% of cells, and for 2-3% of cells in the case of COT and CTH. Polar regions were identified as the most affected by transect sampling. Mean global errors (RMSE) observed at the annual timescale were within or close to the accuracy expected for satellite data used in climate change studies: 1.9% (CA), 2.4% (COT), and 187 m (CTH). This study also found that the spatial resolution of the grid impacts the magnitude of errors: an increase in cell size increased the underestimation of cloud parameters, increased the extent of areas where statistically significant errors/ differences occurred, and increased uncertainty in the climatological mean estimation (wider confidence intervals). However, at the cell level, errors were up to +/- 5% (CA), +/- 25% (COT) and +/- 400 m (CTH); moreover, the magnitude of error was difficult to estimate a priori due to the noisy spatial distribution. These findings suggest that a dedicated uncertainty analysis should be made a requirement in CALIPSO lidar-based studies at fine spatial resolution.

TI  - Using time series vector features for annual cultivated land mapping: A trial in northern Henan, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual monitoring of the spatial distribution of cultivated land is important for maintaining the ecological environment, achieving a status quo of land resource management, and guaranteeing agricultural production. With the gradual development of remote sensing technology, it has become a common practice to obtain cultivated land boundary information on a large scale with the help of satellite Earth observation images. Traditional land use classification methods are affected by multiple types of land cover, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of cultivated land mapping. In contrast, although the current advanced methods (such as deep learning) can obtain more accurate cultivated land mapping results than traditional methods, such methods often require the use of a massive amount of training samples, large computing power, and highly complex model tuning processes, increasing the cost of mapping and requiring the involvement of more professionals. This has hindered the promotion of related methods in mapping institutions. This paper proposes a method based on time series vector features (MTVF), which uses vector thinking to establish the features. The advantage of this method is that the introduction of vector features enlarges the differences between the different land cover types, which overcomes the loss of mapping accuracy caused by the influences of the spectra of different ground objects and ensures the calculation efficiency. Moreover, the MTVF uses a traditional method (random forest) as the classification core, which makes the MTVF less demanding than advanced methods in terms of the number of training samples. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to carry out cultivated land mapping for 2020 in northern Henan Province, China. The results show that the MTVF has the potential to accurately identify cultivated land. Furthermore, the overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy of the overall study area and four sub-study areas were all greater than 90%. In addition, the cultivated land mapping accuracy of the MTVF is significantly better than that of the maximum likelihood, support vector machine, and artificial neural network methods.

TI  - Analysis of the Influencing Factors of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To analyze and discuss the influencing factors of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. Methods. A total of 469 breast cancer patients admitted in the Department of Pathology of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital from October 2016 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The general information, immunohistochemical expression, tumor molecular subtype, tumor size, histological grade, pathological type, and tumor location were collected and the relationship with sentinel lymph node metastasis was analyzed. Results. For patients with different age, Ki-67 and Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) immunohistochemical expression level (invasive cancer), molecular subtype (invasive cancer), tumor size, histological grade (invasive cancer) and pathological type. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the age was less than or equal to 40 years; the molecular subtype was Luminal B and HER-2 overexpression (invasive cancer); tumor was larger; the histological grade (invasive cancer) was higher; the pathological type was invasive carcinoma, there were independent risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. The sentinel lymph node metastasis rates of invasive lobular carcinoma, invasive micropapillary carcinoma, and metaplastic carcinoma (all met the criteria for squamous cell carcinoma and histological grade III) were higher than 50% in special invasive carcinomas. Conclusion. Age, expression level of Ki 67 and HER-2, molecular typing, tumor volume and histological grade are all high-risk factors related to sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. When one or more of the above factors are involved in an examination, pathologists should be more cautious in making a sentinel lymph node frozen diagnosis. By standardizing the sampling and increasing the number of frozen sections (slicing more frozen tissue layers), the section quality can be improved. This may be conducive to reducing the false negative rate and reducing the pain and risk of secondary surgery.

TI  - Quantifying uncertainty in high resolution biophysical variable retrieval with machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of biophysical variables is at the core of remote sensing science, allowing a close monitoring of crops and forests. Deriving temporally resolved and spatially explicit maps of parameters of interest has been the subject of intense research. However, deriving products from optical sensors is typically hampered by cloud contamination and the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work we rely on the HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM) algorithm to generate long gap-free time series of Landsat surface reflectance data by fusing MODIS and Landsat reflectances. An artificial neural network is trained on PROSAIL inversion to predict monthly biophysical variables at 30 m spatial resolution with asso-ciated, realistic uncertainty bars. We emphasize the need for a more thorough analysis of uncertainty, and propose a general and scalable approach to combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by exploiting Monte Carlo (MC) dropout techniques from the trained artificial network and the propagation of HISTARFM uncertainties through the model, respectively. A model recalibration was performed in order to provide reliable uncertainties. We provide new high resolution products of several key variables to quantify the terrestrial biosphere: Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Canopy Water Content (CWC) and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) are at 30 m Landsat spatial resolution and over large continental areas. Two study areas are considered: the large heterogeneous but moderately cloud covered contiguous United States, and the homogeneous but largely cloud covered Amazonia. The produced vegetation products largely agree with the test dataset (R = 0.90, RMSE = 0.80 m2/m2 and ME = 0.12 m2/m2 for LAI, and R = 0.98, RMSE = 0.07 and ME = 0.01 for FAPAR) providing low error and high accuracy. Additionally, the validation considers a thorough comparison with operational and largely validated medium resolution products, such as the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Copernicus Global Land Service. Our products presented a good agreement and consistency with both MODIS (R = 0.84 and R = 0.85 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) and Copernicus (R = 0.92 and R = 0.91 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively). To foster a wider adoption and reproducibility of the methodology we provide an application in GEE and source code at:https:// github.com/IPL-UV/ee_BioNet/

TI  - A pilot study on the lung morphology of shelter dogs in relation to air pollution in Trinidad.
T2  - American journal of veterinary research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the gross and histological lesions associated with air pollution in the lungs of dogs from various locations in Trinidad.ANIMALS: 56 fresh lungs were obtained from already euthanized adult dogs collected from different locations in Trinidad at the Trinidad and Tobago Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.PROCEDURES: Lung specimens were examined grossly and tissue samples were taken for routine histologic examination.RESULTS: Histological examination showed that 51.8% of the dogs had evidence of anthracosis. Dogs with anthracosis had greater median lesion scores compared to dogs without anthracosis (P = .022). There was no association between the presence of anthracosis and any other lesion in this study (P > .05).CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There was evidence that dogs with anthracosis had a greater degree of nonspecific lung histologic lesions. Using the dog as a sentinel model for human exposure in Trinidad, our findings indicate that environmental air pollution may also have an effect on the respiratory health of the human population. It is important for the public to be aware of air pollution, and the government of Trinidad and Tobago should develop an intervention protocol along with veterinary and human medical epidemiologists to reduce air pollution in the country.

TI  - Sentinel-3B OLCI satellite imagery and advanced electron microscopy of nanoparticle analysis in a marine estuary and watershed: Robust multi-analytics and geospatial assessment of key contaminants
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, hydrographic basins are routinely contaminated by anthropogenic contaminants originating from coal mining, swine farming, urban sewage, pesticide use, and other various sources. These contaminants not only spread pollution but also nanoparticles (NPs) capable of contaminating the fauna and flora of estuaries in addition to being harmful to human health. The use of images from the Sentinel-3B OLCI (Ocean Land Color Instrument) satellite makes it possible to obtain spectral data aimed at identifying the presence of possible contamination in large regions, which can be complemented by advanced electron microscopies. The general objective of this study is to analyze the dispersion of NPs and ultrafine particles (UFPs) in a region that contains multiple contaminants through the use of images from the Sentinel-3B OLCI satellite. The authors examined images taken after two particularly intense tropical rain events in December 2018 and 2021, in the region of the Laguna estuary located in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. Suspended sediments (SSs) were collected from seventeen points on the Tubara similar to o River in 2018. These samples were then submitted to an analytical laboratory for various analyses such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and transmission and scanning electron microscopes. Additionally, images from the Sentinel-3B satellite OLCI in the Laguna estuary region from 2018 and 2021 were analyzed based on the following variables: water turbidity (TSM_NN), chlorophyll-a (CHL_NN) and suspended pollution potential (ADG_443_NN). The SSs demonstrated the presence of massive crystals of ultrafine pyrite in a pseudomorph crystal of jarosite containing nanospheres with hazardous elements (e.g. As, Hg, Cd and Pb), which represent important pollutants. The Sentinel-3B OLCI images in relation to the variables TSM_NN, CHL_NN and ADG_443_NN (2018 and 2021), identified high turbidity in the waters of the Tubara similar to o River. Analysis of SSs and satellite images are suitable for identifying contaminants toxic to the marine ecosystem and human health on a

TI  - Long-term relationships of MODIS NDVI with rainfall, land surface temperature, surface soil moisture and groundwater storage over monsoon core region of India
T2  - ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - India's climate is semi-arid, and most of the people in this country depend on agriculture. In this article, we present the long-term relationships of the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with the rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), surface soil moisture (SSM), and the groundwater storage (GWS) during the Kharif (June-October) season of the monsoon core region (MCR) of India from the year 2000 to 2018. Results show that the NDVI could capture the stages of crop phenology and that it undergoes interannual variability characterized by the El Nino Southern Oscillation. A strong dependence of NDVI on SSM and GWS is evidenced by the statistically significant correlation coefficients of +0.89 and +0.88, respectively. A substantial negative correlation coefficient of -0.91 is observed between NDVI and LST. Wavelet coherence spectrum suggests the in-phase relation of NDVI with rainfall, SSM, GWS, and anti-phase connection with LST, with weaker correlations from 2004 to 2008. The results of this study attain significance since the studies on NDVI and hydrologic variables are much less than those on NDVI and climate variables over the MCR of India.

AB  - For the Mexican Otomi of the Sierra Norte de Puebla, Santa Rosa is a sacred plant used by the shaman to heal people and sing in rituals called costumbres. It is also an Antigua, a sacred deity who maintains a constant dialogue with ritual specialists. In the Otomi discourse and its worldview of Santa Rosa, as well as in its ritual process, it is eaten, not smoked. Although it is cannabis, they mention that: "the Santa Rosa is eaten, it is sacred; marijuana, the one they smoke in Mexico, is another one that looks like it."

TI  - Amazon fires in the 21st century: The year of 2020 in evidence
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The aim was to evaluate fire activity for the entire Amazon and Amazon regions within each country/department from 2003 to 2020, assessing the potential contributions of drought and deforestation and contrasting 2020 with the previous years. Location Amazonia sensu lato. Time period Annually from 2003 to 2020. Major taxa studied Terrestrial plants. Methods We collected time series of MODIS active fire detections and burned area and assessed the yearly burned area of several land-use/land-cover types. We also divided the Amazon territory into 10 km x 10 km grid cells to identify annual anomalies in active fire occurrence, rainfall, maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD) and deforestation. Rainfall and MCWD anomalies for a given cell each year consisted of annual values at least one standard deviation below average for that cell from 2003 to 2020, whereas fire and deforestation anomalies had annual values at least one standard deviation above the average for that cell. Results Brazil and Bolivia have contributed, on average, >70% and about 15%, respectively, of annual active fire detections in the Amazon, in addition to more than half and about one-third of annual burned areas in the region. On average, 32% of annual burned areas in the Amazon have consisted of agricultural lands, 29% of natural grasslands and 16% of old-growth forests. The annual extent of areas with fire anomalies was significantly associated with the annual extent of areas with deforestation anomalies, but not significantly associated with the annual extent of areas experiencing water deficit anomalies. In 2020, the total burned area in the Amazon was the greatest since 2010, and the ratio of burned area per active fire was the second greatest of the time series, despite a much lower extent of areas with anomalously high water deficit in comparison to the 2015-2016 megadrought. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the majority of anomalously high fire occurrences in the Amazon since 2003 did not occur in anomalous drought conditions. The intensification of agricultural fires and deforestation aggravated the burning of Amazonian ecosystems in 2020.

TI  - A cloud-based mapping approach for assessing spatiotemporal changes in erosion dynamics due to biotic and abiotic disturbances in a Mediterranean Peri-Urban forest
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, the demographic trajectory and the associated urban development have increased the demand for urban and peri-urban green space. Peri-urban forests provide a wide range of goods and services to city dwellers critical to human well-being. However, these ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. This study aimed to assess the effects of forest disturbances on soil erosion dynamics in a periurban forest of Northern Greece, between 1995 and 2020. Monitoring of soil erosion dynamic was performed by coupling the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform and the RUSLE erosion prediction model. The results highlighted the potential of Landsat imagery to efficiently delineate through time forest cover changes due to the influence of biotic and abiotic factors. After a major fire event, average soil erosion showed an increase of 7.7 t/ha/year whilst the emergency hillslope rehabilitation treatments led to a decrease equal to 8.9 t/ha/year. On the contrary, post-fire watershed stabilization measures and selective logging for the removal of the infested individual trees had a negligible effect on soil loss. The temporal changes in soil loss rate are not only justified by forest cover changes but also by the variability in rainfall, which is also considered a dynamic factor of RUSLE model. Monitoring of soil loss and erosion regulation services over peri-urban forests provide essential information for policy-making and management of these valuable natural resources.

TI  - A moisture-based triangle approach for estimating surface evaporative fraction with time-series of remotely sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a primary process for water and heat transfer between the land and atmosphere. The spatial contextual information-based surface temperature versus vegetation index triangle (temperature-based triangle) is one of the most famous and widely applied methods for regional ET estimation from remotely sensed data. However, the determination of temporally variable satellite scene-specific dry and wet edges in this traditional triangle is often largely biased due to the limited range of variability of surface soil moisture avail-ability and fractional vegetation cover (or the nonexistence of end-member pixels), or must rely on the auxiliary ground-based measurements, leading to a large uncertainty or difficulty in regional evaporative fraction esti-mation. This short communication presents a practically operational moisture-based triangle to address the deficiency of the temperature-based triangle, where temporally universal dry and wet edges in this new triangle are determined by making use of the time-series slope of remotely sensed surface temperature versus vegetation index negative relationship over a small window centering the target pixel. Our validation results show that this new triangle outperformed the temperature-based triangle, reducing the root mean square error from 0.19 to 0.16 and increasing the coefficient of determination from 0.44 to 0.53, when the model-estimated evaporative fractions were validated against ground-based eddy covariance measurements at 34 sites across the globe.

TI  - Correlation between national surveillance and search engine query data on respiratory syncytial virus infections in Japan
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease burden is significant, especially in infants and children with an underlying disease. Prophylaxis with palivizumab is recommended for these high-risk groups. Early recognition of a RSV epidemic is important for timely administration of palivizumab. We herein aimed to assess the correlation between national surveillance and Google Trends data pertaining to RSV infections in Japan. Methods The present, retrospective survey was performed between January 1, 2018 and November 14, 2021 and evaluated the correlation between national surveillance data and Google Trends data. Joinpoint regression was used to identify the points at which changes in trends occurred. Results A strong correlation was observed every study year (2018 [r = 0.87, p < 0.01], 2019 [r = 0.83, p < 0.01], 2020 [r = 0.83, p < 0.01], and 2021 [r = 0.96, p < 0.01]). The change-points in the Google Trends data indicating the start of the RSV epidemic were observed earlier than by sentinel surveillance in 2018 and 2021 and simultaneously with sentinel surveillance in 2019. No epidemic surge was observed in either the Google Trends or the surveillance data from 2020. Conclusions Our data suggested that Google Trends has the potential to enable the early identification of RSV epidemics. In countries without a national surveillance system, Google Trends may serve as an alternative early warning system.

TI  - Blind identification of active landslides in urban areas: a new set of comprehensive criteria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 70% of catastrophic landslides were previously unknown and brought tremendous losses to human life and property in urban regions; therefore, there is an urgent need for early identification of active landslides to eliminate landslide risk at the early stage. However, early identification of landslides has always been a worldwide challenge due to high concealment, steep topography, inaccessible location, and sudden onset. This work suggests a new set of comprehensive criteria for the early identification of landslides by integrating surface deformation, geological, topographic, geomorphological, and disaster-failure features. This set of criteria is universally applicable with no use of the prior knowledge of landslide locations (blind identification) and is successfully validated by a field survey. This work selects the Xuecheng region, a hard-hit area of landslides, as the study area and employs multisource data (seismic, geological, topographic, meteorological, SAR, and optical remote sensing data) and time-series InSAR technology to identify active landslides and reveal their deformation rules. Some new viewpoints are suggested. (1) The new comprehensive criteria synthesize the surface deformation, disaster-controlling, and disaster-inducing characteristics and achieve relatively high accuracy by field validation. (2) Forty-seven active landslides are identified in Xuecheng with no use of the prior knowledge of landslides. The soft rocks or soft-hard interbeddings, tectonic movement, fluvial undercutting and eroding, precipitation, earthquakes, and human engineering activity control or induce the development of these active landslides. (3) Two giant landslides that significantly threaten human lives and properties and exhibit different movement modes are selected to highlight the deformation rules of active landslides under the coupled action of poor lithologic condition, tectonic movement, river erosion, precipitation, and human engineering activity. The suggested new criteria can be applied to other landslide hard-hit urban regions and contribute to the timely and effective prevention and control of catastrophic landslides, reduction of enormous disaster losses, and rational management of the environment.

TI  - Improving the<i> prediction</i> of heavy rainfall with rapid-update dual-resolution hybrid En3DVar assimilation of all-sky AHI infrared water vapor radiances
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board Himawari-8 provides continuous high-resolution observations of severe weather phenomena in space and time, providing a good data source for the rapidly updated cycling data assimilation in numerical weather prediction (NWP). In this study, the all-sky AHI water vapor infrared radiances were rapidly assimilated using a dual-resolution hybrid EnVar method to introduce the flow-dependent ensemble information with a reduced ensemble cost in a case study. Considering the greatly increased compu-tational costs for all-sky radiance data assimilation, the sensitivity of the all-sky radiance data assimilation to the resolution of ensemble error covariance as well as the cycling frequency using dual-resolution EnVar was investigated. The impact of all-sky radiance data assimilation using the dual-resolution hybrid EnVar was then compared to the clear-sky radiance data assimilation. From the case study, it was found that the dual-resolution hybrid EnVar and the full-resolution hybrid EnVar generally performed comparable for the all-sky assimilation of the AHI water vapor radiances in this study. Both show great advantages over 3DVar in analyses and forecasts with different leading time for model state variables. However, the former cost much fewer computational resources with only a tiny loss of the accuracy. For the assimilation frequency of all-sky radiances using the dual-resolution hybrid EnVar, it was found that the half-hourly and hourly test both obtain the better results than the other two (namely the 10-minutely test and 3 -hour-ly test). The former two have the comparable performances in rainfall forecast although the half-hourly test is better. Finally, in the dual-resolution hybrid EnVar framework, the all-sky AHI radiance assimilation impact was studied versus the clear-sky radiances as well as the conventional observations in a case study. The results present a generally positive improvement of the rainfall forecast with the larger rainfall thresholds, caused by the assimilation of the cloud-influenced AHI water vapor radiances.

TI  - Evaluation of MERRA-2 land surface temperature dataset and its application in permafrost mapping over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The second-generation Modern-ERA Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) land surface temperature (LST) dataset has been widely used for permafrost mapping in specific areas; however, its accuracy and application need to be evaluated over China. In this study, the MERRA-2 LST was evaluated against meteorological observations and three other reanalysis datasets including the first-generation MERRA, Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), using multiple statistical methods over the period from 1980 to 2018. The results revealed that the MERRA-2 LST generally exhibited cold bias compared to meteorological observations while performing better than the JRA55, ERA-Interim, and MERRA datasets in China, particularly in high-altitude permafrost regions. The comparison indicated that the time series trends for the MERRA-2 LST was consistent with that observed until 2000, and noticeably amplified cold bias, particularly for the period after 2005, was observed. Moreover, two correction methods were proposed and compared to reduce the error range for the MERRA-2 dataset, which was caused by the difference in elevation and land cover types. Calibrated results demonstrated that the linear regression method (Method1) between the elevation difference and mean bias error (MBE) for the LST performed well with root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 2.15 to 5.97 ?C to 1.09-2.53 ?C. Moreover, in comparison with the MODIS LST dataset, the results showed that the adjusted MERRA-2 LST was in good agreement with smaller RMSEs against the observations. The surface frost number model was used for mapping the permafrost distribution over China based on the daily adjusted MERRA-2 LST dataset. According to the simulation results, the permafrost extent had a slightly continued degradation trend with a rate of 3-5% per decade over the past 39 years. The simulated permafrost area over China for the years 2010-2018 was approximately 1.63 x 106 km2, which accounts for 16.9% of mainland China. Thus, the adjusted MERRA-2 LST with high spatial-temporal consistency is the optimal choice to investigate permafrost distribution on a large scale.

TI  - TROPOMI SIF reveals large uncertainty in estimating the end of plant growing season from vegetation indices data in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale land surface phenology (LSP) information has been developed from remote sensing-based vegetation indices (VIs) data. However, there are considerable discrepancies and uncertainties in the LSP data products for the start and end of growing seasons (SOS; EOS) as different vegetation indices and algorithms are used. Here, we used the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data to estimate SOS and EOS in the Tibetan Plateau, a global hotspot of vegetation response to climate change. We compared SIF-based phenological metrics to those derived from VIs (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)), and gross primary production (GPP) simulated by the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). We found relatively small dis-crepancies in SOS between SIF and VIs, but large differences in EOS. Thus, the length of the growing season derived from VIs was as much as two months longer than that estimated by SIF. These results were consistent across three products, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adjusted (MCD43), standard MODIS (MOD09), and TROPOMI products. The EOS discrepancy remained after excluding two mismatches (solar illu-mination and viewing angle) between satellite sensors. We also found that VIs-based EOS occurred below the freezing point, while SIF-based EOS occurred above the freezing point, suggesting that SIF-based EOS is more physiologically meaningful. Our study proposed that the late VIs-based EOS was caused in part by the effect of changes in soil background on VIs and VIs-based EOS. Our results highlight the need to re-evaluate current LSP data products derived from reflectance-based VIs and to develop new vegetation phenology data products using emitted energy such as SIF.

TI  - Identification of high-temperature targets in remote sensing based on correspondence analysis
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High temperature targets (temperature above 500 K), are the special on the surface of the earth such as forest fire, prairie fire, oil well torches, heap coking, volcanic eruptions, significantly different from those of normal surfaces at lower temperatures. Identification of high-temperature targets plays an important role in environmental monitoring, disaster warning, and resource investigation. In remote sensing data, high-temperature target pixels and bands are studied. And they are deemed samples and variables, respectively, in multivariate analysis. And classification of samples for identification of high-temperature targets is necessary. To classify samples, feature analysis of spectrum needs to be done first. In feature analysis of spectrum, feature bands that can be used to distinguish samples need to be selected. Correspondence analysis is the method that can project samples and variables into the same factor space in the meantime. It can realize the classification of samples and variables synchronously, and the results can be interpreted by each other. First, the correspondence analysis is conducted on Landsat8/OLI remote sensing imagery to build the relationship between samples and variables. After that the correspondence relationship between identification results of high-temperature targets and feature bands can be built in the physical theory of remote sensing and factors which have indicative significance on fire are confirmed. Finally, the single band threshold method is adopted to realize high temperature target recognition by using factor scores. In the field confirmation, results suggest that the precision of identification of high-temperature targets reaches 92%. And we also get a consistent result with SWIR temperature inversion.

TI  - Dust storm ?hot spots? and Transport Pathways Affecting the Arabian Peninsula
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Peninsula (AP), the largest peninsula in the world, contains 'hot spot' areas for intensive dust storms. Dust sources outside the AP can also represent 'hot spots' that heavily impact the AP. This study explores the source and transport pathways of severe dust storm events over the AP over nine years (2010-2018) using MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites (0.25-0.5 km/pxl resolution) combined with the HYSPLIT model and synoptic meteorology. The study identified ten dust source 'hot spots' that affect the AP; two are local (within the AP) and eight are regional (outside the AP). The identified local dust sources were (1) the Empty Quarter and (2) the Mesopotamian flood plain in southern Iraq, while the regional dust sources were (3) the Syria-Iraq border, (4) Hamun-e Jaz Murian, (5) Coastal desert of Iran, (6) Seistan basin ephemeral lakes, (7) Hamun-e Mashkel, (8) Thar desert of Rajasthan, (9) Nile River basin, and (10) Wadi Langeb Tokar Delta. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the emission and transport of dust storms over the AP at the local and regional/subcontinental levels using medium-high resolution remote sensing. This study has important implications for the international community and the multilateral environmental agreements related to desert dust.

TI  - Historical mapping of rice fields in Japan using phenology and temporally aggregated Landsat images in Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the expansion or reduction of rice fields is fundamental for food and water security, greenhouse gas emission accounting, and environmental management. The historical mapping of rice fields with satellite images is challenging because of the limited availability of remote sensing and training data from past decades. The use of phenology-based algorithms has been proposed for mapping rice fields because they can take advantage of rice fields' characteristic spectral signature during the transplanting phase and do not need training data. However, in order to employ phenology-based algorithms effectively for the historical rice mapping of large areas, we need to incorporate automatized methods able to deal with non-usable data (e.g., cloud cover) and with spatial inconsistencies in the number of available images for each pixel. Here we propose the combination of a pixel-based, phenological algorithm with the temporal aggregation of all available Landsat images to produce national level historical maps of rice fields in Japan from the 1980s onwards. We used temporally aggregated metrics (median, percentiles, etc.), derived from spectral indices of a large number of images within the Google Earth Engine, to minimize the issue of inconsistent image availability and reduce the effects of outliers in phenology-based algorithms. We produced seven rice field maps, for the periods 1985-89, 1990-94, 1995-99, 2000-04, 2005-09, 2010-14, and 2015-19. The overall map accuracies ranged from 83% to 95% when validated with visually interpreted aerial photography. We detected a 23% decrease in the area of rice fields at a country level, although the changes varied greatly among prefectures. Here we present the first freely available historical rice field maps of Japan from the 1980s onwards, together with the source code, and a web application that enables the exploration of the maps and data relating to the derived rice field area changes. The application of temporal aggregation is promising for dealing with the gap-filling of large amounts of satellite data, reducing the issue of data outliers and providing an effective use of the historical Landsat archive for phenology-based crop detection algorithms. Our maps could greatly help researchers, conservationists and policymakers studying the drivers and consequences of rice field changes, and our methods could be extrapolated to map rice fields at large scales in other regions of the world.

TI  - Evaluating the variability of glacial lakes in the Kyrgyz and Teskey ranges, Tien Shan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern Tien Shan Mountains are one of the most hazardous areas in Kyrgyzstan due to frequent glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The current status of glacial lakes in this region has not been reported in recent years. Therefore, this study investigates the variations of glacial lakes in the Kyrgyz and Teskey ranges using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope optical satellite images from 2017 to 2019. Results confirm that there are 800 glacial lakes, of which 351 were in the Kyrgyz and 449 were in the Teskey Range. We found seasonality in the character of glacial lakes, most of which have been found to be unstable during our observation period. 242 glacial lakes showed significant variations in area. We found 46 newly emerging glacial lakes, five of which have rapidly expanded in the year since they formed, while 18 were found to have vanished. Thirteen lakes were found to be short-lived or unstable. In this study, 14 lakes showed a significant expansion of area. Such large variations in the glacial lakes are closely linked to local geomorphological conditions, local climate and glacier melt. We also identified a significant shift in the number of glacial lakes at altitudes over 3,500 m asl. It is associated with the mountain permafrost zone and variations of the glacier terminus. The current study recommends detailed investigation of glacial lakes in each season with the use of remote sensing and field surveys.

TI  - Widespread drought-induced leaf shedding and legacy effects on productivity in European deciduous forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Heatwaves and droughts are becoming more common and severe in Europe, causing changes in tree phenology, disrupting the sequestration of carbon and causing tree mortality on a continental scale. The responses of leaf shedding to heatwaves and droughts remain uncertain, although temperate deciduous forests may shed their leaves if exposed to extreme heat and water stress. Little information, however, is available about the extent and recurrence of early leaf shedding induced by drought, likely because it occurs in small forest patches and can be discriminated only during a few weeks. We used highly spatiotemporal Sentinel-2 data as evidence of widespread drought-induced early leaf shedding in Europe during 2017-2021. We estimated the timing of leaf shedding from NDVI time series and a threshold-based method that extracts the end of the growing season. Then, we evaluated the heatwave and drought impacts at the end of season by analysing the z-score of Landsat-7 and -8 land surface temperature and the ERAS-Land air temperature and aridity index. The 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 data identified early leaf shedding not detected by the low-resolution (250 m) MODIS sensor. Early leaf shedding was observed across Europe during the entire study period and its occurrence was linked to preceding anomalously high temperatures and arid conditions. Our results also indicated that mean summer NDVI decreased significantly in the years following early leaf shedding, suggesting a legacy decline in vegetation productivity. Our study demonstrates that decametric satellite data can be used to monitor the responses of forests to extreme climate events at the canopy level and indicates that early leaf shedding associated with heatwaves and droughts is more widespread and frequent across the continent than previously thought.

TI  - Assessment of vegetation damage by three typhoons (Bavi, Maysak, and Haishen) in Northeast China in 2020
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons usually bring natural disasters and economic losses. Satellite-based vegetation monitoring approaches largely improve our understanding of monitoring and assessing the area damaged by typhoons at high temporal and spatial scales, but it is still unclear which approach could achieve a greater robustness in assessing typhoon damages. From August 27 to September 8, 2020, three typhoons of Bavi, Maysak, and Haishen successively passed through the Northeast China, covering Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, and caused great damages to local vegetation and crops. Here, we employed two top-recognized approaches, i.e., the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Disturbance Index (DI) derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer, to assess impacts three typhoons of Northeast China on the local vegetation and crops. With the help of Google Earth high-resolution images, this study demonstrated that the DI-based assessment gave a more accurate performance with an overall accuracy of 83% compared with NDII in typhoon-induced damages. DI was therefore used for spatial monitoring and assessment of three typhoon impacts. The DI-based results revealed that the damaged area of vegetation and crops in Northeast China was over 1.24 x 10(5) km(2), including croplands, forests, and grasslands with the damaged area of 4.74 x 10(4) km(2) (38.23% of total damaged area), 3.41 x 10(4) km(2) (27.5%), and 0.12 x 10(4) km(2) (0.97%), respectively. The damaged proportions were 14.13%, 13.19%, and 3.11% accounting for croplands, forests, and grasslands, respectively, of entire Northeast China. This study proves that DI-based vegetation damage assessment has more potential in large-scale monitoring of typhoon damages.

TI  - Evaluation of aerosol optical depths and clear-sky radiative fluxes of the CERES Edition 4.1 SYN1deg data product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depths (AODs) used for the Edition 4.1 Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Synoptic 1 degrees (SYN1deg) product are evaluated. AODs are derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and assimilated by an aerosol transport model (the Model for Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry - MATCH). As a consequence, clear-sky AODs closely match with those derived from MODIS instruments. AODs under all-sky conditions are larger than AODs under clear-sky conditions, which is supported by ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations. When all-sky MATCH AODs are compared with Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (Version 2; MERRA-2) AODs, MATCH AODs are generally larger than MERRA-2 AODs, especially over convective regions (e.g., the Amazon, central Africa, and eastern Asia). This variation is largely due to the differing methods of assimilating the MODIS AOD data product and the use of quality flags in our assimilation. Including AODs with larger retrieval uncertainty makes AODs over the convective regions larger. When AODs are used for clear-sky irradiance computations and computed downward shortwave irradiances are compared with ground-based observations, the computed instantaneous irradiances are 1 %-2 % larger than observed irradiances. The comparison of top-of-atmosphere clear-sky irradiances with those derived from CERES observations suggests that AODs used for surface radiation observation sites are 0.01-0.03 larger, which is within the uncertainty of instantaneous MODIS AODs. However, the comparison with AERONET AODs suggests that AODs used for computations over desert sites are 0.08 larger. The cause of positive biases in downward shortwave irradiance and in AOD for the desert sites is possibly due to the dust particle size and distribution, as defined by the MATCH transport model, and the transfer of that information into the radiative transfer model.

TI  - Sentinel 2 analysis of turbidity retrieval models in inland water bodies: The case study of Jordanian dams
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of using Sentinel 2 multispectral satellite images to develop turbidity retrieval models and further estimate the turbidity values of inland water bodies in Jordan. Traditionally, laboratory analysis has been used to assess surface water quality, which is expensive, time-consuming, and requires accessing the field physically. In contrast, remote sensing technologies can detect the water contaminant level at a consistent spatial and temporal coverage. Turbidity is an essential indicator of inland water quality as it directly reflects under-water light penetration. This study was held in three Jordanian dams, King Talal Dam, Mujib Dam, and Wadi Al Arab Dam, which vary in their water quality level. Twenty water samples were collected from each dam. Forty samples were used to calibrate the models, and the rest samples were used to validate the predictive models. The results show that Sentinel 2 near-infrared band to green band (B8/B3) achieved high fitting accuracies with R-2 = 0.832 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.123 NTU. Overall, this study has demonstrated the ability of Sentinel 2 data to estimate the turbidity in different ranges of inland water bodies' quality and indicates that remote sensing can be used as an efficient tool for monitoring inland water quality. This study presents empirical data that could act as a platform to extend future work to cover more sites and contexts.

TI  - The national nature reserves in China: Are they effective in conserving mangroves?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are high-productive ecosystems and globally protected. Establishing nature reserves aimed at counteracting the negative effects of anthropogenic activities is one of the most pivotal approaches to conserve mangrove ecosystems. Evaluation of the conservation effectiveness for mangrove nature reserves is thus indispensable for making knowledge-based conservation policies and funding-decisions by government and managers. In this study, using composited Landsat images by the Google Earth Engine cloud platform and object-oriented deep learning classification method, the land cover maps of national mangrove nature reserves (NMNRs) in China were obtained from 1987 to 2019. The systematic evaluation of conservation effectiveness for each NMNR was conducted by landscape metrics and an entropy weight model. Combined with the dynamics in mangrove distribution, human interference intensity, and natural environment change, the driving force factors affecting the conservation effectiveness for NMNRs were investigated. The results show that the total mangrove area in all NMNRs increased 968.6 ha during the study period, a 21.8 % rate of increase. Except for one NMNR with a slight decline, the conservation of remaining NMNRs was considered effective with increase varied from 14.8 % to 87.5 % in the level of protective efficacy. The conservation effectiveness of NMNRs was affected by both anthropogenic and natural factors, while the improvement to the conservation effectiveness was largely attributed to the implementation of protection policies, such as reforestation engineering. Further direct or indirect challenges in mangrove conservation effectiveness, e.g., pollution, natural disasters, and exotic species invasion, still require close attention. This study provides an effective and efficient approach to quantify the conservation effectiveness of mangrove nature reserves, which would facilitate mangrove conservation and management in the future.

TI  - Daily variations in Western Greenland slush limits, 2000-2021
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The marginal areas of the Greenland ice sheet develop streams and lakes each summer, documenting that surface runoff of meltwater is a major component of ice-sheet mass balance. Here we map the slush limit, a proxy for the extent of surface runoff, using daily MODIS data for the years 2000-2021. We develop an automated algorithm capable of detecting daily slush limits, provided sufficient image quality. The algorithm is applied to the ice sheet's western flank (61.7 degrees N to 76.5 degrees N). We find significant increasing trends in maximum slush limits until the year 2012, but not thereafter. We show that the slush limit typically rises quickly early in the ablation season but stabilizes before melting ceases. The data provide evidence that upward migration of surface runoff in summer 2012 stopped early at the upper margin of the ice slabs. These thick and continuous ice layers are located close to the surface, in the firn, and impede percolation of melt into deeper pore space. Had the ice slabs extended higher, the summer 2012 provided sufficient energy to raise the slush limit by another similar to 300 m in elevation.

TI  - Deep learning high resolution burned area mapping by transfer learning from Landsat-8 to PlanetScope
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution commercial satellite data provide new opportunities for terrestrial monitoring. The recent availability of near-daily 3 m observations provided by the PlanetScope constellation enables mapping of small and spatially fragmented burns that are not detected at coarser spatial resolution. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential for automated PlanetScope 3 m burned area mapping. The PlanetScope sensors have no onboard calibration or short-wave infrared bands, and have variable overpass times, making them challenging to use for large area, automated, burned area mapping. To help overcome these issues, a U-Net deep learning algorithm was developed to classify burned areas from two-date Planetscope 3 m image pairs acquired at the same location. The deep learning approach, unlike conventional burned area mapping algorithms, is applied to image spatial subsets and not to single pixels and so incorporates spatial as well as spectral information. Deep learning requires large amounts of training data. Consequently, transfer learning was undertaken using pre-existing Landsat-8 derived burned area reference data to train the U-Net that was then refined with a smaller set of PlanetScope training data. Results across Africa considering 659 PlanetScope radiometrically normalized image pairs sensed one day apart in 2019 are presented. The U-Net was first trained with different numbers of randomly selected 256 x 256 30 m pixel patches extracted from 92 pre-existing Landsat-8 burned area reference data sets defined for 2014 and 2015. The U-Net trained with 300,000 Landsat patches provided about 13% 30 m burn omission and commission errors with respect to 65,000 independent 30 m evaluation patches. The U-Net was then refined by training on 5,000 256 x 256 3 m patches extracted from independently interpreted Plan-etScope burned area reference data. Qualitatively, the refined U-Net was able to more precisely delineate 3 m burn boundaries, including the interiors of unburned areas, and better classify "faint " burned areas indicative of low combustion completeness and/or sparse burns. The refined U-Net 3 m classification accuracy was assessed with respect to 20 independently interpreted PlanetScope burned area reference data sets, composed of 339.4 million 3 m pixels, with low 12.29% commission and 12.09% omission errors. The dependency of the U-Net classification accuracy on the burned area proportion within 3 m pixel 256 x 256 patches was also examined, and patches < 6.5% burned were less accurately classified. A regression analysis between the proportion of 30 m grid cells classified as burned against the proportion labelled as burned in the 3 m reference maps showed high agreement (r2 = 0.91, slope = 0.93, intercept < 0.001), indicating that the commission and omission errors largely compensate at 30 m resolution.

TI  - Synergetic use of unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite images for detecting non-native tree species: An insight into <i>Acacia saligna</i> invasion in the Mediterranean coast
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) are increasingly threatening biodiversity worldwide; thus, early detection and monitoring tools are needed. Here, we explored the potential of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images in providing intermediate reference data which are able to link IAP field occurrence and satellite information. Specifically, we used very high spatial resolution (VHR) UAV maps of A. saligna as calibration data for satellite-based predictions of its spread in the Mediterranean coastal dunes. Based on two satellite platforms (PlanetScope and Sentinel-2), we developed and tested a dedicated procedure to predict A. saligna spread organized in four steps: 1) setting of calibration data for satellite-based predictions, by aggregating UAV-based VHR IAP maps to satellite spatial resolution (3 and 10 m); 2) selection of monthly multispectral (blue, green, red, and near infra-red bands) cloud-free images for both satellite platforms; 3) calculation of monthly spectral variables depicting leaf and plant characteristics, canopy biomass, soil features, surface water and hue, intensity, and saturation values; 4) prediction of A. saligna distribution and identification of the most important spectral variables discriminating IAP occurrence using a fandom forest (RF) model. RF models calibrated for both satellite platforms showed high predictive performances (R (2) > 0.6; RMSE < 0.008), with accurate spatially explicit predictions of the invaded areas. While Sentinel-2 performed slightly better, the PlanetScope-based model effectively delineated invaded area edges and small patches. The summer leaf chlorophyll content followed by soil spectral variables was regarded as the most important variables discriminating A. saligna patches from native vegetation. Such variables depicted the characteristic IAP phenology and typically altered leaf litter and soil organic matter of invaded patches. Overall, we presented new evidence of the importance of VHR UAV data to fill the gap between field observation of A. saligna and satellite data, offering new tools for detecting and monitoring non-native tree spread in a cost-effective and timely manner.

TI  - Water pollution evaluation through fuzzy c-means clustering and neural networks using ALOS AVNIR-2 data and water depth of Lake Hosenko, Japan
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a critical resource for human life and an essential component of ecosystems and the environment. In recent years, water pollution prevention strategies have become increasingly important. Remote sensing techniques that periodically capture wide-area data are useful for surveying the conditions of water bodies. Using a general water quality estimation method to obtain maps consistent with the experimental data, remote sensing data and water quality values should be obtained simultaneously. However, the requirement for simultaneous observation impedes the creation of water quality estimation maps. Methods must be developed to evaluate water pollution conditions without water quality data. In this study, we propose a neural-network-based method to evaluate water pollution conditions in Lake Hosenko, Japan, using remote sensing data and the water depth of the lake. The water depth was calculated based on the water surface and lake bottom elevations. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering was employed to create evaluated water pollution condition maps using only remote sensing data. The proposed method utilizes the FCM results and water depth data during the learning process. We verified the usefulness of the evaluation results obtained through comparisons with actual water pollution conditions in the lake. The results suggest that the difference in water surface elevation affects the mechanism of pollution in Lake Hosenko, and the proposed method contributes to understanding this mechanism. Therefore, the proposed method can identify the pollution condition without water quality data and support the implementation of remedial measures.

TI  - 'I Believe in Something; I Don't Know What It Is': An Exploration of Five British Hindus' Worldviews Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
T2  - SECULARISM & NONRELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has suggested individuals can draw on resources from a diverse range of existential cultures when constructing their personal worldviews. However, the ways individuals??? beliefs and worldviews are acquired and develop is still only partially understood. This study investigates these processes of worldview dynamics by exploring the beliefs and practices of five British Hindus. Semi-structured interviews with each participant were inductively analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). This analysis developed six sub-themes which formed two superordinate themes: ???Everybody has their own way??? and ???Focusing on this world???. The analysis shows the complexity of many individuals??? worldviews and demonstrates how individuals can live in a hinterland between religiosity and non-religiosity. For these participants, existential beliefs were idiosyncratic and deeply personal. They rejected some aspects of their cultural heritage while retaining others. The participants were comfortable with uncertainty about such matters and were highly tolerant of divergent beliefs. Understanding how these participants made sense of their world increases our understanding of both worldview dynamics and the forms that secularity can take in modern Britain. This shows why more nuanced understandings of ???belief??? are necessary to explore the complexity of people???s lived experiences.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) data, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST thermal infrared products, are useful for monitoring surface processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet in remote areas but must be validated to ensure accuracy. Using data from the Programme for Monitoring the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE), we conducted a MODIS LST validation (MOD/MYD11 C6 swath level product) using radiometric in-situ skin temperature records from 2014 to 2017 over 17 PROMICE sites mostly in the ice sheet's ablation zone. There is a significant cold bias in MODIS LST when compared to PROMICE skin temperature, particularly when PROMICE records temperatures below 0 degrees C (mean bias: 2.4 +/- 0.01 degrees C mean +/- standard error, RMSE = 3.2 degrees C). Multiple linear regression analysis reveals the difference between MODIS LST and PROMICE skin temperature is larger at lower temperatures, lower latent heat fluxes and higher specific humidity. Our results confirm the presence of a progressive cold bias in the MODIS LST that should be considered in use of this product, and we identify and corroborate areas for ongoing algorithm development.

TI  - Remote sensing data processing and analysis for the identification of geological entities
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - As Earth observation technology has advanced, the volume of remote sensing big data has grown rapidly, offering significant obstacles to efficient and effective processing and analysis. A convolutional neural network refers to a neural network that covers convolutional calculations. It is a form of deep learning, and convolutional neural networks have characterization learning characteristics, which can classify information into different data. Remote Sensing Data Processing from various sensors has been attracting with more information in Remote Sensing. Remote sensing data is generally adjusted and refined through image processing. Image processing techniques, such as filtering and feature detection, are ideal for dealing with the high-dimensionality of geographically distributed systems. The geological entity is a term in geological work which refers to the product of geological processes that occupy a certain space in the Earth's crust and are different from other materials. They are of different sizes and are divided into different types according to their size. It mainly focuses on improving classification accuracy and accurately describing scattering types. For geological entity recognition, this paper proposed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (DCNN-PSAR). It is expected to use deep convolutional neural network technology and polarized SAR technology to explore new methods of geological entities and improve geological recognition capabilities. With the help of Multimodal Remote Sensing Data Processing, it is now possible to characterize and identify the composition of the Earth's surface from orbital and aerial platforms. This paper proposes a ground object classification algorithm for polarized SAR images based on a fully convolutional network, which realizes the geological classification function and overcomes the shortcomings of too long. The evaluation of DCNN-PSAR shows that the accuracy of the water area is showing a rising trend, and the growth rate is relatively fast in the early stage, which directly changes from 0.14 to 0.6. Still, the increase is slower in the later stage. DCNN-PSAR achieves the highest quality of remote sensing data extraction.

TI  - Isolating the effects of land use land cover change and inter-decadal climate variations on the water and energy cycles over India, 1981-2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of this work is the assessment of the individual and combined impacts of land use land cover change (LULCC) and inter-decadal climate variations (CV) on the water and energy cycles over India, given extensive land use land cover change over the last decades. In this study, we quantify the contributions of LULC and CV on changes in the water and energy cycles over the Indian subcontinent through a scenario-based approach, with Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) model runs from 1981 to 2010. The approach involves four simulation scenarios: (i) the first scenario considers no LULCC or CV (LULC is fixed and the atmospheric forcings for 1981-1990 are repeated in the decades afterwards); (ii) the second scenario considers only the impact of CV; (iii) the third scenario considers only the effect of LULCC by updating the LULC every 10 years; and (iv) the fourth scenario considers the combined impact of LULCC and CV. LULCC causes an overall decrease in the evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture (SM) by 0.3 % and 0.1 % respectively (comparing 1991-2010 with 1981-1990), while the net radiation changes < 1 %. On the other hand, CV caused an increase in the ET, SM and net radiation by + 5.4 %, +1.5 % and + 1.0 % respectively, in spite of decrease of precipitation of 6.6 %. The combined effect of LULCC and CV leads to an increase in the overall ET by 3.8 %. Among the LULC transitions, deforestation and urbanization are found to be the major causes for hydrological changes over the decades, but their impact is much smaller, since CV has a greater impact on the hydrological cycles over India than LULC. The in-depth understanding of the distinct contributions of LULCC and CV on the water and energy cycles in tropical and subtropical regions can be used for framing future water resources planning and management policies.

AB  - This reflection focuses on my experiences teaching political science through a black worldview suggested by Dr. Mack H. Jones. In 1971, Dr. Mack H. Jones challenged black political scientists to subvert the efforts of white political scientists by creating an alternative frame of reference that focused on African American and African communities in the discipline. Moreover, Dr. Jones was the founder and chief visionary for the political science Ph.D. program at Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University-CAU), which created an academic program by which every subfield was taught through the material conditions of black people in the U.S. and around the world. As an alum of CAU, I describe my efforts to answer Dr. Jones' call through my teaching at various Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) by recounting how I integrate the black experience in my political science courses by highlighting race, class, and gender in my teaching.

TI  - SnowWarp: An open science and open data tool for daily monitoring of snow dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is a key hydrological variable, critical to understanding water cycles and informing management decisions around resource extraction and recreational activities. Remote sensing open-access data and cloud -based computing platforms are two innovative tools for snow cover estimation. In this paper, we present SnowWarp, a processing framework that uses Google Earth Engine and the R programming languages to combine Landsat 30 m with MODIS 500 m satellite imagery and produce daily-30-m spatial resolution snow cover data anywhere globally. SnowWarp was applied in an alpine catchment in Northern Italy from 2000-2019 and validated using hy-drometeorological datasets. Strong correlations between snow cover and ground data were found with corre-lations in terms of R up to-0.84 for temperature,-0.17 for precipitation, 0.74 for snow depth, and-0.43 for streamflow. The SnowWarp tool is an open-source framework enabling users to map fine spatial and temporal dynamics of snow cover to the ecosystem and hydrological monitoring.

TI  - Thermal infrared remote sensing and soil gas radon for detecting blind geothermal area
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal resources in the Wugongshan area are abundant and most closely associated with faults. Due to the dense vegetation covering the research area, locating the geothermal resources using conventional ground technologies is costly and challenging. This paper proposes and implements a novel method in the area under examination. More specifically, remote sensing information (Landsat 8) and known geological information are used to delineate the geothermal target area. On January 19, 2021, the land surface temperature in the study area ranged between 7.7 and 21.2 degrees C. Combining the geothermal geological features of the regional area, two areas, namely Tangjiashan and Sanjiang, are delineated as geothermal target areas. The probable location of faults is determined by measuring the soil gas radon concentration. The relative coefficient K-Q of radon activity attained in profiles varies between 1.7 and 13.2. The average values of K-Q between different areas are ranked as Wenjia > Tangjiashan > Hongjiang > Sanjiang. Generally, areas with higher K-Q of radon activity have higher land surface temperature (LST). Thus, the K-Q and LST can be used to evaluate the shallow geothermal potential. Finally, by integrating the interpretation of remote sensing and soil radon measurements, the fault location is identified, and the result is successfully used to guide the drilling of geothermal wells in the Tangjiashan area.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the potential for rice productivity in the wetland soil of Nigeria's Ogun River basin. TOPSIS' multi-criteria analysis process, Ca-Markov model, with NDVI, NDWI, and land surface temperature from remote sensing data analyses were used to derive an efficacious wetland soil potential model for rice production. The potential for rice cultivation in the area varied from highly suitable (6.6%), to moderately suitable (50.1%) areas, and from marginally suitable areas (26.0%) to areas that are currently unsuitable (17.3%). The major barriers to rice soil suitability were topography, temperature, low fertility, and erosion hazards.

TI  - Monitoring detailed mangrove hurricane damage and early recovery using multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to their location in tropical latitudes, mangrove forests are susceptible to the impact of hurricanes and can be vastly damaged by their high-speed winds. Given the logistic difficulties regarding field surveys in mangroves, remote sensing approaches have been considered a reliable alternative. We quantified trends in damage and early signs of canopy recovery in a fringe Rhizophora mangle area of Marismas Nacionales, Mexico, following the landfall of Hurricane Willa in October 2018. We monitored (2016-2021) broad canopy defoliation using 21 vegetation indices (VI) from the Google Earth Engine tool (GEE). We also mapped a detailed canopy fragmen-tation and developed digital surface models (DSM) during five study periods (2018-2021) with a consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over an area of 100 ha. Based on optical data from the GEE time series, results indicated an abrupt decline in the overall mangrove canopy. The VARI index was the most reliable VI for the mangrove canopy classification from a standard RGB sensor. The impact of the hurricane caused an overall canopy defoliation of 79%. The series of UAV orthomosaics indicate a gradual recovery in the mangrove canopy, while the linear model predicts at least 8.5 years to reach pre-impact mangrove cover conditions. However, the sequence of DSM estimates that the vertical canopy configuration will require a longer time to achieve its original structure.

TI  - Integrated viral elements suggest the dual lifestyle of Tetraselmis spp. Polinton-like viruses
T2  - VIRUS EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we aimed at exploring horizontal gene transfer between viruses and Chlorodendraceae green algae (Chlorophyta) using available genomic and transcriptomic sequences for twenty algal strains. We identified a significant number of genes sharing a higher sequence similarity with viral homologues, thus signalling their possible involvement in horizontal gene transfers with viruses. Further characterization showed that many of these genes were clustered in DNA regions of several tens to hundreds of kilobases in size, originally belonging to viruses related to known Tetraselmis spp. viruses (TetV and TsV). In contrast, the remaining candidate HGT genes were randomly dispersed in the algal genomes, were more frequently transcribed, and belonged to large multigene families. The presence of homologues in Viridiplantae suggested that the latter were more likely of algal rather than viral origin. We found a remarkable diversity in polinton-like virus (PLV) elements inserted in Tetraselmis genomes, all of which were most similar to the Tetraselmis striata virus (TsV). The genes of PLV elements are transcriptionally inactive with the notable exception of the homologue of the TVSG_00024 gene of TsV whose function is unknown. We suggest that this gene may be involved in a sentinel process to trigger virus reactivation and excision in response to an environmental stimulus. Altogether, these results provide evidence that TsV-related viruses have a dual lifestyle, alternating between a free viral phase (i.e. virion) and a phase integrated into host genomes.

TI  - Long-term shoreline evolution (Late-Holocene-2018) of the Channel 15 coast (Samborombon bay, NE - Buenos Aires province, Argentina)
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we present an investigation with the aim of reconstructing the shoreline evolution and geomorphological changes in the central zone of Samborombon bay (Channel 15, Buenos Aires province, Argentina) during the period 2700 cal yr BP to recent times. Palynological, geomorphological and historical imagery and proxy-data analyses were combined to reconstruct the shoreline evolution and paleo-environmental changes. Palynological material (pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs -NPP-) was recovered from a continuous 117 cm long sedimentary profile extracted from an outcrop at the northern margin of Channel 15. Relict landforms, including paleo- shorelines, were reconstructed by applying enhancing filters to a Spot 6 image from 2015. Historical shorelines were identified in high-definition images (aerial and satellite imagery) between 1968 and 2018, but also by using the marsh vegetation edge as a shoreline proxy. Shoreline change was quantified using the Net Shoreline Movement and Weighted Linear Regression algorithms in ArcMap 10.1. Results based on the palynological analysis for the period 2700-2740 BP, show the passage from subtidal-intertidal to supratidal environment with influence of brackish to fresh-waters, where paleo-shorelines imprint was recognized developing over a tidal plain that was grading to marshes. Results based on aerial and satellite imagery for the period 1968-2018 show shoreline retrocession only immediately at the north of the channel mouth, while the rest of the coast prograded toward the estuary. These processes indicate that new marshes - and, therefore, wetlands - are constantly developing at the edge of Samborombon bay.

TI  - Semi-automated detection of ungulates using UAV imagery and reflective spectrometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of species conservation, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is increasing in popularity as wildlife observation and monitoring tools. With large datasets created by UAV-based species surveying, the need arose to automate the detection process of the species. Although the use of computer learning algorithms for wildlife detection from UAV-derived imagery is an increasing trend, it depends on a large amount of imagery of the species to train the object detector effectively. However, there are alternatives like object-based image analysis (OBIA) software available if a large amount of imagery of the species is not available to develop a computer-learned object detector. The study tested the semi-automated detection of reintroduced Arabian Oryx (O. leucoryx), using the specie's coat sRGB-colour profiles as input for OBIA to identify adult O. leucoryx, applied to UAV acquired imagery. Our method uses lab-measured spectral reflection of hair sample values, collected from captive O. leucoryx as an input for OBIA ruleset to identify adult O. leucoryx from UAV survey imagery using semi-automated supervised classification. The converted mean CIE Lab reflective spectrometry colour values of n = 50 hair samples of adult O. leucoryx to 8-bit sRGB-colour profiles of the species resulted in the red-band value of 157.450, the green-band value of 151.390 and blue-band value of 140.832. The sRGB values and a minimum size permitter were added as the input of the OBIA ruleset identified adult O. leucoryx with a high degree of efficiency when applied to three UAV census datasets. Using species sRGB-colour profiles to identify re-introduced O. leucoryx and extract location data using a non-invasive UAV-based tool is a novel method with enormous application possibilities. Coat refection sRGB-colour profiles can be developed for a range of species and customised to autodetect and classify the species from remote sensing data.

TI  - Tracking the turnover of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs Gamma to Delta in a Brazilian state (Minas Gerais) with a high-vaccination status
T2  - VIRUS EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence and global dissemination of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) have been described as the main factor driving the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. In Brazil, the Gamma variant dominated the epidemiological scenario during the first period of 2021. Many Brazilian regions detected the Delta variant after its first description and documented its spread. To monitor the introduction and spread of VOC Delta, we performed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) genotyping and genome sequencing in ten regional sentinel units from June to October 2021 in the State of Minas Gerais (MG). We documented the introduction and spread of Delta, comprising 70 per cent of the cases 8 weeks later. Comparing the viral loads of the Gamma and Delta dominance periods, we provide additional evidence that the latter is more transmissible. The spread and dominance of Delta did not culminate in the increase in cases and deaths, suggesting that the vaccination may have restrained the epidemic growth. Analysis of 224 novel Delta genomes revealed that Rio de Janeiro state was the primary source for disseminating this variant in the state of MG. We present the establishment of Delta, providing evidence of its enhanced transmissibility and showing that this variant shift did not aggravate the epidemiological scenario in a high immunity setting.

TI  - Modelling cropland expansion and its drivers in Trans Nzoia County, Kenya
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth and increasing demand for agricultural production continue to drive global cropland expansions. These expansions lead to the overexploitation of fragile ecosystems, propagating land degradation, and the loss of natural diversity. This study aimed to identify the factors driving land use/land cover changes (LULCCs) and subsequent cropland expansion in Trans Nzoia County in Kenya. Landsat images were used to characterize the temporal LULCCs in 30 years and to derive cropland expansions using change detection. Logistic regression (LR), boosted regression trees (BRTs), and evidence belief functions (EBFs) were used to model the potential drivers of cropland expansion. The candidate variables included proximity and biophysical, climatic, and socioeconomic factors. The results showed that croplands replaced other natural land covers, expanding by 38% between 1990 and 2020. The expansion in croplands has been at the expense of forestland, wetland, and grassland losses, which declined in coverage by 33%, 71%, and 50%, respectively. All the models predicted elevation, proximity to rivers, and soil pH as the critical drivers of cropland expansion. Cropland expansions dominated areas bordering the Mt. Elgon forest and Cherangany hills ecosystems. The results further revealed that the logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. In contrast, EBF and the BRT models depicted AUC values of 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. The findings exemplify the relationships between different potential drivers of cropland expansion and contribute to developing appropriate strategies that balance food production and environmental conservation.

TI  - Performance analysis of open-source DEMs in tsunami inundation modelling
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In natural hazard modeling, underestimation is not acceptable, since it will produce unreliable and inadequate information for decision makers to work on during hazard mitigation planning. Including tsunami inundation modeling, result of the natural hazard models is highly sensitive to the accuracy of input data. High resolution elevation data, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) can provide modeling results that are closer to the reality. However, gathering such high-resolution datasets is expensive, time consuming and is usually not open to public access. Moreover, required computational time with those high-resolution datasets is significantly long. Therefore, open-source DEMs such as, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D (AW3D30), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are usually the first preferred data sets. This study aims to analyse the performances of AW3D30, ASTER GDEM, and SRTM for tsunami modeling by comparing them with high-resolution LiDAR DEM tsunami modeling results. For the selected test site of this study, among these three open-source DEMs, tsunami simulations performed with ASTER GDEM exhibits an underestimated coverage of tsunami inundation areas and the maximum flow depth values in those areas and should not be preferred. Whereas, the comparisons of the simulation results using SRTM and AW3D30 as input DEMs revealed that, inundated areas are not less than the LiDAR reference and their error is lower at land use based flow depth analysis. Therefore, AW3D30 and SRTM can be accepted to use in tsunami modeling for the test site of this study considering their limited accuracy and low resolutions, when there is no available higher resolution data with good accuracy or if a rapid hazard assessment is required. However, it should be noted that open-source DEMs may have substantial errors or inadequacy on other coastal areas with different settings. Therefore, it is advised to be cautious in the usage of open-source DEMs in tsunami inundation modeling.

TI  - Rice mapping based on Sentinel-1 images using the coupling of prior knowledge and deep semantic segmentation network: A case study in Northeast China from 2019 to 2021
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Usually, continuous effective optical observation data collected from a single-sensor within one year is not available, most studies conducted rice mapping in Northeast China using optical remote sensing images collected from multi-years and multi-sensors. Meanwhile, the accuracies of mapping results are limited by the employed traditional machine learning algorithms, which cannot fully exploit the deep abstract features contained in the multi-temporal images. Consequently, this paper developed a deep learning framework for large-scale rice mapping based on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images in practice. It was achieved via semantic segmentation based on coupling of U-Net and prior knowledge (i.e., the coupled U-Net). Classification experiments were conducted in regions covered by complete and incomplete multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images to validate ad-vantages of the coupled U-Net. Besides, feature visualization experiments were conducted, and the results showed that the coupled U-Net could further robustly learn deep abstract feature that was more suitable to express land covers. Finally, rice maps of Northeast China in different years were produced by the coupled U-Net and Sentinel-1 images. For the results of 2021, both rice producer's and user's accuracies exceeded 85%, while its overall accuracy and F1-score were higher than 0.9. For the results of 2019 and 2020, the rice areas of Northeast China extracted from Sentinel-1 images were 4.0% and 4.9% less than those of the subnational statistics data. This study provided a viable option toward practical large-scale rice mapping based on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images through the coupling of prior knowledge and deep learning technology.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) reveals continued ground deformation in and around Metro Manila, Philippines, associated with groundwater exploitation
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uneven ground deformations resulting from excessive groundwater exploitation have been causing problems in metropolitan cities worldwide. Metro Manila and its adjoining provinces have been recognized as undergoing ground deformations due to excessive groundwater pumping, meeting the continued population growth rate demands. Previous studies have identified widespread subsidence using advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) techniques, but with insufficient archived SAR data, which suffered from the extended perpendicular and temporal baselines covering long periods from 1993 to 2011. This study presents a Sentinel-1 Permanent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) application from 2015 to 2019 as a continued effort to monitor ground deformations caused by groundwater extraction and recharge in and around Metro Manila. The results revealed that several areas manifest apparent subsidence and uplift within the image's footprint. The line-of-sight (LOS) subsidence rates in Manila, Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela are between 1 and 2 cm/year, except for some coastal communities. Other parts of the region are detected to be experiencing an uplift of 0.1 to 1 cm/year. LOS subsidence rates exceeding 4 cm/year were recorded in the adjoining provinces of Metro Manila, specifically in Bulacan, Cavite, and Laguna. These observations are consistent when correlated with groundwater levels during the same period. Moreover, a high correlation was observed with coefficients of determination (R-2) > 0.95 in Makati, Bagumbayan (in Quezon City), and Dasmarinas (in Cavite). With the results obtained, a better understanding of these subtle ground deformations affecting various areas in the Philippines can help mitigate possible disasters and damages by this geohazard.

TI  - Long-term monitoring particulate composition change in the Great Lakes using MODIS data
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate composition provides important information for understanding the changes in underwater light fields and primary productivity. In this study, a semianalytical algorithm, based on Rayleigh-corrected reflectance at 678 nm and 748 nm on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images was used to estimate the ratio of chlorophyll a to total suspended solids (Chla/TSS), which characterizes the particulate composition of the Great Lakes. The long-term spatial and temporal characteristics of Chla/TSS in the Great Lakes from 2000 to 2020 were obtained. The results demonstrated that Lake Superior had the highest average Chla/TSS values (5.79 & PLUSMN;0.76 mu g/mg), while Lake Erie had the lowest average Chla/TSS values (2.93 & PLUSMN;0.76 mu g/mg). The Mann -Kendall test showed that the Chla/TSS of the Great Lakes all showed an increasing trend, notably in Lake Michigan, with 88.23% pixels showing significant increasing trend. Climatic and hydrological factors dominated the intra-annual variation of Chla/TSS, with contribution rates ranging from 71.47% to 92.54%. Through the annual Chla/TSS change pattern analysis, it was found that the contribution of wind speed to the annual vari-ation in Chla/TSS was slight. Changes in temperature played a major role in the interannual variability of Chla/ TSS in Lake Superior and Ontario; runoff and settlement were the major contributors in Lake Huron and Michigan, while cropland dominated the Chla/TSS interannual variability in Lake Erie. Furthermore, the significantly low values of Chla/TSS in spring had the potential to predict the occurrence of blooms in western Lake Erie, and the spatial distribution of Chla/TSS could help predict the location of blooms in the next few days.

TI  - Correlating severe land subsidence and confined brine aquifer compaction in the Yellow River Delta, China, with Sentinel-1A/1B satellite images
T2  - MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, noticeable subsidence depressions have occurred along the coastal zone of the Yellow River Delta. In some coastal areas, the average annual subsidence varies from tens of millimeters to hundreds of millimeters. Although some studies have discovered a significant land subsidence funnel in the coastal zone of the Yellow River Delta, it has rarely been reported in recent years. Using Sentinel-1A/1B images from the last five years and permanent scatterers interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology, we found a typical subsidence bowl in the northeastern part of the delta, with a cumulative settlement of nearly 1 m over five years. In addition, we used the approach of soil mechanics to simulate the settlement of confined brine layers with different thicknesses under drainage conditions. We found that the 15 m thick confined aquifer can produce 1 m of settlement for every 15% decrease in water content. The simulation results explain the large settlement of the brine industrial area. This study can provide guidance for brine mining in the future. If we continue to overexploit underground brine, there will be more severe land subsidence in the delta in the future.

TI  - Coastal and landuse changes of Burullus Lake, Egypt: A comparison using Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water bodies such as lakes is expensive, but remote sensing made it cost-effective. The extensive anthropogenic activities negatively impact the water lakes everywhere. Moreover, the Egyptian coastal lakes are not an exception. This paper investigates changes in land use/land cover and detects coastal changes of Buullus Lake, ranked to be the second-largest Egyptian northern Mediterranean coastal lake, using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques. Multitemporal Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2019 have been collected and processed where Landsat and Sentinel-2A images for 2019 have been used for comparison purposes. In addition field visits have been conducted to verify the obtained results. The maximum likelihood supervised classification approach was shown to be more accurate in monitoring changes in the Lake's water bodies. Classes of the supervised classification included eight classes; seawater, lake water, floating vegetation, sand, urban, agricultural areas, fish farms, and drainage canals. Analysis of the satellite data indicated that: between 1984 and 2019, the lake's water bodies and floating vegetation area were reduced by 16 % and 52 %, respectively. While agricultural lands increased by (648 km(2)). In addition, there has been a significant growth in the area of fish farms (290 km(2)). The resulted updated spatiotemporal maps and extracted water features assist decision-makers in taking the necessary steps to stop or minimize anthropogenic activities. These steps will help to restore or maintain the lake to host the government planned activities to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the lake level.

TI  - Accuracy and Limitations of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients with Positive Nodes
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Axillary surgical management in patients with node-positive breast cancer at the time of diagnosis converted to negative nodes through neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains unclear. Removal of more than two sentinel nodes (SLNs) in these patients may decrease the false negative rate (FNR) of sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs). We aim to analyse the detection rate (DR) and the FNR of SLNB assessment according to the number of SLNs removed. Methods. A retrospective study was performed from October 2012 to December 2018. Patients with invasive breast cancer who had a clinically node-positive disease at diagnosis and with a complete axillary response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were selected. Patients included underwent SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after NAC. The SLN was considered positive if any residual disease was detected. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the clinicopathologic features and the results of SLNB and ALND. The DR of SLNB was defined as the number of patients with successful identification of SLN. Presence of residual disease in ALND and negative SLN was considered false negative. Results. A total of 368 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent surgery after complete NAC were studied. Of them, 85 patients met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study. The mean age at diagnosis was 50.8 years. Systematic lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients, with an average of 10 lymph nodes removed. The DR of SLNB was 92.9%, and the FNR was 19.1. The median number of SLNs removed was 3, and at least, three SLNs were obtained in 42 patients (53.2%). When at least three sentinel nodes were removed, the FNR decreased to 8.7%. Conclusions. In this cohort, the SLN assessment was associated with an adequate DR and a high FNR. Removing three or more SLNs decreased the FNR from 19.1% to 8.7%. Complementary approaches may be considered for axillary lymph node staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The study was approved by our institution's ethics committee (Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain) ().

TI  - Utilizing multi-temporal thermal data to assess environmental land degradation impacts: example from Suez Canal region, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) analysis of satellite data is critical for studying the environmental land degradation impacts. However, challenges arise to correlate the LST and field data due to the constant development in land use and land cover (LULC). This study aims to monitor, analyze, assess, and map the environmental land degradation impacts utilizing image processing and GIS tools of satellite data and fieldwork. Two thermal and optical sets of Landsat TM +5 and TIRS +8 data dated 1984 and 2018 were used to map the thermal and LULC changes in the Suez Canal region (SCR). The LULC classification was categorized into water bodies, urban areas, vegetation, baren areas, wetland, clay, and salt. LULC and LST change detection results revealed that vegetation and urban areas increased in their areas in 34 years. Moreover, 97% of the SCR witnessed LST rise during this period with an average rise rate of 0.352 degrees C per year. The most effective LULC class changes on LST were the conversions from or to baren areas, where baren areas were converted to 630.5 km(2) vegetation and 104 km(2) urban areas rising the LST to 43.57 degrees C and 45 degrees C, respectively. The spectral reflectance (LSR), LST profiles, and statistical analyses examined the association between LST and LULC deriving factors. In combination with field observations, five hotspots were chosen to detect and monitor natural and human land degradation impacts on LST of the SCR environment. Land degradations detected include water pollution, groundwater rising, salinity increase, sand dune migration, and seismic activity.

TI  - Ensemble averaging using remote sensing data to model spatiotemporal PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations in sparsely monitored South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a paucity of air quality data in sub-Saharan African countries to inform science driven air quality management and epidemiological studies. We investigated the use of available remote-sensing aerosol optical depth (AOD) data to develop spatially and temporally resolved models to predict daily particulate matter (PM10) concentrations across four provinces of South Africa (Gauteng, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape) for the year 2016 in a two-staged approach. In stage 1, a Random Forest (RF) model was used to impute Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD data for days where it was missing. In stage 2, the machine learner algorithms RF, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression were used to model the relationship between ground-monitored PM10 data, AOD and other spatial and temporal predictors. These were subsequently combined in an ensemble model to predict daily PM10 concentrations at 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution across the four provinces. An out-of-bag R-2 of 0.96 was achieved for the first stage model. The stage 2 cross-validated (CV) ensemble model captured 0.84 variability in ground-monitored PM10 with a spatial CV R-2 of 0.48 and temporal CV R-2 of 0.80. The stage 2 model indicated an optimal performance of the daily predictions when aggregated to monthly and annual means. Our results suggest that a combination of remote sensing data, chemical transport model estimates and other spatiotemporal predictors has the potential to improve air quality exposure data in South Africa's major industrial provinces. In particular, the use of a combined ensemble approach was found to be useful for this area with limited availability of air pollution ground monitoring data.

TI  - Maritime glacier retreat and terminus area change in Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska, between 1984 and 2021
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier change in Kenai Fjords National Park in southcentral Alaska affects local terrestrial, fresh water and marine ecosystems and will likely impact ecotourism. We used Landsat 4-8 imagery from 1984 through 2021 to manually map lower glacier ice margins for 19 maritime glaciers in Kenai Fjords National Park. Of these glaciers, six are tidewater, three are lake-terminating, six are land-terminating and four terminated in more than one environment throughout the study period. We used the mapped ice margins to quantify seasonal terminus position and areal change, including distinguishing between ice loss at glacier termini and along glacier margins. Overall, 13 glaciers substantially retreated (more than 2 sigma), 14 lost substantial area and only two underwent both net advance and area gain. The glaciers that had insubstantial length and area changes were predominantly tidewater. Cumulatively, the lower reaches of these 19 glaciers lost 42 km(2) of ice, which was nearly evenly distributed between the terminus and the lateral margins. The rapid rate of glacier change and subsequent land cover changes are highly visible to visitors and locals at Kenai Fjords National Park, and this study quantifies those changes in terms of glacier length and area.

TI  - Monitoring Water Turbidity in a Temperate Floodplain Using UAV: Potential and Challenges
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lake Saint-Pierre (LSP) is a wide (approximate to 300 km(2)) and shallow (approximate to 3 m) lake created through a widening of the St. Lawrence River. Each spring, freshet makes it the largest floodplain in the province of Quebec. Agricultural practices in the littoral increase the water turbidity, which deteriorate the habitat's quality of many fish species. However, measuring spatio-temporal turbidity patterns in the LSP floodplain remain difficult because turbidity is highly variable in space and time. This study aims to evaluate the potential to use an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to measure the water turbidity in the LSP's floodplain. The results show that the UAV can efficiently measure the variation of turbidity in the LSP with a RMSE of 28.22 FNU. We also compared the turbidity retrieved from UAV with those retrieved from Sentinel-2 observations. The results show that the two models are comparable, even if Sentinel-2 yields better results. However, challenges remain when using UAV for turbidity monitoring, such as software limitations for mosaics creation over large water bodies. Nevertheless, the high spatial and temporal information can provide insights into the complex water turbidity patterns which characterize floodplains. The method could help land use management to improve the water quality of these ecosystems.

TI  - Assessment of the effect of landowner type on deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon using remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Legal Amazon contains important reservoirs of forest that are threatened by stakeholders' behaviour. The Cadastro Ambiental Rural (CAR; Rural Environmental Registry) database was used to define the limits and classes of landowner according to private property size. For each class, we identified the annual forest-cover/cover-loss profile at 2-year intervals from 2000 to 2020 based on Brazilian Annual Land Use and Land Cover Mapping Project (MapBiomas) and Program for Deforestation Monitoring (PRODES) data. The analysis revealed that very large landowners dominate the CAR-registered area and that deforestation is influenced by landowner type. The cumulative contributions to deforestation were 2 916 245.96, 1 234 216.79, 2 871 400.36, 2 805 058.62 and 2 637 485.60 ha for very large landowners, large landowners, medium landowners, small landowners and very small landowners, respectively. Very large landowners (1.7% of the total number of properties) had more forest on their properties but caused the greatest amount of deforestation in total, often associated with agribusiness. Small and very small landowners were more numerous (21.0% and 68.3% of the total number of properties, respectively), but they owned a small total area and contributed less to total deforestation. Property size and landownership asymmetry should be considered in deforestation control policies and commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.

TI  - A spatio-temporal assessment and prediction of Ahmedabad's urban growth between 1990-2030
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing long term urban growth trends can provide valuable insights into a city's future growth. This study employs LANDSAT satellite images from 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2019 to perform a spatiotemporal assessment and predict Ahmedabad's urban growth. Land Use Land Change (LULC) maps developed using the Maximum Likelihood classifier produce four principal classes: Built-up, Vegetation, Water body, and "Others". In between 1990-2019, the total built-up area expanded by 130%, 132 km(2) in 1990 to 305 km(2) in 2019. Rapid population growth is the chief contributor towards urban growth as the city added 3.9 km(2) of additional built-up area to accommodate every 100,000 new residents. Further, a Multi-Layer Perceptron - Markov Chain model (MLP-MC) predicts Ahmedabad's urban expansion by 2030. Compared to 2019, the MLP-MC model predicts a 25% and 19% increase in Ahmedabad's total urban area and population by 2030. Unaltered, these trends shall generate many socio-economic and environmental problems. Thus, future urban development policies must balance further development and environmental damage.

TI  - Identification of misdiagnosis by deep neural networks on a histopathologic review of breast cancer lymph node metastases
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - The frozen section (FS) diagnoses of pathology experts are used in China to determine whether sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer have metastasis during operation. Direct implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) in clinical practice may be hindered by misdiagnosis of the algorithm, which affects a patient's treatment decision. In this study, we first obtained the prediction result of the commonly used patch-DNN, then we present a relative risk classification and regression tree (RRC ART) to identify the misdiagnosed whole-slide images (WSIs) and recommend them to be reviewed by pathologists. Applying this framework to 2362 WSIs of breast cancer lymph node metastasis, test on frozen section results in the mean area under the curve (AUC) reached 0.9851. However, the mean misdiagnosis rate (0.0248), was significantly higher than the pathologists' misdiagnosis rate (p < 0.01). The RRCART distinguished more than 80% of the WSIs as a high-accuracy group with an average accuracy reached to 0.995, but the difference with the pathologists' performance was not significant (p > 0.01). However, the other low-accuracy group included most of the misdiagnoses of DNN models. Our research shows that the misdiagnosis from deep learning model can be further enriched by our method, and that the low-accuracy WSIs must be selected for pathologists to review and the high-accuracy ones may be ready for pathologists to give diagnostic reports.

TI  - It's a numbers game: inundative biological control of water hyacinth (<i>Pontederia crassipes</i>), using <i>Megamelus scutellaris</i> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) yields success at a high elevation, hypertrophic reservoir in South Africa
T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Classical biological control of water hyacinth in South Africa has been constrained by cool winter temperatures that limit population growth of the biological control agents, and highly eutrophic waters which enhance plant growth. However, inundative releases of the control agent, Megamelus scutellaris (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), at the Hartbeespoort Dam, South Africa, suggest that water hyacinth can be managed successfully using biological control as a standalone intervention for the first time in the absence of herbicide operations, despite eutrophication and a temperate climate. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to measure the reduction in water hyacinth cover from over 37% to less than 6% over two consecutive years since M. scutellaris was first released on the dam in 2018, while site surveys confirmed a corresponding increase in M. scutellaris population density from fewer than 500 insects/m(2) in October 2019, to more than 6000 insects/m(2) by March 2020. Inundative release strategies are recommended for the control of water hyacinth in South Africa at key stages of its invasion, particularly after winter, and flooding events.

TI  - Discovery of unexpected paternity after direct-to-consumer DNA testing and its impact on identity
T2  - FAMILY RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective In this study, we describe the experiences of individuals who received direct-to-consumer DNA test results indicating unexpected parentage. Background The availability of recreational DNA testing has left individuals navigating unexpected results with limited resources. Little is known about the emotional impact of learning about unexpected paternity. Methods This qualitative study used inductive thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with adults (n = 27; age 40-70 years) who received direct-to-consumer DNA test results revealing unexpected biological paternity. Results Identity transformation occurred while integrating DNA results. Themes included (a) initial discovery marked by shock, fear, crisis, and loss of genetic relatedness; (b) identity exploration encompassing anxiety, emotional challenges, determination to conduct genealogical research, and confronting family; (c) identity reconstruction due to new familial connections and reconciliation of personal and familial history; and (d) synthesis of and shift in worldview, impacting trust in kinship. Conclusion Identity transformation after unexpected DNA results is often accompanied by intense change in personal and community identity and a shift in identity related to race, ethnicity, religion, family status, belonging, or other facets of one's self. Temporal trauma, grief, and loss are common outcomes. Isolation, shame, and a lack of emotional support are prevalent. Implications This research elucidates emotional processes related to learning unexpected DNA results.

TI  - Mixed tropical forests canopy height mapping from spaceborne LiDAR GEDI and multisensor imagery using machine learning models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial mapping of forests canopy height (Hcanopy) provides an opportunity to assess above-ground biomass, net primary productivity, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, biodiversity conservation and forest fire risks. This study incorporated a continuous coverage of multi-spectral optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) along with sparsely global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in the machine learning (ML) models for mapping Hcanopy in the mixed tropical forests of Shoolpaneshwar wildlife sanctuary (SWLS), Gujarat, India. We trained seven ML models, including quantile random forest (QRF), support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian regularization for feed-forward neural networks (BRNN), conditional inference random forest (Cforest), Extreme gradient boosting (Xgbtree), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) using GEDI_02A extracted Hcanopy as training data. We used predictors which were extracted from LiDAR (GEDI metrics), multispectral optical (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), and SAR (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, Sentinel-1). A 10-fold cross-validation (CV) resampling was used to avoid overfitting or underfitting. The comparison of the models performances shows that the BRNN model has the highest satisfactory accuracy metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.686 m, R-squared (R-2) of 0.49 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.66 m. Low training samples of tall canopies (> 25 m), presence of mixed vegetation, geometric and structural variability and sloppy terrain of SWLS possibly restricted models from performing well. Field validation shows an R(2 )of 0.55, satisfactory for mixed tropical forests using spaceborne LiDAR. The present work provides insights into using spaceborne LiDAR GEDI data with optical and SAR data for Hcanopy mapping through ML models, which help to manage SWLS and further implications of forest Hcanopy mapping over large spatial scales.

TI  - Assessing agrometeorological drought trends in Iran during 1985-2018
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to investigate Iran's agrometeorological drought history and its properties using Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI). For this purpose, precipitation and soil moisture recorded at 99 synoptic stations in Iran during 1985 to 2018 were selected. Based on MSDI time series, drought properties including duration and severity were calculated and trend analysis was carried on using Trend Free Prewhitening Mann Kendall test. Also, the standard normal homogeneity test was applied to investigate chronological drought change-point detection. From agrometeorological perspective, results showed that longer and more severe droughts are more dominant in southern, southeastern, northeastern, and some western regions of the country. Trend analysis revealed that most study stations have rising frequency and significant drying trend especially in winter at central plateau and western regions. Also, we recognized two main periods 1991-2000 and 2006-2010 that many stations experienced change-point in their MSDI time series, mainly because of climatic and anthropogenic causes. Drought properties assessment shows 6 stations with serious upward trend in drought duration and severity in northeast and western regions. Sens's Slope statistics in these stations was calculated around 1.5 degree per event for drought severity and 1 month per event for drought duration. It is also observed that the 75th quantile of drought severity for most parts of the country is between 13 and 18 and the 75th quantile for drought duration varies between 8 and 24 months in different regions. The probability analysis revealed that most stations have a ratio around 2-5 times increase in drought occurrence probability after change point, leading to longer and more severe droughts in these stations. The paper indicates a serious situation related to agrometeorological drought occurrence, persistence, and severity in Iran because of many climatic and anthropogenic factors over the last 30 years.

TI  - Estimation of gross primary productivity of Indian Sundarbans mangrove forests using field measurements and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are considered to be one of the vital coastal ecosystems in the world and Sundarbans is one of the largest blocks of mangrove ecosystem. It covers an area of about 1 mha, of which 60% is located in Bangladesh and the remaining 40% lies in India. For sustainable management of mangrove forests, there is a need to study the health of the mangrove vegetation in terms of their productivity. In the present study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance data of 2017-18 over Indian Sundarbans, encompassing three seasons (summer, winter and post-monsoon) were used for computing certain spectral/ vegetation indices. Subsequently, a satellite-based vegetation photosynthesis-light use efficiency model was adopted to estimate Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using the above indices along with in-situ data measured using portable gas exchange system and soil salinity information. The mean GPP value of post monsoon period was found to be higher than the winter and the summer seasons. Furthermore, the mean GPP values were estimated for the different Reserve Forests, islands and localities of Indian Sundarbans. These GPP estimates provide an insight into the mangrove health in terms of their photosynthetic efficiency and carbon sequestration. The reported methodology can be used for estimating primary productivity of other mangrove areas or forests at landscape-level. This study reveals integration of satellite data and in-situ measurements towards assessment of GPP of mangrove forests and thereby serves as one of the major applications in studying mangrove physiology and ecology.

AB  - Diabetes is a systemic disease in which patients with diabetes may develop peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities and peripheral vascular disease due to long-term continuous exposure to high glucose. Delayed wound healing in diabetes is one of the major complications of diabetes. Slow wound healing in diabetic patients is associated with high glucose toxicity. When the condition deteriorates, the patient needs to be amputated, which seriously affects the quality of life and even endangers the life of the patient. In general, the delayed healing of diabetes wound is due to the lack of chemokines, abnormal inflammatory response, lack of angiogenesis and epithelial formation, and fibroblast dysfunction. The incidence of several chronic debilitating conditions is increasing in patients with diabetes, such as chronic renal insufficiency, heart failure, and hepatic insufficiency. Fibrosis is an inappropriate deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It is common in diabetic patients causing organ dysfunction. The fibrotic mechanism of diabetic fibroblasts may involve direct activation of permanent fibroblasts. It may also involve the degeneration of fibers after hyperglycemia stimulates immune cells, vascular cells, or organ-specific parenchymal cells. Numerous studies confirm that fibroblasts play an essential role in treating diabetes and its complications. The primary function of fibroblasts in wound healing is to construct and reshape the ECM. Nowadays, with the widespread use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), an increasing number of studies have found that fibroblasts have become the critical immune sentinel cells, which can detect not only the activation and regulation of immune response but also the molecular pattern related to the injury. By exploring the heterogeneity and functional changes of fibroblasts in diabetes, the manuscript discusses that fibroblasts may be used as immunomodulatory factors in refractory diabetic wound healing, providing new ideas for the treatment of refractory diabetic wound healing.

TI  - Effects of aerosol on terrestrial gross primary productivity in Central Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols significantly contribute to global and regional climate change by altering the surface solar radiation, thereby affecting plant productivity. Central Asia is a primary source of global dust aerosols. However, the mechanisms of how aerosols affect terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), especially in Central Asia, are not clearly understood. In this study, we investigated the spatial variation in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and GPP and the relationship between them during the growing season (April-October) from 2001 to 2018 using remote sensing data from several sources. We created a GWR-SEM model consisting of a geographically weighted model (GWR) coupled with a structural equation model (SEM) to quantify and analyze the effects of AOD on GPP. The results show that AOD decreased slightly at a rate of-0.0002 y(-1) during the study period and that there was a tendency towards spatial aggregation. The extent of AOD pollution in the northwest region (around the Aral Sea) was slightly greater than that in the southeast. GPP increased significantly at a rate of 7.2965 g C m(- 2) y(-2), especially in the northern region. There were some differences in the effects of AOD on GPP between different vegetation types; the highest AOD-GPP correlation was found in shrublands and croplands. Analysis of the GWR-SEM model suggested that AOD and two forms of radiation (surface net radiation, SNR, and photo-synthetically active radiation, PAR) explained 72.4% (63.4% for 2001, 66.8% for 2018) of the spatial variation in GPP. SNR had the greatest effect on GPP, followed by AOD. Diffuse PAR had the greatest indirect effect on GPP. The findings of this study highlight the importance of aerosol pollution on spatial variation in gross primary productivity, and they provide a methodological framework for investigating the relationship between AOD and GPP in arid areas.

TI  - Simulation of Land Surface Temperature Patterns Over Future Urban Areas-A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study attempts to simulate land surface temperature (LST) as a function of built-up density using an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The LST was retrieved from Landsat thermal datasets for years 2000, 2010, and 2019 using a single channel algorithm. The retrieved LST was validated using downscaled MODIS LST products of corresponding dates and an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.3 degrees C and 1.9 degrees C was obtained on winter and summer datasets, respectively. The ANN was trained using corresponding built-up density and LST values for the year 2000, 2010, and 2019. The mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.1 degrees C and 0.7 degrees C was achieved on summer and winter training datasets, respectively, while on summer and winter testing datasets MAE of 1.5 degrees C and 0.9 was obtained. Various urban growth scenarios in the year 2029 were simulated using sim weight which is a nonparametric instance-based machine learning algorithm, based on K nearest neighbour procedure. The simulated built-up densities for the year 2029 were input into the trained ANN and LST patterns for the year 2029 were predicted. Analysis of the results showed that for Dehradun city which is located in a humid subtropical climate zone in India, compact urban growth led to lesser areas having LST greater than 42 degrees C in summers, as compared to other urban growth patterns.

TI  - Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence guide for the use and indications in general surgery: Recommendations based on the descriptive review of the literature and the analysis of experience
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Review
AB  - Indocyanine Green is a fluorescent substance visible in near-infrared light. It is useful for the identification of anatomical structures (biliary tract, ureters, parathyroid, thoracic duct), the tissues vascularization (anastomosis in colorectal, esophageal, gastric, bariatric surgery, for plasties and flaps in abdominal wall surgery, liver resection, in strangulated hernias and in intestinal ischemia), for tumor identification (liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, implants of peritoneal carcinomatosis, retroperitoneal tumors and lymphomas) and sentinel node identification and lymphatic mapping in malignant tumors (stomach, breast, colon, rectum, esophagus and skin cancer). The evidence is very encouraging, although standardization of its use and randomized studies with higher number of patients are required to obtain definitive conclusions on its use in general surgery.The aim of this literature review is to provide a guide for the use of ICG fluorescence in general surgery procedures.

TI  - An original method of analysis of the breast contour curve with 3-dimensional imaging: Case series
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Postoperative assessment of breast reconstruction results has become increasingly important. In this paper, a unique analysis method with 3-dimensional surface images of patients who were treated with immediate breast reconstruction is presented. Patient concerns: Five Japanese women were suspected of having breast cancer and visited our hospital for treatment. Diagnosis: Breast cancer was diagnosed by biopsy, mammography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Interventions: Five patients underwent nipple/skin-sparing mastectomy, concomitant sentinel lymph node biopsy, and immediate breast reconstruction in our hospital. Three cases were reconstructed by extended latissimus dorsi flaps, one was reconstructed by a pedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, and one was reconstructed by a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap. Three-dimensional photographs were taken 1 year postoperatively. The similarity of the breast contours between the reconstructed breast and the nonaffected opposite breast obtained from 3-dimensional images was analyzed. The calculated value is called the breast contour score. Outcomes: No recurrence was observed during the follow-up period in any cases. All cases could be analyzed by breast contour score to evaluate the breast shapes. Conclusion: The scores become a relative value that ranges from 0 (completely different) to 100 (completely the same). By expressing the score as a relative value, the breast contour score could help us understand the degree of breast symmetry more intuitively.

TI  - Multiparametric sea state fields from synthetic aperture radar for maritime situational awareness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a method for estimating a series of sea state parameters from satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The method was realized in a near real time (NRT) application which allows for the processing of data from different satellites and modes. The algorithm estimates the total significant wave height Hs, dominant and secondary swell and windsea wave heights, first, and second moment wave periods, the mean wave period and the period of wind sea. The algorithm was applied to the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (IW), Extra Wide (EW) and Wave Mode (WV) Level-1 (L1) products and also extended to X -band TerraSAR-X (TS-X) StripMap (SM) products. The scenes are processed in raster and result in continuous sea state fields, with the exception of S1 WV, where averaged values for sea state parameters for along-orbit imagettes of 20 km x 20 km are presented. The developed empirical algorithm consists of two parts: a first CWAVE_EX (extended CWAVE) part, based on a linear regression approach, and a subsequent machine learning part using the support vector machine (SVM) technique. A series of new data preparation steps (i.e. filtering, denoising) and new features estimated from SAR images are also introduced. The algorithm was tuned and validated using two independent global wave model hindcasts, WaveWatch-3 and MFWAM as well as National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) measurements. The achieved root mean squared errors (RMSE) for CWAVE_EX for the total Hs are 0.60 m for low-resolution modes S1 IW (10 m pixel) and EW (40 m pixel) and 0.35 m for S1 WV and TS-X SM (pixel spacing ca.1-4 m) in comparison to model predictions. The RMSEs of the retrieved wave periods are in the range of 0.45-0.90 s for all of the satellites and models considered. Similarly, the dominant and secondary swell, and wind sea wave height RMSEs are in the range of 0.35-0.80 m. The SVM postprocessing improves the accuracy of the initial results of CWAVE_EX for Hs and reaches an RMSE of 0.25 m for S1 WV. Comparisons to 64 NDBC buoys, collocated at distances shorter than 50 km to S1 WV imagettes worldwide, result in an RMSE of 0.41 m. All results and the methods presented are novel in terms of the accuracy achieved, combining the classical approach with machine learning techniques, and performing an automatic NRT processing of multiparametric sea state fields from L1 data with automatic switching for different satellites and modes. The complete archive of S1 WV L1 Single Look Complex products from December 2014 until February 2021 was processed to create a sea state parameter database and validated using model hindcast and buoy mea-surements. The derived parameters are available to the public within the scope of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative.

TI  - Maps of cropping patterns in China during 2015-2021
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Multiple cropping is a widespread approach for intensifying crop production through rotations of diverse crops. Maps of cropping intensity with crop descriptions are important for supporting sustainable agricultural management. As the most populated country, China ranked first in global cereal production and the percentages of multiple-cropped land are twice of the global average. However, there are no reliable updated national-scale maps of cropping patterns in China. Here we present the first recent annual 500-m MODIS-based national maps of multiple cropping systems in China using phenology-based mapping algorithms with pixel purity-based thresholds, which provide information on cropping intensity with descriptions of three staple crops (maize, paddy rice, and wheat). The produced cropping patterns maps achieved an overall accuracy of 89% based on ground truth data, and a good agreement with the statistical data (R-2 >= 0.89). The China Cropping Pattern maps (ChinaCP) are available for public download online. Cropping patterns maps in China and other countries with finer resolutions can be produced based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) images using the shared code.

TI  - Reflections on China's primary care response to COVID-19: roles, limitations and implications
T2  - PRIMARY HEALTH CARE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the role of primary care in China's response to COVID-19. A retrospective, reflective approach was taken using data available to one of the authors who led the national community response to COVID-19, first in Wuhan and then multiple cities in ten provinces/municipalities across the country. At the peak of the pandemic, primary care providers shoulder various public health responsibilities and work in close partnerships with other key stakeholders in the local communities. Primary care providers keep playing a 'sentinel'/surveillance role in identifying re-emerging cases after the elimination of community transmissions of COVID-19. Critically, however, the pandemic once again highlights some key limitations of the primary care sector, including the lack of gatekeeping, limited capacity and weak integration between medical care and public health.

T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, several factors, such as improved hand hygiene, social distancing, and restricted hospital referral, may have had an influence on the epidemiology of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). Methods The annual CDI incidence rate of nine hospitals participating in the Dutch sentinel CI surveillance with complete data was compared between 2020 and the previous five surveillance years. Trends in characteristics of hos-pitalised CDI patients in 21-24 participating hospitals were compared between the first (March 13-May 12, 2020) or second Dutch COVID-19 wave (September 17, 2020-January 1, 2021) and the same calendar periods in 2015 through 2019. All analyses were adjusted for trend changes over time. Findings The annual CDI incidence rate in 2020 was lower compared to previous years. During the second wave, the percentage of CDI patients with severe CDI was higher compared to earlier (25.8% in 2020 vs 17.9% in 2015-2019 (RR 1.6; 95%CI 1.1-2.3)). After adjustment for delayed C. difficile diagnostics (>= 8 days from start symptoms), the increase disappeared. Delayed C. difficile diagnostics was indeed more common during the second wave (RR 1.7; 95%CI 1.1-2.6), but only for community-onset CDI (CO-CDI). Interpretation This study shows that a higher percentage of severe CDI cases was observed during the second COVID-19 wave. This may partially be caused by delayed diagnostics, potentially due to decreased visits to a physi-cian or restricted hospital referral for CO-CDI patients. Funding Dutch ministry of Health.

TI  - Modeling discrete choices with large fine-scale spatial data: opportunities and challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrete choice models have played a pivotal role in modeling spatial & regional systems in the past few decades. Various extensions for the classic discrete choice models have been developed, including spatial discrete choice models and dynamic discrete choice models. The two categories of models represent methodological developments in the spatial dimension and the temporal dimension of spatial data modeling, respectively. With the growing availability of spatial data in large and more refined scales, spatial and dynamic discrete choice modeling techniques face methodological and computational challenges. By comparing different existing estimation methods, we show that the Bayesian MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) method is the most computationally efficient estimation method for explicitly modeling the spatial relationships with large data sets. As far as dynamic discrete choice models are concerned, most of the existing research effort focuses on improving the model performance in capturing the inter-temporal structures of decision making. In addition, there is an anticipated need to integrate the spatial dimension and the temporal dimension in spatial data modeling. It will require (1) effective solutions to address the computational challenges; and (2) theoretical and methodological innovations in characterizing spatial data processes. We also discussed opportunities and challenges related to empirical analysis with spatial big data, including reviewing several open-source software packages for estimating spatial discrete choice models. Lacking continuous development support and limited applicability are the main issues that prevent them from being widely used.

TI  - Identification of the lymph node metastasis-related automated breast volume scanning features for predicting axillary lymph node tumor burden of invasive breast cancer <i>via</i> a clinical prediction model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer has become the malignant tumor with the highest incidence in women. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is an effective method of maintaining regional control; however, it is associated with a significant risk of complications. Meanwhile, whether the patients need ALND or not is according to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, the false-negative results of SLNB had been reported. Automated breast volume scanning (ABVS) is a routine examination in breast cancer. A real-world cohort consisting of 245 breast cancer patients who underwent ABVS examination were enrolled, including 251 tumor lesions. The ABVS manifestations were analyzed with the SLNB results, and the ALND results for selecting the lymph node metastasis were related to ABVS features. Finally, a nomogram was used to construct a breast cancer axillary lymph node tumor burden prediction model. Breast cancer patients with a molecular subtype of luminal B type, a maximum lesion diameter of >= 5 cm, tumor invasion of the Cooper's ligament, and tumor invasion of the nipple had heavy lymph node tumor burden. Molecular classification, tumor size, and Cooper's ligament status were used to construct a clinical prediction model of axillary lymph node tumor burden. The consistency indexes (or AUC) of the training cohort and the validation cohort were 0.743 and 0.711, respectively, which was close to SLNB (0.768). The best cutoff value of the ABVS nomogram was 81.146 points. After combination with ABVS features and SLNB, the AUC of the prediction model was 0.889, and the best cutoff value was 178.965 points. The calibration curve showed that the constructed nomogram clinical prediction model and the real results were highly consistent. The clinical prediction model constructed using molecular classification, tumor size, and Cooper's ligament status can effectively predict the probability of heavy axillary lymph node tumor burden, which can be the significant supplement to the SLNB. Therefore, this model may be used for individual decision-making in the diagnosis and treatments of breast cancer.

TI  - Developing wipe sampling strategy guidance for assessing environmental contamination of antineoplastic drugs
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PHARMACY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Surveillance for environmental contamination of antineoplastic drugs has been recommended by authoritative bodies such as the United States Pharmacopeia and the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities. Clear guidance is needed on how to develop sampling strategies that align with surveillance objectives efficiently and effectively. We conducted a series of simulations using previously collected surveillance data from nine cancer treatment centers to evaluate different sampling strategies. We evaluated the impact of sampling 2, 5, 10, or 20 surfaces, at monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual frequencies, while employing either a random or sentinel surface selection strategy to assess contamination by a single antineoplastic drug (AD) or by a panel of three ADs. We applied two different benchmarks: a binary benchmark of above or below the limit of detection and AD-specific hygienic guidance values, based on 90th percentile values as quantitative benchmarks. The use of sentinel surfaces to evaluate a three-drug panel relative to 90th percentile hygienic guidance values (HGVs) resulted in the most efficient and effective surveillance strategy.

TI  - Using deep convolutional neural networks to forecast spatial patterns of Amazonian deforestation
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1.Tropical forests are subject to diverse deforestation pressures while their conservation is essential to achieve global climate goals. Predicting the location of deforestation is challenging due to the complexity of the natural and human systems involved but accurate and timely forecasts could enable effective planning and on-the-ground enforcement practices to curb deforestation rates. New computer vision technologies based on deep learning can be applied to the increasing volume of Earth observation data to generate novel insights and make predictions with unprecedented accuracy. 2. Here, we demonstrate the ability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatiotemporal patterns of deforestation from a limited set of freely available global data layers, including multispectral satellite imagery, the Hansen maps of annual forest change (2001-2020) and the ALOS PALSAR digital surface model, to forecast deforestation (2021). We designed four model architectures, based on 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs, and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to produce spatial maps that indicate the risk to each forested pixel (similar to 30 m) in the landscape of becoming deforested within the next year. They were trained and tested on data from two similar to 80,000 km(2) tropical forest regions in the Southern Peruvian Amazon. 3. The networks could predict the location of future forest loss to a high degree of accuracy (F-1 = 0.58-0.71). Our best performing model (3D CNN) had the highest pixel-wise accuracy (F-1 = 0.71) when validated on 2020 forest loss (2014-2019 training). Visual interpretation of the mapped forecasts indicated that the network could automatically discern the drivers of forest loss from the input data. For example, pixels around new access routes (e.g. roads) were assigned high risk, whereas this was not the case for recent, concentrated natural loss events (e.g. remote landslides). 4. Convolutional neural networks can harness limited time-series data to predict near-future deforestation patterns, an important step in harnessing the growing volume of satellite remote sensing data to curb global deforestation. The modelling framework can be readily applied to any tropical forest location and used by governments and conservation organisations to prevent deforestation and plan protected areas.

TI  - Multi-sensor spectral synergies for crop stress detection and monitoring in the optical domain: A review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote detection and monitoring of the vegetation responses to stress became relevant for sustainable agri-culture. Ongoing developments in optical remote sensing technologies have provided tools to increase our un-derstanding of stress-related physiological processes. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview of the main spectral technologies and retrieval approaches for detecting crop stress in agriculture. Firstly, we present integrated views on: i) biotic and abiotic stress factors, the phases of stress, and respective plant responses, and ii) the affected traits, appropriate spectral domains and corresponding methods for measuring traits remotely. Secondly, representative results of a systematic literature analysis are highlighted, identifying the current status and possible future trends in stress detection and monitoring. Distinct plant responses occurring under short-term, medium-term or severe chronic stress exposure can be captured with remote sensing due to specific light interaction processes, such as absorption and scattering manifested in the reflected radiance, i.e. visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared, and emitted radiance, i.e. solar-induced fluorescence and thermal infrared (TIR). From the analysis of 96 research papers, the following trends can be observed: increasing usage of satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle data in parallel with a shift in methods from simpler parametric ap-proaches towards more advanced physically-based and hybrid models. Most study designs were largely driven by sensor availability and practical economic reasons, leading to the common usage of VIS-NIR-TIR sensor com-binations. The majority of reviewed studies compared stress proxies calculated from single-source sensor do-mains rather than using data in a synergistic way. We identified new ways forward as guidance for improved synergistic usage of spectral domains for stress detection: (1) combined acquisition of data from multiple sensors for analysing multiple stress responses simultaneously (holistic view); (2) simultaneous retrieval of plant traits combining multi-domain radiative transfer models and machine learning methods; (3) assimilation of estimated plant traits from distinct spectral domains into integrated crop growth models. As a future outlook, we recom-mend combining multiple remote sensing data streams into crop model assimilation schemes to build up Digital Twins of agroecosystems, which may provide the most efficient way to detect the diversity of environmental and biotic stresses and thus enable respective management decisions.

TI  - Bedrock depth influences spatial patterns of summer baseflow, temperature and flow disconnection for mountainous headwater streams
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountain headwater streams, the quality and resilience of summer cold-water habitat is generally regulated by stream discharge, longitudinal stream channel connectivity and groundwater exchange. These critical hydrologic processes are thought to be influenced by the stream corridor bedrock contact depth (sediment thickness), a parameter often inferred from sparse hillslope borehole information, piezometer refusal and remotely sensed data. To investigate how local bedrock depth might control summer stream temperature and channel disconnection (dewatering) patterns, we measured stream corridor bedrock depth by collecting and interpreting 191 passive seismic datasets along eight headwater streams in Shenandoah National Park (Virginia, USA). In addition, we used multi-year stream temperature and streamflow records to calculate several baseflow-related metrics along and among the study streams. Finally, comprehensive visual surveys of stream channel dewatering were conducted in 2016, 2019 and 2021 during summer low flow conditions (124 total km of stream length). We found that measured bedrock depths along the study streams were not well-characterized by soils maps or an existing global-scale geologic dataset where the latter overpredicted measured depths by 12.2 m (mean) or approximately four times the average bedrock depth of 2.9 m. Half of the eight study stream corridors had an average bedrock depth of less than 2 m. Of the eight study streams, Staunton River had the deepest average bedrock depth (3.4 m), the coldest summer temperature profiles and substantially higher summer baseflow indices compared to the other study steams. Staunton River also exhibited paired air and water annual temperature signals suggesting deeper groundwater influence, and the stream channel did not dewater in lower sections during any baseflow survey. In contrast, Paine Run and Piney River did show pronounced, patchy channel dewatering, with Paine Run having dozens of discrete dry channel sections ranging from 1 to greater than 300 m in length. Stream dewatering patterns were apparently influenced by a combination of discrete deep bedrock (20+ m) features and more subtle sediment thickness variation (1-4 m) depending on local stream valley hydrogeology. In combination, these unique datasets show the first large-scale empirical support for existing conceptual models of headwater stream disconnection based on spatially variable underflow capacity and shallow groundwater supply.

TI  - Central European 2018 hot drought shifts scots pine forest to its tipping point
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of hot drought, i.e. low water availability and simultaneous high air temperature, represents a severe threat to ecosystems. Here, we investigated how the 2018 hot drought in Central Europe caused a tipping point in tree and ecosystem functioning in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest in southwest Germany. Measurements of stress indicators, such as needle water potential, carbon assimilation and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, of dominant P. sylvestris trees were deployed to evaluate tree functioning during hot drought. Ecosystem impact and recovery were assessed as ecosystem carbon exchange, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from satellite data and tree mortality data. During summer 2018, needle water potentials of trees dropped to minimum values of -7.5 +/- 0.2 MPa, which implied severe hydraulic impairment of P. sylvestris. Likewise, carbon assimilation and VOC emissions strongly declined after mid-July. Decreasing NDVI values from August 2018 onwards were detected, along with severe defoliation in P. sylvestris, impairing ecosystem carbon flux recovery in 2019, shifting the forest into a year-round carbon source. A total of 47% of all monitored trees (n = 368) died by September 2020. NDVI recovered to pre-2018 levels in 2019, likely caused by emerging broadleaved understorey species. The 2018 hot drought had severe negative impacts on P. sylvestris. The co-occurrence of unfavourable site-specific conditions with recurrent severe droughts resulted in accelerated mortality. Thus, the 2018 hot drought pushed the P. sylvestris stand towards its tipping point, with a subsequent vegetation shift to a broadleaf-dominated forest.

TI  - Unsupervised domain adaptation for global urban extraction using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date maps of built-up areas are crucial to support sustainable urban development. Earth Observation (EO) is a valuable data source to cover this demand. In particular, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) missions offer new opportunities to map built-up areas on a global scale. Using Sentinel-2 images, recent urban mapping efforts achieved promising results by training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on available built-up data. However, these results strongly depend on the availability of local reference data for fully supervised training or assume that the application of CNNs to unseen areas (i.e. across-region generalization) produces satisfactory results. To alleviate these short-comings, it is desirable to leverage Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) algorithms that can take advantage of un-labeled data, especially because satellite data is plentiful. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) approach using SSL that jointly exploits Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI to improve across-region generalization for built-up area mapping. Specifically, two identical sub-networks are incorporated into the proposed model to perform built-up area segmentation from SAR and optical images separately. Assuming that consistent built-up area segmentation should be obtained across data modality, we design an unsupervised loss for unlabeled data that penalizes inconsistent segmentation from the two sub-networks. Therefore, we propose to use complementary data modalities as real-world perturbations for consistency regularization. For the final prediction, the model takes both data modalities into account. Experiments conducted on a test set comprised of sixty representative sites across the world showed that the proposed DA approach achieves strong improvements (F1 score 0.694) over fully supervised learning from Sentinel-1 SAR data (F1 score 0.574), Sentinel-2 MSI data (F1 score 0.580) and their input-level fusion (F1 score 0.651). To demonstrate the effectiveness of DA, we also performed a comparison with two state-of-the-art products, namely GHS-BUILT-S2 and WSF 2019, on the test set. The comparison showed that our model is capable of producing built-up area maps with comparable or even better quality than the state-of-the-art global human settlement maps. Therefore, the multi-modal DA offers great potential to be adapted to produce easily updateable human settlements maps at a global scale.

TI  - Advanced separation and classification of ionospheric troughs in midnight conditions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a novel approach to separate and classify different ionospheric troughs from CHAMP satellite data in the winter midnight ionosphere of the southern hemisphere at high solar activity (2000-2002). The main ionospheric trough (MIT) was separated from the high latitude trough (HLT). The separation was performed through an analysis of troughs in the frame of a model of the diffuse auroral particle precipitation. Two types of HLT were distinguished. In the mid-latitude ionosphere, the MIT was separated from the ring ionospheric trough (RIT), which is formed by the decay processes of the magnetospheric ring current. The separation was performed on the basis of an analysis of the prehistory of all geomagnetic disturbances for the period under study. In addition, a decrease in the electron density, which is superimposed on the MIT and masks its minimum position, is quite often observed at American and Atlantic longitudes near the Polar Circle.

TI  - Spatial-temporal dynamics of alpine grassland coverage and its response to climate warming in Mt. Qomolangma Nature Preserve during 2000-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has the largest and highest alpine grassland ecosystem in the world, which is considered to be the most sensitive and vulnerable ecosystem to climate change. Its dynamic changes and driving mechanism have always been widely researched. The Qomolangma National Nature Preserve (QNNP), with the largest altitude difference in the world, was selected as the study area to analyse the spatial-temporal dynamics of grassland coverage and the different characteristics of elevation gradients at the southern slope (SS) and northern slope (NS) with MODIS MOD13Q1 NDVI and MOD11A2 land surface temperature data from 2000 to 2019 using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Theil-Sen slope methods. Further, the response mechanism of grassland coverage to climate warming is discussed. The results revealed that from 2000 to 2019, the grassland coverage change in the study area is mainly stable. The increased area proportion of grassland coverage on the southern slope is significantly higher than that on the northern slope, and the decreased area proportion of grassland coverage on the northern slope is significantly greater than that on the southern slope. The change characteristics of grassland coverage in the QNNP exhibit an obvious elevation gradient; the higher the elevation, the greater the increased area proportion of grassland coverage, particularly on the SS. The land surface temperature can be used as a proxy for analysing the temporal and spatial variation trends of air temperature in the QNNP. With the increase of the altitude, the land surface temperature rise rate on both the southern slope and northern slope exhibited an increasing trend, and the sensitivity of grassland coverage to temperature rise was higher on the northern slope. The water condition was the decisive factor for the horizontal and vertical spatial heterogeneity of the dynamic change of grassland coverage, and the melting of glaciers and thawing of permafrost were important sources of water for grassland growth in the QNNP. Climate warming promotes the growth of grassland in areas with a sufficient water supply, but adversely affects the growth of grassland in areas with insufficient water supplies, which will be further intensified by human activities.

TI  - Revealing four decades of snow cover dynamics in the Hindu Kush Himalaya
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the distribution and dynamics of seasonal snow cover (SSC) is of high importance for climate studies, hydrology or hazards assessment. SSC varies considerably across the Hindu Kush Himalaya both in space and time. Previous studies focused on regional investigations or the influence of snow melt on the local hydrological system. Here, we present a systematic assessment of metrics to evaluate SSC dynamics for the entire HKH at regional and basin scale based on AVHRR GAC data at a 0.05 degrees spatial and daily temporal resolution. Our findings are based on a unique four-decade satellite-based time series of snow cover information. We reveal strong variability of SSC at all time scales. We find significantly decreasing SSC trends in individual summer and winter months and a declining tendency from mid-spring to mid-fall, indicating a shift in seasonality. Thanks to this uniquely spatio-temporally resolved long-term data basis, we can particularly highlight the unique temporally variable character of seasonal snow cover and its cross-disciplinary importance for mountain ecosystems and downstream regions.

T2  - NEW ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radial velocity (RV) data from Lu et al. (2001) were combined with light curve (LC) data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in an integrated Wilson-Devinney analysis to yield fundamental parameters. Obtained were masses M-1 = 0.526 (5), M-circle dot, and M-2 = 1.063 (7) M-circle dot, stellar radii R-1 = 0.65 (2) R-circle dot, and R-2 = 0.90 (1) R-circle dot, and luminosities L1 = 0.40 (4) L-circle dot and L-2 = 0.62 (5) L-circle dot. These are in reasonable agreement with the values from Hill et al. (1989). Additional analyses were carried out also using the same RV data but substituting, in turn, the LC datasets of Binnendijk (1955), Duerbeck (1978), Robb and Milone (1982) and Genet et al. (1982). While the four Earthbound LC datasets were of much lower precision than the satellite data, they still yielded reasonable agreement in the final parameters. Additionally, they yielded some insight as to the behaviour of the dark spot (on star 1) over some 75 years. The B and V light curve data of Duerbeck (1978) suggested that the unresolved companion is hot. An updated period study originally presented in Nelson et al. (2014) but now with a Light Time Effect (LiTE) fit is presented. Fifteen new times of minimum from the TESS data were added, requiring only a modest refinement of the LiTE parameters. The intrinsic rate of period change (that is, with the LiTE component removed) is dP/dt = 1.80 (20) x 10(-7) seconds/year. If dP/dt can be attributed to conservative mass exchange, the rate would be dM(1)/dt = -2.33 (26) x 10(-7) M-circle dot/year. When the fundamental parameters for each star were added to the Log L vs Log T plot for EW-type binaries from Yakut and Eggleton (2005), the results suggested that star 1 of the W-type binary is under-luminous, while the cooler but larger secondary is somewhat evolved. Both are in a marginal contact, typical of W-type eclipsing binaries.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Correlation Analysis was carried out in this study by considering Pearson Correlation Methodology for the Land Surface Temperature (LST). In this different Spectral Indices such as Normalised Difference Urban Index(NDBI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI) and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) were carried out for correlation on Landsat-8 (TIRS and OLI)data of three seasons in one calendar year. The Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification done following on-screen visual interpretation technique using Sentinel-2A and 2B satellite data for the comparison of LST. The LST variation on LULC depends upon the surface type of the classes. Some classes like the built-up area and the bare land supports the increase of LST where as the Vegetation cover and the water body classes reduce the LST values. It is concluded that the NDBI shows a positive correlation with LST i.e. R-2 = 0.985, 0.986 & 0.973 in January, April and October, 2018 irrespective of the seasons. In case of NDVI and NDWI negative correlation observed i.e., R-2 = 0.940, 0.914, 0.977 and 0.934, 0.886, 0.95 for all three seasons respectively. NDVI reveals a seasonal vegetation effect upon the correlation with LST as we can observe R-2 = 0.914 in summer season. Also the case with NDWI whose R-2 value is strongly correlated when compared to other seasons i.e., 0.977 in the month of October. Study revealing that the scatter plot and the R coefficient played a vital role in examining and retrieving the correlation results. The rising temperature is the causative factor for global warming, vector borne diseases and ecological changes, etc.on Earth. LST can best be studied using different wavelength regions of satellite data products in urban areas for human comforts.

This paper will argue that the problem with The Crown's montage is that it represents Maori and the hake in exoticising, othering, and demeaning ways. Drawing on a range of theories, this paper will use Kia Manawanui-a Kaupapa Maori framework for analysing film texts-to critique the montage in The Crown. This paper also argues that consultation with an expert in Maori culture and Kaupapa Maori filmmaking would have been necessary for The Crown to avoid representing Maori and the hake disparagingly.

TI  - Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept fails to detect sentinel lymph nodes in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept is a synthetic radiotracer specifically designed for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping that has been FDA-approved in breast cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. No published studies exist for the use of this radiotracer in endometrial cancer. Objective: The primary objective was to determine the detection rate of bilateral SLNs in endometrial cancer with the concurrent use of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept and ICG. Methods: An open-label, single cohort, prospective feasibility study was conducted with participants receiving preoperative cervical injections of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept followed by subsequent imaging and SPECT/CT. Intraoperative ICG injections were administered for all patients with near-infrared imaging used to visualize lymphatic vessels and nodes. A laparoscopic gamma counter was used to detect radioactive SLN intraoperatively. Results: All six evaluated patients had FIGO grade 1 or 2 endometrioid histology. Stage IA/IB were in 33% and 66% of patients, respectively. Tilmanocept did not map any SLN in the first six patients but instead showed retention of the tracer in the cervical stroma, leading to study discontinuation for futility. ICG mapped bilateral SLN in all patients with the most common location being the external iliac region, followed by the obturator and common iliac areas. All patients had CD206 positive staining throughout the full wall thickness of ectocervix, transformation zone, endocervix, and lymphatic vessels. No patients experienced adverse events. Conclusion: Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept did not detect SLN in early stage endometrial cancers and is unlikely to improve bilateral detection rate compared to ICG alone. ICG remains a standard technique for SLN detection in low stage, low grade endometrial cancer.

TI  - Convolutional neural network model for discrimination of harmful algal bloom (HAB) from non-HABs using Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal bloom (HAB) caused by Magalefidinium polykrikoides becomes frequent in Korean coastal waters during the mid-1990s and is now annual events on the southern coast of Korea. HAB often leads to high rates of fish mortality and subsequent economic losses in aquaculture. In addition, non-harmful algal blooms (non-HABs) caused by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium sp., Mesodinium rubrum, and the diatom Skeletonema sp. occur simul-taneously in time and space. Because HAB and non-HABs are difficult to discriminate using multi-band satellite data, most previous studies have attempted only detection or qualitative classification with limited data. In contrast, in this current study, we aimed to quantitatively discriminate M. polykrikoides bloom associated HAB from non-HABs around the southern coast of Korea using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) imagery with a spatial resolution of 300 m and 16 spectral bands for the first time. To identify the effect of non-HAB patches on the performance of the CNN model, five CNN models were trained with OLCI images as input and ground-truth HAB maps as output data. The appropriate figure-of-merits values (FOMs) with sensitivity of 0.53, precision of 0.92, and F-measure of 0.67 were reasonable when the CNN model trained using the dataset with the highest ratio of non-HABs patches was applied to HAB images. Even when non-HAB images were applied to the models, the CNN model exhibited the lowest error pixel count. Therefore, we confirmed that the CNN model, which can discriminate red tide blooms with subtle dif-ferences between the spectrum bands and spatial characteristics, helps solve the complexity and ambiguity in discriminating HAB from non-HABs.

TI  - Novel variant Hendra virus genotype 2 infection in a horse in the greater Newcastle region, New South Wales, Australia
T2  - ONE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In October 2021, the first contemporary detection of Hendra virus genotype 2 (HeV-g2) was made by veterinary priority disease investigation in a horse near Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, as part of routine veterinary priority disease surveillance.This discovery followed an update of Hendra virus diagnostic assays following retrospective identification of this variant from 2015 via sentinel emerging in-fectious disease research, enabling timely detection of this case. The sole infected horse was euthanized in moribund condition. As the southernmost recognised HeV spill-over detection to date, it extends the southern limit of known cases by approximately 95 km. The event occurred near a large urban centre, characterised by equine populations of diverse type, husbandry, and purpose, with low HeV vaccination rates.Urgent multi-agency outbreak response involved risk assessment and monitoring of 11 exposed people and biosecurity management of at-risk animals. No human or additional animal cases were recognised.This One Health investigation highlights need for research on risk perception and strategic engagement to support owners confronted with the death of companion animals and potential human exposure to a high consequence virus. The location and timing of this spill-over event diverging from that established for prototype HeV (HeV-g1), highlight benefit in proactive One Health surveillance and research activities that improve understanding of dynamic transmission and spill-over risks of both HeV genotypic lineages and related but divergent emerging pathogens.

TI  - What Do Nonreligious Nonbelievers Believe in? Secular Worldviews Around the World
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global increase in nonreligious individuals begs for a better understanding of what nonreligious beliefs and worldviews actually entail. Rather than assuming an absence of belief or imposing a predetermined set of beliefs, this research uses an open-ended approach to investigate which secular beliefs and worldviews nonreligious nontheistic individuals in 10 countries around the world might endorse. Approximately, one thousand participants were recruited (N = 996; approximately 100 participants per country) and completed the online survey. A data-driven coding scheme of the open-ended question about the participants' beliefs and worldviews was created and includes 51 categories in 11 supercategories (agency and control, collaboration and peace, equality and kindness, morality, natural laws and the here and now, nonreligiosity, reflection and acceptance, science and critical thinking, spirituality, truth, and other). The 10 most frequently mentioned categories were science, humanism, critical skepticism, natural laws, equality, kindness and caring, care for the earth, left-wing political causes, atheism, and individualism and freedom. Patterns of beliefs were explored, demonstrating three worldview belief sets: scientific worldviews, humanist worldviews, and caring nature-focused worldviews. This project is a timely data-driven exploration of the content and range of global secular worldviews around the world and matches previous theoretical work. Future research may utilize these data and findings to construct more comprehensive surveys to be completed in additional countries.

TI  - Inversion of the hybrid machine learning model to estimate leaf area index of winter wheat from GaoFen-6 WFV imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important agroecological physiological parameter affecting vegetation growth and is an essential indicator for estimating crop growth. To apply the hybrid machine learning model to the remote sensing inversion of winter wheat LAI at three growth stages based on the wide field of view (WFV) of the GaoFen-6 (GF-6 WFV) images, the Xiangfu District in the east of Kaifeng City, Henan Province, was selected as the testing region. The LAI values, which were simulated using the CERES-wheat model, were an input for the PROSAIL model to simulate spectral reflectance. Different machine learning regression algorithms (MLRA) were trained with simulated spectra reflectance by PROSAIL and subsequently applied to the GF-6 WFV reflectance spectra. The random forest regression (RFR) model achieved reliable LAI estimates at the three growth stages. CERES-wheat and PROSAIL preserved the most informative spectra reflectance for LAI estimation so that each RFR could achieve satisfactory estimation results. The hybrid machine learning model could accurately reverse the growth state of winter wheat in three growth stages.

TI  - Extracting deforming landslides from time-series Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting landslide precursors early is crucial for mitigating regional landslide hazards. Yet, it is challenging to recognize true regional surface deformation among abundant background noises. Previous work has been focused on the detection of already-known landslide precursors or retrospective deformation of landslides. We proposed a new method to extract deforming landslides from background noise by using time-series Sentinel-2 images. The method is tested along a section of the Jinsha River in southwest China. First, we selected 104 clear images from 412 Sentinel-2 images December 2018 to October 2021 to compose 141 image pairs. Second, we derived three clusters of cumulative deformations starting from December 2018 with approximately 1-year interval. Third, we used linear regression models to fit cumulative deformations and calculated the p-values for each pixel. Finally, we used the low p-value (p = 0.0005) as a threshold to suppress background noises. The proposed method is very efficient to eliminate almost all background noise and isolate deforming landslides. Application of this method enables extraction of landslide precursors over large mountain regions.

TI  - Comparison and evaluation of multiple satellite aerosol products over China in different scenarios under a unified criterion: Preparation for consistent and high-quality dataset construction
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) products provided by satellite sensors are widely used in climate modeling and climate change research. However, inconsistencies between products can cause large biases. It is necessary to integrate multiple satellite aerosol products to produce a consistent and high-quality aerosol record that satisfies the requirements of climate research users. To effectively combine the advantages of different datasets, their performance under different conditions needs to be compared during overlapping periods using uniform methods and criteria. Based on Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements from 2019 to 2021, this study is the first to systematically compare the accuracy of 16 publicly released products from multiple satellite sensors in China under various scenarios using the same criteria to support the construction of a harmonized and highquality dataset. Compared with AERONET AOD, the average retrieval percentage of 16 products satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) accuracy requirement is 26.51%, with MISR and VIIRS Deep Blue (DB) products exceeding 40%, while MODIS 3 km Dark Target (DT), VIIRS DT, VIIRS Enterprise Processing System (EPS), and Sentinel-3 products are below 20%. By quantifying the accuracy of the products under different surface conditions, aerosol loadings, and particle size types, the accuracy ranking matrix of 16 products under different scenarios is established to provide a priori knowledge for the construction of a merged dataset. Finally, AOD products from October 2020 are merged based on the accuracy ranking matrix. The merged results show that, compared to the commonly used MODIS DT product, the percentage of retrievals satisfying GCOS requirement is improved by 22.55%, the correlation coefficient and mean absolute error are also improved, and the national average AOD coverage increases from 22.18% to 47.73%. These results are expected to provide guidance for the construction of high-quality datasets and the application of satellite aerosol products in climate research.

TI  - Livelihood, carbon and spatiotemporal land-use land-cover change in the Yenku forest reserve of Ghana, 2000-2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are important sources of securing basic human needs (livelihoods) for both the deprived and well-endowed but are also critical for reducing metric tonnes of carbon (tC) emitted from deforestation and land degradation. However, inequalities of human population and land-use land-cover change (LULCC) are existential threats to sustainable tropical forest reserve management and their aboveground biomass carbon stock (AGBCS) in Africa. This study examines the extent of LULCC, AGBCS and perception of livelihood effects on the Yenku Forest Reserve (YFR) in the Central Region of Ghana. Google Earth Engine remotely sensed Landsat data analysis using supervised classification, change detection, mixed with qualitative data from individual in-depth in-terviews and focus group discussions with inhabitants were used. The overall classification accuracy was 89.1%, 90.8% and 89.8% for the LULC in 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. Farming, charcoal production, hunting and harvesting non-timber forest products were the main livelihood activities impacting LULCC and AGBCS in the reserve. Open degraded forest was estimated at 1627ha, 1764ha, 1784ha out of 2293ha, corresponding to 36,349.6tC, 39,395.70tC, 39,840.0tC respectively in 2000, 2010 and 2020. Dense degraded forest cover yielded the least carbon stock of 938.6tC compared to 39,840.0tC from less dense degraded forest cover. These findings would aid policy decisions toward achieving United Nations land degradation neutrality and sustainable development goals (SDGs) one, ten and fifteen while ensuring YFR sustainability. Deprived forest-fringe com-munities, traditional authorities and other relevant stakeholders need to actively adopt gendered livelihood objectives to achieve SDGs, carbon and land degradation neutralities within YFR.

TI  - Estimating soil available water capacity within a Mediterranean vineyard watershed using satellite imagery and crop model inversion
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil available water capacity (SAWC) is a key factor to be considered when assessing soil capability to provide ecosystem services. The current study deepens the use of remotely sensed data for mapping SAWC and its components from crop model inversion. The inversion was conducted using the STICS (Simulateur mulTI-discplinaire pour les Cultures Standard) crop model along with the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) algorithm on a panel of 14 sites within a rainfed vineyard catchment located in Southern France. Several constraint variables derived from Landsat 7 ETM + satellite imagery (leaf area index -LAI -and evapotranspiration -ET) or in-situ measurements (surface soil moisture -SSM), were used in the inversion process alone or in combination. Three main outcomes could be reported when comparing retrievals of both SAWC and its components against field estimates. First, retrievals were significantly correlated with ground estimates for some SAWC components and some scenarios of constraint variables, although overall retrieving performances were quite poor. Second, poor retrieving performances for two scenarios of constraint variables were related to few sites for which specific processes were disregarded by the modelling framework, namely allochthonous water supply and waterlogging during wet autumn and summer. Third, we could identify some promising combinations of constraint variables, after the removal of the aforementioned sites with specific processes. These promising combinations were (LAI, ET) and even more (LAI, ET, SSM) for estimating SAWC and root zone thickness, as well as SSM for estimating soil moistures at field capacity and wilting point of the topsoil layer. Provided we can avoid site-specific processes, our approach may further provide spatial sampling of SAWC and related components, to be used as surrogate input data for DSM models.

TI  - Deep learning for estimating pavement roughness using synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the high costs of ground-based pavement condition methods used to monitor pavement condition, transportation agencies often limit distress surveys to their major roads. As a result, the condition of local and ancillary roads remains unknown to decision-makers. This study addresses this gap by exploring the capabilities of publicly available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate pavement roughness. This paper introduces a novel framework to address the challenges of using SAR images in evaluating pavement condition. The trunk highway network in Minnesota is analyzed to develop deep learning models that predict International Roughness Index (IRI) and associated prediction intervals. This analysis found that SAR images have a strong potential in quantifying pavement condition. The deep learning models were able to predict IRI with a mean absolute error of 14.6 in./miles and provide intervals of pavement condition that capture actual IRI values with an accuracy of 81%.

TI  - Surge dynamics of Shisper Glacier revealed by time-series correlation of optical satellite images and their utility to substantiate a generalized sliding law
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding fast ice flow is key to assessing the future of glaciers. Fast ice flow is controlled by sliding at the bed, yet that sliding is poorly understood. A growing number of studies show the relationship between sliding and basal shear stress transitions from an initially rate-strengthening behavior to a rate-independent or rate-weakening behavior. Studies that have tested a glacier sliding law with data remain rare. Surging glaciers, as we show in this study, can be used as a natural laboratory to inform sliding laws because a single glacier shows extreme velocity variations at a subannual timescale. The present study has two main goals: (1) we introduce a new workflow to produce velocity maps with a high spatiotemporal resolution from remote-sensing data, combining Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) and using the results to describe the recent surge of Shisper Glacier, and (2) we present a generalized sliding law and substantiate the sliding-law behavior using the remote sensing dataset. The quality and spatiotemporal resolution of the velocity time series allow us to identify a gradual amplification of spring speed-up velocities in the 2 years leading up to the surge that started in November 2017. We also find that surface velocity patterns during the surge can be decomposed into three main phases, and each phase appears to be associated with hydraulic changes. Using this dataset, we are able to highlight the rate-independent and rate-weakening relationships between resistive stress and sliding during the surge. We then discuss the importance of the generalized sliding relationship to reconcile observations of fast ice flow, and in particular, different surge behaviors. The approach used in this study remains qualitative, but if coupled with better bed-elevation data and numerical modeling could lead to the widespread quantification of sliding-law parameters.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a standard staging procedure for cutaneous melanoma. Regional disease control is a clinically important therapeutic goal of surgical intervention, including nodal surgery.OBJECTIVE To determine how frequently SLN biopsy without completion lymph node dissection (CLND) results in long-term regional nodal disease control in patients with SLN metastases.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II), a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial, randomized participants with SLN metastases to either CLND or nodal observation. The current analysis examines observation patients with regard to regional nodal recurrence. Trial patients were aged 18 to 75 years with melanoma metastatic to SLN(s). Data were collected from December 2004 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from July 2020 to January 2022.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-basin nodal recurrence.RESULTS Of 823 included patients, 479 (58.2%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 52.8 (13.8) years. Among 855 observed basins, at 10 years, 80.2% (actuarial; 95% CI, 77-83) of basins were free of nodal recurrence. By univariable analysis, freedom from regional nodal recurrence was associated with age younger than 50 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34-0.70; P < .001), nonulcerated melanoma (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.36-0.49; P < .001), thinner primary melanoma (less than 1.5 mm; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.78; P = .004), axillary basin (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.86; P = .005), fewer positive SLNs (1 vs 3 or more; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.75; P = .008), and SLN tumor burden (measured by diameter less than 1 mm [HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.60; P = .001] or less than 5% area [HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.54; P < .001]). By multivariable analysis, younger age (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.84; P = .004), thinner primary melanoma (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.70; P = .002), axillary basin (HR, 0.55; 95% Cl. 0.31-0.96; P = .03), SLN metastasis diameter less than 1 mm (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.81; P = .007), and area less than 5% (HR. 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88; P = .01) were associated with basin control. When looking at the identified risk factors of age (50 years or older), ulceration, Breslow thickness greater than 3.5 mm, nonaxillary basin, and tumor burden of maximum diameter of 1 mm or greater and/or metastasis area of 5% or greater and excluding missing value cases, basin disease-free rates at 5 years were 96% (95% CI, 88-100) for patients with 0 risk factors, 89% (95% CI, 82-96) for 1 risk factor, 86% (95% CI, 80-93) for 2 risk factors, 80% (95% CI, 71-89) for 3 risk factors, 61% (95% CI, 48-74) for 4 risk factors, and 54% (95% CI, 36-72) for 5 or 6 risk factors.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This randomized clinical trial was the largest prospective evaluation of long-term regional basin control in patients with melanoma who had nodal observation after removal of a positive SLN. SLN biopsy without CLND cleared disease in the affected nodal basin in most patients, even those with multiple risk factors for in-basin recurrence. In addition to its well-validated value in staging, SLN biopsy may also be regarded as therapeutic in some patients.

TI  - A novel detail injection framework using latent low-rank decomposition for multispectral pan-sharpening
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel framework for pansharpening based on Latent Low-Rank Representation theory, called Detail injection using Latent Low-Rank decomposition based Pansharpening approach (DiLRP), is proposed. Our proposal comprises two fusion stages. In the first step, a primary joint fusion scheme is defined as a combination of low-rank and saliency images, which is used further for extracting spatial details. In this model, the histogram-matched PAN and up-sampled images are decomposed into low-rank and saliency components, and the corresponding fusion strategies are designed according to their characteristics. Indeed, to preserve more global structural information, low-rank components are combined by an optimized weighted average fusion strategy to generate a low-rank image. Furthermore, the saliency image is obtained by a simple average fusion rule in order get high-frequencies details (i.e., edges) that are highly relevant to MS image. The second stage consists in injecting (globally or locally) the high-frequency details, extracted from the reconstructed primary joint fused image using a multi-scale approach, into the up-sampled MS image. The performances of the proposed method have been studied both at reduced resolution and at full resolution. Three different datasets, acquired by the QuickBird, Pleaides-1A and WorldView-2 sensors, are used for validation. Compared with several well-known algorithms, experimental results reveal the validity and the advantages of the proposed DiLRP method.

TI  - Evaluation of simulations of near-surface variables using the regional climate model CCLM for the MOSAiC winter period
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ship-based experiment MOSAiC 2019/2020 was carried out during a full year in the Arctic and yielded an excellent data set to test the parameterizations of ocean/sea-ice/atmosphere interaction processes in regional climate models (RCMs). In the present paper, near-surface data during MOSAiC are used for the verification of the RCM COnsortium for Small-scale MOdel-Climate Limited area Mode (COSMO-CLM or CCLM). CCLM is used in a forecast mode (nested in ERA5) for the whole Arctic with 15 km resolution and is run with different configurations of sea ice data. These include the standard sea ice concentration taken from passive microwave data with around 6 km resolution, sea ice concentration from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared data and MODIS sea ice lead fraction data for the winter period. CCLM simulations show a good agreement with the measurements. Relatively large negative biases for temperature occur for November and December, which are likely associated with a too large ice thickness used by CCLM. The consideration of sea ice leads in the sub-grid parameterization in CCLM yields improved results for the near-surface temperature. ERA5 data show a large warm bias of about 2.5 degrees C and an underestimation of the temperature variability.

TI  - Axially loaded square concrete-filled steel tubular long columns made of high-strength materials: Experimental investigation, analytical behavior and design
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the structural performance of axially loaded high-strength concrete-filled square steel tubular (HCFSST) long columns, a total of nine HCFSST specimens with various slenderness ratio (lambda) values were experimentally tested and the working mechanism of the column was numerically revealed in this work. Parametric studies were also conducted to explore the column stability behavior, material strength matching relationship, and internal load distribution of each material. Combined with test results, various buckling curves (a0, a, b, c, and d) specified in code EC3 were reviewed to confirm an appropriate design curve for HCFSST columns. Furthermore, the predictions of the stability reduction factors and peak-loads of columns based on current design codes were compared and discussed. The results indicated that the failure modes of the columns were significantly affected by the lambda values. To efficiently improve the load bearing performance of the column, the recommended value of fy/fcu ratio is within 6.57-7.00 as lambda = 14-37 and is within 5.75-6.57 as lambda > 37. The new design models of the axially loaded columns proposed in this work are applicable to the HCFSST columns and hence are recommended. This study will provide guidance for the engineering practice of HCFSST columns.

TI  - Sentinel-1 observation for shoreline delineation applied to Mexico's Coast
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal mapping with satellite imagery is broadly used to calculate shoreline positions due to its high ecological and socioeconomic value in the context of coastal conservation and management strategies. We show the applicability of the Sentinel-1 to monitor large-scale shoreline at a country level. The present study develops a novel shoreline extraction method based on C band from SAR missions, that improves coastal ocean/land discrimination. The method considers an automated processing chain using the incorporation of GLCM-mean texture information to increase improvements in image binarization by Sauvola thresholding. Results show that the proposed method may be used for shoreline monitoring of different types of geomorphology along the Mexican coastline, thus guaranteeing its applicability in different geographic surroundings. For the six specific areas of validation, the overall agreement between binarization ranges is from 90% to 100% and Sentinel-2 images are used to evaluate the VV and VH shorelines from Sentinel-1.

TI  - A spatial-spectral adaptive thin-cloud removal method based on slow feature analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds cover corrupts the spatial and spectral information of optical remote sensing (RS) images, which seriously affects the use of RS data. To solve the problem of missing information, a spatial-spectral adaptive method based on slow feature analysis (SFA) is proposed to restore cloudy scenes in this letter. SFA converts the sequence signal into slowly varying signal signatures and the clouds will be located in the first component. We propose spatial and spectral adaptive correction methods to reduce interference from highlighted pixels and jointly constrain the cloud coefficients in each band according to reflectance and gradient. The effectiveness of our method is verified on Landsat-8 OLI simulated and real cloudy datas, the restored results are visually rich in texture detail and moderately corrected. The average PSNR of the four real scenes is 42.9738 dB and coefficient of determination (R (2)) is 0.8203, and many indicators have proved that our method is better than the existing methods.

TI  - Corn grain yield forecasting by satellite remote sensing and machine-learning models
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the performance of six machine-learning models in forecasting corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield before harvest using, as input, variables in the models, some of the most-used vegetation indices (VIs) and spectral bands in the literature, as well as using data at 770 and 980 sum of degree days (SDD). The field study was carried out in a commercial area in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 harvests. Spectral data were obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite images and were used as input variables in the proposed models: artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The maximum R-2 and minimum values of mean absolute error (MAE) and RMSE were 0.89, 0.33, and 0.42 t ha(-1), respectively, for the RF algorithm using all input variables. The results obtained in the present study show that it is possible to predict corn grain yield 80 d before harvest using only VIs for the crop. Testing the various combinations of spectral bands and VIs resulted in obtaining the GREEN band and the VI global environment monitoring index (GEMI) as the best predictor variables in the present study. The use of more than one SDD did not improve the performance of the models tested. The models developed using data at 980 SDD obtained the best precision and accuracy performance both in the scenario with all model input variables and with the two best predictors. The KNN algorithm obtained the best performance in the precision and accuracy metrics for most of the scenarios studied in the present work.

TI  - Multi-dimensional hydrological-hydraulic model with variational data assimilation for river networks and floodplains
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution presents a novel multidimensional (multi-D) hydraulic-hydrological numerical model with variational data assimilation capabilities. It allows multi-scale modeling over large domains, combining in situ observations with high-resolution hydrometeorology and satellite data. The multi-D hydraulic model relies on the 2D shallow-water equations solved with a 1D-2D adapted single finite-volume solver. One-dimensional-like reaches are built through meshing methods that cause the 2D solver to degenerate into 1D. They are connected to 2D portions that act as local zooms, for modeling complex flow zones such as floodplains and confluences, via 1D-like-2D interfaces. An existing parsimonious hydrological model, GR4H, is implemented and coupled to the hydraulic model. The forward-inverse multi-D computational model is successfully validated on virtual and real cases of increasing complexity, including using the second-order scheme version. Assimilating multiple observations of flow signatures leads to accurate inferences of multi-variate and spatially distributed parameters among bathymetry friction, upstream and lateral hydrographs and hydrological model parameters. This notably demonstrates the possibility for information feedback towards upstream hydrological catchments, that is, backward hydrology. A 1D-like model of part of the Garonne River is built and accurately reproduces flow lines and propagations of a 2D reference model. A multi-D model of the complex Adour basin network, with inflow from the semi-distributed hydrological model, is built. High-resolution flow simulations are obtained on a large domain, including fine zooms on floodplains, with a relatively low computational cost since the network contains mostly 1D-like reaches. The current work constitutes an upgrade of the DassFlow computational platform. The adjoint of the whole tool chain is obtained by automatic code differentiation.

TI  - An integrated approach for the reconstruction of rockfall scenarios from UAV and satellite-based data in the Sorrento Peninsula (southern Italy)
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present the results of a rockfall trajectory study performed on the south-western slope of Mt. Catiello (Sorrento Peninsula, southern Italy). Such a study develops within a multi-methodological approach which integrates different types of remote sensing data and techniques. Specifically, ground-truth data (e.g., rock mass geo-structural information, rock block inventory) were generated by geologically-supervised in-terpretations of high-resolution virtual outcrop models (VOMs). These data were then used for reconstructing the in-situ fractured rock mass attributes of the Mt. Catiello peak, as provided by a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model, and to prepare the subsequent numerical simulations of rockfall trajectories. The resulting rockfall sce-narios are consistent with the ground-truth data, both in terms of size and spatial distribution. Thus, we believe that the proposed approach can be effectively applied to other areas, characterized by similar geological features but higher levels of exposure and vulnerability.

TI  - Sub-pixel building area mapping based on synthetic training data and regression-based unmixing using Sentinel-1 and-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of buildings has become a major research focus of settlement mapping with Earth Observation data. Building area or building footprint data is particularly required in research related to population, such as disaster risk management or urban health. This study examined the suitability of machine learning regression-based unmixing for quantifying the pixel-wise share of building area with decametre resolution Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Compared to using a single-step approach directly estimating building area, leading to an over-estimation of building area compared to non-building impervious surface area due to feature similarity, the introduction of a hierarchical approach considerably improved mapping results. While the original mapping resolution was 10 m, we found that building area was most accurately mapped starting at a spatial resolution of 100 m - a resolution well suitable for many urban applications. The proposed approach is widely transferable in space as it used spatially robust spectral-temporal metrics from time series imagery and as its requirements for training data are very limited.

TI  - Morphometric characterization and land use of the Pajeu river basin in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The watershed are units controlling hydrological processes and essential for implementation of water resources management policies. The present study aims to integrate the morphometry and land use of the Pajeu river Basin and the Boa Vista micro-basin (headwater of the Pajeu river) using satellite data and a set of remote sensing techniques in open-source software (QGIS). The studied areas are in the semi-arid region of the Pernambuco State, Brazil. Physical morphometric parameters (area, perimeter, axial length, compactness factor, form factor, elongation ratio, and circularity ratio), hydrological parameters (length and distribution of the drainage network, drainage density, hydrographic density, constant of channel maintenance, textural ratio, sinuosity, concentration time, and extension of surface course) and relief (slope and altitude map) were produced. Furthermore, in the micro-basin, we determined the distribution of surface reservoirs using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The Pajeu river basin and the micro-basin have an elongated shape (form factor <0.4 and a capacity coefficient greater than 1.8), approximately 65% of areas with a slope of less than 8%, and moderately developed drainage network; thus, the regions studied are not prone to flooding. However, more than 70% of the basin has soils that have a low infiltration capacity, which, when associated with the conditions of removal of native vegetation, tends to favor the occurrence of floods. Through the integration of land use and morphometry, we found that about 40% of the areas that should be riparian forests are under agricultural activities. A more detailed analysis of the morphometry-coverage-soil-hydrology interactions in watersheds helps understand the hydrological processes and basin management. The presented results can be useful for modeling studies in the basin and for future water resources management plans.

TI  - Ecological restoration programs dominate vegetation greening in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many ecological restoration programs have been implemented in China during the last two decades. At the same time, the vegetation has turned green significantly in China. However, few studies have directly evaluated the contribution of the ecological restoration programs to vegetation greening in comparison with the contribution of climate change using high-resolution data of afforestation areas at the national scale. We used newly compiled high-resolution data on yearly forest plantation and mountain closure, the daily climate data from the 2480 meteorological stations and GIMMS 3g NDVI data. We used a multiple linear regression model to compare the influence of temperature, precipitation, and ecological restoration programs on NDVI dynamics. We then used the hierarchical variance partitioning method to evaluate the relative contribution of temperature, precipitation, and ecological restoration programs on NDVI dynamics. We found a significant greening trend in China from 1999 to 2015 with an annual increase rate of 0.0017 yr(-1) in the mean growing season NDVI. The ecological restoration programs dominated the vegetation greening in northern China and the southern coastal regions, indicating a good performance of restoration programs in these regions. In contrast, temperature or precipitation dominated the vegetation greening in southwestern China, Inner Mongolia and the implementation regions of several ecological restoration programs in northeastern China. Among the ecological restoration programs except the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program, the effect of ecological restoration programs on vegetation greening was stronger than the total effects of temperature and precipitation changes. Our study presents a systematic assessment on the contribution of ecological restoration programs to the vegetation greening in China, accessed the role on vegetation greening of different ecosystem restoration programs. We analyzed the reasons for the differences in the contribution of different ecological restoration programs to vegetation greening and provided insights facilitating policy makers to prioritize future restoration planning.

AB  - Remote Sensing-based multi-time point imagery helps incorporate the potentiality of time series analysis in crop classification studies. Single timepoint imagery has limitations in this aspect due to a comparatively similar spectral signature of crops. Even in multi-time point imagery, the viability of optical datasets is thwarted by clouds in crop growing seasons. Hence, researchers have used the all-weather imaging capabilities of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for crop classification. This all-weather capability of SAR and the multispectral capability of Optical datasets combined with their time series data hold great potential in remote sensing-based crop classification. Nevertheless, the underlying patterns of the combined SAR and optical time series haven't been meticulously explored, especially for socio-economically important crops like sugarcane. Therefore, this study proposes using the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series datasets and crop phenology information to develop a Neural Network capable of identifying sugarcane crops in the sugar belts of Western-Uttar Pradesh. Studies are done for the year 2020 using a Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network obtaining high accuracies in classifying sugarcane and non-sugarcane classes using optical and SAR time-series analysis datasets. The synthetic dataset has also been developed to enhance the convergence of the deep learning model, producing higher accuracy than utilizing the original dataset. Consequently, the study contributes to remote sensing-based crop classification and sets a foundation for further advancements in this domain.

TI  - Historical and future dynamics of land use land cover and its drivers in Ajora-Woybo watershed, Omo-Gibe basin, Ethiopia
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) dynamics have long been recognized as a significant driver of natural resource change. As a result, understanding the spatial and temporal variation of LULC in the watershed is essential for effective natural resource management and long-term development. This study attempts to analyze the dynamics and change drivers from 1990 to 2020 and predict the situation for 2035 and 2050 in the Ajora-Woybo watershed. ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS 2015 were used to analyze quantitative data from Landsat imagery. For supervised image classification, a Maximum-Likelihood classification algorithm was used. To identify driver variables, focus groups and key informants' interviews were done. TerrSet 18.31 software was used to predict LULC utilizing the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Cellular Automata-Markov Chain models incorporated in Land Change Modeler. Six LULC classes were discovered: cultivated land, built-up, shrub land, forest land, bare land, and water body. Cultivated land, built-up area, and bare land have increased at the expense of shrub land and forest land over the last three decades. Trends in water bodies show both decreasing and increasing trends. According to the predicted outcomes, cultivated land, built-up and bare land has increased, while shrub land and forest land have declined. Finally, agricultural expansion, population growth, wood extraction, resettlement, urbanization, and lack of environmental consideration were identified as the major drivers of LULC change. The study demonstrated that there have been significant changes in the watershed LULC. As a result, reversing the predicted conditions is critical to ensuring the watershed long-term viability.

TI  - External validation study of endometrial cancer preoperative risk stratification model (ENDORISK)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAmong industrialized countries, endometrial cancer is a common malignancy with generally an excellent outcome. To personalize medicine, we ideally compile as much information as possible concerning patient prognosis prior to effecting an appropriate treatment decision. Endometrial cancer preoperative risk stratification (ENDORISK) is a machine learning-based computational Bayesian networks model that predicts lymph node metastasis and 5-year disease-specific survival potential with percentual probability. Our objective included validating ENDORISK effectiveness in our patient cohort, assessing its application in the current use of sentinel node biopsy, and verifying its accuracy in advanced stages. MethodsThe ENDORISK model was evaluated with a retrospective cohort of 425 patients from the University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic. Two hundred ninety-nine patients were involved in our disease-specific survival analysis; 226 cases with known lymph node status were available for lymph node metastasis analysis. Patients were included undergoing either pelvic lymph node dissection (N = 84) or sentinel node biopsy (N =70) to explore the accuracy of both staging procedures. ResultsThe area under the curve was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.9) for lymph node metastasis analysis and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.93) for 5-year disease-specific survival evaluation, indicating quite positive concordance between prediction and reality. Calibration plots to visualize results demonstrated an outstanding predictive value for low-risk cancers (grades 1-2), whereas outcomes were underestimated among high-risk patients (grade 3), especially in disease-specific survival. This phenomenon was even more obvious when patients were subclassified according to FIGO clinical stages. ConclusionsOur data confirmed ENDORISK model's laudable predictive ability, particularly among patients with a low risk of lymph node metastasis and expected favorable survival. For high-risk and/or advanced stages, the ENDORISK network needs to be additionally trained/improved.

TI  - Deep segmentation and classification of complex crops using multi-feature satellite imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remote sensing-based land use and crop maps provide important and timely information for decision support in large-scale agricultural monitoring. Most existing multi-crop products for complex agricultural areas based on traditional machine learning algorithms are not suitable for large agricultural management because of the poor model transfer capabilities. Therefore, a deep segmentation and classification model including spatiotemporal transfer across regions and years must be developed. In this study, a deep learning approach was developed based on the UNet++ architecture by integrating feature fusion and upsampling of small samples for large-scale land use and crop mapping. Classification experiments were conducted for ten categories at four sites using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2A images from 2019 to 2021 containing 4,194,304 pixels. The joint loss, including the label smoothing cross entropy and Dice coefficient, and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) were used to evaluate the model performance depending on different features and upsampling schemes. The joint loss and mIoU values of the training model and the prediction accuracies of the test sites indicate that the scheme including the upsampling and fusion of spectral bands, vegetation indices, and texture features yields the optimal model performance. For comparison, UNet, DeepLab V3+, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), and random forest models were built. The improved UNet++ model exhibits the best performance, with an overall accuracy, kappa, and macro F1 above 91 %, 85 %, and 51 %, respectively. The deep segmentation and classification results without training samples demonstrate the spatiotemporal transfer capability of the UNet++ architecture during the key crop growth period. The patch parameter values also indicate that the improved model exhibits a better shape compactness and significantly reduces and suppresses patch fragmentation. Based on the analysis of the overall confusion matrix, the proposed method improves the classification accuracy for datasets with imbalanced land cover and crop types. This study provides a strategy for large-scale and complex land use and crop mapping based on the integration of feature fusion and deep learning.

TI  - A daily highest air temperature estimation method and spatial-temporal changes analysis of high temperature in China from 1979 to 2018
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The daily highest air temperature (T-max) is a key parameter for global and regional high temperature analysis which is very difficult to obtain in areas where there are no meteorological observation stations. This study proposes an estimation framework for obtaining high-precision T-max. Firstly, we build a near-surface air temperature diurnal variation model to estimate T-max with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees for China from 1979 to 2018 based on multi-source data. Then, in order to further improve the estimation accuracy, we divided China into six regions according to climate conditions and topography and established calibration models for different regions. The analysis shows that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6322881, Wang et al., 2021) after correction with the calibration models is about 1.07 degrees C and the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 1.52 degrees C, which is higher than that before correction to nearly 1 degrees C. The spatial-temporal variations analysis of T-max in China indicated that the annual and seasonal mean T-max in most areas of China showed an increasing trend. In summer and autumn, the Tmax in northeast China increased the fastest among the six regions, which was 0.4 degrees C per 10 years and 0.39 degrees C per 10 years, respectively. The number of summer days and warm days showed an increasing trend in all regions while the number of icing days and cold days showed a decreasing trend. The abnormal temperature changes mainly occurred in El Nino years or La Nina years. We found that the influence of the Indian Ocean basin warming (IOBW) on air temperature in China was generally greater than those of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the NINO3.4 area sea surface temperature after making analysis of ocean climate modal indices with air temperature. In general, this T-max dataset and analysis are of great significance to the study of climate change in China, especially for environmental protection.

TI  - Temporal variation in the behaviour of a cooperatively breeding bird, Jungle Babbler (<i>Argya striata</i>)
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Time is an important and limited resource that can drive the trade-off between various essential activities in the lives of animals. Group-living social birds are likely to be constrained for time as they need to perform individual behaviours required for sustenance but also participate in group activities. They must, therefore, partition the available time between these activities which may vary considerably with environmental and ecological conditions, making studies on time-activity budgets of social animals essential in understanding the evolution of sociality. We examined the time-activity budget of a cooperative passerine, Jungle Babbler (Argya striata) and temporal variation in their behaviours. A repertoire of 13 behaviours was recorded of which 12 behaviours that occur throughout the year were examined further in detail. This included individual behaviours such as foraging, grooming, rest, shower and group behaviours such as allogrooming, movement, play, sentinel, mobbing and inter-group fight. Our results indicate that most of the time (about 70%) was spent performing individual behaviours and the remaining time (about 30%) was allocated to social behaviours. We also found almost all behaviours varied across diel and seasonal scales with respect to the proportion of time spent performing them. This highlights the impact of environmental factors on how animals partition their time to perform various activities. Our study also lays the foundation for future studies examining the role of ecological factors such as habitat type and predation pressure in driving these patterns of behaviour in Jungle Babblers.

TI  - An integrated approach to modelling the interaction of the natural landscape and the karez water system in Turpan (Xinjiang, PRC)
T2  - LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The research in this paper focusses on examining the link between the karez and their location in the physical landscape. The landscape can be divided into specific classes dependent on their natural characteristics, such as slope, drainage, and soil properties. These classes are compared to the known karez locations, settlement, and vegetation throughout time using Corona KH4B-, Landsat 8-, and Pleiades 1-imagery. It is shown that the karez are indeed restricted to certain landscape types, nonetheless, variety is still possible within one site location. When including settlement patterns, they are heavily influenced by the presence of karez and/or surface water. The connection between the landscape classes, the karez, and the settlements is evident but interestingly some aspects cannot be explained fully by the physical surroundings only. This leads to believe that other agents must also be present of socio-economical, mental, or historical nature.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline changes and erosion risk assessment along Jerba island (Tunisia) based on remote-sensing data and geospatial tools
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Jerba, the largest island in North Africa, is among the most exposed islands to the combined effects of climate change and human activities in the Mediterranean. The eastern coast of Jerba island has long been subject to intense tourist development due to its attractive natural potential. The main issue addressed in this study concerns the evolutionary trends of Jerba shoreline and the assessment of coastal erosion risk. This work focuses on the historical study of the shoreline positions based on satellite data processing. The use of geographic information system (GIS) and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) geostatistical calculation tool allowed for the identification of erosion and accretion rates and the description of evolutionary trends across 32 years covering three periods (1989-1999, 1999-2009, and 2009-2021). The results show an overall erosion trend (89% of the coastline). The statistics revealed that the study area, with the exception of the sandy spit, has experienced an intense and alarming level of erosion between 1989 and 1999, with an end point rate (EPR) equal to -4.12 m/year. This net rate continued to be negative in the period between 1999 and 2009, with an EPR of -0.5 m/year. Between 2009 and 2021, the net rate of shoreline change is marked by slight accretion, at an average of +1.4 m/year. The overall long-term trend shows the shoreline is eroding, with an average linear regression rate of -1.38 m/year for the whole period. This trend is due to a combination of the cumulative effects of sea-level rise and anthropogenic actions. Therefore, sustainable management strategies need to be implemented urgently by coastal managers to restore the sectors that are susceptible to further erosion. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Representing and modeling spatio-temporal uncertainty using belief function theory in flood extent mapping
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In our world of rapid change, floods are a growing threat. In this context, flood extent mapping is important for damage and accurate and timely information about flood-affected areas are needed. Due to the suitability of remote sensing in mapping flood inundation, multi-source satellite images have been used in recent years. This paper presents a new approach to representing and modeling uncertainty in spatio-temporal information of satellite images using belief function theory for flooded areas extraction. Interval approaches and the associated arithmetic operations are used for modeling the uncertainty of spatial locations and temporal durations from 2D dimensional model in order to take the direction of flow in the flood. Based on topological spatial relationships, the similarity for the spatio-temporal inundation events is performed and the similar intervals are fused. Detailed examples are given to illustrate each step. A case study of flood risk in Chad Lake from 2003 to 2019 using Sentinel-2, MODIS and Landsat-8 images shows how spatio-temporal uncertainty can be problematic and bias the results of even the simplest flood mapping, and how coupling a Dempster-Shafer approach with topological relationships nevertheless offers a useful solution.

TI  - The Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) global active fire product: principle, methodology and validation
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have a strong negative effect on the environment, ecology and public health. However, the potential degradation of mainstream global fire products leads to large uncertainty in the effective monitoring of wildfires and their influence. To fill this gap, we produced Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) global fire products with a similar spatial and temporal resolution, aiming to serve as an alternative to and continuity for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global fire products. Firstly, the sensor parameters and major algorithms for noise detection and fire identification in FY-3D products were introduced. For visual-check-based accuracy assessment, five typical regions with a large number of fire spots across the globe, Africa, South America, the Indochinese Peninsula, Siberia and Australia, were selected, and the overall accuracy exceeded 94 %. Meanwhile, the consistence between FY-3D and MODIS fire products was examined. The result suggested that the overall consistence was 84.4 %, with a fluctuation across seasons, surface types and regions. The high accuracy and consistence with MODIS products proved that the FY-3D fire product is an ideal tool for global fire monitoring. Based on field-collected reference data, we further evaluated the suitability of FY-3D fire products in China. The overall accuracy and accuracy without considering omission errors were 79.43% and 88.50% higher, respectively, than those of MODIS fire products. Since detailed local geographical conditions were specifically considered, FY-3D products should be preferably employed for fire monitoring in China. The FY-3D fire dataset can be downloaded at http://satellite.nsmc.org.cn/portalsite/default.aspx (NSMC, 2021) or at http://figshare.com (last access: 10 January 2021) with the following identifier DOI: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20102210 (Chen et al., 2022).

TI  - Reconstructions of four-dimensional spatiotemporal characteristics of soil organic carbon stock in coastal wetlands during the last decades
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of multiple disturbances, soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) in coastal wetlands experiences drastic spatiotemporal variations, which involve four dimensions. However, the finiteness and discontinuity of historical field soil data hinder the four-dimensional SOCS reconstruction in coastal wetlands. In this study, the zonal and progressive simulations were integrated to reconstruct the four-dimensional characteristics of coastal wetland SOCS by using field soil data in current time point and remote sensing data during the last decades. The zonal simulation was adopted to conduct the two-dimensional simulation at a low cost of field survey. The spatial and temporal progressive simulations were implemented based on the close relationships among soil factors in different depths and at different time points, respectively, for realizing the three- and four-dimensional simulations. The demonstration of the study in Chongming Island, an important coastal wetland in China, validated the low cost, high accuracy, and good applicability of the approach. Over the entire island during the last decades, SOCS in surface layer showed overall increasing characteristics, while SOCS in intermediate and bottom layers did not exhibit distinct change trend. Generally, SOCS in surface layer increased and that in intermediate and bottom layers decreased along the gradient from the shoreline to the inner island. Continuous sediment discharge and deposition enlarged the areas of coastal wetlands and thus increased SOCS in the alongshore areas. Human activities distinctly increased SOCS through long-term and large-scale agricultural activities in the inner island, while decreased it through urbanization. Then, healthy, coordinated, and sustainable measures for increasing coastal wetland SOCS were proposed from perspectives of scale control, spatial configuration, and quality promotion. Therefore, this approach could reconstruct SOCS four-dimensional characteristics and achieve the conversions of soil data from point to area, from surface to bottom, and from present to past.

TI  - Engineering geomorphological and InSAR investigation of an urban landslide, Gisborne, New Zealand
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Coast region of New Zealand has some of the highest erosion rates in the world, due to its proximity to an active plate boundary, susceptibility to high-intensity storms and steep terrain underlain by young soft sedimentary rock and soil. In the city of Gisborne, expansion of residential blocks into steeper terrain in peri-urban areas has required improved capacity for the characterisation and monitoring of slope stability. Landslides have affected several properties and have destroyed infrastructure. Slope failure commonly occurs during heavy rainfall events when slow-moving retrogressive slides transition into earthflows and mudflows. In this study, we used in situ sampling and testing methods combined with remote sensing techniques to provide an understanding of the pre-failure and post-failure behaviour of an urban landslide in Gisborne. High-resolution aerial imagery, unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and light detection and ranging data revealed slope morphology and contours of prehistoric failures in the area, and highlighted the more recent impacts of deforestation on slope stability. Furthermore, Sentinel-1 InSAR analysis determined that gradual deformation began in 2017, following two ex-tropical cyclone events. Deformation downslope continued until an initial failure in July 2020. Following that event, some parts of the slope proceeded to accelerate, leading to a further reactivation event in November 2021, following heavy rainfall. During this November 2021 event, average line of sight velocities ranged from - 7.9 to - 11.2 mm/year, and deformation rates in the vertical direction (related to rotational slumping) averaged - 11.2 to -11.9 mm/year, consistent with field observations.

TI  - Cerebral embolic protection and severity of stroke following transcatheter aortic valve replacement
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The cerebral embolic protection (CEP) device captures embolic debris during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the impact of CEP on stroke severity following TAVR remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether CEP was associated with reduced severity of stroke following TAVR. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 2839 consecutive patients (mean age: 79.2 +/- 9.5 years, females: 41.5%) who underwent transfemoral TAVR at our institution between 2013 and 2020. We categorized patients into Sentinel CEP users and nonusers. Neuroimaging data were reviewed and the final diagnosis of a cerebrovascular event was adjudicated by a neurologist blinded to the CEP use or nonuse. We compared the incidence and severity (assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) of stroke through 72 h post-TAVR or discharge between the two groups using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) of propensity scores. Results Of the eligible patients, 1802 (63.5%) received CEP during TAVR and 1037 (36.5%) did not. After adjustment for patient characteristics by stabilized IPTW, the rate of overall stroke was numerically lower in CEP users than in CEP nonusers, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (0.49% vs. 1.18%, p = 0.064). However, CEP users had significantly lower rates of moderate-or-severe stroke (NIHSS >= 6: 0.11% vs. 0.69%, p = 0.013) and severe stroke (NIHSS >= 15: 0% vs. 0.29%, p = 0.046). Stroke following CEP use (n = 8), compared with stroke following CEP nonuse (n = 15), tended to carry a lower NIHSS (median [IQR], 4.0 [2.0-7.0] vs. 7.0 [4.5-19.0], p = 0.087). Four (26.7%) out of 15 patients with stroke following CEP nonuse died within 30 days, with no death after stroke following CEP use. Conclusions CEP use may be associated with attenuated severity of stroke despite no significant difference in overall stroke incidence compared with CEP nonuse. This finding is considered hypothesis-generating and needs to be confirmed in large prospective studies.

TI  - Offset of MODIS land surface temperatures from in situ air temperatures in the upper Kaskawulsh Glacier region (St. Elias Mountains) indicates near-surface temperature inversions
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are a crucial tool for monitoring climatological changes and glacier response in areas inaccessible for in situ measurements. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) product provides temperature data for remote glaciated areas where air temperature measurements from weather stations are sparse or absent, such as the St. Elias Mountains (Yukon, Canada). However, MODIS LSTs in the St. Elias Mountains have been found in prior studies to show an offset from available weather station measurements, the source of which is unknown. Here, we show that the MODIS offset likely results from the occurrence of near-surface temperature inversions rather than from the MODIS sensor's large footprint size or from poorly constrained snow emissivity values used in LST calculations. We find that an offset in remote sensing temperatures is present not only in MODIS LST products but also in Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emissions Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat temperature products, both of which have a much smaller footprint (90-120 m) than MODIS (1 km). In all three datasets, the offset was most pronounced in the winter (mean offset > 8 degrees C) and least pronounced in the spring and summer (mean offset < 2 degrees C). We also find this enhanced seasonal offset in MODIS brightness temperatures, before the incorporation of snow surface emissivity into the LST calculation. Finally, we find the MODIS LST offset to be consistent in magnitude and seasonal distribution with modeled temperature inversions and to be most pronounced under conditions that facilitate near-surface inversions, namely low incoming solar radiation and wind speeds, at study sites Icefield Divide (60.68 degrees N, 139.78 degrees W; 2,603 m a.s.l) and Eclipse Icefield (60.84 degrees N, 139.84 degrees W; 3017 m a.s.l.). Although these results do not preclude errors in the MODIS sensor or LST algorithm, they demonstrate that efforts to convert MODIS LSTs to an air temperature measurement should focus on understanding near-surface physical processes. In the absence of a conversion from surface to air temperature based on physical principles, we apply a statistical conversion, enabling the use of mean annual MODIS LSTs to qualitatively and quantitatively examine temperatures in the St. Elias Mountains and their relationship to melt and mass balance.

TI  - Identification of undocumented buildings in cadastral data using remote sensing: Construction period, morphology, and landscape
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Buildings are the predominant objects that characterize the urban structure. For many cities, local governments establish building databases for administration as well as urban planning and monitoring. However, newly constructed buildings are often only included with a considerable time delay in the official digital cadastral maps due to processes in the acquisition of data, so-called undocumented buildings. In this regard, detecting undocumented buildings using remote sensing techniques would support the construction of update-to-date building databases with complementary information. In-depth studies on undocumented buildings and their number and location, however, are scarce. Therefore, we exploit a deep learning-based framework to detect undocumented buildings in remote sensing data and propose to derive 2D and 3D morphological parameters as well as landscape metrics., which are capable of depicting the physical forms and spatial structures of undocumented buildings. Furthermore, we exemplify the variabilities of undocumented buildings across space by the differences in morphology and landscape metrics between high and low building density regions. Upon analysis of undocumented buildings in 15 cities in the state of Bavaria, Germany, both state-and city -scale results reveal that most undocumented buildings are located in lower dense regions. This reveals that fragmentation of the landscape by building structures in the state of Bavaria is probably greater than official geospatial data currently documented.

TI  - Aboveground biomass estimation in forests with random forest and Monte Carlo-based uncertainty analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests and the associated uncertainty are important pieces of information outlined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Traditional integrated surveying methods require high inputs of manpower and material resources, whereas remote sensing technology can be used to improve the efficiency of forest resources surveying at a lower measurement cost. Previous studies have primarily utilized spectral information and textural features as the main modeling factors for AGB prediction models, however, few studies have examined how different modeling factors affect prediction accuracy in detail. At the same time, uncertainties in AGB are usually determine by a data set producing a single prediction result, ignoring the model uncertainty due by residual variability in the prediction results. To solve the above problems, this study focuses on Milin County of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China as the research area and uses data from the Landsat Operational Land Imager, digital elevation models (DEM), and the national forest inventory (NFI) to extract and analyze spectral information, textural features, and terrain factors. Four regression models based on different combinations of variables were established using a combination of random forest and Monte Carlo simulation methods (RF-MC), and the uncertainties of each model were determined. The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of different types of variable factors on AGB inversion and to measure the model uncertainty resulting from changes in the variable factors. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the fit and accuracy of the model, while the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) was used to quantify the uncertainty. The results show that the degree of fitting and accuracy are greatest for the RF-MC model based on three kinds of variables (spectrum and plot data + DEM + texture characteristics) the best (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 11.76 t/ha, MAE = 8.49 t/ha, rRMSE = 5.97 %), which performed better than the RF-MC model based on two variables (spectrum and plot data + texture characteristics, R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 13.93 t/ha, MAE = 10.01 t/ha, rRMSE = 7.07 % or spectrum and plot data + DEM, R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 16.75 t/ha, MAE = 14.62 t/ha, rRMSE = 8.49 %) and the RFMC model based on a single variable (spectrum and plot data, R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 21.39 t/ha, MAE = 19.84 t/ha, rRMSE = 10.86 %). The range of the predicted model value is 150.6-227.8 t/ha, which is close to the actual value. The RF-MC method based on multifeature is demonstrated to be effective in the practical application of AGB inversion, and different types of modeling variables have a certain impact on the accuracy of AGB inversion. This study provides a theoretical basis for improving the accuracy of AGB estimates and the selection of modeling variables, while also contributing to continued improvements in remote sensing-based systems for monitoring forest resources.

TI  - Improvements of a low-cost CO<sub>2</sub> commercial nondispersive near-infrared (NDIR) sensor for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) atmospheric mapping applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a cost-effective way to fill in gaps between surface in situ observations and remotely sensed data from space. In this study, a novel portable CO2 measuring system suitable for operations on board small-sized UAVs has been developed and validated. It is based on a low-cost commercial nondispersive near-infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensor (Senseair AB, Sweden), with a total weight of 1058 g, including batteries. The system performs in situ measurements autonomously, allowing for its integration into various platforms. Accuracy and linearity tests in the lab showed that the precision remains within +/- 1 ppm (1 sigma) at 1 Hz. Corrections due to temperature and pressure changes were applied following environmental chamber experiments. The accuracy of the system in the field was validated against a reference instrument (Picarro, USA) on board a piloted aircraft and it was found to be +/- 2 ppm (1 sigma) at 1 Hz and +/- 1 ppm (1 sigma) at 1 min. Due to its fast response, the system has the capacity to measure CO2 mole fraction changes at 1 Hz, thus allowing the monitoring of CO2 emission plumes and of the characteristics of their spatial and temporal distribution. Details of the measurement system and field implementations are described to support future UAV platform applications for atmospheric trace gas measurements.

TI  - Inversion of Regional Economic Trend from NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light Data Based on Adaptive Clustering Algorithm
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Night lighting is closely related to social and economic development. Inversion of socioeconomic parameters using nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data is a research hot spot currently. In this paper, a calibration method based on adaptive clustering algorithm for the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) NTL data was proposed to remove background noise in the original imagery. The validity of the calibration method was evaluated through comparing the correlation between the corrected NTL data and the regional economic data. The result indicated that the NTL data obtained by this calibration method have higher correlation with the regional GDP data, and the values of R-2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.8531 and 133.18, respectively. On this basis, the total nighttime light (TNL)-gross domestic product (GDP) regression model obtained from this paper was used to invert the GDP of Liaoning Province from 2012 to 2016. Using the TNL-GDP regression model established in high-quality regions to verify the fraudulent economic statistics of Liaoning Province, it can be proved that NTL data can be a reliable reference for reflecting regional economic development trends.

TI  - First record of red-tide in Elba protectorate coast using Sentinel-3 and its impacts on ecosystem
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the first to document an algal bloom caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which was detected using remote sensing techniques and confirmed in the field along the coast of Elba National Park. Noctiluca scintillans is a phytoplankton species that accumulate toxic ammonia that endangers various organisms, including fish, birds, mammals, and human. Therefore, monitoring red tide is essential for water pollution control and management. This study aims to evaluate the potential of the recent launch of the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3 satellite to identify chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a proxy for an algal bloom event and study its impacts on the ecosystem. To fulfill the aim, OLCI images were collected over the study area from the 25th of May to the 13th of June 2017. Satellite images were converted from level 1 to level 2 through radiometric and atmospheric correction, and Chl-a maps were produced from the level 3 data during product development using standard Ocean Color 4 for MERIS (OC4Me) model. The time-series analyses of the Sentinel-3 satellite images indicated that the algal blooms (Red tide) event occurred four days at the studied sites (7th to 10th of June). The current findings reveal a strong relationship between the deterioration in water quality criteria and Noctiluca scintillans cell counts (x104) /L (0.05 > P & LE; 0.01). This study strongly urges routine monitoring of the physicochem-ical characteristics of coastal waters and using remote sensing techniques for early rid tide detection to control the phenomenon.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - A modeling approach for evaluating the impacts of Land Use/Land Cover change for Ziway Lake Watershed hydrology in the Ethiopian Rift
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many parts of the Ethiopian Rift are undergoing significant Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes. In many places, the natural LULCs are converted into agricultural land to sustain the increasing food demand arising from a rapidly growing population. Modelling the responses of LULC changes on the hydrology of the area at the watershed scale is crucial for sustainable development of land and water resources. This study investigates the historic LULC change and its potential impacts on the hydrology of Ziway Lake Watershed in the Ethiopian Rift. Commonly, such assessments are accomplished by integrating physically based and semi-distributed hydrological model with Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques. A hybrid LULC classification approach was applied to classify Landsat images of 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2020 and detect the LULC changes in the watershed. Subsequently, Soil and Water Assessment Tool was utilized to simulate the response of the hydrological process (water balance and stream flow) to LULC changes from 1985 to 2020. The image classifications of 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2020 revealed four LULC maps with eight LULC types. The relative change assessment results in the past 35 years from 1985 to 2020 revealed that the major expansion in Settlement, Cultivation and Agroforest resulting in a reduction of Woodlands. However, 58.3% of the watershed has remained intact while 41.7% has shown some degree of change. At the watershed level, these LULC changes had increased SURQ (87.07%), WYLD (31.86%) and ET (4.91%). Conversely, the observed change had reduced PERC (63.22%). But, the spatial analysis of the water balance components due to LULC changes were found to be non-uniform across the watershed. On the other hand, the seasonal stream flow analysis results indicated that Katar flow is increased by 15.36% and declined by 3.86% during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Similarly, Meki flow showed a decrement during the dry seasons and an increment during the wet seasons by 7.04% and 20.66%, respectively. Beside the observed change, the results of the hypothetical LULC change scenarios justified a pronounced impact of historic LULC change on the water balance components of the watershed. These change in hydrological components and stream flow substantially attributed to the transformation of Woodland to agricultural land. Among the water balance components, the increment of SURQ may have a wider implication for increasing soil erosion and lake bed siltation. The continuous decline in PERC also highly affected the available groundwater resource of the watershed. The study will have significance for watershed managers and decision makers to improve the LULC and water management practices in the area by formulating mechanisms to maintain a sustainable hydrological balance in the watershed.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to assess the urban expansion by using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System along with field verification. In recent decades, India has been experienced rapid urbanisation. Agartala is the second largest and fastest growing urban centre in Northeast India. To assess the urban growth through Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) dynamics of Agartala City through Landsat Satellite imageries of four different time periods between 2000 to 2021. The changing scenario of LULC indicates that gradually changing pattern of the city. The LULC of the city has been categorised into five different classes, i.e., agricultural land, built-up area, vegetation cover, fallow land and water body. Time series data has been analysed as well as annual and composite growth rate has been calculated to monitor the changing nature of urban dynamics. Kappa coefficient has been performed for the reliability of changing elements. It has been found that agricultural land, forest area and water bodies converted into the built-up area in Agartala City. The study reveals that the city is expanding maximum towards northsouth direction due to the presence of the airport in the north and National Highway-8 along the periphery of the city in the south. The study also highlights the build-up area forecasting model using the exponential smoothing method in the Agartala City area. The reliability test represents overall accuracy of 89.75%, and Kappa Coefficient is 86%. The study has been forecasted possible future changes in growth patterns of the city as well as the development of sustainable urban land use planning. decisions.

TI  - The use of remote sensing indices to understand flood-recharged soil moisture impacts on trees in semi-arid floodplains: A review
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing indices (RSIs) are essential for detection, mapping and monitoring of floods, soil moisture and tree characteristics. An understanding of the nexus between flood-recharged soil moisture (FRSM) and endangered biodiversity tree hotspots in semi-arid floodplains is critical. Specifically, the influence of FRSM on biophysical characteristics of keystone tree species with social, economic, ecological and environmental functions is crucial. However, the use of RSIs to understand the link between episodic floods, FRSM and trees, as well as their respective spatiotemporal dynamics within the semi-arid floodplains, remains largely unexplored. Hence, this study reviewed literature on the adoption of RSIs in understanding short-term phenological and long-term tree structural changes arising from flood-related infiltration. The reviewed literature shows the predominance of the normalised difference water index, the land surface water index and normalised difference vegetation index for flood, FRSM and tree mapping. The review also shows the emergence of SAR-based normalised difference flood index for understanding the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees. Although the review identified an increase in data availability, however, there are high costs of active commercial remote sensing data of superior quality and computing resources. Furthermore, available free data are incapable of penetrating canopies and have coarse spatial resolution constraining the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on trees. In view of increasing free SAR data and cloud-based computing resources, application of emerging deep learning algorithms offers prospects for the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees.

TI  - Unraveling the hydrology and sediment balance of an ungauged lake in the Sudano-Sahelian region of West Africa using remote sensing
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of ephemeral ponds and perennial lakes in the Sudano-Sahelian region of West Africa is strongly variable in space and time. Yet, they have important ecological functions and societies are reliant on their surface waters for their lives and livelihoods. It is essential to monitor and understand the dynamics of these lakes to assess past, present, and future water resource changes. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to unravel the sediment and water balance of Lac Wegnia, a small ungauged lake in Mali near the capital of Bamako. The approach uses optical remote sensing data to identify the shoreline positions over a period of 22 years (2000-2021) and then attributes water surface heights (WSHs) to each observation using the lake bathymetry. We then present a novel methodology to identify and quantitatively analyze deposition and erosion patterns at lakeshores and in lake beds. The method therefore represents a significant advancement over previous attempts to remotely monitor lakes in the West African drylands, since it considers not only changes in water depth to explain recent declining trends in lake areas, but also changes in the storage capacity. At Lac Wegnia, we recognize silting at the tributaries to the lake, but overall, erosion processes are dominant and threaten the persistence of the lake because of progressive erosion through the natural levee at the lake outlet. This factor contributes 66%+/- 18% to the decreasing WSH trend, while 34%+/- 18 % of the dry-season lake level changes are explained by increasing evaporation from the lake and by possibly falling groundwater tables. Due to the decreasing reservoir capacity of the lake, WSHs are declining even in the wet season in spite of positive rainfall patterns.

TI  - Use of cellular automata-based artificial neural networks for detection and prediction of land use changes in North-Western Dhaka City
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the trend of change in land use land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) in Mirpur and its surrounding area over the last 30 years using Landsat satellite images and remote sensing indices, and to develop relationships between LULC types and LST, as well as to analyze their impact on local warming. Using this analyzed data, a further projection of LULC and LST change over the next two decades was made. From 1989 to 2019, 5-year intervals of Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images were utilized to track the relationship between LULC changes and LST. The modeled LST was validated with MODIS-derived LST within the study area. Cellular automata-based artificial neural network (CA-ANN) algorithm was used to model the LULC and LST maps for the year 2039. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were analyzed to determine their link with LST. The relation between LST and LULC types indicates that built-up area raises LST by substituting non-evaporating surfaces for natural vegetation. The average surface temperature was increasing steadily for the last 30 years. For the year 2019, it was determined that roughly 86% of total land area has been converted to built-up area and that 89% of land area had an LST greater than 28 degrees C. According to the study, if the current trend continues, 72% of the Mirpur area is predicted to see temperatures near 32 degrees C in 2039. Additionally, LST had a significant positive association with NDBI and a negative correlation with NDVI. The overall accuracy of LULC was greater than 90%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.83. The study may assist urban planners and environmental engineers in comprehending and recommending effective policy measures and plans to mitigate the consequences of LULC.

TI  - Effectiveness of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for flood detection assessment in Europe
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Inundation is one of the major natural hazards in Europe. The evaluation of the flood hazard and risk is not straightforward mainly due to the monitoring system that is poor or not uniformly distributed in the territory. The ESA Earth Observation Program, including a series of satellites, Sentinels, for the operative observation of the natural phenomenon, e.g. the inundations, can potentially reduce the gap. Sentinel-1 (SAR: synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) have been demonstrated to be suitable for mapping flooded areas, but despite the medium-high spatial and temporal resolution of the sensors, the mapping of inundated territories is often partial or missing. The objective of this study is to evaluate through a synthetic study the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 in the systematic assessment of floods in Europe, where the flood events have durations ranging from some hours to a few days. To reach the target, we analysed 10 years of river discharge data over almost 2000 sites in Europe, and we extracted flood events over some established thresholds as proxies of riverine inundations. Based on the revisit time of the satellite constellations and cloud coverage, we derived the percentage of potential inundation events that Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 could be able to observe. Results show that assuming the configuration of a constellation of two satellites for each mission and considering the ascending and descending orbit, on average 58 % of flood events are potentially observable by Sentinel-1 and only 28 % by Sentinel-2 due to the cloud coverage.

TI  - Turbidity dynamics of large lakes and reservoirs in northeastern China in response to natural factors and human activities
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The water environment has experienced prominent changes worldwide in recent decades, especially in inland waters. As an important lake region in China, the water turbidity of lakes/reservoirs in the Northeast Plain -Mountainous Region (NPLR) remains less understood, especially the influencing mechanisms of regional cli-matic conditions and human activities. To enhance the knowledge of turbidity dynamics and explanatory var-iables of NPLR water bodies, long-term turbidity estimates of lakes/reservoirs were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua observations between 2003 and 2019. The results show that most lakes/reservoirs became less turbid in NPLR during the study period, as indicated by a decreasing turbidity trend of 0.05-2.4 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)/year. Overall, the decreased turbidity was mainly attributed to the decreased wind speed (from 2003 to 2012, r = 0.85, p < 0.01), but also to the increased normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the forest region (r =-0.80, p < 0.01), with the latter being a result of the forest protection efforts of the Chinese government. The increased snowmelt depth also contributed to a substantial turbidity decline in April. In addition, distinct seasonal patterns of turbidity were observed in the NPLR, with less turbid water in the wet season (i.e., from June to August) and turbid water in the dry season (i.e., October, November, and April in the next year). This result is attributed to the rapid seasonal dynamics of precipitation and runoff. This study provided a comprehensive analysis on the influencing mechanisms of turbidity dynamics in NPLR lakes; in particular, for the first time, revealed the impacts of the national policy -mandated forest development and the snowmelt depth on lake turbidity. These findings will provide vital in-formation for government decision-making in water environment protection in NPLR and other similar areas with densely distributed lakes.

TI  - Long-Term Investigation of Aerosols in the Urmia Lake Region in the Middle East by Ground-Based and Satellite Data in 2000-2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dried lake beds are some of the largest sources of dust in the world and have caused environmental problems in the surrounding areas in recent decades. In the present work, we studied the monthly and annual occurrence of dust storms at selected weather stations around Urmia Lake in northwestern (NW) Iran. Furthermore, we investigated the variations in the daily aerosol optical depth (AOD at 550 nm) and the angstrom ngstrom exponent (at 412/470 nm), as well as the vertical profile of the total aerosol extinction coefficient and AOD at 532 nm, using space-borne MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aqua and CALIPSO Satellite LiDAR data over the Urmia Lake region (36-39 degrees N, 44-47 degrees E). The monthly variations of AOD(550) and AOD(532) for the regions 37-39 degrees N and 46-59 degrees E were compared, and it was found that the CALIPSO AOD(532) and MODIS AOD(532) (reconstructed using the angstrom ngstrom exponent) were in good agreement. In general, the dust storms during 2000-2021 increased the AOD(550) above average around the Urmia Lake. The vertical profile of aerosols showed that the largest contribution to total aerosol loading over the Urmia Lake was from 1.5-3 km, 1.5-4 km, 1.5-5 km, and 1.5-3 km during winter, spring, summer, and autumn seasons, respectively.

TI  - Vivax malaria in Duffy-negative patients shows invariably low asexual parasitaemia: implication towards malaria control in Ethiopia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The increase in detections of Plasmodium vivax infection in Duffy-negative individuals in Africa has challenged the dogma establishing the unique P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein-Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (PvDBP-DARC) pathway used by P. vivax merozoites to invade reticulocytes. Information on the impact of Duffy antigen polymorphisms on the epidemiology of P. vivax malaria remains elusive. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of asexual parasitaemia of P. vivax according to the Duffy antigen polymorphisms in Ethiopia. Methods DNA was extracted from dried blood spots (DBS) collected from prospectively recruited 138 P. vivax-infected patients from health centres. The identification and estimation of P. vivax asexual parasitaemia were performed by microscopic examination and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Duffy genotyping was conducted by DNA sequencing in a total of 138 P.vivax infected samples. Results The proportion of Duffy-negatives (FY*B-ES/FY*B-ES) in P. vivax infected patients was 2.9% (4/138). Duffy genotype FY*B/FY*B-ES (48.6%) was the most common, followed by FY*A/FY*B-ES genotype (25.4%). In one patient, the FY*02 W.01/FY*02 N.01 genotype conferring a weak expression of the Fy(b) antigen was observed. All P.vivax infected Duffy-negative patients showed low asexual parasitaemia (<= 110 parasites/mu L). The median P. vivax parasitaemia in Duffy-negative patients (53 parasites/mu L) was significantly lower than those found in homozygous and heterozygous individuals (P < 0.0001). Conclusion Plasmodium vivax in Duffy-negative patients shows invariably low asexual parasitaemia. This finding suggests that the pathway used by P. vivax to invade Duffy-negative reticulocytes is much less efficient than that used in Duffy-positives. Moreover, the low asexual parasitaemia observed in Duffy-negative individuals could constitute an 'undetected silent reservoir', thus likely delaying the elimination of vivax malaria in Ethiopia.

TI  - A Review of Hybrid Approaches for Quantitative Assessment of Crop Traits Using Optical Remote Sensing: Research Trends and Future Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing technology allows to provide information about biochemical and biophysical crop traits and monitor their spatiotemporal dynamics of agriculture ecosystems. Among multiple retrieval techniques, hybrid approaches have been found to provide outstanding accuracy, for instance, for the inference of leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (fCover), and leaf and canopy chlorophyll content (LCC and CCC). The combination of radiative transfer models (RTMs) and data-driven models creates an advantage in the use of hybrid methods. Through this review paper, we aim to provide state-of-the-art hybrid retrieval schemes and theoretical frameworks. To achieve this, we reviewed and systematically analyzed publications over the past 22 years. We identified two hybrid-based parametric and hybrid-based nonparametric regression models and evaluated their performance for each variable of interest. From the results of our extensive literature survey, most research directions are now moving towards combining RTM and machine learning (ML) methods in a symbiotic manner. In particular, the development of ML will open up new ways to integrate innovative approaches such as integrating shallow or deep neural networks with RTM using remote sensing data to reduce errors in crop trait estimations and improve control of crop growth conditions in very large areas serving precision agriculture applications.

TI  - Mapping of soils and land-related environmental attributes in modern agriculture systems using geomatics
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for reliable information about soil water has become increasingly necessary in recent times. Which represent an important input data into ecological, hydrological, or land surface models. A total number of 460 soil samples were collected to perform inverse distance weighting (IDW) estimates to map some soil quality properties. Moreover, soil profiles were used to apply geo-statistical analysis. Maps were produced with available soil information on soil texture and organic matter. Their unknown reliability hampers the estimation of the accuracy of models that rely on soil information. The hydraulic properties of field soils can improve predictions for such models using remote sensing data (RS). Scientific study and models application at various geographic scales can both benefit from a reliable soil water map. It is also essential for the development and spatial implementation of the comprehensive soil quality index (SQ) planned in the examined study. The assessment of soil suitability for agricultural purposes was based on important physical, chemical and environmental parameters. It is indicated that 81% of the samples fall within the moderately appropriate category S-2. These samples are found in the upper and middle parts of the investigated area. The remaining percentage (19%), located in the south of the region, was marginally suitable for class S-3. The calculated coefficients were also used in addition to estimating the suitability of irrigation. Accordingly, most areas are unsuitable for (surface) irrigation under natural conditions and require a special type of irrigation method. Improving irrigation management techniques and using appropriate plants is the basis of irrigation water management according to soil characteristics.

TI  - Soil Moisture Mapping with Moisture-Related Indices, OPTRAM, and an Integrated Random Forest-OPTRAM Algorithm from Landsat 8 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing tools have been extensively used for large-scale soil moisture (SM) mapping in recent years, using Landsat satellite images. Rainfall, soil clay percentage, and the standardized precipitation index play key roles in determining the moisture content of crop fields. The objective of this study was to (i) calculate and determine the effectiveness of moisture-related indices in predicting surface SM, (ii) predict surface SM from satellite images using the Optical Trapezoid Model (OPTRAM), and (iii) evaluate if the OPTRAM predictions can be improved by incorporating weather station, soil, and crop data with a random forest algorithm. The ENVI (R) platform was used to create moisture-related indices maps, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to prepare OPTRAM maps. The results showed a very weak relationship between the moisture-related indices and surface SM content where r(2) and slopes were <0.10 and <0.20, respectively. OPTRAM SM, when compared with in situ surface moisture, showed weak relationship with regression values <0.2. Surface SM was then predicted using random forest regression using OPTRAM moisture values, rainfall, and the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and percent clay showed high goodness of fit (r(2) = 0.69) and low root mean square error (RMSE = 0.053 m(3) m(-)(3)).

AB  - We describe an efficient and cost-effective data access mechanism for Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode bursts. Our data access mechanism enables burst-based data access and processing, thereby eliminating the European Space Agency's (ESA's) Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) data packaging conventions as a bottleneck to large scale processing. The pipeline throughput is now determined by the available computation resources and the efficiency of the analysis algorithms. For targeted infrastructure monitoring studies, we are able to generate coregistered, geocoded stacks of SLCs for any area of interest (AOI) in the world, in a few minutes. In addition, we describe our global scale radar backscatter and interferometric products, and associated pipeline design decisions that ensure geolocation consistency across the suite of derived products from Sentinel-1 data. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of working with geocoded SLC data.

TI  - MONITORING OF COMBUSTION RELATED AIR POLLUTANTS OCCURRING AFTER FOREST FIRES WITH REMOTE SENSING IMAGES: A CASE STUDY TURKEY AND GREECE FIRES
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest fires, which cause multiple defects in ecosystems, economies and social life, are among the most destructive natural disasters in the world. In addition, forest fires are a very important source of gases and aerosols worldwide. Rapidly developing remote sensing systems and monitoring methods for atmospheric phenomena are of critical importance in observing environmental problems on a global scale, compared to traditional air pollution monitoring technologies. Air pollutant parameters caused by largescale fires in Turkey and Greece between July 26 and August 10 were analyzed and mapped with Sentinel-5P satellite images within this study. Also, significant information such as the directions and amounts of pollutants has been accessed by the maps created. Analyzes indicate that the highest Formaldehyde amount was determined as 0.001464 mol/m2, carbon monoxide (CO) was 0.7044 mol/m2, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) was determined as 0.0252 mol/m2. The results showed that satellite images contribute greatly to the identification and monitoring of pollutant patterns caused by forest fires. This information is critical for officials, emergency services and the local community during and after the hazard. Those maps created using satellite images will inform governments and lawmakers more effectively to reduce (or to prevent, if necessary) emission of pollutants.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF FOREST COVER LOSS ON LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE: A CASE STUDY OF KOCAELI PROVINCE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, large amounts of change have occurred in forest cover all over the world. The biggest reasons for the decrease in the forest cover areas were industrialization and conversion as rural settlements, urbanization, agricultural land, and forest cover thinning. Deforestation has various effects on the earth. One of the side effects of deforestation is the increase in Land Surface Temperature (LST). Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are some of the effective methods used for monitoring forest cover and LST change. However, accessing and processing satellite data is both time-consuming and costly. Therefore, the use of cloud technologies for this purpose is beneficial for rapid response. In the present study, the forest cover in the Kocaeli province boundaries and how much loss of this forest cover was investigated during the time period (2001-2020) with the help of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, GIS and RS. Also, the change in LST due to forest cover loss was studied by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In addition, the correlation relationship between forest loss and LST was also investigated. The amount of forest cover and total forest loss that has been computed on the GEE was 162196.84 and 10529.35 hectares (ha), respectively. Due to the loss of forest cover, LST values increased by 2.1 degrees C in the province.

TI  - Assessment Analysis of Flood Susceptibility in Tropical Desert Area: A Case Study of Yemen
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the catastrophic natural hazards worldwide that can easily cause devastating effects on human life and property. Remote sensing devices are becoming increasingly important in monitoring and assessing natural disaster susceptibility and hazards. The proposed research work pursues an assessment analysis of flood susceptibility in a tropical desert environment: a case study of Yemen. The base data for this research were collected and organized from meteorological, satellite images, remote sensing data, essential geographic data, and various data sources and used as input data into four machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this study, RS data (Sentinel-1 images) were used to detect flooded areas in the study area. We also used the Sentinel application platform (SNAP 7.0) for Sentinel-1 image analysis and detecting flood zones in the study locations. Flood spots were discovered and verified using Google Earth images, Landsat images, and press sources to create a flood inventory map of flooded areas in the study area. Four ML algorithms were used to map flash flood susceptibility (FFS) in Tarim city (Yemen): K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), random forests (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Twelve flood conditioning factors were prepared, assessed in multicollinearity, and used with flood inventories as input parameters to run each model. A total of 600 random flood and non-flood points were chosen, where 75% and 25% were used as training and validation datasets. The confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to validate the susceptibility maps. The results obtained reveal that all models had a high capacity to predict floods (AUC > 0.90). Further, in terms of performance, the tree-based ensemble algorithms (RF, XGBoost) outperform other ML algorithms, where the RF algorithm provides robust performance (AUC = 0.982) for assessing flood-prone areas with only a few adjustments required prior to training the model. The value of the research lies in the fact that the proposed models are being tested for the first time in Yemen to assess flood susceptibility, which can also be used to assess, for example, earthquakes, landslides, and other disasters. Furthermore, this work makes significant contributions to the worldwide effort to reduce the risk of natural disasters, particularly in Yemen. This will, therefore, help to enhance environmental sustainability.

TI  - Burn Severity Assessment Using Sentinel-1 SAR in the Southeast Peruvian Amazon, a Case Study of Madre de Dios
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the significant drivers of vegetation loss and threat to Amazonian landscapes. It is estimated that fires cause about 30% of deforested areas, so the severity level is an important factor in determining the rate of vegetation recovery. Therefore, the application of remote sensing to detect fires and their severity is fundamental. Radar imagery has an advantage over optical imagery because radar can penetrate clouds, smoke, and rain and can see at night. This research presents algorithms for mapping the severity level of burns based on change detection from Sentinel-1 backscatter data in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon. Absolute, relative, and Radar Forest Degradation Index (RDFI) predictors were used through singular polarization length (dB) patterns (Vertical, Vertical-VV and Horizontal, Horizontal-HH) of vegetation and burned areas. The Composite Burn Index (CBI) determined the algorithms' accuracy. The burn severity ratios used were estimated to be approximately 40% at the high level, 43% at the moderate level, and 17% at the low level. The validation dataset covers 384 locations representing the main areas affected by fires, showing the absolute and relative predictors of cross-polarization (k = 0.734) and RDFI (k = 0.799) as the most concordant in determining burn severity. Overall, the research determines that Sentinel-1 cross-polarized (VH) data has adequate accuracy for detecting and quantifying burns.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Monitoring in the Central Salt Range, Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion and exploitation of mining resources are essential for social and economic growth. Remote sensing provides vital tools for surface-mining monitoring operations as well as for reclamation efforts in the central Salt Range of the Indus River Basin, Pakistan. This research demonstrates the applicability of remote sensing techniques to the coal mining monitoring scheme to allow for effective and efficient monitoring and to offset the adverse consequences of coal mining activities. Landsat 8 OLI images from June 2019 and 2020, and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image from June 2002, were used for this study. A three-phase methodology including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis, land cover mapping, and change detection approaches was adopted. Image classification based on Tasseled Cap Transformation and the brightness temperature At-satellite using the K-means algorithm was implemented in a GIS program to identify seven land cover classes within the study area. The results show some level of surface disturbance to the landscape due to the coal mining reclamation activities that had taken place over the 18-year time period. From 2019 to 2020, about 3.622 km(2) of coal mines or barren land were converted into bare agricultural land. Over the years, it was also observed that reclamation areas exhibited higher values of NDVI than coal mining areas. The mean NDVI for coal mining areas was 0.252 km(2), and for areas of reclamation, it was 0.292 km(2) in 2020, while in 2019, the value for coal mining sites was 0.133 km(2), and 0.163 km(2) for reclamation sites. This trend suggests that coal-mining operations can be monitored using satellite data, and the progress of reclamation efforts can be assessed using satellite NDVI data from the target locations. This study is beneficial to agencies responsible for monitoring land cover changes in a coal mine because it provides a cost-effective, efficient, and robust scientific tool for making mine site allocation decisions and for monitoring the progress of reclamation efforts.

TI  - Analysis of Land Surface Temperature Dynamics in Islamabad by Using MODIS Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid pace of unattended urbanization has caused the urban heat island phenomenon, due to which the United Nations SDGs agenda 2030 calls for immediate actions for "sustainable cities and communities". In this context, the case of the emerging metropolitan city Islamabad has been studied based on its developmental discourse vis-a-vis associated environmental problems. A time-series trend for the land surface temperature was generated by investigating the change in minimum and maximum variability against a dataset of 1960-2012 which was obtained from the Pakistan Meteorological Department, along with MODIS LST images from January 2000 to December 2015. The statistical comparison of an eight-day composite of the maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature reveals an increasing trend with R-2 values of 0.2507 (Tmin) and 0.1868 (Tmax). The box plots for both the Tmin and Tmax depict changes in seasonal patterns for Islamabad, with summers becoming longer and winters becoming harsher. Moreover, the application of the Mann-Kendall test affirmed the slope of the R-2 linear trend map and showed the temperature regression in the Margalla Hills National Park and in such urban zones which had an expanded vegetative cover. These findings will act as a guide for urban planners and future researchers to maintain a standardized urban heat island and promote the concept of sustainable cities in the future course of action.

TI  - 3D Co-Seismic Surface Displacements Measured by DInSAR and MAI of the 2017 Sarpol Zahab Earthquake, Mw7.3
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 12 November 2017, an earthquake occurred in Sarpol Zahab city, located on the Iraq/Iran boundary, with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3. Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) L-band (23.6 cm wavelength) and C-band Sentinel-1A data (ascending and descending) were used to detect the co-seismic displacements maps caused by this earthquake. The ALOS-2 data was utilized to reconstruct the 3D co-seismic displacements maps, as well as estimate the fault-dip and slip distribution along the rupture. The results showed the maximum surface displacement in the north, east, and up directions to be 100, 50, and 100 cm, respectively. The best-fit faulting geometry had a strike of 337.5 degrees and a dip of 11.2 degrees toward the northeast, at a depth of 8 km. The predicted geodetic moment was 1.15 1020 Nm, which corresponds to a magnitude of Mw 7.31. There were two significant slip sources: one in the shallower depth range of 8.5-10 km, with a peak slip of 5 m, and another in the depth range of 10.5-20 km, with a peak slip of 5.3 m. Both controlled the principal deformation signals in geodetic images. The slip was concentrated, along with a strike distance of 20 to 40 km, at a depth of 10 to 20 km. The earthquake was caused by the Zagros Mountains Front Fault (ZMFF), based on the results of 3D co-seismic deformation, inferred slip, preliminary investigation, and interpretation of the mainshock, as well as aftershock distributions.

TI  - UAV-Based Hyperspectral Imagery for Detection of Root, Butt, and Stem Rot in Norway Spruce
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous species of pathogenic wood decay fungi, including members of the genera Heterobasidion and Armillaria, exist in forests in the northern hemisphere. Detection of these fungi through field surveys is often difficult due to a lack of visual symptoms and is cost-prohibitive for most applications. Remotely sensed data can offer a lower-cost alternative for collecting information about vegetation health. This study used hyperspectral imagery collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to detect the presence of wood decay in Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) at two sites in Norway. UAV-based sensors were tested as they offer flexibility and potential cost advantages for small landowners. Ground reference data regarding pathogenic wood decay were collected by harvest machine operators and field crews after harvest. Support vector machines were used to classify the presence of root, butt, and stem rot infection. Classification accuracies as high as 76% with a kappa value of 0.24 were obtained with 490-band hyperspectral imagery, while 29-band imagery provided a lower classification accuracy (similar to 60%, kappa = 0.13).

TI  - The Psychology of Communication: The Interplay Between Language and Culture Through Time
T2  - JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human behavior is often guided by the development and use of language as a means of communication and as a way to represent thoughts and knowledge. Notions of linguistic relativity and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis indicate that language plays a role in structuring the worldview and perceptions of individuals. The current work will explore how those perceptions are not only guided by language but are also moderated by culture and the beliefs, mores, and ideas that are sanctioned and regulated by a given cultural group. Papers, chapters, and books that have demonstrated the ways in which culture moderates behavior by way of the language that is used to express that culture will be of primary focus. Moreover, a developmental view of language learning will frame this approach in learning how language, culture, and thought have been examined and assessed as a way of describing how, together, they moderate human behavior. Is there truly evidence of linguistic relativity? Does language serve as the primary moderator of thought, or do cultural influences play a more pressing role in cognitive thought processes for a given group? Developments in theory, methods, and data that help explore these concepts through their publication in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology as well as other outlets will be presented and discussed as a framework that can be developed to generate future research questions, testing paradigms, and experimental approaches-both basic and applied.

TI  - Dental Pulp Fibroblast: A Star Cell
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDODONTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Dental pulp fibroblasts (DPFs) are the most abundant cell type in the dental pulp. They play pivotal roles; however, they are often mistaken to be involved only in the repair and maintenance of this connective tissue. Methods: We used the search terms "pulp fibroblast," "complement system proteins," "pulp inflammation," "angiogenesis," and "dentin pulp regeneration" to identify articles from the PubMed and Scopus databases. Results: These sentinel cells produce all complement system proteins participating in defense processes, control of inflammation, and dentin-pulp regeneration; produce several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and express pattern-recognition receptors, demonstrating their involvement in immunoregulatory mechanisms; express neuropeptides and their receptors, playing an important role in neurogenic inflammation and dental pulp wound healing; secrete angiogenic growth factors as well as neurotrophic proteins, essential for dentin-pulp regeneration; regulate neuronal plasticity processes; and can sense the external environment. Conclusions: This review highlights that DPFs are more than mere passive cells in pulp biology and presents an integrative analysis of their roles and functions.

TI  - Forty Years of Wetland Status and Trends Analyses in the Great Lakes Using Landsat Archive Imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide many benefits, such as water storage, flood control, transformation and retention of chemicals, and habitat for many species of plants and animals. The ongoing degradation of wetlands in the Great Lakes basin has been caused by a number of factors, including climate change, urbanization, and agriculture. Mapping and monitoring wetlands across such large spatial and temporal scales have proved challenging; however, recent advancements in the accessibility and processing efficiency of remotely sensed imagery have facilitated these applications. In this study, the historical Landsat archive was first employed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify wetlands (i.e., Bog, Fen, Swamp, Marsh) and non-wetlands (i.e., Open Water, Barren, Forest, Grassland/Shrubland, Cropland) throughout the entire Great Lakes basin over the past four decades. To this end, an object-based supervised Random Forest (RF) model was developed. All of the produced wetland maps had overall accuracies exceeding 84%, indicating the high capability of the developed classification model for wetland mapping. Changes in wetlands were subsequently assessed for 17 time intervals. It was observed that approximately 16% of the study area has changed since 1984, with the highest increase occurring in the Cropland class and the highest decrease occurring in the Forest and Marsh classes. Forest mostly transitioned to Fen, but was also observed to transition to Cropland, Marsh, and Swamp. A considerable amount of the Marsh class was also converted into Cropland.

TI  - Offshore Oil Slick Detection: From Photo-Interpreter to Explainable Multi-Modal Deep Learning Models Using SAR Images and Contextual Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean surface monitoring, emphasizing oil slick detection, has become essential due to its importance for oil exploration and ecosystem risk prevention. Automation is now mandatory since the manual annotation process of oil by photo-interpreters is time-consuming and cannot process the data collected continuously by the available spaceborne sensors. Studies on automatic detection methods mainly focus on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data exclusively to detect anthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) oil slicks, all using limited datasets. The main goal is to maximize the detection of oil slicks of both natures while being robust to other phenomena that generate false alarms, called "lookalikes". To this end, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slick detection on an extensive database of real and recent oil slick monitoring scenarios, including both types of slicks. It relies on slick annotations performed by expert photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data over four years and three areas worldwide. In addition, contextual data such as wind estimates and infrastructure positions are included in the database as they are relevant data for oil detection. The contributions of this paper are: (i) A comparative study of deep learning approaches using SAR data. A semantic and instance segmentation analysis via FC-DenseNet and Mask R-CNN, respectively. (ii) A proposal for Fuse-FC-DenseNet, an extension of FC-DenseNet that fuses heterogeneous SAR and wind speed data for enhanced oil slick segmentation. (iii) An improved set of evaluation metrics dedicated to the task that considers contextual information. (iv) A visual explanation of deep learning predictions based on the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method adapted to semantic segmentation. The proposed approach yields a detection performance of up to 94% of good detection with a false alarm reduction ranging from 14% to 34% compared to mono-modal models. These results provide new solutions to improve the detection of natural and anthropogenic oil slicks by providing tools that allow photo-interpreters to work more efficiently on a wide range of marine surfaces to be monitored worldwide. Such a tool will accelerate the oil slick detection task to keep up with the continuous sensor acquisition. This upstream work will allow us to study its possible integration into an industrial production pipeline. In addition, a prediction explanation is proposed, which can be integrated as a step to identify the appropriate methodology for presenting the predictions to the experts and understanding the obtained predictions and their sensitivity to contextual information. Thus it helps them to optimize their way of working.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change of ecologic environment quality and human interaction factors in three gorges ecologic economic corridor, based on RSEI
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three Gorges Ecologic Economic (Eco-Economic) Corridor is an ecological barrier in the Yangtze River's upstream and midstream areas. Due to anthropogenic activities, the corridor's ecologic environment quality has waned over the last few years. To achieve economic sustainability in this region, the premise is to assess the quality of the ecological environment in the corridor, which comprises the main counties, and to identify its response to human activities. As a result, this article developed the Remote Sensing Ecologic Index (RSEI) using MODIS data in the Three Gorges Eco-Economic Corridor from 2001 to 2019 to examine its ecological environment. Then human interaction factors affecting ecologic environment quality were probed using a Geographical Detector (geo-detector). The results showed that: (1) From 2001 to 2019, the average RSEI index of the Three Gorges Eco-Economic Corridor ranged between 0.474 and 0.655. The areas with ecological environment quality significantly worse and worse grades gathered in eastern and western regions, which is located alongside the Yangtze River and gradually radiated to surrounding areas. (2) The average ecologic environment quality level in the Three Gorges Eco-Economic Corridor was 78.19%, stable at about 75%-80% in most cases and medium and good area accounts for the main part. (3) Compared with the contribution of a single factor, multi-factor interaction had another noticeable effect on ecologic environment quality. Moreover, the top 10 multi-factor interactions were mainly between GDPs per capita and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. Our research findings can be used to the realization of green economic growth in the Three Gorges Eco-Economic Corridor.

TI  - Groundwater vulnerability assessment of an urban coastal phreatic aquifer in India using GIS-based DRASTIC model
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The groundwater pollution in shallow aquifers is usually an outcome of urbanisation resulting from the discharge of industrial and domestic effluents. Maps of aquifer vulnerability to pollution are becoming more in demand because it addresses the degree of sensitivity of the groundwater system towards changes in intrinsic and extrinsic factors. With this aim, the DRASTIC method was adopted to address the vulnerable groundwater zones for shallow aquifers of Greater Cochin and the surrounding region. Seven hydrogeological parameters either measured in-situ for 98 dug wells or derived from secondary sources and satellite data were integrated into a GIS platform and modelled using DRASTIC. Rating for the DRASTIC factors was derived based on weights assigned to each parameter. The resultant map depicted vulnerability index values ranging 79 to 174 reclassified as very high (> 144), high (144-131), medium (< 131 to 115) and low (< 115). About 68% of the total study area, characterised by porous and permeable aquifer media with shallow groundwater levels, displayed a very high to high vulnerability index value. The majority of the highly vulnerable area falls in the urban centre with high population density within the lowland region. Sensitivity analysis shows that aquifer media has the biggest effect on vulnerability assessment. Water quality analysis was carried out for groundwater samples collected from 41 dug wells. The degree of contamination was calculated by adding the concentration of metals. The susceptible zones based on the degree of contamination (Cd) cross verified with vulnerability index depicted a significant correlation between vulnerability zones. The study indicates that contamination and vulnerability to contami-nation is a main cause of concern for more than 3.82 million people living in the region. The study suggests that DRASTIC model can be used as an efficient tool to manage water-sensitive urban development and groundwater sustainability.

TI  - Quantifying Large-Scale Surface Change Using SAR Amplitude Images: Crater Morphology Changes During the 2019-2020 Shishaldin Volcano Eruption
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological processes often induce meter-scale elevation changes. When a volcano erupts, tracking such processes provides insights into the style and evolution of eruptive activity and related hazards. Compared to optical remote-sensing products, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observes surface change during inclement weather and at night. Differential SAR interferometry estimates phase change between SAR acquisitions and is commonly applied to quantify deformation. However, large deformation or other coherence loss can limit its use. We develop a new approach applicable when repeated digital elevation models (DEMs) cannot be otherwise retrieved. Assuming an isotropic radar cross-section, we estimate meter-scale vertical morphological change directly from SAR amplitude images via an optimization method that utilizes a high-quality DEM. We verify our implementation through simulation of a collapse feature that we modulate onto topography. We simulate radar effects and recover the simulated collapse. To validate our method, we estimate elevation changes from TerraSAR-X stripmap images for the 2011-2012 eruption of Mount Cleveland. Our results reproduce those from two previous studies; one that used the same dataset, and another based on thermal satellite data. By applying this method to the 2019-2020 eruption of Shishaldin Volcano, Alaska, we generate elevation change time series from dozens of co-registered TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight images. Our results quantify previously unresolved cone growth in November 2019, collapses associated with explosions in December-January, and further changes in crater elevations into spring 2020. This method can be used to track meter-scale morphology changes for ongoing eruptions with low latency as SAR imagery becomes available.

TI  - Sensitivity of surface roughness parameters on the simulation of boundary layer winds over a complex terrain site Kaiga in western India
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kaiga, in the Western Ghats region, has a hilly topography and dense forest canopy. In this study, the sensitivity of surface roughness length (z(o)) on the boundary layer winds over Kaiga is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for summer and winter seasons. Observational analysis shows high frequency of calm winds due to the flow blockage by the surrounding hills and surface drag from forest cover in the Kaiga valley. To realistically simulate the surface winds, surface roughness length is estimated using the sonic anemometer data and tower wind speed measurements employing the logarithmic profile relationship under neutral stability conditions for different months. The estimated z o varies in the range of 0.96-1.84 m in different seasons. To study the effect of forest cover on the wind field, WRF simulations are conducted using various roughness factors within the range of default value for evergreen broadleaf forest in the MODIS land-cover data used in the model and the highest estimated value, i.e., z(o) = 0.5 m, 0.75 m, 1.0 m, 1.25 m, and 1.50 m. Simulations show considerable overestimation of wind speed in control run (z(o)z(o) = 0.50 m) and experiments with increased roughness length reduced the bias in the surface wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. On average, the simulated winds are corrected by 2 m/s and 3 m/s for z(o) = 1.0 m and z(o) = 1.50 m, respectively. Increasing the surface roughness length also improved the prediction of the frequency of occurrence of calm winds to some extent. The assimilative capacity of the Kaiga valley atmosphere is evaluated by estimating the ventilation coefficient for the winter and summer seasons. It has been found that the model overestimated the surface winds and thus overpredicted the ventilation coefficient. By modifying the surface roughness length, the overestimation in the ventilation coefficient is corrected to an extent.

TI  - Monthly Burned-Area Mapping using Multi-Sensor Integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 and machine learning: Case Study of 2019?s fire events in South Sumatra Province, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has experienced massive historical land and forest fire events, creating transnational environmental and socioeconomic issues. The extent of burned areas (BAs) is one of many indicators that reflect the magnitudes and impacts from fire events, and such information is also used for planning the response and recovery steps after the fire events. This information is usually derived using remote sensing (RS) data. However, the assessment on the performance using available RS data, possible RS data combinations, and existing methods is needed to regularly monitor the BA extent. This study aims to assess the performance from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar polarization (Pol.) and gray-level of co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features and the integration with Sentinel-2 spectral data (Spec.) for the monthly mapping of BA extent using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). The study took place in the parts of Ogan Komering Ilir Regency and Banyuasin in South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. This area has complex land-use classes, such as natural vegetation and plantations (pulpwood and oil palm), which were affected by the 2019's fire events. Our study demonstrated that the combination between Pol. from Sentinel-1 and spectral data from Sentinel-2 (Diff.Pol + Spec.) yielded the best classification accuracy with the overall accuracy (OA) values ranging from 91.80% (XGB) to 95.80% (RF) with the producer's accuracy (PA) from 73.33% to 97.66% and user's accuracy (UA) from 76.69% to 89.80% for the BA class. The integration of spectral data using Sentinel-2 reduced the source of misclassification of BAs from false detection from the non-fire-related land-cover conversion, such as logging activities.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping in ovarian tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of the report: Since the presence of lymph node metastases upstages the disease and to reduce the morbidity of total lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in ovarian mass has been the focus of extensive research. This study aims to review all the literature associated with ovarian SLN mapping and assess the feasibility of ovarian SLN mapping. Materials and methods: PubMed and Scopus were searched using the following keywords: (Sentinel lymph node) AND (Ovary OR Ovarian) AND (Tumor OR Neoplasm OR Cancer). All studies with information regarding sentinel node biopsy in ovaries were included. Different information including mapping material, injection sites, etc., was extracted from each study. In total, two indices were calculated for included studies: detection rate and false-negative rate. Meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-MUMS software. Pooled detection rate, sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias were evaluated. Quality of the studies was evaluated using the Oxford center for evidence-based medicine checklist. Results: Overall, the systematic review included 14 studies. Ovarian SLN detection rate can vary depending on the type of tracer, site of injection, etc., which signifies an overall pooled detection rate of 86% [95% CI: 75-93]. The forest plot of detection rate pooling is provided (Cochrane Q-value = 31.57, p = 0.003; I-2 = 58.8%). Trim and fill method resulted in trimming of 7 studies, which decreased the pooled detection rate to 79.1% [95% CI: 67.1-87.5]. Overall, pooled sensitivity was 91% [59-100] (Cochrane Q-value = 3.93; p = 0.41; I-2 = 0%). The proportion of lymph node positive patients was 0-25% in these studies with overall 14.28%. Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node mapping in ovarian tumors is feasible and seems to have high sensitivity for detection of lymph node involvement in ovarian malignant tumors. Mapping material, injection site, and previous ovarian surgery were associated with successful mapping. Larger studies are needed to better evaluate the sensitivity of this procedure in ovarian malignancies.

TI  - Detection of Flash Flood Inundated Areas Using Relative Difference in NDVI from Sentinel-2 Images: A Case Study of the August 2020 Event in Charikar, Afghanistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 26 August 2020, a devastating flash flood struck Charikar city, Parwan province, Afghanistan, causing building damage and killing hundreds of people. Rapid identification and frequent mapping of the flood-affected area are essential for post-disaster support and rapid response. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine to evaluate the performance of automatic detection of flood-inundated areas by using the spectral index technique based on the relative difference in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (rdNDVI) between pre- and post-event Sentinel-2 images. We found that rdNDVI was effective in detecting the land cover change from a flash flood event in a semi-arid region in Afghanistan and in providing a reasonable inundation map. The result of the rdNDVI-based flood detection was compared and assessed by visual interpretation of changes in the satellite images. The overall accuracy obtained from the confusion matrix was 88%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.75, indicating that the methodology is recommendable for rapid assessment and mapping of future flash flood events. We also evaluated the NDVIs' changes over the course of two years after the event to monitor the recovery process of the affected area. Finally, we performed a digital elevation model-based flow simulation to discuss the applicability of the simulation in identifying hazardous areas for future flood events.

TI  - Land Use Change and Prediction for Valuating Carbon Sequestration in Viti Levu Island, Fiji
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines land use changes and evaluates the past and projected forest carbon sequestration and its valuation in Viti Levu Island, Fiji, through a combination of remote sensing with a geospatial-based modeling approach. Land use classification was performed using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imageries of the years 2000 and 2020; then, cellular automata and artificial neural network (CA-ANN) modeling was conducted to predict the land use map of 2040. Carbon sequestration and the economic valuation were estimated using the land use maps of the past, present, and future (2000, 2020, and 2040) within the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystems Trade-off (InVEST) model. The results showed that deforestation occurred during the past two decades, and the forest area was predicted to keep decreasing in 2040, with the major contribution from the conversion to the agricultural area. Local communities' perceptions confirmed that the forest conversion to croplands would persist due to the demand for fertile lands. This study estimated a loss of -7.337 megatonnes of forest carbon (Mt C) with an economic loss of USD -1369.38 million during 2000-2020 due to deforestation. If the business-as-usual scenario does not change in the near future, a potential carbon loss of -7.959 Mt C is predicted in the upcoming 20 years. The predicted results can be used to assist as a reference in establishing a national baseline and reference level for implementing the REDD+ mechanism in Fiji and sustainably managing the limited pristine forest by implementing forest-related programs.

TI  - Viticultural Suitability Analysis Based on Multi-Source Data Highlights Climate-Change-Induced Decrease in Potential Suitable Areas: A Case Analysis in Ningxia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a perennial plant with long productive span of 30-50 years, grapevine may experience cross-lifespan climate change, which can modify wine quality and challenge viticultural sustainability. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the viticultural suitability by considering both current and future climate conditions. To this end, a maximum entropy model was proposed to delimitate potentially suitable areas for viticulture based on multi-source data in a novel wine region, Ningxia, China, considering both current and future climate conditions. Firstly, we combined traditional data of climate, soil, and topography with remote sensing data to screen predictors that best characterize current geographical distribution of vineyards. Then, we used those predictors to assess current suitability (2001-2020) in Ningxia. The results indicated altitude, aridity index during April-September (K0409), precipitation during July-September (P0709), normalized difference vegetation index during July-September (NDVI0709), soil organic carbon (SOC), and precipitation in September (P09) were key predictors to assess potential suitability for viticulture, and their threshold values ranged from 1075 m to 1648 m, 2.93 to 4.83, 103.1 mm to 164.1 mm, 0.1 to 0.89, 0.07 g/kg to 11 g/kg and 28.4 mm to 45.0 mm, respectively. Suitability maps revealed a total suitable area of 12029 km(2), among which the highly and moderately suitable areas accounted for 6.1% and 23.1%, respectively. Finally, the alteration in proportion of potential suitable areas due to changing climate was estimated. The potential suitable areas varied from 8742 km(2) to 10623 km(2) over the next 40 years (2022-2060) and decreased to 8826-9184 km(2) under a short-term sustainability (suitable only during current-2040). To further consider long-term and sustainable development of the wine industry (current-2060), total suitable areas dropped by 26.7-29.2% under different climate scenarios compared with current suitable areas (2001-2020). The conclusions provide indispensable guidance for vineyard zoning considering long-term climate change.

TI  - On the Use of NDVI to Estimate LAI in Field Crops: Implementing a Conversion Equation Library
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a direct indicator of vegetation activity, and its relationship with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been investigated in many research studies. Remote sensing makes available NDVI data over large areas, and researchers developed specific equations to derive the LAI from the NDVI, using empirical relationships grounded in field data collection. We conducted a literature search using "NDVI" AND "LAI" AND "crop" as the search string, focusing on the period 2017-2021. We reviewed the available equations to convert the NDVI into the LAI, aiming at (i) exploring the fields of application of an NDVI-based LAI, (ii) characterizing the mathematical relationships between the NDVI and LAI in the available equations, (iii) creating a software library with the retrieved methods, and (iv) releasing a publicly available software as a service, implementing these equations to foster their reuse by third parties. The literature search yielded 92 articles since 2017, where 139 equations were proposed. We analyzed the mathematical form of both the single equations and ensembles of the NDVI to LAI conversion methods, specific for crop, sensor, and biome. The characterization of the functions highlighted two main constraints when developing an NDVI-LAI conversion function: environmental conditions (i.e., water and light resource, land cover, and climate) and the availability of recurring data during the growing season. We found that the trend of an NDVI-LAI function is usually driven by the ecosystem water availability for the crop rather than by the crop type itself, as well as by the data availability; the data should be adequate in terms of the sample size and temporal resolution for reliably representing the phenomenon under investigation. Our study demonstrated that the choice of the NDVI-LAI equation (or ensemble of equations) should be driven by the trade-off between the scale of the investigation and data availability. The implementation of an extensible and reusable software library publicly queryable via API represents a valid mean to assist researchers in choosing the most suitable equations to perform an NDVI-LAI conversion.

TI  - An Improved Vicarious Calibration Method Based on Multi-Grayscale Targets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious calibration is a well-developed method for electro-optical (EO) sensor calibration that has been used since the early 1980s. The radiometric calibration of reflectance solar band is mainly applied to reflection inversion. In this paper, a radiometric calibration-reflectance inversion (RCRII) model is proposed as an improved vicarious calibration method. Taking the reflectance of grayscale targets with constant spectrum, suitable uniformity, and near-Lambertian characteristics as the known information, the grayscale target calibration is realized, and the initial value of calibration coefficient and offset are calculated. Then, the adjacency effect is evaluated and corrected by reflectance inversion, and the results are fed back to the calibration process to realize the iterative process of calibration inversion rescaling. The results indicate that the absolute difference between the reflectance calculated with the RCRII model and measured reflectance is less than 0.01. By comparing with Sentinel-2A images, it is cross-verified that the difference of radiance between them is within 4%, and the absolute reflectance difference is less than 0.01, in the range of 0.1 similar to 0.3 reflectance.

TI  - Satellite-Based Flood Mapping through Bayesian Inference from a Sentinel-1 SAR Datacube
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are well-established systems for flood mapping, thanks to their high sensitivity towards water surfaces and their independence from daylight and cloud cover. Particularly able is the 2014-launched Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band SAR mission, with its systematic monitoring schedule featuring global land coverage in a short revisit time and a 20 m ground resolution. Yet, variable environment conditions, low-contrasting land cover, and complex terrain pose major challenges to fully automated flood monitoring. To overcome these issues, and aiming for a robust classification, we formulate a datacube-based flood mapping algorithm that exploits the Sentinel-1 orbit repetition and a priori generated probability parameters for flood and non-flood conditions. A globally applicable flood signature is obtained from manually collected wind- and frost-free images. Through harmonic analysis of each pixel's full time series, we derive a local seasonal non-flood signal comprising the expected backscatter values for each day-of-year. From those predefined probability distributions, we classify incoming Sentinel-1 images by simple Bayes inference, which is computationally slim and hence suitable for near-real-time operations, and also yields uncertainty values. The datacube-based masking of no-sensitivity resulting from impeding land cover and ill-posed SAR configuration enhances the classification robustness. We employed the algorithm on a 6-year Sentinel-1 datacube over Greece, where a major flood hit the region of Thessaly in 2018. In-depth analysis of model parameters and sensitivity, and the evaluation against microwave and optical reference flood maps, suggest excellent flood mapping skill, and very satisfying classification metrics with about 96% overall accuracy and only few false positives. The presented algorithm is part of the ensemble flood mapping product of the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) component of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).

TI  - Assessing Durum Wheat Yield through Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two modeling approaches for the estimation of durum wheat yield based on Sentinel-2 data are presented for 66 fields across three growing periods. In the first approach, a previously developed multiple linear regression model (VI-MLR) based on vegetation indices (EVI, NMDI) was used. In the second approach, the reflectance data of all Sentinel-2 bands for several dates during the growth periods were used as input parameters in three machine learning model algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and boosting regressions (BR). Modeling results were examined against yield data collected by a combine harvester equipped with a yield mapping system. VI-MLR showed a moderate performance with R-2 = 0.532 and RMSE = 847 kg ha(-1). All machine learning approaches enhanced model accuracy when all images during the growing periods were used, especially RF and KNN (R-2 > 0.91, RMSE < 360 kg ha(-1)). Additionally, RF and KNN accuracy remained high (R-2 > 0.87, RMSE < 455 kg ha(-1)) when images from the start of the growing period until March, i.e., three months before harvest, were used, indicating the high suitability of machine learning on Sentinel-2 data for early yield prediction of durum wheat, information considered essential for precision agriculture applications.

TI  - Resistance levels to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors among pregnant women with recent HIV infection in Malawi
T2  - ANTIVIRAL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Information on HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) prevalence in people newly diagnosed with HIV is limited. We implemented a cross-sectional study to estimate HIVDR prevalence among pregnant women recently infected with HIV in Malawi. Methods The HIVDR study was nested within a routine antenatal clinic (ANC) sentinel surveillance survey. Dried blood spot samples were tested for recent infection using a limiting antigen antibody assay together with HIV viral load testing. HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Drug susceptibility was predicted using Stanford HIVdb algorithm (version 8.9). Weighted analysis was performed in Stata 15.1. Results Of the 21,642 pregnant women enrolled in the ANC survey, 8.4% (1826/21,642) tested HIV positive. Of these, 5.0% (92/1826) had recent HIV infection, and 90.2% (83/92) were tested by PCR. The amplification and sequencing success rate was 57.8% (48/83). The prevalence of any HIVDR was 14.6% (5/45) (95% CI: 4.7-36.8%), all of which indicated HIVDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). HIVDR to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was 7.9% (2/45) (95% CI: 1.4-34.6%). Resistance to protease inhibitors currently in use in Malawi was not observed. Conclusions Despite the low number of cases with presumed TDR, our study hints that resistance to NNRTIs was high, above the 10% target for regimen change. Further investigation is needed to establish the exact magnitude of presumed TDR among women recently infected with HIV. These findings support the transition to an integrase inhibitor-based first-line regimen for patients initiating or on ART.

TI  - Unsupervised self-training method based on deep learning for soil moisture estimation using synergy of sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we present a novel unsupervised self-training method (USTM) for SM estimation. First, a ML model is trained using the labeled and unlabeled data. Then, the pseudo-labeled data are generated employing the second model by adding a proxy labeled data. Eventually, SM is estimated applying the third model by pseudo-labeled data generated by the second model and unlabeled data. The final SM estimation result is obtained by training the third model. Subsequently, in-situ measurements are performed to validate our method. The final model is an unsupervised learning model. Experiments were carried out at two different sites located in southern Tunisia using Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A data. The input data include the backscatter coefficient in two-mode polarization (sigma degrees(VV) and sigma degrees(VH)), derived from Sentinel-1A, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) for Sentinel-2A and in-situ data. The USTM method based on (Random Forest (RF)-Convolutional neural network (CNN)-CNN) combination allowed obtaining the best performance and precision rate, compared to other combinations (Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-CNN-CNN) and (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-CNN-CNN).

TI  - Self-Supervised Learning for Scene Classification in Remote Sensing: Current State of the Art and Perspectives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Deep learning methods have become an integral part of computer vision and machine learning research by providing significant improvement performed in many tasks such as classification, regression, and detection. These gains have been also observed in the field of remote sensing for Earth observation where most of the state-of-the-art results are now achieved by deep neural networks. However, one downside of these methods is the need for large amounts of annotated data, requiring lots of labor-intensive and expensive human efforts, in particular for specific domains that require expert knowledge such as medical imaging or remote sensing. In order to limit the requirement on data annotations, several self-supervised representation learning methods have been proposed to learn unsupervised image representations that can consequently serve for downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection or semantic segmentation. As a result, self-supervised learning approaches have been considerably adopted in the remote sensing domain within the last few years. In this article, we review the underlying principles developed by various self-supervised methods with a focus on scene classification task. We highlight the main contributions and analyze the experiments, as well as summarize the key conclusions, from each study. We then conduct extensive experiments on two public scene classification datasets to benchmark and evaluate different self-supervised models. Based on comparative results, we investigate the impact of individual augmentations when applied to remote sensing data as well as the use of self-supervised pre-training to boost the classification performance with limited number of labeled samples. We finally underline the current trends and challenges, as well as perspectives of self-supervised scene classification.

TI  - Analysis of algal bloom intensification in mid-Ganga river, India, using satellite data and neural network techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River Ganga is one of the most significant rivers in the country. This river is the adobe for numerous aquatic species and microorganisms. The color of the river suddenly changed to green due to the rise of algal bloom in the Varanasi and nearby regions of the river Ganga during May-June 2021. These algal blooms can be detrimental to the aquatic animals of the river. This study analyzes the occurrence and the possible reasons for the algal bloom generation in the river for the considered stretch. Several factors like nutrient accumulation in the river through agricultural run-off, warm river temperature, low flow condition of the river, thermal stratification, and less turbid river water can be considered as possible reasons for algal bloom development. In this work, the optical remote sensing-based Sentinel 2 datasets have been used for the duration of mid-May 2021 to mid-June 2021. These datasets have been processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and chlorophyll concentration has been calculated using different satellite-based indices or band ratios. The chlorophyll concentration measurements have quantified the algal bloom growth. These indices or band ratios have been analyzed using several artificial neural network (ANN) architectures like multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) along with the in situ values. It has been found that chlorophyll concentration has been highest for the mid-June 2021 time period in the considered river stretch.

TI  - Monitoring Lake Volume Variation from Space Using Satellite Observations-A Case Study in Thac Mo Reservoir (Vietnam)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates monthly variation of surface water volume of Thac Mo hydroelectric reservoir (located in South Vietnam), during the 2016-2021 period. Variation of surface water volume is estimated based on variation of surface water extent, derived from Sentinel-1 observations, and variation of surface water level, derived from Jason-3 altimetry data. Except for drought years in 2019 and 2020, surface water extent of Thac Mo reservoir varies in the range 50-100 km(2), while its water level varies in the range 202-217 m. Correlation between these two components is high (R = 0.948), as well as correlation between surface water maps derived from Sentinel-1 and free-cloud Sentinel-2 observations (R = 0.98), and correlation between surface water level derived from Jason-3 altimetry data and from in situ measurement (R = 0.99; RMSE = 0.86 m). We showed that water volume of Thac Mo reservoir varies between -0.3 and 0.4 km(3) month(-1), and it is in a very good agreement with in situ measurement (R = 0.95; RMSE = 0.0682 km(3) month(-1)). This study highlights the advantages in using different types of satellite observations and data for monitoring variation of lakes' water storage, which is very important for regional hydrological models. Similar research can be applied to monitor lakes in remote areas where in situ measurements are not available, or cannot be accessed freely.

TI  - Scanning Inside Volcanoes with Synthetic Aperture Radar Echography Tomographic Doppler Imaging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A problem with synthetic aperture radars (SARs) is that due to the poor penetrating action of electromagnetic waves within solid bodies, the ability to see through distributed targets is precluded. In this context, indeed, imaging is only possible for targets distributed on the scene surface. This work describes an imaging method based on the analysis of micro-motions present in volcanoes and generated by the Earth's underground heat. Processing the coherent vibrational information embedded in a single SAR image, in the single-look-complex configuration, the sound information is exploited, penetrating tomographic imaging over a depth of about 3 km from the Earth's surface. Measurement results are calculated by processing a single-look-complex image from the COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation satellite constellation of Vesuvius. Tomographic maps reveal the presence of the magma chamber, together with the main and the secondary volcanic conduits. This technique certainly paves the way for completely new exploitation of SAR images to scan inside the Earth's surface.

TI  - Integration of C-band SAR and high-resolution optical images for delineating palaeo-channels in Nagaur and Barmer districts, western Rajasthan, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying hitherto unknown palaeo-channels, especially in the arid regions of the Thar Desert, is crucial since these channels may form excellent aquifers, and are also associated with valuable ore deposits of many precious minerals. This study employed integrated C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) of Sentinel-1A and high-resolution multispectral Sentinel-2A data of pre- and post-monsoon seasons (June and November) to delineate playas and palaeo-channels. This approach is the first of its kind for this area. The palaeo-channels were delineated through a detailed visual inspection of colour composite (CC) images of Sentinel-2A data, SAR backscatter (VH) images and fused SAR and optical images. Then, we studied the topographic profiles generated from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission - Digital Elevation Model (SRTM-DEM) across the identified palaeo-channels, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to further confirm the existence of a palaeo-channel's course and playas. As a result, several playas and palaeo-channels in the area were successfully identified, some of which were previously unmapped and undetected. The results indicate that the post-monsoon datasets are more useful for the precise delineation of palaeo-channels due to the presence of relatively higher moisture along the palaeo-channels' courses.

TI  - Mapping Roads in the Brazilian Amazon with Artificial Intelligence and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents our efforts to automate the detection of unofficial roads (herein, roads) in the Brazilian Amazon using artificial intelligence (AI). In this region, roads are built by loggers, goldminers, and unauthorized land settlements from existing official roads, expanding over pristine forests and leading to new deforestation and fire hotspots. Previous research used visual interpretation, hand digitization, and vector editing techniques to create a thorough Amazon Road Dataset (ARD) from Landsat imagery. The ARD allowed assessment of the road dynamics and impacts on deforestation, landscape fragmentation, and fires and supported several scientific and societal applications. This research used the existing ARD to train and model a modified U-Net algorithm to detect rural roads in the Brazilian Amazon using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2020 in the Azure Planetary Computer platform. Moreover, we implemented a post-AI detection protocol to connect and vectorize the U-Net road detected to create a new ARD. We estimated the recall and precision accuracy using an independent ARD dataset, obtaining 65% and 71%, respectively. Visual interpretation of the road detected with the AI algorithm suggests that the accuracy is underestimated. The reference dataset does not include all roads that the AI algorithm can detect in the Sentinel-2 imagery. We found an astonishing footprint of roads in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, with 3.46 million km of roads mapped in 2020. Most roads are in private lands (similar to 55%) and 25% are in open public lands under land grabbing pressure. The roads are also expanding over forested areas with 41% cut or within 10 km from the roads, leaving 59% of the 3.1 million km(2) of the remaining original forest roadless. Our AI and post-AI models fully automated road detection in rural areas of the Brazilian Amazon, making it possible to operationalize road monitoring. We are using the AI road map to understand better rural roads' impact on new deforestation, fires, and landscape fragmentation and to support societal and policy applications for forest conservation and regional planning.

TI  - Evaluation of CanESM Cloudiness, Cloud Type and Cloud Radiative Forcing Climatologies Using the CALIPSO-GOCCP and CERES Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the annual and seasonal climatology of cloud fraction (CF) and cloud type simulated by the Canadian Environmental System Models (CanESMs) version 5 (CanESM5) and version 2 (CanESM2) at their fully coupled and AMIP configurations were validated against the CALIPSO-GOCCP-based CF. The CFs produced using the CALIPSO-COSP simulator based on the CanESMs data at their atmospheric (AMIP) configuration are also evaluated. The simulated shortwave, longwave, and net cloud radiative forcing using the AMIP version of the CanESM5 were also validated against satellite observations based on the recent CERES radiation satellite products. On average, all models have a negative bias in the total CF with global mean biases (MBs) of 2%, 2.4%, 3.9%, 6.4%, 5.6%, and 7.1% for the coupled-CanESM5, AMIP-CanESM5, COSP-AMIP-CanESM5, coupled-CanESM2, AMIP-CanESM2, and COSP-AMIP-CanESM2, respectively, indicating that the CanESM5 has a smaller MB. There were no significant differences between AMIP and coupled versions of the model, but the COSP-based model-simulated data showed larger biases. Although the models captured well the climatological features of CF, they also exhibited a significant bias in CF reaching up to 40% over some geographical locations. This is particularly prevalent over the low level (LL) marine stratocumulus/cumulus, convectively active tropical latitudes that are normally dominated by high level (HL) clouds and at the polar regions where all models showed negative, positive, and positive bias corresponding to these locations, respectively. The AMIP-CanESM5 model performed reasonably well simulating the global mean cloud radiative forcing (CRF) with slight negative biases in the NetCRF at the TOA and surface that would be expected if the model has a positive bias in CF. This inconsistent result may be attributed to the parameterization of the optical properties in the model. The geographical distributions of the model bias in the NetCRF, however, can be significant reaching up to +/- 40 Wm(-2) depending on the location and atmospheric level. The Pearson correlation showed that there is a strong correlation between the global distribution of model bias in NetCRF and CF and it is significantly influenced by the LL and HL clouds.

TI  - Changes in the Water Surface Area of Reservoirs of the Crimean Peninsula and Artificial Increases in Precipitation as One of the Possible Solutions to Water Shortages
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatic conditions of Crimea are semiarid; therefore, alternative sources of fresh water are needed. A significant increase in water use and consumption (due to the intensification of construction, industry, tourism, and militarization), along with the cessation of fresh water supplies from mainland Ukraine, has reduced the water levels in some reservoirs to critical levels, and climate change has exacerbated this situation. There has been a significant decrease in precipitation by 10-15% on the Crimean Peninsula, accompanied by an increase in surface temperature by 0.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C per 10 years during the period 1991-2020. The analysis of satellite-driven drought severity index reveals that the vast area of Crimean steppe is exposed to moderate-high drought risk. According to Landsat satellite imagery, there is a decreasing tendency for the water mirror area of all reservoirs, with a decrease of 34% on average in 2021 compared to 2015. The retrospective analysis of satellite images for 2015-2021 showed that the water surface area of the Simferopol reservoir had decreased on average by similar to 20% compared to 2015. To solve the problems associated with the shortage of fresh water, a series of works on the active influences on atmospheric processes was conducted, aimed at providing additional artificial precipitation. Two situations were considered, with mixed results: In the first case, on 30 October 2016, wet soil and standing water areas were detected by radar satellite imagery in agricultural fields within a radius of 40 km of the village of Petrovka, Krasnogvardiiskyi district, potentially related to the induction of precipitation by active influences on atmosphere. Meanwhile, in the second case, the realization of atmospheric precipitation occurred over Simferopol on 29-30 September 2020, leading to flooding in the city, but an increase in the water surface area of the Simferopol reservoir after active influences was not recorded.

TI  - The Use of Social Media in Children and Adolescents: Scoping Review on the Potential Risks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, social media has become part of our lives, even among children. From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic period, media device and Internet access rapidly increased. Adolescents connected Internet alone, consulting social media, mostly Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. During "lockdown", the Internet usage allowed communication with peers and the continuity activities such as school teaching. However, we have to keep in mind that media usage may be related to some adverse consequences especially in the most vulnerable people, such as the young. Aim of the review is to focus on risks correlated to social media use by children and adolescents, identifying spies of rising problems and engaging in preventive recommendations. The scoping review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, searching on PubMed the terms "social media" or "social network", "health", and "pediatrics". Excluding articles not pertinent, we found 68 reports. Out of them, 19 were dealing with depression, 15 with diet, and 15 with psychological problems, which appeared to be the most reported risk of social media use. Other identified associated problems were sleep, addiction, anxiety, sex related issues, behavioral problems, body image, physical activity, online grooming, sight, headache, and dental caries. Public and medical awareness must rise over this topic and new prevention measures must be found, starting with health practitioners, caregivers, and websites/application developers. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks associated to a problematic social media use for the young's health and identify sentinel signs in children as well as prevent negative outcomes in accordance with the family.

T2  - REVISTA DA ANPOLL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work proposes to bring the perspective of Jose Saramago's narrator closer to the baroque perspective, from the dialectical tension characteristic of allegory as elaborated by Walter Benjamin (1984). We associate the modernity of Benjamin's allegory in literature as a dialectical game that expresses the conflict and the laceration of the subject in the face of the precarious condition of his existence, in order to present the narrator's position as a fundamental authorial strategy for the presentation of the Portuguese author's worldview. As we perceive, the allegory will correspond to a "responsibility of the form" of Jose Saramago, an author known to be engaged with a political writing that reconciles the social denunciation with the dialogical and dialectical expressive force, crossed by irony and play with the reader.

TI  - Total Carbon Content Assessed by UAS Near-Infrared Imagery as a New Fire Severity Metric
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ash produced by forest fires is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic particles with many properties. Amounts of ash and char are used to roughly evaluate the impacts of a fire on nutrient cycling and ecosystem recovery. Numerous studies have suggested that fire severity can be assessed by measuring changes in ash characteristics. Traditional methods to determine fire severity are based on in situ observations, and visual approximation of changes in the forest floor and soil which are both laborious and subjective. These measures primarily reflect the level of consumption of organic layers, the deposition of ash, particularly its depth and color, and fire-induced changes in the soil. Recent studies suggested adding remote sensing techniques to the field observations and using machine learning and spectral indices to assess the effects of fires on ecosystems. While index thresholding can be easily implemented, its effectiveness over large areas is limited to pattern coverage of forest type and fire regimes. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, allow multivariate classifications, but learning is complex and time-consuming when analyzing space-time series. Therefore, there is currently no consensus regarding a quantitative index of fire severity. Considering that wildfires play a major role in controlling forest carbon storage and cycling in fire-suppressed forests, this study examines the use of low-cost multispectral imagery across visible and near-infrared regions collected by unmanned aerial systems to determine fire severity according to the color and chemical properties of vegetation ash. The use of multispectral imagery data might reduce the lack of precision that is part of manual color matching and produce a vast and accurate spatio-temporal severity map. The suggested severity map is based on spectral information used to evaluate chemical/mineralogical changes by deep learning algorithms. These methods quantify total carbon content and assess the corresponding fire intensity that is required to form a particular residue. By designing three learning algorithms (PLS-DA, ANN, and 1-D CNN) for two datasets (RGB images and Munsell color versus Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based multispectral imagery) the multispectral prediction results were excellent. Therefore, deep network-based near-infrared remote sensing technology has the potential to become an alternative reliable method to assess fire severity.

TI  - Landscape Analysis of Cobalt Mining Activities from 2009 to 2021 Using Very High Resolution Satellite Data (Democratic Republic of the Congo)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cobalt mining sector is well positioned to be a key contributor in determining the success of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Despite the important contribution to the DRC's economy, the rapid expansion of mining operations has resulted in major social, health, and environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the cumulative impact of mining activities on the landscape of a prominent cobalt mining area in the DRC. To achieve this, an object-based method, employing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, was used to map land cover across the city of Kolwezi and the surrounding mining areas, where long-term mining activity has dramatically altered the landscape. The research used very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery (2009, 2014, 2019, 2021) to map the spatial distribution of land cover and land cover change, as well as analyse the spatial relationship between land cover classes and visually identified mine features, from 2009 to 2021. Results from the object-based SVM land cover classification produced an overall accuracy of 85.2-90.4% across the time series. Between 2009 and 2021, land cover change accounted to: rooftops increasing by 147.2% (+7.7 km(2)); impervious surface increasing by 104.7% (+3.35 km(2)); bare land increasing by 85.4% (+33.81 km(2)); exposed rock increasing by 56.2% (+27.46 km(2)); trees decreasing by 4.5% (-0.34 km(2)); shrub decreasing by 38.4% (-26.04 km(2)); grass and cultivated land decreasing by 27.1% (-45.65 km(2)); and water decreasing by 34.6% (-3.28 km(2)). The co-location of key land cover classes and visually identified mine features exposed areas of potential environmental pollution, with 91.6% of identified water situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature, and vulnerable populations, with 71.6% of built-up areas (rooftop and impervious surface class combined) situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature. Assessing land cover patterns over time and the interplay between mine features and the landscape structure allowed the study to amplify the findings of localised on-the-ground research, presenting an alternative viewpoint to quantify the true scale and impact of cobalt mining in the DRC. Filling geospatial data gaps and examining the present and past trends in cobalt mining is critical for informing and managing the sustainable growth and development of the DRC's mining sector.

TI  - Advances in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Management
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is an increasingly prevalent and morbid cancer worldwide. Management of this cancer has changed significantly in the last decade through improved risk stratification and new therapies offering patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease more effective, less toxic, and more durable treatment options. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing new therapeutic options as well as optimizing existing regimens in efforts to better manage this cancer. The recent developments highlight the need for multidisciplinary care, especially for those with locally advanced and metastatic disease. cSCC is increasing in prevalence due to increased lifespans and improvements in survival for conditions that increase the risk of cSCC. The absolute mortality of cSCC exceeds melanoma in the United States and approaches that of melanoma worldwide. This review presents significant changes in the management of cSCC, focusing on improvements in risk stratification, new treatment options, optimization of existing treatments, and prevention strategies. One major breakthrough in cSCC treatment is the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which have ushered in a renaissance in the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease. These agents have offered patients with advanced disease decreased therapeutic toxicity compared to traditional chemotherapy agents, a more durable response after discontinuation, and improved survival. cSCC is an active field of research, and this review will highlight some of the novel and more developed clinical trials that are likely to impact cSCC management in the near future.

TI  - Poker-Faced and Godless: Expressive Suppression and Atheism
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To make sense of an apparent discrepancy between atheists' muted self-reports of positive and negative emotions versus stereotyped perceptions of them as cold, angry, hostile, and unhappy, three Canadian studies explored a hypothesized link between atheism and expressive suppression (ES: modulating emotion by restricting its display). In Study 1 (N = 1,059), atheists self-reported more ES compared to religious and agnostic/nonreligious groups, whereas cognitive reappraisal (CR: managing emotions by thinking differently about situations) scores did not differ. Study 2 (N = 247) tested whether ES facilitates openness to an atheistic worldview by dampening the intensity of positive emotions, a known facilitator of religious/spiritual receptivity: chronic preference for ES (vs. CR) predicted increased endorsement of atheism-congruent postmortem beliefs when participants were instructed to suppress (but not when instructed to express) their emotions. Blind to religious identity, Study 3 participants (N = 100) who watched silent video interviews perceived atheists to express less positive (but more negative) emotion compared to the religiously affiliated. Atheists were also judged to be less trustworthy and likable. By contributing to an observable grain of truth in stereotypic depictions of atheists' emotional demeanor, ES may exacerbate antiatheist prejudice even as it intensifies atheists' own convictions.

TI  - Analysis of land surface temperature with land use and land cover and elevation from NASA MODIS satellite data: a case study of Bali, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) offers numerous land products of the Earth's datasets. On the other hand, researchers find it difficult to retrieve this data for specific places. The methods for extracting and analyzing land surface temperature (LST), land use and land cover (LULC), and elevation are presented in this study. The R commands provided make the time-consuming process of extracting data for specific places much more accessible. As a result, a statistical study of LST over Bali is shown as an example. Over the 15 regions of Bali, a quadratic polynomial identified five possible warming patterns, while a logistic regression model assessed the probability of warming. The findings suggest that 25.2% of Bali has warmed during the last two decades, with temperatures being highest in urban and built-up areas and deciduous forests and inversely associated with elevation. Global warming has sparked a lot of academic interest and has become a serious climate problem. The techniques proposed in this work simplify the extraction of LST, LULC, and elevation data from MODIS satellites. These approaches can also be used on other datasets with identical topologies, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), aerosol optical depth (AOD), and night light data.

TI  - Multispectral satellite imagery processing to recognize and analyze archaeological sites in the central area of Sicily (Italy)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to improve the study of archaeological sites in the territory of Milena, a town located in Sicily (Italy). Between the 80 s and 90 s different excavation campaigns had documented numerous prehistoric sites. However, most of the ancient settlements have yet to be discovered and studied. The search operations are made difficult by the large size of the territory and its geomophorological characteristics. In fact, many settlements stand on chalky hills that are rapidly crumbling, risking damage to the archaeological remains. To intervene as soon as possible, we have relied on the use of modern approaches, capable of speeding up the work of researchers. Here we propose a new approach based on remote sensing and the GIS technology to detect archaeological sites. In particular, we used multispectral remote sensing data in a GIS environmental both for predictive and post-dictive analyses. We were able to locate areas where there are ceramics and elements that can be recoded to human settlements. The quality of the results depends on the choice of the remotely sensed images, which can have different spectral characteristics, on the acquisition period, but also on the preprocessing algorithms adopted for the classification in the GIS environment.

TI  - Geotechnologies as decision support strategies for the identification of fire-susceptible areas in Rio de Janeiro State
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires have global, regional, and local socioeconomic and environmental consequences, with negative effects on ecosystem services, air quality, population health, and other relevant aspects, emphasizing their significance in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The study identified areas in the Rio de Janeiro State (RJS) with varying degrees of susceptibility to fire focis using remote sensing data derived from topographic, anthropogenic, meteorological, and hydrological factors based on seasonality and integrated into geographic information systems. The analytical hierarchy process was used as a method of integration and normalized hierarchy of variables, generating susceptibility maps in the annual, summer, and winter periods in the RJS's hydrographic regions (HR), with the application of the associated chi-square test to records of fire focis from the AQUA satellite, period 2003 to 2017, without methodological variation for data acquisition, whose susceptibility was classified as very low to very high. The results show that the years with the most fire foci in the adopted time series are 2007 and 2014, with a peak in September and a fall from October onwards. According to the susceptibility map, 9% of the RJS is highly susceptible during the annual period, with HR-IX being especially vulnerable. In the summer, 0.2% of RJS is extremely vulnerable, while 32% is highly vulnerable in the winter, with 6402 km(2) of HR-IX areas being extremely vulnerable. A statistical correlation was discovered between the chi-square test and susceptible areas. This work contributes as a decision-making tool in fire planning and emergency response, with the potential to assist control bodies (city halls, civil defense, environmental protection bodies, health systems) in the local and regional context in the assessment, analysis, and management of these phenomena.

TI  - Retrieval of Suspended Sediment Concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary Using Multi-Source Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and quantifying suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in estuaries such as the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) provide crucial information for environmental processes, hydrological infrastructure, and navigation. Traditional SSC mapping based on in situ investigations lacks the spatial coverage necessitated by detailed analysis. In this study, based on in situ spectral data and SSC measurements, we developed models to quantify SSC based on Landsat TM/OLI and Sentinel-2 imagery. The models were then used to map the SSC distribution in the PRE for the period 1986-2020. The results indicated that SSC in the entire PRE displayed an overall decreasing trend over the past 35 years, but an abnormal increase was also observed in shallow waters near Hengmen. Geographically, the concentration along the west coast is higher than on the east coast, and the central part of Lingding Bay underwent a slight increase. The decreased sediment output from the Pearl River Basin is the major cause of the decreasing changes in SSC. However, the natural factors and human activities such as channel dredging and the construction of artificial facilities can also disturb the spatial distribution of SSC. Regions with a significant decrease in SSC should have special concerns about retaining the PRE's health and sustainability.

TI  - Discerning Spatiotemporal Patterns and Policy Drivers of Rural Settlement Changes from 1962 to 2020
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite two centuries of urbanisation worldwide, 45% of the world's people still live in rural areas. Driven by urban development, the form and structure of rural settlements have undergone drastic changes. Reasonable planning according to the scale of the land and spatial layout of rural settlements is particularly important for the development of rural areas. The continuous development of the economy means that the housing needs of farmers and the macro policy background will inevitably change. We create a relationship curve for the "policy-scale of rural settlements" in different periods according to the laws of Maslow's psychological demand theory and game theory and conduct an empirical study on Dingzhou City, China. The limited availability of remote sensing data means it is difficult to map the evolution patterns of rural settlements on medium and long time scales, and therefore, this paper explores and decrypts military satellite images, reveals the spatial evolution characteristics of rural settlements in Dingzhou, China from 1962 to 2020, and discusses the impact of policy factors on changes to rural settlements in different periods. The study found that from 1962 to 2020, the total area of rural settlements in Dingzhou showed a trend of continual increase, with a total increase of 8354.97 ha (73%). The average annual growth rates in 1962-1972, 1972-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2020 were 0.29%, 1.17%, 1.81%, 1.26%, and 0.05%, respectively. The growth rate of rural settlements was relatively slow from 1962 to 1972. The policy was mainly because rural homesteads (land for building rural residences) were transformed from private ownership to "one homestead, two systems", and the expansion of rural settlements was inhibited. From 1972 to 1990, with the deepening of reform and opening up, there was a boom in building houses in rural areas, and the growth rate of rural settlements increased. From 1990 to 2000, although the state strengthened the management of rural settlement use, there was still an increasing trend in the area of rural settlements; from 2000 to 2020 the implementation of policies such as "one house for one household" and "connecting increase and decrease" meant that the growth rate of rural settlements slowed.

TI  - GF-1 Satellite Imagery Data Service and Application Based on Open Data Cube
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the application of big data in Earth observation, satellite imagery data are gradually becoming important means of observation for monitoring changes in vegetation, water bodies, and urbanization. Therefore, new satellite imagery data organization and management paradigms are urgently needed to fully mine the useful information from these data and provide new ways to better quantify and serve the sustainable development of resources and the environment. In this paper, a framework for processing and analyzing Chinese GF-1 satellite imagery data was developed using the latest technologies such as Open Data Cube (ODC) grids, Analysis Ready Data (ARD) generation, and space subdivision, which extended the data loading and processing capacities of the ODC grids for Chinese satellite imagery data. Using the proposed framework, we conducted a case study to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in vegetation and water mapping with GF-1 data collected from 2014 to 2021 covering the Miyun Reservoir, Beijing, China. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework had significantly improved temporal and spatial efficiency compared with the traditional scene-based data management approach, thus demonstrating the advantages and potential of the ODC grids as a new data management paradigm.

TI  - Reconstructing High-Spatiotemporal-Resolution (30 m and 8-Days) NDVI Time-Series Data for the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2000-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest and highest alpine ecoregion in the world, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is extremely sensitive to climate change and has experienced extraordinary warming during the past several decades; this has greatly affected various ecosystem processes in this region such as vegetation production and phenological change. Therefore, numerous studies have investigated changes in vegetation dynamics on the QTP using the satellite-derived normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data provided by the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, the highest spatial resolution of only 250 m for the MODIS NDVI product cannot meet the requirement of vegetation monitoring in heterogeneous topographic areas. In this study, therefore, we generated an 8-day and 30 m resolution NDVI dataset from 2000 to 2020 for the QTP through the fusion of 30 m Landsat and 250 m MODIS NDVI time-series data. This dataset, referred to as QTP-NDVI30, was reconstructed by employing all available Landsat 5/7/8 images (>100,000 scenes) and using our recently developed gap-filling and Savitzky-Golay filtering (GF-SG) method. We improved the original GF-SG approach by incorporating a module to process snow contamination when applied to the QTP. QTP-NDVI30 was carefully evaluated in both quantitative assessments and visual inspections. Compared with reference Landsat images during the growing season in 100 randomly selected subregions across the QTP, the reconstructed 30 m NDVI images have an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.022 and a spatial structure similarity (SSIM) above 0.094. We compared QTP-NDVI30 with upscaled cloud-free PlanetScope images in some topographic areas and observed consistent spatial variations in NDVI between them (averaged SSIM = 0.874). We further examined an application of QTP-NDVI30 to detect vegetation green-up dates (GUDs) and found that QTP-NDVI30-derived GUD data show general agreement in spatial patterns with the 250 m MODIS GUD data, but provide richer spatial details (e.g., GUD variations at the subpixel scale). QTP-NDVI30 provides an opportunity to monitor vegetation and investigate land-surface processes in the QTP region at fine spatiotemporal scales.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial-Temporal Variations and Driving Factors of Typical Tail-Reach Wetlands in the Ili-Balkhash Basin, Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ili River Delta (IRD) is the largest delta in the arid zone of Central Asia. Since the 1970s, the entire delta system has undergone a series of changes due to climate change and the impoundment of the Kapchagay Reservoir upstream of the delta, triggering an ecological crisis. Wetlands play a crucial ecological role in biodiversity conservation. Most studies have mainly focused on the response of vegetation and soil microbial to ecological changes in the delta, ignoring the dynamic processes of wetlands changes. Hence, such changes in the IRD and the underlying mechanisms need to be investigated in depth. In this study, wetlands in the IRD from 1975 to 2020 were extracted based on Landsat images using the object-oriented method; changes in the wetland area, wetland landscape pattern, NDVI, and NPP were analyzed; and the contributions of natural and human factors to wetland evolution were quantified. The results indicated the following: (1) From 1975 to 2020, the wetland area of the IRD showed an increasing trend, and changes in the wetland area were mainly found in the middle part of the delta near the Saryesik Peninsula. (2) The wetland landscape pattern in the IRD changed markedly from 1975 to 2020. The dominant patches of the wetland in the middle of the delta continued to expand; the patch aggregation index (AI) increased, and the landscape fragmentation index (LFI) decreased. (3) From 2000 to 2020, the average annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and net primary productivity (NPP) in the IRD increased, which is consistent with the change in wetland expansion. (4) Inflow to the delta from the Ili River and the water level of Balkhash Lake are significantly correlated with the wetland area, which are the dominant factors driving wetland evolution; and water evaporation from the Kapchagay Reservoir and irrigation water diversion on the left bank of the reservoir obviously intensified the process of lake water level decline and wetland degradation during 1970 to 1985. These results can provide scientific background for making informed ecological protection decisions in the IRD under the impacts of climate change and human activities.

TI  - Romantic irony and the education of the gaze: a reflection on Jose Saramago's works
T2  - REVISTA DA ANPOLL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a reflection on irony in Jose Saramago's works, not only as a rhetorical strategy, but mainly as a romantic irony. Since Baltasar and Blimunda, Saramago has woven a link between the intrusions of his narrators and a subliminal project of education of the gaze that came to be revealed explicitly through the epigraph of Blindness. By ostensibly using the ironic discourse that David Muecke (1995) categorizes as instances of situational and verbal irony, Saramago points to "ethical values [that] are born ingrained in aesthetic value" (GRAcA apud JAMES, 1995, p.11); values that continue to question the past and the present. Thus, the article proposes the analysis of the ironic ethos that manifests itself in Saramago's novels as the presentification of the author's worldview.

TI  - Analysis of Biophysical Variables in an Onion Crop (<i>Allium cepa</i> L.) with Nitrogen Fertilization by Sentinel-2 Observations
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of onions bulbs (Allium cepa L.) requires a high amount of nitrogen. According to the demand of sustainable agriculture, the information-development and communication technologies allow for improving the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization. In the south of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 8000 and 10,000 hectares per year are cultivated in the districts of Villarino and Patagones. This work aimed to analyze the relationship of biophysical variables: leaf area index (LAI), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), and canopy cover factor (fCOVER), with the nitrogen fertilization of an intermediate cycle onion crop and its effects on yield. A field trial study with different doses of granulated urea and granulated urea was carried out, where biophysical characteristics were evaluated in the field and in Sentinel-2 satellite observations. Field data correlated well with satellite data, with an R-2 of 0.91, 0.96, and 0.85 for LAI, fCOVER, and CCC, respectively. The application of nitrogen in all its doses produced significantly higher yields than the control. The LAI and CCC variables had a positive correlation with yield in the months of November and December. A significant difference was observed between U250 (62 Mg ha(-1)) and the other treatments. The U500 dose led to a yield increase of 27% compared to U250, while the difference between U750 and U500 was 6%.

TI  - Modern Pyromes: Biogeographical Patterns of Fire Characteristics across the Contiguous United States
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, wildfires in many areas of the United States (U.S.) have become larger and more frequent with increasing anthropogenic pressure, including interactions between climate, land-use change, and human ignitions. We aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of contemporary fire characteristics across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We derived fire variables based on frequency, fire radiative power (FRP), event size, burned area, and season length from satellite-derived fire products and a government records database on a 50 km grid (1984-2020). We used k-means clustering to create a hierarchical classification scheme of areas with relatively homogeneous fire characteristics, or modern 'pyromes,' and report on the model with eight major pyromes. Human ignition pressure provides a key explanation for the East-West patterns of fire characteristics. Human-dominated pyromes (85% mean anthropogenic ignitions), with moderate fire size, area burned, and intensity, covered 59% of CONUS, primarily in the East and East Central. Physically dominated pyromes (47% mean anthropogenic ignitions) characterized by relatively large (average 439 mean annual ha per 50 km pixel) and intense (average 75 mean annual megawatts/pixel) fires occurred in 14% of CONUS, primarily in the West and West Central. The percent of anthropogenic ignitions increased over time in all pyromes (0.5-1.7% annually). Higher fire frequency was related to smaller events and lower FRP, and these relationships were moderated by vegetation, climate, and ignition type. Notably, a spatial mismatch between our derived modern pyromes and both ecoregions and historical fire regimes suggests other major drivers for modern U.S. fire patterns than vegetation-based classification systems. This effort to delineate modern U.S. pyromes based on fire observations provides a national-scale framework of contemporary fire regions and may help elucidate patterns of change in an uncertain future.

TI  - Anatomical breast imaging-derived parameters do not provide incremental information in prediction of nonvisualization of sentinel lymph nodes on lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Accurate sentinel lymph node (SLN) staging is essential for both prognosis and treatment in patients with breast cancer. However, the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy may fail to visualize the SLN. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether parameters derived from anatomical breast imaging can predict SLN nonvisualization on lymphoscintigraphy. Methods For this retrospective study, all data of mammography, breast MRI, and lymphoscintigraphy of SLN procedures from January 2016 to April 2021 were collected and reviewed from the Amsterdam UMC database. Results A total of 758 breast cancer patients were included in this study. SLN nonvisualization on planar lymphoscintigraphy at 2-h postinjection (pi) was 29.7% and was reduced after a second injection to 7.5% at late lymphoscintigraphy 4-h pi. Multivariable analysis showed that age >= 70 years (P = 0.019; OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.10-3.01), BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) (P = 0.031; OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.04-2.43), and nonpalpable tumors (P = 0.034; OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.03-2.04) were independent predictors of SLN nonvisualization. Differences in tumor size, Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System classification, or breast density were not significantly associated with SLN nonvisualization. Conclusion This study shows that, by using a multivariable analysis, risk factors for SLN nonvisualization in breast cancer patients during preoperative lymphoscintigraphy at 2-h pi are age >= 70 years, BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), and nonpalpable tumors. Parameters derived from mammography or breast MRI, however, are not useful to predict SLN nonvisualization on lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution Characteristics of Urbanization in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone Based on Nighttime-Light Data from 1992 to 2020
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In China and elsewhere, urban expansion is directly related to the important issues of social development, economic development, and the sustainable development of the ecological environment. Traditional statistical methods based on administrative regions lack geospatial information, which makes it difficult to analyze and explore in detail the development status and spatial differences of cities. In real time, nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing can reveal the spatial expansion change information of urban built-up areas (UB) on different scales, thus allowing for the analysis of urban spatial patterns and variations in urban development. Based on the long-time sequence NTL data from 1992 to 2020, this work studies the Xiamen Special Economic Zone by using the vegetation-water-adjusted NTL urban index (VWANUI) to extract the urban built-up areas and study the UB expansion patterns, the migration of the urban center of gravity, and intra-city differences. The result is a qualitative and quantitative temporal and spatial evaluation of Xiamen's economic development characteristics. The results show that the UB of Xiamen expanded 349.219 km(2) from 1995 to 2020, mainly concentrated in the period 2005-2020, during which time 79.44% of the expansion of the whole study period occurred. Throughout the study period, the urban center of gravity of Xiamen city shifts 8757.15 m to the northeast at the rate of 350.29 m/year in the direction of 74.88 degrees (the urban center of gravity shifted from the inner island to the outer island). The total brightness of nighttime lights in Xiamen is gradually increasing, indicating that the level of urban economic development continuously improved over the measurement period, that human social activities have strengthened, and that the cross-island development strategy has produced certain results. These results provide data that describe urban development and policy formulation in Xiamen.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of the Occurrence and Spread of Wildfires in Southwest Madagascar
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The island of Madagascar, located in the southern hemisphere between the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Indian Ocean, 450 km from the African continent, is particularly affected by wildfires. The vegetation of the phytogeographic Western Domain of the island consists largely of savannas, wooded grassland, and secondary grassland, maintained by the repeated action of fire operating each year on a seasonal cycle. Rural populations employ fire to manage land use. Depending on the burning practice and the environment in which the fires happen, the impacts vary. This paper supplement the studies that have so far located and quantified wildfires by taking into account their different behaviors, particularly their spread. We analyzed the modalities of the relationship between the two fire products, active fire and burned area, derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to establish a typology based on fire spread patterns. We identified three general patterns of fire behaviors, as well as their locations in the studied area. Spatial analysis of this patterns enabled us to understand spatial logics better. Type 1 fires are the least frequently observed and have many active fires, but little or no burned area. Type 2 fires are the most common and have areas that burn like a mosaic. Type 3 fires are observed slightly less frequently than the previous type and have few active fires and large burned areas. An inter-annual analysis reveals the spatial stability or variability of these fire types.

TI  - Investigation of Spatio-Temporal Changes in Land Use and Heat Stress Indices over Jaipur City Using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat waves are expected to intensify around the globe in the future, with a potential increase in heat stress and heat-induced mortality in the absence of adaptation measures. India has high current exposure to heat waves, and with limited adaptive capacity, impacts of increased heat waves might be quite severe. This paper presents a comparative analysis of urban heat stress/heatwaves by combining temperature and vapour pressure through two heat stress indices, i.e., Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) and humidex index. For the years 1970-2000 (historical) and 2041-2060 (future), these two indicators were estimated in Jaipur. Another goal of this research is to better understand Jaipur land use changes and urban growth. For the land use study, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data from the years 1993, 2010, and 2015 were examined. During the research period, urban settlement increased and the majority of open land is converted to urban settlements. In the coming term, all months except three, namely July to September, have seen an increase in the WBGT index values; however, these months are classified as dangerous. Humidex's historical value has been 21.4, but in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, it will rise to 25.5 and 27.3, respectively, and slip into the danger and extreme danger categories. The NDVI and SAVI indices are also used to assess the city's condition during various periods of heat stress. The findings suggest that people's discomfort levels will rise in the future, making it difficult for them to work outside and engage in their usual activities.

TI  - Mapping Dynamic Turbidity Maximum Zone of the Yellow River Estuary from 38 Years of Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) plays a crucial role in estuarine ecosystems, exerting effects on erosion, environment evolution and socioeconomic activities in the coastal area. However, the long-term understanding of the TMZ in large river estuary such as the Yellow River estuary is still lacking. In this study, we focus on the TMZ distribution, variation and regulation mechanisms in the Yellow River estuary from different time scales. Based on time series Landsat images during the period 1984 to 2021 and Google Earth Engine (GEE), we proposed a TMZ extracting method in the Yellow River estuary to generate 322 TMZ maps. The overall accuracy of our algorithm reached 97.4%. The results show that there are clear decadal and seasonal TMZ variations during the 38-year period in the Yellow River estuary. Morphology, currents and wind speeds combined with seawater stratification have direct effects on TMZ at different time scales, while the direct impacts of tides and fluvial output of the Yellow River on TMZ are limited. In this article, the highly robust method provides a cost-effective alternative to accurately map the TMZ in global large river estuaries and systematically reveals the spatiotemporal evolution of TMZ, shedding light on the response mechanism of coastal geomorphology, marine ecological environment and biogeochemical cycle.

TI  - Evaluating Skill of the Keetch-Byram Drought Index, Vapour Pressure Deficit and Water Potential for Determining Bushfire Potential in Jamaica
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bushfire management which incorporates fire potential indices is still in its infancy in Jamaica and the Caribbean. In this study three bushfire potential indices-Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) and Water Potential (psi(w))-are calculated for south-central Jamaica where bushfire frequencies are highest. The skills of the indices are evaluated using their representation of the normalised bushfire climatology, monthly and seasonal (December-March/DJFM; April-June/AMJ; July-August/JA and September-November/SON) fire variability for the periods 2013-2017, 2010-2019 and 2001-2019. Fire data are obtained from the MODIS C6 Archive and Jamaica Fire Brigade (JFB). The relationship between the fire indices and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric features are also examined. The results suggest that psi(w) exhibits strong correlations with the MODIS and JFB climatologies and represents well the maxima in March and July and the local minima in May-June and October. psi(w) and VPDI also show good hit rates for moderate and high-risk categories in south-central Jamaica (though with relatively high false alarm rates). Regression models premised on psi(w) and VPD respectively show good skill in representing AMJ (R-2 = 57-58%), SON (R-2 = 57-58%) and JA (R-2 = 57-60%) fire variability. Variability during DJFM is poorly captured by any fire index. Although the KBDI represents the normalised climatology reasonably well its peaks occur one month later, that is, in April and August. KBDI exhibits strong and statistically significant correlations with JFB and MODIS climatologies, but seasonal models premised on KBDI do not perform as well as for the other two indices except in JA. All indices had a statistically significant relationship on both monthly and 1 month lag time scales for NINO3 and TNA-NINO3 large-scale climate indices. The indices, and in particular psi(w), show good prospects for producing seasonal bushfire outlooks for south-central Jamaica and Jamaica in general. These results also suggest the usefulness of monitoring large-scale oceanic patterns as part of the monitoring framework for bushfires in the island.

TI  - Beyond green environments: Multi-scale difference in human exposure to greenspace in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenspace exposure metrics can allow for comparisons of green space supply across time, space, and population groups, and for inferring patterns of variation in opportunities for people to enjoy the health and recreational benefits of nearby green environments. A better understanding of greenspace exposure differences across various spatial scales is a critical requirement for lessening environmental health disparities. However, existing studies are typically limited to a single city or across selected cities, which severely limits the use of results in measuring systemic national and regional scale differences that might need policy at above individual city planning level. To close this knowledge gap, our study aims to provide a holistic assessment of multi-scale greenspace exposure across provinces, cities, counties, towns, and land parcels for the whole of China. We mapped the nationwide fractional greenspace coverage at 10 m with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, and then modeled population-weighted greenspace exposure to examine variation of greenspace exposure across scales. Our results show a prominent scaling effect of greenspace exposure across multi-scale administrative divisions in China, suggesting, as expected, an increase in heterogeneity with finer spatial scales. We also identify an asymmetric pattern of the difference between greenspace exposure and greenspace coverage, across a geo-demographic demarcation boundary (i.e., along the Heihe-Tengchong Line). In general, the greenspace coverage rate will overestimate more realistic human exposure to greenspace in East China while underestimating in West China. We further found that, in China, more recently urbanized areas have much better greenspace exposure than older urban areas. Our study provides a spatially explicit greenspace exposure metric for discovering multi-scale greenspace exposure difference, which will enhance governments' capacity to quantify environmental justice, detect vulnerable greenspace exposure risk hotspots, prioritize greenspace management at the supra-city scale, and monitor the balance between greenspace supply and demand.

TI  - Analysis Long-Term and Spatial Changes of Forest Cover in Typical Karst Areas of China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, China has exhibited the fastest and most remarkable social-economic development in the world. As a result of such development, the forest cover of the country has undergone radical changes. This paper aims to develop a method for analyzing long-term and spatial changes in forest cover based on historical maps and remote sensing images. Moreover, we will focus on the reduction or restoration of forests distributed at different altitudes, slopes, soils, and lithologic types in different periods, to reveal the problems that should be paid attention to in forest restoration in karst areas. A typical county of China was selected as the study area. A historical military operation map was considered the principal source of basic data. These data were then combined with Landsat satellite images to conduct quantitative analysis on changes in the spatial area and location of forest cover with a long time series. The findings are as follows: in terms of time series, the forest area in the study area showed a trend of decreasing at first and then increasing, with the year 1986 as the turning point. In terms of spatial patterns, a considerable difference is observed in regions with changes in forest cover under different historical periods. Changes are obvious in limestone areas, rock soil areas, and areas with an elevation of 2000-2500 m and a slope gradient of 6 degrees-15 degrees. Spatial-temporal changes in forest cover reflect the effects of the war, national policy, and economic development to some extent. All these results indicate that, despite its limitations, a historical map is a valuable document for studying an ecological environment.

TI  - An Improved QAA-Based Method for Monitoring Water Clarity of Honghu Lake Using Landsat TM, ETM plus and OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) is used to quantify water clarity as an important water-quality parameter, and one of the most used mechanistic models for Z(SD) is the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA), of which the latest version is QAA_v6. There are two models in QAA for clear and turbid waters (referred to as QAA_clear and QAA_turbid). QAA_v6 switches between the two models by setting a threshold value for the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) at the selected reference band of 656 nm. However, some researchers found that this reference band or the threshold value does not apply to many turbid inland lakes. In Honghu Lake, the R-rs (656) (R-rs at 656 nm) in the whole lake is less than 0.0015 sr(-1); therefore, only QAA_turbid can be applied. Moreover, we found that QAA_clear resulted in overestimation while QAA_turbid resulted in significant underestimations. The waters of inland lakes usually continuously vary between clear and turbid water. We proposed a hypothesis that QAA_turbid and QAA_clear transition evenly, rather than being distinguished by one threshold value, and we developed a model that combined QAA_clear and QAA_turbid according to our assumption. This model simulated the process of continuous change in water clarity. The results showed that our model had a better performance with an RMSE that reduced from 0.5 to 0.28, an MAE that reduced from 0.43 to 0.21, and bias that reduced from -0.4 to -0.05 m compared with QAA_v6. We applied QAA_Honghu to Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI data and obtained 205 Z(SD) maps with high spatial resolution in Honghu Lake. The results were consistent with the existing in situ measurements. From 1987-2020, the Z(SD) results of Honghu Lake showed an overall downward trend and a distinct seasonal pattern.

TI  - Grid-Scale Regional Risk Assessment of Potentially Toxic Metals Using Multi-Source Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the risks posed by potentially toxic metals (PTMs) in large regions is important for environmental management. However, regional risk assessment that relies on traditional field sampling or administrative statistical data is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and coarse. Internet data, remote sensing data, and multi-source data, have the advantage of high speed of collection, and can, thereby, overcome time lag challenges and traditional evaluation inefficiencies, although, to date, they are rarely applied. To evaluate their effectiveness, the current study used multi-source data to conduct a 1 km scale assessment of PTMs in Yunnan Province, China. In addition, a novel model to simulate potentially hazardous areas, based on atmospheric deposition, was also proposed. Assessments reveal that risk areas are mainly distributed in the east, which is consistent with the distribution of mineral resources in the province. Approximately 3.6% of the cropland and 1.4% of the sensitive population are threatened. The risk areas were verified against those reported by the government and the existing literature. The verification exercise confirmed the reliability of multi-source data, which are cost-effective, efficient, and generalizable for assessing pollution risks in large areas, particularly when there is little to no site-specific contamination information.

TI  - Spatial Pattern and Influencing Factors of Rural Settlements in Qinba Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial patterns and the influencing determinants of rural settlements are the most important indicators for understanding the constituent structure of rural regional systems. However, there is little knowledge addressing the characteristics from the settlement perspective by realizing the spatial reconstruction and sustainable development of rural settlements. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the geographical, size, and morphological properties of rural settlement patterns in the Qinba Mountains in southern Shaanxi Province, China, using rural settlement and remote sensing data through spatial measurement index, gradient transects, demographic-economic index, and geodetector analysis. The results show the following: (1) Overall, rural settlements have spatial characteristics of "high-density multi-core clusters (0.8-1.6/km(2)) and low-density broadly scattered (<0.08/km(2))". There is a significant positive correlation between the scale of rural settlement density and the characteristics of high-value agglomeration. (2) The spatial disparities of morphological traits of settlement shapes are significant. Furthermore, 1840 NP/piece of plain basin landform types provide high-value areas for each settlement feature value, and locations with moderate slopes are best for settlement dispersal. Moreover, rivers, roads, and distance from township centers are all examples of beneficial directivity. There is consistency between the spatial differentiation of rural settlement areas per capita and the distribution of settlement scale. Conversely, the settlement density is inconsistent with the agricultural production value density's spatial distribution features. (3) The impact of geographical factors on the diversification of settlement characteristics has significant spatial differences. Moreover, natural ecological characteristics such as elevation and landform and the distribution of cultivated land strongly influence the spatial pattern of the study region. Finally, the study findings can be beneficial for land and space planning and rural governments to develop sustainable rural settlements.

AB  - Vegetation is an important part of a regional ecological environment and vegetation coverage can reflect the health of a regional ecological environment. Through an analysis of and research into changes in the vegetation NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and its driving factors in the Pearl River Delta region, the spatial-temporal pattern of vegetation changes and the driving factors can be measured. It is of significance to improve the ecological environment quality of the Pearl River Delta region and to promote the sustainable development of the regional economy. Based on SPOT/VEGETATION NDVI satellite remote sensing data, meteorological data, population density data, and gross domestic product (GDP) data during the period 2000-2019, this paper analyzed the temporal and spatial trends of the vegetation NDVI as well as the climate factors and human activities in the Pearl River Delta on a pixel scale. The correlations between the vegetation NDVI and precipitation, temperature, population density, GDP, and other factors were also estimated. The results showed that during the period 2000-2019, the annual mean NDVI significantly increased, with a growth rate of 0.0044 (R-2 = 0.71, p < 0.0001). The NDVI in the center of the Pearl River Delta was lower than that in other regions. As far as the driving factors of the NDVI were concerned, among the climatic factors, the response of the NDVI to temperature was higher than that for precipitation in the Pearl River Delta. Human activities had changed from a negative hindering effect on the NDVI to a positive promoting effect. The correlation between the NDVI and the GDP was higher than that for population density. Policy factors such as the "Grain for Green Project" as well as an increase in the sown area of crops and land use changes were also important driving factors of the NDVI. It is suggested that the NDVI can be increased by the implementation of artificial afforestation policies, building a "Green City", and moderately increasing the sown area of crops.

TI  - Dynamic behaviors and mitigation measures of a train passing through windbreak transitions from ground to cutting
T2  - JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the effects of a right-angle windbreak transition (RWT) from the flat ground to cutting on train aerodynamic and dynamic responses were investigated, then a mitigation measure, an oblique structure transition (OST) was proposed to reduce the impact of RWT on the train aerodynamic and dynamic performance. The results showed that in the RWT region, the airflow was divided into two parts. One part of the airflow induced a strong backflow in the flat ground position, and the other part of the airflow induced a strong backflow in the cutting position. Therefore, there were two lateral impacts on the train. For the head car with the OST, the drop ratios of the peak-to-peak values compared with RWT were 47%, 40%, and 52% for the side force coefficient C-Fy, lift force coefficient C-Fz and overturning moment coefficient C-Mx, respectively. For the peak-to-peak value of the dynamic parameters, the drop ratios of OST compared with RWT were all larger than 50%. The maximum dynamic overturning coefficients for RWT and OST were 0.75 and 0.3, respectively.

TI  - Road extraction in remote sensing data: A survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated extraction of roads from remotely sensed data come forth various usages ranging from digital twins for smart cities, intelligent transportation, urban planning, autonomous driving, to emergency management. Many studies have focused on promoting the progress of methods for automated road extraction from aerial and satellite optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and LiDAR point clouds. In the past 10 years, no a more comprehensive survey on this topic could be found in literature. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive survey on road extraction methods that use 2D earth observing images and 3D LiDAR point clouds. In this review, we first present a tree-structure that separate the literature into 2D and 3D. Then, further methodologies level classification is demonstrated both in 2D and 3D. In 2D and 3D, we introduce and analyze the literature published in the last ten years. Except for the methodologies, we also review the aspects of data commonly used. Finally, this paper explores the existing challenges and future trends.

TI  - Extraction of Mountain Grasslands in Yunnan, China, from Sentinel-2 Data during the Optimal Phenological Period Using Feature Optimization
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate mapping of the spatial distribution of grasslands is crucial for maintaining grassland habitats and ensuring the sustainable utilization of resources. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-2 data for mountain grassland extraction in Yunnan, China. The differences in the normalized vegetation index in the time-series data of different ground objects were compared. February to March, during grassland senescence, was the optimum phenological stage for grassland extraction. The spectral, textural of Sentinel-2, and topographic features of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) were used for the classification. The features were optimized using the recursive feature elimination (RFE) feature importance selection algorithm. The overall accuracy of the random forest (RF) classification algorithm was 91.2%, the producer's accuracy of grassland was 96.7%, and the user's accuracy of grassland was 89.4%, exceeding that of the cart classification (Cart), support vector machine (SVM), and minimum distance classification (MDC). The SWIR1 and elevation were the most important features. The results show that Yunnan has abundant grassland resources, accounting for 18.99% of the land area; most grasslands are located in the northwest at altitudes above 3200 m and in the Yuanjiang River regions. This study provides a new approach for feature optimization and grassland extraction in mountainous areas, as well as essential data for the further investigation, evaluation, protection, and utilization of grassland resources.

TI  - Simulating Dynamics and Ecology of the Sea Ice of the White Sea by the Coupled Ice-Ocean Numerical Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a numerical model of the White Sea is presented. The White Sea is a small shallow sea with strong tidal currents and complex ice behavior. The model is the only comprehensive numerical model for the White Sea. It consists of several coupled submodels (for water, ice, pelagic, and sympagic ecology). In this work, the focus is on the dynamics of sea ice and its ecosystem. The model is described and its results are compared to available sea-ice data, mostly satellite data. The spatial resolution of the model is 3 km. High current velocities require the time step of 3 min. The model is shown to reproduce sea-ice concentration well; in particular, timing of the sea ice is perfect. The dynamics of the sea-ice ecosystem also looks reasonable. Chlorophyll-a content agrees well with measurements, and the ratio of algal, bacterial, and faunal biomass is correct. Sympagic biomass is underestimated. Light is limiting at the early stage of sympagic bloom, nutrient limitation is for the second half. We show that sympagic component influences the spring bloom (in terms of timing and height of the peaks) but has little effect on the dynamics during the warm period of the year.

TI  - Landsat 9 Geometric Characteristics Using Underfly Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat program has a long history of providing remotely sensed data to the user community. This history is being extended with the addition of the Landsat 9 satellite, which closely mimics the Landsat 8 satellite and its instruments. These satellites contain two instruments, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). OLI is a push-broom sensor that collects visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths at 30 m ground sample distance, along with a panchromatic 15 m band. The TIRS sensor contains two long-wave thermal spectral channels centered at 10.9 and 12 mu m. The data from these two instruments, on both satellites, are combined into a single Landsat product. The Landsat 5-9 satellites follow a 16 day repeat cycle designated as the Worldwide Reference System (WRS-2), which provides a global notional gridded mapping for identifying individual Landsat scenes. The Landsat 8 and 9 satellites are flown such that their orbital tracks are separated by 8 days in this 16 day cycle. During the commissioning period of Landsat 9, and during its ascent to its operational WRS-2 orbit, the Landsat 9 satellite's orbital track went under and crossed over the orbital track of the Landsat 8 satellite. This produced a unique situation where nearly time-coincident imagery could be obtained from the instruments of the two spacecrafts. From a radiometric standpoint, this allowed for near-time cross-calibration between the instruments to be performed. From a geometry perspective, calibration is achieved through high-resolution reference imagery over specific ground locations, thus ensuring calibration of the instruments and for the instruments to be well cross-calibrated geometrically. Although these underfly data do not provide calibration of the instruments between the platforms from a geometric perspective, they allow for the verification of the calibration steps involving the instruments and spacecraft. This paper discusses the co-registration of this unique set of data while also discussing other geometric aspects of these data by looking at and comparing the differences in sensor viewing and sun angles associated with the collections from the two platforms for imagery obtained over common geographic locations. The image-to-image comparisons between Landsat 8 and 9 coincident pairs, where both datasets are precision terrain products, are registered to within 2.2 m with respect to their root-mean-squared radial error (RMSEr). The 2.2 m represents less than 0.1 of a 30 m multispectral pixel in misregistration between the L9 and L8 underfly products that will be available to the user community. This unique dataset will provide well-registered, near-coincident image acquisitions between the two platforms that can be a key to any calibration or application comparisons. The paper also presents that, for images for which one of the image pairs failed precision corrections and became a terrain-corrected only product type, a range of 8-14 m RMSEr could be expected in co-registration, while, in cases where both image pairs failed the precision correction step and both images became a terrain-corrected only product type, a 14 m RMSEr could be expected for co-registration.

TI  - Recent Trends of Abnormal Sea Surface Temperature Occurrence Analyzed from Buoy and Satellite Data in Waters around Korean Peninsula
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study a tendency of abnormal sea surface temperature (SST) occurrence in the seas around South Korea is analyzed from daily SST data from satellite and 14 buoys from August 2020 to July 2021. As thresholds 28 degrees C and 4 degrees C are used to determine marine heatwaves (MHWs) and abnormal low water temperature (ALWT), respectively, because those values are adopted by the National Institute of Fisheries Science for the breaking news of abnormal temperature. In order to calculate frequency of abnormal SST occurrence spatially by using satellite SST, research area was divided into six areas of coast and three open seas. ALWT dominantly appeared over a wide area (7,745 km(2)) in Gyeonggi Bay for total 94 days and it was also confirmed from buoy temperature showing an occurrence number of 47 days. MHWs tended to be high in frequency in the coastal areas of Chungcheongdo and Jeollabukdo and the south coastal areas while in case of buoy temperature Jupo was the place of high frequency (32 days). This difference was supposed to be due to the low accuracy of satellite SST at the coasts. MHWs are also dominant in offshore waters around Korean Peninsula. Although detecting abnormal SST by using satellite SST has advantage of understanding occurrence from a spatial point of view, we also need to perform detection using buoys to increase detection accuracy along the coast.

TI  - Performance of Random Forest Classifier for Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, was heavily damaged by the flood of the Nile in 2020. Classification using satellite images can define the damaged area and help emergency response. As Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) uses microwave that can penetrate cloud, it is suitable to use in the flood study. In this study, Random Forest classifier, one of the supervised classification algorithms, was applied to the flood event in Khartoum with various sizes of the training dataset and number of images using Sentinel-i SAR. To create a training dataset, we used unsupervised classification and visual inspection. Firstly, Random Forest was performed by reducing the size of each class of the training dataset, but no notable difference was found. Next, we performed Random Forest with various number of images. Accuracy became better as the number of images increased, but converged to a maximum value when the dataset covers the duration from flood to the completion of drainage.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to provide evidence on the effects of pandemic curtailment measures on public health, targeting the changes in breathable air quality, within urban areas. The analyzed period covers the full impact of lockdowns in Europe in 2020. We used everyday data for each analyzed pollutant, NO2, SO2, CO, PM2.5 and PM10, from urban monitoring stations that provided real-time concentrations (provided by Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, Environmental Protection Agency repository and European Environment Agency map services) and satellite data (provided by NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2). In the present study, the urban air quality was computed using a composite index that was further analyzed in comparison with pandemic restrictions. Descriptive statistics, charts and maps were used to visualize the data that covered the analyzed countries. Our results show that air pollution was reduced by 12% after lockdowns in European urban areas, with a 0.76 correlation between air pollution and pandemic restrictions. All air pollutants registered significant drops.

TI  - The Future Impacts of ESL Events in Euro-Mediterranean Coastal Cities: The Coast-RiskBySea Model to Assess the Potential Economic Damages in Naples, Marseille and Barcelona
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal cities, the effects of climate change will cause an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme sea level (ESL). In this scenario, the application of the Coast-RiskBySea model is proposed to assess the economic impacts of ESL on the built environment in three Euro-Mediterranean coastal cities: Naples, Barcelona, and Marseille. The risk (land use-based) is assessed in the GIS environment as a function of the potential direct and tangible economic damages. The results highlight risk scenarios in all three cities with significant economic damages expected, requiring the implementation of climate mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce the current impacts and limit future ones. The simulations highlight the potential of both remote sensing data and GIS systems to carry out homogeneous environmental analyses over wide areas. The results that were obtained are compared with existing works to verify the reliability of the Coast-RiskBySea model.

TI  - Comprehensive Clinical, Histopathologic, and Molecular Analysis and Long-term Follow-up of Patients With Nodal Blue Nevi
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue nevi are benign, melanocytic neoplasms that show a range of clinical and morphologic patterns and include common/dendritic, cellular, and atypical cellular subtypes. Like other nevi, they most commonly occur in skin but can occasionally involve lymph nodes where they may be misinterpreted as representing metastatic melanoma. Moreover, whether benign blue nevi can metastasize to lymph nodes and their natural history and prognostic significance has been the subject of great controversy. To date, few cases of nodal blue nevi have been reported in the literature, and those reports have had limited clinical follow-up and supporting molecular data. This study sought to determine the clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of blue nevi involving lymph nodes, clarify their clinical significance, provide evidence for understanding their pathogenesis, and highlight potential pitfalls in the interpretation of lymph nodes with an ultimate aim of improving patient care. Thirteen cases of blue nevi involving lymph nodes were identified in the archives of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia (1984-2018). A detailed assessment of the clinical and pathologic features of each case was performed, including an evaluation of all available immunohistochemical stains. Extended clinical follow-up was available for 9 patients. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction for GNAQ Q209L, Q209P and GNA11 Q209L mutations was performed on 7 cases of blue nevi within lymph nodes together with matching cutaneous (presumed primary) blue nevi in 2 cases. All cases showed typical histologic features of blue nevi. BAP1 was retained in all cases (n=7). There were no recurrence or metastasis of blue nevus in any case on long-term clinical follow-up (n=9, median follow-up, 12 y). The majority of cases (n=5 of 7 evaluated) had GNAQ and GNA11 driver mutations. The 2 patients with a matched primary cutaneous blue nevus and regionally associated nodal blue nevus had the same GNAQ Q209L mutation in both sites in each patient. We conclude that blue nevi can involve lymph nodes and are associated with benign clinical behavior, and probably represent so-called "benign" metastasis. Awareness of these lesions is important when evaluating lymph nodes to avoid misdiagnosis as metastatic melanoma.

TI  - The Longest Baseline Record of Vegetation Dynamics in Antarctica Reveals Acute Sensitivity to Water Availability
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Against a changing climate, the development of evidence-based and progressive conservation policies depends on robust and quantitative baseline studies to resolve habitat natural variability and rate of change. Despite Antarctica's significant role in global climate regulation, climate trend estimates for continental Antarctica are ambiguous due to sparse long-term in situ records. Here, we present the longest, spatially explicit survey of Antarctic vegetation by harmonizing historic vegetation mapping with modern remote sensing techniques. In 1961, E. D. Rudolph established a permanent survey plot at Cape Hallett, one of the most botanically diverse areas along the Ross Sea coastline, harboring all known types of non-vascular Antarctic vegetation. Following a survey in 2004 using ground-based photography, we conducted the third survey of Rudolph's Plot in 2018 using near-ground remote sensing and methodologies closely mirroring the two historic surveys to identify long-term changes and trends. Our results revealed that the vegetation at Cape Hallett remained stable over the past six decades with no evidence of transformation related to a changing climate. Instead, the local vegetation shows strong seasonal phenology, distribution patterns that are driven by water availability, and steady perennial growth of moss. Given that East Antarctica is at the tipping point of drastic change in the near future, with biological change having been reported at certain locations, this record represents a unique and potentially the last opportunity to establish a meaningful biological sentinel that will allow us to track subtle yet impactful environmental change in terrestrial Antarctica in the 21st century.

TI  - A Chlorophyll Biomass Time-Series for the Distributed Biological Observatory in the Context of Seasonal Sea Ice Declines in the Pacific Arctic Region
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Declines in seasonal sea ice in polar regions have stimulated projections of how primary production has shifted in response to greater light penetration over a longer open water season. Despite the limitations of remotely sensed observations in an often cloudy environment, remote sensing data provide strong indications that surface chlorophyll biomass has increased (since 2000) as sea ice has declined in the Pacific Arctic region. We present here shipboard measurements of chlorophyll-a that have been made annually in July since 2000 from the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) stations in the Bering Strait region. This time series as well as shipboard observations made in other months since the late 1980s implicate complexities that intrude on a simple expectation that, as open water periods increase, the production and biomass of phytoplankton will increase predictably. These shipboard observations indicate that there have not been sharp increases in chlorophyll-a, for either maxima observed in the water column or integrated over the whole water column, at the DBO stations over a time-series extending for as long as 20 years coinciding with seasonal sea ice declines. On the other hand, biomass may be increasing in other months: we provide a shipboard confirmation of a fall bloom in October as wind mixing introduced nutrients back into the upper water column. The productive DBO stations may be at a high enough production already that additional enhancements in chlorophyll-a biomass should not be expected, but our time-series record does not exclude the possibility that additional enhanced production may be present in other areas outside the DBO station grid. These findings may also reflect limitations imposed by nutrient cycling and water column structure. The increasing freshwater component of waters flowing through the Bering Strait is likely associated with increased stratification that limits the potential change in biological production associated with decreases in seasonal sea ice persistence.

For this purpose, we developed a fully coupled model based on a parameter-saving crop growth model (Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY)) with a water-energy balance model (Flash-flood Event-based Spatially-distributed rainfall-runoff Transformation-Energy Water Balance model (FEST-EWB)) with a double exchange of leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture (SM) information. Both models are driven by remote sensing data and are calibrated independently from in situ measurements. Satellite LAI data are used to calibrate the crop growth model parameters, while the energy-water balance parameters are calibrated against satellite land surface temperature (LST) data. Multiple satellite data are used either at high spatial resolution (Sentinel 2 and LANDSAT 7 and 8) and at low-resolution (MODIS). Two Italian case studies are selected to test the model accuracy: the Chiese Irrigation Consortium (Northern Italy), mainly devoted to maize crop cultivation, and the Capitanata Irrigation Consortium (Southern Italy), where tomatoes are largely diffused. At local scale, LAI is reproduced for tomatoes with a mean RMSE of 0.92 and yield with a RMSE of 1.2 ton ha(-1); while for maize, a RMSE of 1 is found for LAI and a RMSE of 1.5 ton ha(-1) for yield. Results show an overall correspondence of daily soil moisture and evapotranspiration estimates with a RMSE in between 0.11 and 0.15 and of 1.3-3 mm, respectively. At the regional scale, LAI estimates show a RMSE around 1.1 for both case studies, while a RMSE of 13.4 ton ha(-1) is obtained for tomato yield and of 1.4 ton ha-1 for maize.

TI  - A Method for Clear-Sky Identification and Lone-Term Trends Assessment Using Daily Surface Solar Radiation Records
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of clear-sky irradiance are fundamental for the understanding of changes in the Earth Radiation budget, since they allow to examine radiative processes in the cloud-free atmosphere. Clear-sky data is usually derived from all-sky irradiances using one of several clear-sky methods proposed in the literature. However, most of the available clear-sky methods require additional in situ measurements and/or high temporal resolution (sub-daily), which restricts the derivation of clear-sky time series to a few well equipped stations. Here we propose a new clear-sky identification method that aims to overcome this problem, with the ultimate goal of deriving multidecadal clear-sky trends for many sites globally. The method uses site specific monthly transmittance thresholds to derive long term clear-sky time series for any station worldwide that has daily mean irradiance data. We exemplify the method for 24 stations. Transmittance thresholds are derived by combining 29 years (1990-2018) of satellite cloud cover data with in situ irradiance measurements. The thresholds are then applied to the whole time series (independent of satellite data availability) to screen out cloudy days. Comparison of our results with reference data derived using Long and Ackerman's (2000, https://doi. org/10.1029/2000jd900077) method shows good agreement after bias correction, especially for decadal trends. While limitations of the method, such as anomalies representation, are highlighted and discussed, validation results encourage its use to derive long term clear-sky time series and associated decadal-scale trends around the globe.

TI  - Seasonal Ecosystem Productivity in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (Caatinga) Using Flux Tower Measurements and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga dry forest encompasses 11% of the total continental territory of Brazil. Nevertheless, most research on the relationship between phenology and ecosystem productivity of Brazilian tropical forests is aimed at the Amazon basin. Thus, in this study we evaluated the seasonality of ecosystem productivity (gross primary production-GPP) in a preserved Caatinga environment in northeast Brazil. Analyses were carried out using eddy covariance measurements and satellite-derived data from sensor MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MOD17 and MOD13 products). In addition to GPP, we investigated water use efficiency (WUE) and meteorological and phenological aspects through remotely sensed vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI). We verified that ecosystem productivity is limited mainly by evapotranspiration, with maximum GPP values registered in the wetter months, indicating a strong dependency on water availability. NDVI and EVI were positively associated with GPP (r = 0.69 and 0.81, respectively), suggesting a coupling between the emergence of new leaves and the phenology of local photosynthetic capacity. WUE, on the other hand, was strongly controlled by consecutive dry days and not necessarily by total precipitation amount. The vegetation indices adequately described interannual variations of the forest response to environmental factors, and GPP MODIS presented a good relationship with tower-measured GPP in dry (R-2 = 0.76) and wet (R-2 = 0.62) periods.

TI  - Diversity beyond demographics: Environmental worldviews of forestry and natural resource undergraduate students
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In US academic institutions, efforts often concentrate on enhancing the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups, focusing on gender and/or race. However, little attention has been paid to nondemographic forms of diversity, such as environmental worldviews (i.e., differences in the metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical beliefs that define how humans view, value, and interact with the natural world). Here, we present an exploratory measure of environmental worldview diversity among undergraduate students enrolled in natural resource-related programs. We tested our procedure at Oregon State University, a large public land-grant university in the United States. Many students reported metaphysical, epistemological, and/or ethical beliefs that deviate from what has been philosophically characterized as the dominant western worldview of natural resources (anthropocentric, dualistic, hierarchical, utilitarian, and mechanistic). Our results suggest that, although forestry students' environmental worldviews are in some ways more closely aligned with the dominant western worldview than other students in natural resources, generally student worldviews reflect a long-term generational shift away from a strict resource-commodity value orientation, as documented in the past research. Our findings highlight the importance of considering environmental worldviews as a dimension of diversity within the new generation of natural resource students. Future efforts toward understanding these levels of difference can be important assets in designing programs that appeal to a wide variety of students, ultimately helping efforts to recruit and retain a diverse pool of aspiring natural resource professionals.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Subsidence in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Central-West of Portugal) Applying Sentinel-1 SAR Dataset and Active Deformation Areas Procedure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lisbon metropolitan area (LMA, central-west of Portugal) has been severely affected by different geohazards (flooding episodes, landslides, subsidence, and earthquakes) that have generated considerable damage to properties and infrastructures, in the order of millions of euros per year. This study is focused on the analysis of subsidence, as related to urban and industrial activity. Utilizing the A-DInSAR dataset and applying active deformation areas (ADA) processing at the regional scale has allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of subsidence phenomena in the LMA. The dataset consisted of 48 ascending and 61 descending SAR IW-SLC images acquired by the Sentinel-1 A satellite between January 2018 and April 2020. The line-of-sight (LOS), mean deformation velocity (VLOS) maps (mm year(-1)), and deformation time series (mm) were obtained via the Geohazard Exploitation Platform service of the European Space Agency. The maximum VLOS detected, with ascending and descending datasets, were -38.0 and -32.2 mm year(-1), respectively. ADA processing over the LMA allowed for 592 ascending and 560 descending ADAs to be extracted and delimited. From the VLOS measured in both trajectories, a vertical velocity with a maximum value of -32.4 mm year(-1) was estimated. The analyzed subsidence was associated to four ascending and three descending ADAs and characterized by maximum VLOS of -25.5 and -25.2 mm year(-1). The maximum vertical velocity associated with urban subsidence was -32.4 mm year(-1). This subsidence is mainly linked to the compaction of the alluvial and anthropic deposits in the areas where urban and industrial sectors are located. The results of this work have allowed to: (1) detect and assess, from a quantitative point of view, the subsidence phenomena in populated and industrial areas of LMA; (2) establish the relationships between the subsidence phenomena and geological and hydrological characteristics.

TI  - IoT and Satellite Sensor Data Integration for Assessment of Environmental Variables: A Case Study on NO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a novel approach to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of an arbitrary environmental variable. This is achieved by utilizing machine learning algorithms to construct a satellite-like image at any given time moment, based on the measurements from IoT sensors. The target variables are calculated by an ensemble of regression models. The observed area is gridded, and partitioned into Voronoi cells based on the IoT sensors, whose measurements are available at the considered time. The pixels in each cell have a separate regression model, and take into account the measurements of the central and neighboring IoT sensors. The proposed approach was used to assess NO2 data, which were obtained from the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and IoT ground sensors. The approach was tested with three different machine learning algorithms: 1-nearest neighbor, linear regression and a feed-forward neural network. The highest accuracy yield was from the prediction models built with the feed-forward neural network, with an RMSE of 15.49 x10(-6) mol/m(2).

TI  - Spatial Syndromic Surveillance and COVID-19 in the US: Local Cluster Mapping for Pandemic Preparedness
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps have become the de facto primary mode of visualizing the COVID-19 pandemic, from identifying local disease and vaccination patterns to understanding global trends. In addition to their widespread utilization for public communication, there have been a variety of advances in spatial methods created for localized operational needs. While broader dissemination of this more granular work is not commonplace due to the protections under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), its role has been foundational to pandemic response for health systems, hospitals, and government agencies. In contrast to the retrospective views provided by the aggregated geographies found in the public domain, or those often utilized for academic research, operational response requires near real-time mapping based on continuously flowing address level data. This paper describes the opportunities and challenges presented in emergent disease mapping using dynamic patient data in the response to COVID-19 for northeast Ohio for the period 2020 to 2022. More specifically it shows how a new clustering tool developed by geographers in the initial phases of the pandemic to handle operational mapping continues to evolve with shifting pandemic needs, including new variant surges, vaccine targeting, and most recently, testing data shortfalls. This paper also demonstrates how the geographic approach applied provides the framework needed for future pandemic preparedness.

TI  - A Multi-Parametric and Multi-Layer Study to Investigate the Largest 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Eruptions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 20 December 2021, after six quiet years, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted abruptly. Then, on 15 January 2022, the largest eruption produced a plume well registered from satellites and destroyed the volcanic cone previously formed in 2015, connecting the two islands. We applied a multi-parametric and multi-layer study to investigate all the possible pre-eruption signals and effects of this volcanic activity in the lithosphere, atmosphere, and ionosphere. We focused our attention on: (a) seismological features considering the eruption in terms of an earthquake with equivalent energy released in the lithosphere; (b) atmospheric parameters, such as skin and air temperature, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), cloud cover, relative humidity from climatological datasets; (c) varying magnetic field and electron density observed by ground magnetometers and satellites, even if the event was in the recovery phase of an intense geomagnetic storm. We found different precursors of this unique event in the lithosphere, as well as the effects due to the propagation of acoustic gravity and pressure waves and magnetic and electromagnetic coupling in the form of signals detected by ground stations and satellite data. All these parameters and their detailed investigation confirm the lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC) models introduced for natural hazards such as volcano eruptions and earthquakes.

TI  - Lisbon Field: Geology of microseepage
T2  - INTERPRETATION-A JOURNAL OF SUBSURFACE CHARACTERIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Certain satellite sensors can be used for mineral identification and thus detection of alteration indicative of hydrocarbon microseepage. However, care must be taken when placing these results into context because alteration also can be due to other factors. The authors review the rationale for multiscale and multispectral image selection as well as the benefit of iterative processing, to highlight alteration within a given formation. The authors determine using remote sensing results integrated with other geologic information to confirm that alteration exists, compare results with a conceptual microseepage model, reconcile alteration pattern and ex-tent with the geologic setting and trap timing, and appraise the potential that other factors may have caused alteration. The authors used geologic information from the well-studied Lisbon Field including, but not limited to, geochemistry, petrography and diagenetic studies, and paleo-structure reconstruction. We evaluated whether the alteration model made sense by assessing the thermal history and estimating volumetrics and seep-age rate based on the geologic setting and extent of alteration. The results confirm that the alteration at the Lisbon Field is compatible with hydrocarbon microseepage as its principal cause, however, it cannot rule out the possibility that some of it may be due to hydrothermal fluid migration.

TI  - Scalable Residential Building Geometry Characterisation Using Vehicle-Mounted Camera System
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Residential buildings are an important sector in the urban environment as they provide essential dwelling space, but they are also responsible for a significant share of final energy consumption. In addition, residential buildings that were built with outdated standards usually face difficulty meeting current energy performance standards. The situation is especially common in Europe, as 35% of buildings were built over fifty years ago. Building retrofitting techniques provide a choice to improve building energy efficiency while maintaining the usable main structures, as opposed to demolition. The retrofit assessment requires the building stock information, including energy demand and material compositions. Therefore, understanding the building stock at scale becomes a critical demand. A significant piece of information is the building geometry, which is essential in building energy modelling and stock analysis. In this investigation, an approach has been developed to automatically measure building dimensions from remote sensing data. The approach is built on a combination of unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including K-means++, DBSCAN and RANSAC. This work is also the first attempt at using a vehicle-mounted data-capturing system to collect data as the input to characterise building geometry. The developed approach is tested on an automatically built and labelled point cloud model dataset of residential buildings and shows capability in acquiring comprehensive geometry information while keeping a high level of accuracy when processing an intact model.

TI  - LAI-Based Phenological Changes and Climate Sensitivity Analysis in the Three-River Headwaters Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate changes have a great impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Vegetation is an important component of ecosystems, and the impact of climate changes on ecosystems can be determined by studying vegetation phenology. Vegetation phenology refers to the phenomenon of periodic changes in plants, such as germination, flowering and defoliation, with the seasonal change of climate during the annual growth cycle, and it is considered to be one of the most efficient indicators to monitor climate changes. This study collected the global land surface satellite leaf area index (GLASS LAI) products, meteorological data sets and other auxiliary data in the Three-River headwaters region from 2001 to 2018; rebuilt the vegetation LAI annual growth curve by using the asymmetric Gaussian (A-G) fitting method and extracted the three vegetation phenological data (including Start of Growing Season (SOS), End of Growing Season (EOS) and Length of Growing Season (LOS)) by the maximum slope method. In addition, it also integrated Sen's trend analysis method and the Mann-Kendall test method to explore the temporal and spatial variation trends of vegetation phenology and explored the relationship between vegetation phenology and meteorological factors through a partial correlation analysis and multiple linear regression models. The results of this study showed that: (1) the SOS of vegetation in the Three-River headwaters region is concentrated between the beginning and the end of May, with an interannual change rate of -0.14 d/a. The EOS of vegetation is concentrated between the beginning and the middle of October, with an interannual change rate of 0.02 d/a. The LOS of vegetation is concentrated between 4 and 5 months, with an interannual change rate of 0.21 d/a. (2) Through the comparison and verification with the vegetation phenological data observed at the stations, it was found that the precision of the vegetation phonology extracted by the A-G method and the maximum slope method based on GLASS LAI data is higher (MAE is 7.6 d, RMSE is 8.4 d) and slightly better than the vegetation phenological data (MAE is 9.9 d, RMSE is 10.9 d) extracted based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS NDVI) product. (3) The correlation between the SOS of vegetation and the average temperature in March-May is the strongest. The SOS of vegetation is advanced by 1.97 days for every 1 degrees C increase in the average temperature in March-May; the correlation between the EOS of vegetation and the cumulative sunshine duration in August-October is the strongest. The EOS of vegetation is advanced by 0.07 days for every 10-h increase in the cumulative sunshine duration in August-October.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis with Landsat Series and Sentinel-3B OLCI Satellites to Assess Changes in Land Use and Water Quality over Time in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial analyses have gained fundamental importance on a global scale following emphasis on sustainability. Here we geospatially analyze images from Landsat 2/5/7/8 satellites captured during 1975 to 2020 in order to determine changes in land use. Sentinel-3B OLCI (Ocean Land Color Instrument) images obtained in 2019 and 2021 were utilized to assess water resources, based on water turbidity levels (TSM_NN), suspended pollution potential (ADG_443_NN) and the presence of chlorophyll-a (CHL_NN) in order to temporally monitor the effectiveness of Brazilian legislation currently in force. This work on sustainability standards was applied to a hydrographic basin dedicated to agricultural production located in southern Brazil. Satellite images from Landsat 2/5/7/8 (1975 to 2020) and Sentinel-3B OLCI (2019 and 2021) revealed that changes in land use, vegetation cover and water in the Capingui Dam reservoir detected high concentrations of ADG_443_NN (3830 m(-1)), CHL_NN (20,290 mg m(-3)) and TSM_NN (100 gm(-3)). These results can alert the population to the risks to public health and harm to hydrographic preservation, capable of covering large regions.

TI  - Epidemiologic and environmental characterization of the Re-emergence of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus in California, 2015-2020
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is an endemic flavivirus in the western and southeastern United States, including California. From 1938 to 2003, the virus was detected annually in California, but after West Nile virus (WNV) arrived in 2003, SLEV was not detected again until it re-emerged in Riverside County in 2015. The re-emerging virus in California and other areas of the western US is SLEV genotype III, which previously had been detected only in Argentina, suggesting a South American origin. This study describes SLEV activity in California since its re-emergence in 2015 and compares it to WNV activity during the same period. From 2015 to 2020, SLEV was detected in 1,650 mosquito pools and 26 sentinel chickens, whereas WNV was detected concurrently in 18,108 mosquito pools and 1,542 sentinel chickens from the same samples. There were 24 reported human infections of SLEV in 10 California counties, including two fatalities (case fatality rate: 8%), compared to 2,469 reported human infections of WNV from 43 California counties, with 143 fatalities (case fatality rate: 6%). From 2015 through 2020, SLEV was detected in 17 (29%) of California's 58 counties, while WNV was detected in 54 (93%). Although mosquitoes and sentinel chickens have been tested routinely for arboviruses in California for over fifty years, surveillance has not been uniform throughout the state. Of note, since 2005 there has been a steady decline in the use of sentinel chickens among vector control agencies, potentially contributing to gaps in SLEV surveillance. The incidence of SLEV disease in California may have been underestimated because human surveillance for SLEV relied on an environmental detection to trigger SLEV patient screening and mosquito surveillance effort is spatially variable. In addition, human diagnostic testing usually relies on changes in host antibodies and SLEV infection can be indistinguishable from infection with other flaviviruses such as WNV, which is more prevalent.

TI  - Responses of the copepod <i>Eurytemora affinis</i> to trace metal exposure: A candidate for sentinel to marine sediment resuspension effects
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study reports the ability of Eurytemora affinis to indicate certain responses in 96 h when exposed to resusopended sediment from a polluted site (PS, Seine estuary, France), less polluted site (LPS, Canche estuary, France) and dissolved trace metals. Mortality from dissolved trace metal was highest (57.5 %) followed by PS (38.59 %) > LPS (24.04 %). The exposure to PS sediment resulted in significantly lower no. of early larval stage (nauplii < 2), sex-ratio (39.24 % of males) and higher ovigerous female (>10). Eurytemora affinis bioaccumulated high concentrations of copper (27.3 mg/kg), nickel (12.8 mg/kg), lead (21.8 mg/kg) and arsenic (13.7 mg/kg) from PS exposure with significantly lower bioaccumulation of metals from LPS. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) was highest from dissolved toxicity (>2000) followed by PS that showed significantly higher BCF for Nickel and Copper, compared to LPS. The responses of E. affinis to different matrices exemplify its role as a sentinel.

TI  - GeoAI to implement an individual tree inventory: Framework and application of heat mitigation
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual Tree Inventory (ITI) is critical for urban planning, including urban heat mitigation. However, an ITI is usually incomplete and costly due to data collection challenges in the dynamic urban landscape. This research developed a methodical GeoAI framework to build a comprehensive ITI and quantify tree species cooling on rising urban heat.The object detection Faster R-CNN model with Inception ResNet V2 was implemented to detect individual trees canopy and seven tree species (Callery pear, Chinese elm, English elm, Mugga ironbark, Plane tree, Spotted gum and White cedar). The land-surface temperature (LST) was derived from Landsat 8 surface reflectance imagery. Two models for ITI were further developed for spatial and statistical analysis. Firstly, an 'Individual tree-based model' stores the attributes of tree species and its vertical configuration obtained from LiDAR, along with its tree canopy area and surface temperature. Secondly, the 'LST zone-based model' stores tree canopy cover and building areas in each zone unit. Pearson correlation, global linear regression, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were applied to establish the relationship between tree attributes, building areas (explanatory variables) with local temperature (dependent variable). Results showed that English elm has the highest cooling and least by Mugga ironbark in the study area. GWR results demonstrate that 94% of the LST was explained by tree height and tree canopy area. The LST zone-based model showed that 85% of the LST was explained by the percentage of tree species and buildings. Maps of the local R2 and coefficients of the independent variables provide spatially explicit information on the cooling of different tree species compared to building areas. The implemented GeoAI approach provides important insights to urban planners and government to monitor urban trees with the enhanced Individual Tree Inventory and strategies mitigation plan to reduce the impact of climate change and global warming.

TI  - Canopy Height Mapping by Sentinel 1 and 2 Satellite Images, Airborne LiDAR Data, and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous mapping of vegetation height is critical for many forestry applications, such as planning vegetation management in power transmission line right-of-way. Satellite images from different sensors, including SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) from Sentinel 1 (S1) and multispectral from Sentinel 2 (S2), can be used for producing high-resolution vegetation height maps at a broad scale. The main objective of this study is to assess the potential of S1 and S2 satellite data, both in a single and a multisensor approach, for modeling canopy height in a transmission line right-of-way located in the Atlantic Forest of Parana, Brazil. For integrating S1 and S2 data, we used three machine learning algorithms (LR: Linear Regression, CART: Classification and Regression Trees, and RF: Random Forest) and airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) measurements as the reference height. The best models were obtained using the RF algorithm and 20 m resolution features from only S2 data (cross-validated RMSE of 4.92 m and R-2 of 0.58) or multisensor data (cross-validated RMSE of 4.86 m and R-2 of 0.60). Although the multisensor model presented the best performance, it was not statistically different from the single-S2 model. Thus, the use of only S2 to estimate canopy height has practical advantages, as it reduces the need to process SAR images and the uncertainties due to S1 noise or differences between the acquisition dates of S2 and S1.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image-Based Analysis of the Urban Heat Island Effect in Braganca, Portugal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Islands increase surface temperatures which impact the health and well-being of urban populations. Radiative forcing is impacted by changes to the land surface associated with urbanization that are particularly significant immediately after sunset. This paper aimed to analyze the behavior of UHI in different Local Climate Zones (LCZ) in Braganca city (Portugal), using Air Temperature (Ta), satellite images (Landsat 8), and on-site data. The methodology included a seasonal approach, integrating data with different scales (spatial, radiometric, and spectral) and qualitative and quantitative analyses. Google Earth Engine (GEE) optimized the processing time and computation requirement to generate the Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps. The integration of data with different scales corroborated the complementation of information/analysis and detected the correlation between the Ta and LST. However, the identification of the UHI was compromised due to the time of the passage of Landsat 8, and it was identified as the Urban Cool Island (UCI), a complementary effect of UHI, supporting the results of previous studies and for the use of Remote Sensing (RS) for thermal effects analysis.

TI  - Vegetation indices as a Tool for Mapping Sugarcane Management Zones
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In precision agriculture, the adoption of management zones (MZs) is one of the most effective strategies for increasing agricultural efficiency. Currently, MZs in sugarcane production areas are classified based on conventional soil sampling, which demands a lot of time, labor and financial resources. Remote sensing (RS) combined with vegetation indices (VIs) is a promising alternative to support the traditional classification method, especially because it does not require physical access to the areas of interest, is cost-effective and less labor-intensive, and allows fast and easy coverage of large areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) to classify sugarcane MZs, compared with the conventional method, in the Brazilian Cerrado biome (savannah), where about half of Brazil ' s sugarcane production takes place. This study used historical crop production data from 5,500 production fields in three agricultural years (2015 to 2018) and NDVI and EVI2 values of 14 images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite from 2015 to 2018 in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Although improvements are still necessary and encouraged, a new methodology of classifying MZs according to VIs was proposed in this study. The NDVI was not correlated with MZs classified using the conventional method, whereas EVI2 was more sensitive to biomass variations between MZs and, therefore, could better discriminate between MZs. The EVI2 values measured in crops aged 180 to 240 days in the rainy season proved to be the best strategy for classifying MZs by RS, where MZ A, for example, had EVI2 of 0.37, compared to MZ E, which had an EVI2 of 0.32.

TI  - Time series analysis of remote sensing images of vegetation cover change in the Faro-Benoue-Bouba Ndjidda ecological landscape, north region of Cameroon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Faro-Be ' noue '-Bouba Ndjidda ecological landscape in the north region of Cameroon consists of a vast network of protected areas with multiple potentials that contribute to the economic and social development of the local populations. Because of all its potentials, the landscape is highly valued and subject to multiple pressures and threats that endanger biodiversity. The main objective of this study is to analyse changes in land use, as well as the factors responsible for these changes. Time series of satellite images from Landsat 1-3 MSS, Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS sensors from the periods 1975, 1996 and 2017 respectively, were used. The supervised classification algorithm using Support Vector Machines (SVM) from Envi 5.3 software was used for image classification. The Land Change Modeler of the Terrset 18 software was used to monitor land use changes. The analyses revealed that in 1975, the landscape had 4,536,647.42 ha of forested land. In 1996 this land was 2,822,597.42 ha and in 2017 it was 1,239,338.60 ha. Between 1975 and 1996, the net loss of the forested land was 1,714,050.01 ha, corresponding to an annual loss of 81,621.43 ha (0.02%/year). Over the period 1996 to 2017, this loss was estimated at 1,583,258.82 ha, corresponding to an annual loss of 75,393.28 ha (0.04%/year). The conversion of these areas to other uses, according to the socio-ecological field survey, is mainly caused by the expansion of agricultural land coupled with the demographic explosion induced by the large migration of populations from Chad and the Central African Republic. The intensification of gold panning and livestock farming also contribute to the regression of the natural vegetation. These pressures and threats are exacerbated by the vulnerability caused by the effects of climate change, especially as the landscape is located in an agropastoral region marked by high inter-annual variability in temperature and rainfall. The results of this research provide a sound basis for considering the sustainable management of this ecological landscape.

TI  - Effect of Altitude and Topography on Vegetation Phenological Changes in the Niubeiliang Nature Reserve of Qinling Mountains, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the fragility of the habitats in mountain nature reserves, the vegetation is extremely sensitive to climate change, and its phenological changes are more specific. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the effects of topography and climate on the vegetation phenology in mountain nature reserves. Based on the vegetation phenology data retrieved from MODIS EVI2 during 2000 to 2017, combined with temperature data, spatial trend analysis and correlation analysis methods were used to study the effects of topographic and climatic factors on vegetation phenology in the Niubeiliang Nature Reserve of the Qinling Mountains. The results showed that the GSS (growing season start) was advanced with a rate of 4.24 days/10a, and the rates in the northern and southern slopes were almost the same; the GSE (growing season end) was delayed with a rate of 3.29 days/10a, and the rate in the northern slope was faster; and the GSL (growing season length) was prolonged. There were seasonal differences and north-south differences in the effects of topography on the phenophase. The phenophase changed regularly with the increase in altitude. The higher the altitude, the more significant the effect. The steeper the slope, the later the GSS, the earlier the GSE, and the more significant its effect on the GSE. The aspect had little effect on GSS but a more significant effect on GSE, which was the latest on the sunny slope and the earliest on the zero slope. Temperature affected both the GSS advance and the GSE delay, and both had a time-lag effect of approximately 2-3 months. Its effect was more significant in the GSE, in the southern slopes, and in the high-altitude areas.

TI  - Impacts of Sand Mining Activities on the Wetland Ecosystem of Poyang Lake (China)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing anthropogenic activities are threatening freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Sand mining in Poyang Lake has significantly impacted the wetland ecosystem over the past 20 years, yet a quantitative analysis of these impacts remains insufficient. Here, we used 63 Landsat images taken from 2000 to 2020 along with the support vector machine (SVM) method and a retrieval model of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) to identify sand mining vessels and areas affected by sand mining. Then, we analyzed the changes in landscape patterns in the areas affected by sand mining. The potential impact of underwater noise generated by sand mining vessels on Yangtze finless porpoises was analyzed by a sound propagation model. The number of sand mining vessels in Poyang Lake during the flood, normal, and dry seasons increased from 2000 to 2016 but rapidly decreased from 2017 to 2020. Sand mining vessels were mainly distributed in the northern channel from 2000 to 2006, moved toward the center of the lake from 2007 to 2010, then moved northward in 2017. Within the areas affected by sand mining, water and mudflats declined, grassland and sandbars increased, and the landscape discontinuity increased. The habitat of the Yangtze finless porpoise affected by underwater noise from sand mining vessels in all seasons has significantly increased overtime. The mean area of the affected habitats was 70.65% (dry), 64.48% (normal), and 63.30% (flood) of the total habitat areas. The porpoise habitats in the northern channel and the west branch of the Ganjiang River are more seriously affected by the underwater noise of sand mining vessels than the southern lake. The impact of sand mining activities on wetland landscape and aquatic species demands systematic investigation in the future.

TI  - Water Occurrence in the Two Largest Lakes in China Based on Long-Term Landsat Images: Spatiotemporal Changes, Ecological Impacts, and Influencing Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake are the two largest freshwater lakes in China. They play a critical ecological role in regional sustainable development, which is closely related to water occurrence (WO). This study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal changes, ecological impacts, and influencing factors of WO in the two lakes. First, this study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and all available Landsat images to retrieve the time series of WO in Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake on a two-year scale from 1989 to 2020. Then, the study explored the landscape variation intensity, landscape structure, and their ecological impacts on net primary production (NPP) and total nitrogen (TN) based on the landscape transfer rate (LTR), landscape indices, and geostatistical connectivity analysis. Finally, the study investigated the natural and human factors that influence the changes in WO. The major conclusions include the following: (1) the mean WO showed a significantly decreasing trend in the two lakes from 1989 to 2020. According to the LTR, the landscape variation in Dongting Lake was more intense before 2002, while after 2002, the landscape variation in Poyang Lake was more intense. (2) The landscape structure of WO gradually fragmented and diversified, along with decreasing hydrological connectivity in the two lakes. (3) The increase in NPP in Poyang Lake and the increase in TN in Dongting Lake were closely correlated with the changes in WO. (4) The upstream runoff showed a significantly positive correlation with the mean WO in Poyang Lake and the annual precipitation showed a significantly positive correlation with the mean WO in Dongting Lake; the influences of natural factors on WO changes became weaker. This study reinforces the understanding of long-term changes in the water body in Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake.

TI  - Detection and Quantification of Daily Marine Oil Pollution Using Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is the most effective technique for ocean oil spill surveillance in the hot spot regions like surroundings of oil platforms, oil rigs and major ship traffic routes to help protect the ocean ecosystem. A framework for the detection and quantification of daily oil pollution in the ocean is presented and explained in detail. This paper describes a new approach to SAR oil spill detection using bag of visual words (BOVW) method of feature extraction and classification. A labelled dataset of verified oil spills and look-alikes with the aid of Marios Krestenitis is used for demonstrating the use of BOVW method for feature extraction and classification of oil spills and look-alikes. The overall accuracy of 93% is obtained for the classification of oil spills and look-alikes from SAR images. An analysis of the BOVW method of feature extraction and classification in this paper has highlighted the importance of speeded-up robust features (SURF) features used by the algorithm for accurately classifying the oil spills and look-alikes. Fixed oil platforms and major ship traffic routes in the Eastern Arabian Sea are selected for oil spill surveillance. Initially, detection and quantification of some reported oil spills in the year 2017 is performed for validation. Subsequently, the technique is implemented for unreported oil spills from January to November 2020 to investigate the occurrence of oil spill incidents from oil fields and ships in the selected study region.

TI  - DETER-R: An Operational Near-Real Time Tropical Forest Disturbance Warning System Based on Sentinel-1 Time Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of forest disturbance on tropical forests is a fundamental tool to support proactive preservation actions and to stop further destruction of native vegetation. Currently most of the monitoring systems in operation are based on optical imagery, and thus are flaw-prone on areas with frequent cloud cover. As this, several Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based systems have been developed recently, aiming all-weather disturbance detection. This article presents the main aspects and the results of the first year of operation of the SAR based Near Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER-R), an automated deforestation detection system focused on the Brazilian Amazon. DETER-R uses the Google Earth Engine platform to preprocess and analyze Sentinel-1 SAR time series. New images are treated and analyzed daily. After the automated analysis, the system vectorizes clusters of deforested pixels and sends the corresponding polygons to the environmental enforcement agency. After 12 months of operational life, the system has produced 88,572 forest disturbance warnings. Human validation of the warning polygons showed a extremely low rate of misdetections, with less than 0.2% of the detected area corresponding to false positives. During the first year of operation, DETER-R provided 33,234 warnings of interest to national monitoring agencies which were not detected by its optical counterpart DETER in the same period, corresponding to an area of 105,238.5 ha, or approximately 5% of the total detections. During the rainy season, the rate of additional detections increased as expected, reaching 8.1%.

TI  - A Major Medieval Earthquake on the Main Kopetdag (Kopeh Dagh) Fault, Turkmenistan
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Main Kopetdag fault (MKDF) of Turkmenistan is one of the longest (approximate to 500 km) and the most rapidly straining (9.1 +/- 1.3 mm/yr) faults of the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone, and yet, in contrast to adjacent parts of Turkmenistan and Iran, it has little in the way of observed seismicity. Field observations indicate a fresh paleorupture along an approximate to 100 km long section of the MKDF with abundant streams offset across it. We use WorldView-2 optical satellite imagery to measure geomorphic offsets and compile them into a cumulative offset probability density (COPD) function. The COPD yields two peaks in offset density at 7.5 +/- 1.5 and 12.5 +/- 1.5 m, when considering the highest and the lowest quality measurements, whereas the medium-quality measurements present a single peak at 9 +/- 3 m. We are unable to separate peaks into distinct events when exploring the contributions of offset measurements along strike that have significant variability. The paleorupture displaces archaeological remains, including extensive field boundaries of likely medieval age, and a paleoseismic trench brackets the age of the most recent displacement at 600-800 yr B.P. From our measurements of displacement, we estimate that the most recent paleoearthquake had a moment magnitude (M-w) 7.6 +/- 0.4 and yet is missing from earthquake records in nearby Iran, indicating that the paucity of historical earthquakes in Turkmenistan may be misleading. The Baharly, Dowgala, and Gokdepe segments of the MKDF, which extend eastward toward Asgabat, do not show fresh surface expression. Infrared-stimulated luminescence ages of 3.4 +/- 0.5 and 2.5 +/- 0.2 ka from a river-cutting exposure along the Baharly segment predate the most recent paleorupture. We conclude that individual segments of the MKDF are capable of rupturing in major (M-w > 7.0) earthquakes, with ends of individual ruptures possibly controlled by segment boundaries. The occurrence of major earthquakes and rapid slip rate suggests that the MKDF constitutes a hazard to a populated region of Turkmenistan and northeast Iran.

TI  - Aligning citizen science and remote sensing phenology observations to characterize climate change impact on vegetation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology observations are essential indicators to characterize the local effects of climate change. Citizen participation in the collection of phenological observations is a potential approach to provide data at both high temporal scale and fine grain resolution. Traditional observation practices of citizen science (CS), although precise at the species scale, are limited to few observations often closely located to an observer's residence. These limitations hinder coverage of the great variability of vegetation phenology across biomes and improvement of the knowledge of vegetation changes due to climate change impacts. This study presents a new approach to overcome these limitations by improving CS guidance and feedback as well as expanding phenology report sites and observations across different habitats and periods to contribute to monitoring climate change. This approach includes: (a) a new methodology focused on harmonizing remote sensing phenology products with traditional CS phenology observations to direct volunteers to active phenology regions and, (b) a new protocol for citizen scientists providing tools to guide them to specific regions to identify, collect and share species phenological observations and their phenophases. This approach was successfully tested, implemented and evaluated in Catalonia with more than 5000 new phenologically interesting regions identified and more than 200 observations collected and Sentinel-2 derived phenometrics were demonstrated as of good quality.

TI  - Construction and Application Analysis of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function Model of Dunhuang Radiation Correction Site
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dunhuang correction site is the most important radiation correction site in China, and the directional reflection characteristic of the ground target is an important parameter affecting the site calibration accuracy. Until now, there are no clear studies on circumstances that necessitate the ground reflectance correction, and which bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is used for correction. Due to the high accuracy of medium-resolution image spectrometer (MODIS), MODIS images are analyzed. First, using six sets of unmanned aerial vehicle multi-angle observation data under different sun zenith angles at the Dunhuang site in September 2020, 36 different BRDF models are established by six different kernel function combinations. For the images under different observation angles, we calculated the apparent reflectance before and after the BRDF correction and compared the relative deviation with the measured apparent reflectance of the satellite. By considering the observation angle of 28 degrees as the boundary, the experimental results show that the relative deviation is greater when the angle is greater than 28 degrees, which is a significant consequence of the BRDF correction. Among the BRDF models established above, the BRDF model established using multi-angle observation data measured close to the time of satellite transit has a better correction effect. Furthermore, the relative deviation between the apparent reflectance calculated by the BRDF model using the kernel function combination of Rossthick-Lidense or RossThick-LiSparseR or Rossthin-LisparseR and the satellite observation value are small.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variability of Grassland Grasshopper Habitat Suitability and Its Main Influencing Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasshoppers are highly destructive pests, and their outbreak can directly damage livestock development. Grasshopper outbreaks can be monitored and forecasted through dynamic analysis of their potential geographic distribution and main influencing factors. By integrating vegetation, edaphic, meteorological, topography, and other geospatial data, this study simulated the grasshopper suitability index in Hulunbuir grassland using maximum entropy species distribution modeling (Maxent). The Maxent model showed high accuracy, with the training area under the curve (AUC) value ranging from 0.897 to 0.973 and the testing AUC ranging from 0.853 to 0.971 for the past 13 years. The results showed that suitable areas, including the most suitable area and moderately suitable area, accounted for a small proportion and were mainly located in the eastern and southern parts of the study area. According to model analysis based on 51 environmental factors, not all factors played a significant role in the grasshopper cycle. Moreover, differences in environmental factors drive the spatial variability of suitable areas for grasshoppers. The monitoring and prediction of potential outbreak areas can be improved by identifying major environmental factors having large variability between suitable and unsuitable areas. Future trends in grasshopper suitability indices are likely to contradict past trends in most of the study area, with only approximately 33% of the study area continuing the past trend. The results are expected to guide future monitoring and prediction of grasshoppers in Hulunbuir grassland.

TI  - Remote Estimation of the Particulate Phosphorus Concentrations in Inland Water Bodies: A Case Study in Hongze Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus is the most important nutrient associated with lake eutrophication and changes in cyanobacterial blooms, and particulate phosphorus (PP) is the main form of phosphorus found in highly turbid inland waters. Therefore, it is urgent to monitor PP concentrations in inland water bodies. In this study, we take Hongze Lake as the research area and establish a semianalytical model to estimate PP concentrations based on the total particle absorption coefficient (a(p)); the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values, which indicate the model accuracy, were 14.90% and 0.009 mg/L, respectively. In addition, the construction process and parameter selection criteria of the remote sensing-based PP concentration estimation model were derived using remote sensing data obtained at different spectral resolutions. Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager version 2 (OLI-2) data were selected as representatives to verify the accuracy of the model; compared to these two datasets, the MAPE values of the models were 16.32% and 26.84%, respectively, while the RMSE values were 0.010 mg/L and 0.014 mg/L, respectively. Finally, the models were applied to Sentinel 3 OLCI and Landsat 9 OLI-2 images obtained on 16 January 2022. The results show that the spatiotemporal distributions of PP concentrations in Hongze Lake estimated from these two images were relatively consistent, but the OLI data reflected overestimations and underestimations in some areas. These research results provide a new methodology for estimating PP concentrations through remote sensing methods and help to further improve the accuracy of remotely sensed PP concentration estimations in inland water bodies.

TI  - Mitigating Extreme Summer Heat Waves with the Optimal Water-Cooling Island Effect Based on Remote Sensing Data from Shanghai, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the progress in global warming, the frequency, duration and intensity of climate extremes are increasing. As one of these extremes, heat waves influence the well-being of human beings and increase societies' energy consumption. The Water-Cooling Island (WCI) effect of urban water bodies (UWBs) is important in urban heat wave mitigation. In this paper, the impact of WCI, especially the landscape pattern of the surrounding area, was explored. The results indicate that water bodies with a larger total area and simpler shape have a longer cooling effect. In the areas surrounding UWBs, a lower percentage or discrete distribution of impervious surfaces or green land provide a longer cooling effect. The amplitude of WCI is mainly decided by the impervious surface in the surrounding areas. A lower percentage or discrete distribution of impervious surfaces or green land leads to a smaller-amplitude WCI. The gradient is impacted by the shape of the UWB and surrounding green land. A complex shape and discrete distribution of green land lead to a higher gradient of WCI. The linear regress model was significant in terms of WCI range and gradient, while the model of WCI amplitude was not significant. This indicates that WCI is directly decided by impact factors through gradient and range. The conclusions provide a methodology for WCI prediction and optimization, which is important when mitigating summer heat waves.

TI  - Sandy Land-lake-vegetation Landscape of Songnen Sandy Land of China: Pattern, Process and Mechanism
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate the dynamic evolution of the sandy land-lake-vegetation landscape in Songnen Sandy Land (SSL) and its response to climate change and human activities, the distribution pattern, evolution, and driving mechanisms of the landscape were analyzed based on Landsat satellite images and meteorological and socio-economic data during 1980-2020. The results indicate that the area of sandy land exhibited an upward fluctuation during the last 40 yr, with a net increase of 251.75 km(2) at an increment rate of 3.80%/10 yr. The lake area also exhibited an upward fluctuation, with a net increase of 1200.95 km(2) at an increment rate of 20.42%/10 yr. Vegetation coverage decreased by 2633.30 km(2), with areas of low vegetation coverage exhibiting a trend of initial decline and subsequent increase, areas of medium vegetation coverage showed an upward fluctuation, and areas of high vegetation coverage showed a trend of initial increase and subsequent decrease, with overall changes of -0.67%/yr, 1.12%/yr, and 0.17%/yr, respectively. The relationships between sandy land, lakes, and vegetation coverage were significant, with areas of sandy land and low vegetation coverage showing the strongest correlation. The dynamic evolution of landscape is controlled by regional climatic and socio-economic factors, with socio-economic factors as the first principal component contributing up to 59.64%.

TI  - Impact of Gulf Stream Warm-Core Rings on Slope Water Intrusion into the Gulf of Maine
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intruding slope water is a major source of nutrients to sustain the high biological productivity in the Gulf of Maine (GoM). Slope water intrusion into the GoM is affected by Gulf Stream warm-core rings (WCRs) impinging onto the nearby shelf edge. This study combines long-term mooring measurements, satellite remote sensing data, an idealized numerical ocean model, and a linear coastal-trapped wave (CTW) model to examine the impact of WCRs on slope water intrusion into the GoM through the Northeast Channel. Analysis of satellite sea surface height and temperature data shows that the slope sea region off the GoM is a hotspot of ring activities. A significant linear relationship is found between inter-annual variations of ring activities in the slope sea region off the GoM and bottom salinity at the Northeast Channel, suggesting the importance of WCRs in modulating variability of intruding slope water. Analysis of the mooring data reveals enhanced slope water intrusion through bottom-intensified along-channel flow following impingements of WCRs on the nearby shelf edge. Numerical simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed WCR impingement processes and associated episodic enhancement of slope water intrusion in the Northeast Channel. Diagnosis of the model result indicates that baroclinic CTWs excited by the ring-topography interaction are responsible for the episodically intensified subsurface along-channel inflow, which carries more slope water into the GoM. A WCR that impinges onto the shelf edge to the northeast of the Northeast Channel tends to generate stronger CTWs and cause stronger enhancement of the slope water intrusion into the GoM.

TI  - Local Scale (3-m) Soil Moisture Mapping Using SMAP and Planet SuperDove
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A capability for mapping meter-level resolution soil moisture with frequent temporal sampling over large regions is essential for quantifying local-scale environmental heterogeneity and eco-hydrologic behavior. However, available surface soil moisture (SSM) products generally involve much coarser grain sizes ranging from 30 m to several 10 s of kilometers. Hence, a new method is proposed to estimate 3-m resolution SSM using a combination of multi-sensor fusion, machine-learning (ML), and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching approaches. This method established favorable SSM correspondence between 3-m pixels and overlying 9-km grid cells from overlapping Planet SuperDove (PSD) observations and NASA Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission products. The resulting 3-m SSM predictions showed improved accuracy by reducing absolute bias and RMSE by similar to 0.01 cm(3)/cm(3) over the original SMAP data in relation to in situ soil moisture measurements for the Australian Yanco region while preserving the high sampling frequency (1-3 day global revisit) and sensitivity to surface wetness (R 0.865) from SMAP. Heterogeneous soil moisture distributions varying with vegetation biomass gradients and irrigation regimes were generally captured within a selected study area. Further algorithm refinement and implementation for regional applications will allow for improvement in water resources management, precision agriculture, and disaster forecasts and responses.

TI  - Evaluation of Methods for Estimating Lake Surface Water Temperature Using Landsat 8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in lake water temperature, observed with the greatest intensity during the last two decades, may significantly affect the functioning of these unique ecosystems. Currently, in situ studies in Poland are conducted only for 38 lakes using the single-point method. The aim of this study was to develop a method for remote sensing monitoring of lake water temperature in a spatio-temporal context based on Landsat 8 imagery. For this purpose, using data obtained for 28 lakes from the period 2013-2020, linear regression (LM) and random forest (RF) models were developed to estimate surface water temperature. In addition, analysis of Landsat Level-2 Surface Temperature Science Product (LST-L2) data provided by United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was performed. The remaining 10 lakes not previously used in the model development stage were used to validate model performance. The results showed that the most accurate estimation is possible using the RF method for which RMSE = 1.83 degrees C and R-2 = 0.89, while RMSE = 3.68 degrees C and R-2 = 0.8 for the LST-L2 method. We found that LST-L2 contains a systematic error in the coastal zone, which can be corrected and eventually improve the quality of estimation. The satellite-based method makes it possible to determine water temperature for all lakes in Poland at different times and to understand the influence of climatic factors affecting temperature at the regional scale. On the other hand, spatial presentation of thermics within individual lakes enables understanding the influence of local factors and morphometric conditions.

AB  - Karzin-Qir basin as Part of the central Fars region is considered to be the Zagros fold belt of Iran which follows the general trend of Zagros folds are northwest to southeast, And the sedimentary basins are limited to the anticlines and gutters of Fars province. In this paper, the aim is to estimate the erosion rate of the basin and estimate the amount of annual sedimentation and to determine the severity of erosion using geomorphological indicators and Erosion Potential Method (EPM) modeling. And sediment yield models in a GIS, with the primary data obtained from topographic maps, Landsat ETMC data, aerial photographic interpretation, field survey and earlier studies. The results showed that the combination of the above two methods provides a more appropriate estimate than determining the sedimentary erosion rate of the basin. And the calculation of EPM erosion rate of 515 m(3)/Km(2).y, coefficient of sedimentation of the basin 0.47. and total sediment discharge rate in the basin was 242 m(3)/km(2).y. And total sediment discharge is 23232 m(3)/y. Based on the method of scoring geomorphological factors total erosion rate of the basin was set at 442 m(3)/km(2).y.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed elevation data obtained from high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is one of the main sources of data required for environmental modeling and remediation especially when it has to do with identification of erosion sites and flood-prone areas. The focus of this study is to evaluate four recently improved and freely available high-resolution elevation data obtained from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D Digital Surface Model version 2.1 (ALOS W3D30), TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X 90), Multi-ErrorRemoved Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM and EarthEnv-DEM90 in order to determine the most suitable DEM that could be used as an input data in a multi-criteria environmental modeling to identify erosion sites and flood-prone areas in data limited regions such as Southeastern Nigeria. Intensive performance evaluation of these four DEMs was rigorously carried out using statistical and surface analyses tools (Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), Land Use/Land Cover, slope, and contour maps). The obtained RMSE range from 5.49 m to 19.79 m depending on the surface of contact. Slope values range from 0.00 to 89.49 degrees depicting the complexity and ruggedness of the terrain. Analyses of the obtained RMSE showed that EarthEnv-DEM90 is more accurate (in terms of RMSE value) than the other three DEMs but further terrain analyses using slope and contour maps generated from each of the DEMs revealed that ALOS W3D30 represent the topography of the terrain (terrain variation) better than the other three DEMs. This study demonstrates the importance of carrying out rigorous and intensive performance evaluation of DEMs using many terrain parameters or attributes in order to avoid large errors that may be contributed by the use of a DEM in applications such as environmental modeling and remediation.

TI  - Combination of Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Meteorological Data for Crop Water Requirements Estimation in Intensive Agriculture
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, agriculture is an important element of the national economy, but this sector is a large consumer of water. In a context of high pressure on water resources, appropriate management is required. In semi-arid, intensive agricultural systems, such as the Tadla irrigated perimeter in central Morocco, a large amount of water is lost by evapotranspiration (ET), and farmers need an effective decision support system for good irrigation management. The main objective of this study was to combine a high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 satellite and meteorological data for estimating crop water requirements in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla and qualifying its irrigation strategy. The dual approach of the FAO-56 (Food and Agriculture Organization) model, based on the modulation of evaporative demand, was used for the estimation of crop water requirements. Sentinel-2A temporal images were used for crop type mapping and deriving the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) based on NDVI data. Meteorological data were also used in crop water requirement simulation, using SAMIR (satellite monitoring of irrigation) software. The results allowed for the spatialization of crop water requirements on a large area of irrigated crops during the 2016-2017 agricultural season. In general, the crops' requirement for water is at its maximum during the months of March and April, and the critical period starts from February for most crops. Maps of water requirements were developed. They showed the variability over time of crop development and their estimated water requirements. The results obtained constitute an important indicator of how water should be distributed over the area in order to improve the efficiency of the irrigation scheduling strategy.

TI  - The progressive relationship between increasing Breslow thickness and decreasing survival is lost in patients with ultrathick melanomas (≥15 mm in thickness)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Survival tends to decrease as the Breslow thickness of a primary melanoma increases. However, little is known about the prognostic value of Breslow thickness in patients with very thick melanomas.Objective: We sought to assess survival in patients with melanomas >= 4.0 mm in Breslow thickness.Methods: A pooled cohort of 5595 patients (4107 Dutch and 1488 Australian) with melanomas >= 4.0 mm in thickness diagnosed from 2000 to 2014 was analyzed. Standard and spline Cox regressions were generated for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS).Results: The median follow-up was 3.4 years. The continuous hazard ratios (HRs) for OS and RFS increased steadily as the Breslow thickness increased to 15 mm, stabilized up to 20 mm, and decreased thereafter. Using patients with melanomas 4 to <10 mm thick as a reference group, the categoric HR for OS increased up to the 15- to -<0-mm thickness category and then decreased (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.29-1.66], P<.0001 for 10-<15 mm; HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.55-2.51], P<.0001 for 15-<20 mm; and HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.07-1.84], P =.045 for >= 20 mm). For the RFS, similar trends were observed.Limitations: Retrospective study. Small cohorts of patients with melanomas 15-<20mm and >= 20mm.Conclusion: The progressive relationship between increasing Breslow thickness and decreasing survival is lost in patients with melanomas >= 15 mm in thickness.

In this study, four models driven by high resolution remote sensing data were intercompared and evaluated over an heterogeneous and complex traditional irrigated area located in the piedmont of the High Atlas mountain, Morocco, during the 2017 and 2018 seasons: (1) SAtellite Monitoring of IRrigation (SAMIR) which is a software-based on the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient water balance model fed with Sentinel-2 high-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to derive the basal crop coefficient (Kcb); (2) Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration (SPARSE) which is a surface energy balance model fed with land surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal data provided from Landsat 7 and 8; (3) a modified version of the Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW) model which uses the LST to compute surface resistances and (4) METRIC-GEE which is a version of METRIC model ("Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration") that operates on the Google Earth Engine platform, also driven by LST. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) measurements from two Eddy-Covariance (EC) systems and a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) were used to evaluate the four models. One EC was used to calibrate SAMIR and SPARSE (EC1) which were validated using the second one (EC2), providing a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and a determination coefficient (R) of 0.53 mm/day (R=0.82) and 0.66 mm/day (R=0.74), respectively. SW and METRIC-GEE simulations were obtained respectively from a previous study and Google Earth Engine (GEE), therefore no calibration was performed in this study. The four models predict well the seasonal course of ETa during two successive growing seasons (2017 and 2018). However, their performances were contrasted and varied depending on the seasons, the water stress conditions and the vegetation development. By comparing the statistical results between the simulation and the measurements of ETa it has been shown that SAMIR and METRIC-GEE are the less scattered and the better in agreement with the LAS measurements (RMSE equal to 0.73 and 0.68 mm/day and R equal to 0.74 and 0.82, respectively). On the other hand, SPARSE is less scattered (RMSE = 0.90 mm/day, R = 0.54) than SW which is slightly better correlated (RMSE = 0.98 mm/day, R = 0.60) with the observations. This study contributes to explore the complementarities between these approaches in order to improve the evapotranspiration mapping monitored with high-resolution remote sensing data

AB  - Opportunities to include Cetancodontamorpha in the study of the evolution of the immune system in the clades of Artiodactylamorpha, Ruminantiamorpha, Suinamorpha, and Camelidamorpha have increased with the use of the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, as a sentinel species to study the effects of environmental pollutants on the health of marine mammals. Efforts are currently underway to increase the number reagents needed for detailed studies. Thus far, screening of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made to leukocyte differentiation mole-cules (LDM) and the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and class II molecules in Ruminantiamorpha have yielded some mAbs that recognize conserved epitopes expressed on orthologues in the bottlenose dolphin. More direct approaches are in progress to identify additional mAbs to bottlenose LDM and cytokines. As reported here, both direct and indirect approaches were used to identify mAbs specific for cytokines useful in monitoring the effects of environmental pollutants on the immune system. Immunization of mice with expressed bottlenose dolphin cytokines yielded mAbs specific for IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17A. Screening of previously developed mAbs used in livestock immunology research revealed mAbs developed against ovine IFN-gamma and bovine IL-17 and IL-1 beta recognize conserved epitopes in bottlenose dolphin orthologues. The mAbs identified in the present study expand the reagents available to study the function of the immune system in bottlenose dol-phins and cattle.

TI  - Mapping Archaeal Diversity in Soda Lakes by Coupling 16S rRNA PCR-DGGE Analysis with Remote Sensing and GIS Technology
T2  - FERMENTATION-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The haloarchaeal diversity of four hypersaline alkaline lakes from the Wadi El-Natrun depression (Northern Egypt) was investigated using culture-independent polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene phylotypes, which was combined with remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data to highlight the distribution pattern of the microbial diversity in water and sediment samples. The majority of archaeal sequences identified in all four lakes belonged to the phyla Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Sediment samples from Beida Lake and water samples from El-Hamra Lake showed the highest levels of archaeal diversity. Sequence similarities >= 95% were found between six of the acquired clones and uncultured Halorhabdus, Euryarchaeota, and archaeon clones. In addition, two clones shared a high level of sequence similarity (97%) with unclassified archaea, while other nine clones exhibited 96% to 99% sequence similarity with uncultured archaeon clones, and only one clone showed 97% identity with an uncultured Crenarchaeota. Likewise, 7 DGGE bands presented a sequence similarity of 90 to 98% to Halogranum sp., Halalkalicoccus tibetensis, Halalkalicoccus jeotgali, uncultured Halorubrum, Halobacteriaceae sp., or uncultured haloarchaeon. In conclusion, while the variety of alkaliphilic haloarchaea in the examined soda lakes was restricted, the possibility of uncovering novel species for biotechnological applications from these extreme habitats remains promising.

TI  - Irrigated Crop Types Mapping in Tashkent Province of Uzbekistan with Remote Sensing-Based Classification Methods
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate crop type mapping to monitor and control land management is very important in developing countries. It can be very useful where digital cadaster maps are not available or usage of Remote Sensing (RS) data is not utilized in the process of monitoring and inventory. The main goal of the present research is to compare and assess the importance of optical RS data in crop type classification using medium and high spatial resolution RS imagery in 2018. With this goal, Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data were acquired over the Tashkent Province between the crop growth period of May and October. In addition, this period is the only possible time for having cloud-free satellite images. The following four indices "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index" (NDVI), "Enhanced Vegetation Index" (EVI), and "Normalized Difference Water Index" (NDWI1 and NDWI2) were calculated using blue, red, near-infrared, shortwave infrared 1, and shortwave infrared 2 bands. Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classification methods were used to generate the main crop type maps. As a result, the Overall Accuracy (OA) of all indices was above 84% and the highest OA of 92% was achieved together with EVI-NDVI and the RF method of L8 sensor data. The highest Kappa Accuracy (KA) was found with the RF method of L8 data when EVI (KA of 88%) and EVI-NDVI (KA of 87%) indices were used. A comparison of the classified crop type area with Official State Statistics (OSS) data about sown crops area demonstrated that the smallest absolute weighted average (WA) value difference (0.2 thousand ha) was obtained using EVI-NDVI with RF method and NDVI with SVM method of L8 sensor data. For S2-sensor data, the smallest absolute value difference result (0.1 thousand ha) was obtained using EVI with RF method and 0.4 thousand ha using NDVI with SVM method. Therefore, it can be concluded that the results demonstrate new opportunities in the joint use of Landsat and Sentinel data in the future to capture high temporal resolution during the vegetation growth period for crop type mapping. We believe that the joint use of S2 and L8 data enables the separation of crop types and increases the classification accuracy.

TI  - Outcomes with adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma without completion lymph node dissection
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Until recently, most patients with sentinel lymph node-positive (SLN+) melanoma underwent a completion lymph node dissection (CLND), as mandated in published trials of adjuvant systemic therapies. Following multicenter selective lymphadenectomy trial-II, most patients with SLN+ melanoma no longer undergo a CLND prior to adjuvant systemic therapy. A retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes in SLN+ melanoma patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy after July 2017 was performed in 21 international cancer centers. Of 462 patients who received systemic adjuvant therapy, 326 patients received adjuvant anti-PD-1 without prior immediate (IM) CLND, while 60 underwent IM CLND. With median follow-up of 21 months, 24-month relapse-free survival (RFS) was 67% (95% CI 62% to 73%) in the 326 patients. When the patient subgroups who would have been eligible for the two adjuvant anti-PD-1 clinical trials mandating IM CLND were analyzed separately, 24-month RFS rates were 64%, very similar to the RFS rates from those studies. Of these no-CLND patients, those with SLN tumor deposit >1 mm, stage IIIC/D and ulcerated primary had worse RFS. Of the patients who relapsed on adjuvant anti-PD-1, those without IM CLND had a higher rate of relapse in the regional nodal basin than those with IM CLND (46% vs 11%). Therefore, 55% of patients who relapsed without prior CLND underwent surgery including therapeutic lymph node dissection (TLND), with 30% relapsing a second time; there was no difference in subsequent relapse between patients who received observation vs secondary adjuvant therapy. Despite the increased frequency of nodal relapses, adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy may be as effective in SLN+ pts who forego IM CLND and salvage surgery with TLND at relapse may be a viable option for these patients.

TI  - Identifying Coffee Agroforestry System Types Using Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Data and Auxiliary Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee is one of the most important agricultural commodities of Mexico. Mapping coffee land cover is still a challenge because it is grown mainly on small areas in agroforestry systems (AFS), which are located in hard-to-access mountainous regions. The objective of this research was to map coffee AFS types in a mountainous region using the changing spectral response patterns over the dry season as well as supplementary data. We employed Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-Palsar images, a digital elevation model, soil moisture layers, and 150 field plots. First, we defined three coffee AFS types based on their structural and spectral characteristics. Then, we performed a recursive feature elimination analysis to identify the most relevant predictor variables for each land use/cover class in the region. Next, we constructed a predictor variable dataset for each AFS type and one for the remaining land use/cover classes. Afterward, four maps were generated using a random forest (RF) classifier. Finally, we combined the four maps into a unique land-cover map through a maximum likelihood algorithm. Using a validation sample of 932 sites derived from Planet images (4.5 m pixel size), we estimated a 95% map overall accuracy. Two AFS types were classified as having low error; the third, with the highest tree density, had the lowest accuracy. The results obtained show that the infrared and near-infrared bands from the Sentinel-2 scenes are particularly useful for coffee AFS discrimination. However, supplementary data are required to improve the performance of the classifier. Our findings also highlight the importance of the multi-temporal and multi-dataset approach for identifying complex production systems in areas of high topographic heterogeneity.

TI  - Unrest at Cayambe Volcano revealed by SAR imagery and seismic activity after the Pedernales subduction earthquake, Ecuador (2016)
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time in decades, a sudden increase in seismicity has been observed and monitored at Cayambe volcano in Ecuador, in 2016. This seismic unrest, which occurred a few months after the April 2016, Mw 7.8 Pedernales subduction earthquake, has raised many questions, especially as there is no record of recent eruptions at Cayambe volcano. Here we analyze a time series of 104 images from Sentinel 1 (SAR) data spanning the period 2014-2018 using the NSBAS processing chain in order to quantify surface deformation around this potentially explosive and ice-covered volcano. We evidence a large-scale uplift reaching a maximum mean displacement rate of about 0.44 cm/yr in Line of Sight. This uplift is mainly due to a significant and sudden acceleration of the deformation pattern, focused on the SE flank starting in November 2016. We model this signal as related to magma emplacement at around 6 km depth below the summit, with a sudden volume influx of about 2.6 million m(3). The inflation and surface deformation pattern is concomitant in time with two Mw 3 seismic events recorded at Cayambe volcano in November 2016 and is consistent with the location at the summit of the volcano-tectonic (VT) seismic swarm from September 2016 onwards. This VT swarm follows an earlier swarm in June 2016 located on the northern side of the volcano and closer to a western branch of the Chingual-Cosanga-Pallatanga-Puna (CCPP) fault system, that plays a major role in accommodating plate tectonic processes in South America. We thus propose that static stress changes from the Pedernales megathrust earthquake triggered magma ascent below the Cayambe volcano, through reactivation of the CCPP fault system. Finally, volcanic hazards around Cayambe ice-capped volcano, previously dormant for the last 300 years, should be reassessed in light of this recent unrest.

TI  - Monitoring and Identification of Agricultural Crops through Multitemporal Analysis of Optical Images and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The information about where crops are distributed is useful for agri-environmental assessments, but is chiefly important for food security and agricultural policy managers. The quickness with which this information becomes available, especially over large areas, is important for decision makers. Methodologies have been proposed for the study of crops. Most of them require field survey for ground truth data and a single crop map is generated for the whole season at the end of the crop cycle and for the next crop cycle a new field survey is necessary. Here, we present models for recognizing maize (Zea mays L.), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) before the crop cycle ends without current-year field survey for ground truth data. The models were trained with an exhaustive field survey at plot level in a previous crop cycle. The field surveys begin since days before the emergence of crops to maturity. The algorithms used for classification were support vector machine (SVM) and bagged tree (BT), and the spectral information captured in the visible, red-edge, near infrared, and shortwave infrared regions bands of Sentinel 2 images was used. The models were validated within the next crop cycle each fifteen days before the mid-season. The overall accuracies range from 71.9% (38 days after the begin of cycle) to 87.5% (81 days after the begin cycle) and a kappa coefficient ranging from 0.53 at the beginning to 0.74 at mid-season

TI  - Multi-temporal Landsat-derived NDVI for vegetation cover degradation for the period 1984-2018 in part of the Arganeraie Biosphere Reserve (Morocco)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biosphere Reserves (BRs) are especial zones established to conserve the biodiversity (ecosystem, species or genetic). Therefore, evaluating and analyzing the ecosystem degradation in these zones are crucial for protecting them. This study attempts to assess and analyze the vegetation cover degradation during the last three decades (period between 1984 and 2018) in part of the Arganeraie Biosphere Reserve (ABR) of Morocco. The study aims to describe the ecosystem degradation scenario by using multi-temporal Landsat-derived NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and to highlight the reasonable factors causing its degradation. Long-term and short-term NDVI changes were investigated using image difference change detection technique and IsoData classification. The obtained results confirm that about 3644.64 ha of the vegetation cover was degraded during last decade. Field investigations confirm that the anthropogenic activities caused vegetation cover degradation that last a long time (2007-2018) as confirmed by long-term analysis. Forest fire, due to charcoal production, caused degradation of about 2989.59 ha of the vegetation cover during the period 2010-2018. This study has highlighted the importance to use long-term NDVI change detection to map anthropogenic-induced vegetation cover degradation and to use short-term NDVI change detection for best chronological analysis of ecosystem degradation. In addition, the easiest proposed method offers a user-friendly tool to monitor ecosystem degradation.

TI  - Evaluation of the Extent of Land Use-Land Cover Changes of Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria from 1987-2019
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Human growth and development occur at the expense of our natural resources. The ancient city of Benin, the capital of Edo State, Nigeria has been experiencing a surge in population hence this study was initiated to evaluate the extent of land use-land cover (LULC) changes over a 32-year period (1987-2019), using remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques. USGS Landsat data were acquired for 1987, 2002, and 2019, pre-processed and classified using ENVI 5.2 software and exported into ARC-GIS platform for further analysis. The results of the 1987-2019 LULC classifications were also used to forecast Benin City's LULC for 2050 using the Markov and CA-Markov models in Ten Set 17.0 software. The results showed that 284.56 km(2) of forest lands were lost over a 32-year period (1987-2019), while built-up and barren lands increased rapidly by 153.961= 2 and 81.581= 2, respectively. By 2050, the built-up area is expected to increase by 236.921= 2, while barren land is expected to maintain its percentage cover. Grassland increased by 52.16 km(2), while water decreased by 3.60 km(2), both of these classes are expected to decrease by 157.581= 2 and 0.451= 2 by 2050, respectively. The increase in population and built-up areas in Benin City contributes to deforestation and increased urban heat, as well as reduced ecosystem services and biodiversity loss. As a result, it is recommended that the Benin City Urban Planning Authority encourage the planting of ornamental trees, shrubs, and lawns in order to restore more carbon sequestration to the ecosystem and thus reduce global warming.

TI  - Ecological State of Larch Forests in the Forest-Tundra Ecotone of Western Siberia (As Exemplified by the Mongayurbey River Valley)
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on remote sensing and tree-ring chronology data, the ecological state of the extrazonal sparse larch forest in the Mongayurbey River valley (Taz Peninsula) has been studied. This area is one of the northernmost enclaves of taiga vegetation in Western Siberia. An analysis of Terra-MODIS satellite images from 2000 to 2020 shows that the value of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImean), which reflects the average amount of photosynthetically active phytomass for the summer period, most strongly depends on air temperature (correlation coefficient R = 0.69). However, despite the steady trend towards an increase in the avarage annual summer temperatures, no statistically significant trend in the vegetation index is found, which is due to the inertness of the shrub-moss-lichen ground cover. An analysis of the relationship between the maximum normalized difference vegetation index NDVImax and the absolute tree ring width (TRW) in Larix sibirica Ledeb. shows a strong correlation (R = 0.72) in the marginal, near-watershed area, where a young forest stand with the highest crown density and abundant undergrowth is located. In the valley areas, conversely, forest-stand digression associated with the deterioration of natural conditions is seen (changes in drainage, soil characteristics, and permafrost-geochemical conditions). With continued warming, the spread of the larch forest from the river floodplain to the watershed can be expected, which confirms the current shift of the forest vegetation boundary to the north.

AB  - This study examines uncertainties in the retrieval of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for different aerosol types, which are obtained from different satellite-borne aerosol retrieval products over North Africa, California, Germany, and India and Pakistan in the years 2007-2019. In particular, we compared the aerosol types reported as part of the AOD retrieval from MODIS/MAIAC and CALIOP, with the latter reporting richer aerosol types than the former, and from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and MODIS Deep Blue (DB), which retrieve aerosol products at a lower spatial resolution than MODIS/MAIAC. Whereas MODIS and OMI provide aerosol products nearly every day over of the study areas, CALIOP has only a limited surface footprint, which limits using its data products together with aerosol products from other platforms for, e.g., estimation of surface particulate matter (PM) concentrations. In general, CALIOP and MAIAC AOD showed good agreement with the AERONET AOD (r: 0.708, 0.883; RMSE: 0.317, 0.123, respectively), but both CALIOP and MAIAC AOD retrievals were overestimated (36-57%) with respect to the AERONET AOD. The aerosol type reported by CALIOP (an active sensor) and by MODIS/MAIAC (a passive sensor) were examined against aerosol types derived from a combination of satellite data products retrieved by MODIS/DB (Angstrom Exponent, AE) and OMI (Aerosols Index, AI, the aerosol absorption at the UV band). Together, the OMI-DB (AI-AE) classification, which has wide spatiotemporal cover, unlike aerosol types reported by CALIOP or derived from AERONET measurements, was examined as auxiliary data for a better interpretation of the MAIAC aerosol type classification. Our results suggest that the systematic differences we found between CALIOP and MODIS/MAIAC AOD were closely related to the reported aerosol types. Hence, accounting for the aerosol type may be useful when predicting surface PM and may allow for the improved quantification of the broader environmental impacts of aerosols, including on air pollution and haze, visibility, climate change and radiative forcing, and human health.

TI  - Improved U-Net Remote Sensing Classification Algorithm Fusing Attention and Multiscale Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The selection and representation of classification features in remote sensing image play crucial roles in image classification accuracy. To effectively improve the features classification accuracy, an improved U-Net remote sensing classification algorithm fusing attention and multiscale features is proposed in this paper, called spatial attention-atrous spatial pyramid pooling U-Net (SA-UNet). This framework connects atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) with the convolutional units of the encoder of the original U-Net in the form of residuals. The ASPP module expands the receptive field, integrates multiscale features in the network, and enhances the ability to express shallow features. Through the fusion residual module, shallow and deep features are deeply fused, and the characteristics of shallow and deep features are further used. The spatial attention mechanism is used to combine spatial with semantic information so that the decoder can recover more spatial information. In this study, the crop distribution in central Guangxi province was analyzed, and experiments were conducted based on Landsat 8 multispectral remote sensing images. The experimental results showed that the improved algorithm increases the classification accuracy, with the accuracy increasing from 93.33% to 96.25%, The segmentation accuracy of sugarcane, rice, and other land increased from 96.42%, 63.37%, and 88.43% to 98.01%, 83.21%, and 95.71%, respectively. The agricultural planting area results obtained by the proposed algorithm can be used as input data for regional ecological models, which is conducive to the development of accurate and real-time crop growth change models.

TI  - Seismogenic fault of the 2020 <i>M</i><sub>W</sub>6.3 Yutian, Xinjiang earthquake revealed from InSAR observations and its implications for the growth of the rift in the North Tibet
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Normal faulting (NF) earthquakes are important tectonic processes in the Tibetan Plateau, which is likely related to the growth of the Tibetan Plateau. On June 25, 2020, an M(W)6.3 NF earthquake occurred in Yutian, Xinjiang. The epicenter was located near the Gongga fault in the western Bayan Har structural junction in the northern Tibetan Plateau. From 2008 to 2020, four earthquakes of M>6 occurred in the Yutian area, three of which resulted from NF. In this study, we used the SAR data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS2 satellites to obtain the co- and post-seismic deformation in the Line of Sight (LOS) direction following the mainshock. Based on the InSAR LOS measurements, we determined the fault geometric parameters, coseismic slip and early afterslip of the Yutian earthquake using a two-step geophysical inversion strategy. The InSAR observations show continuous subsidence in the epicentral area through the co- and post-seismic processes, in which the maximum coseismic deformation reaches up to 20 cm, and the cumulative postseismic deformation in the first 6 months is greater than 3 cm. The modelling results show that the coseismic slip is concentrated at depth of 7 km, while the afterslip requires a shallower and steeper fault structure, implying that the earthquake fault may have a listric shape. We compiled over 10 NF earthquakes source parameters across the Tibetan Plateau. Their dip angles gradually increase from south to north, while they are inversely correlated to the geological extension rates. This further indicates that the dip of a normal fault can be an indicator of the progress of the rift growing.

TI  - How Have Global River Widths Changed Over Time?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in a river's width reflect natural and anthropogenic impacts on local and upstream/downstream hydraulic and hydrologic processes. Temporal variation of river width also impacts biogeochemical exchange and reflects geomorphologic evolution. However, while global maps of mean river width and dynamic water surface extent exist, there is currently no standardized global assessment of river widths that documents changes over time. Therefore, we made repeated width measurements from Landsat images for all rivers wider than 90 m collected from 1984 to 2020 (named Global LOng-term river Width, GLOW), which consists of similar to 1.2 billion cross-sectional river width measurements, with an average of 3,000 width measurements per 10-km reach. With GLOW, we investigated the temporal variations of global river width, quantified by the interquartile range (IQR) and temporal trend. We found that 85% of global rivers have a width IQR <150 m. We also found that 37% of global river segments show significant temporal trends in width over the past 37 years, and this number is higher (46%) for human-regulated rivers. Further, we leveraged machine learning to identify the most important factors explaining river width variations and revealed that these driving factors are significantly different between free-flowing and non-free-flowing rivers. Specifically, the most important factor driving temporal variations in river width is the climate for free-flowing rivers, and is soil condition for human-impacted rivers. Finally, we anticipate that this study and the public release of GLOW will improve the understanding of river dynamics and catalyze additional interdisciplinary studies.

TI  - Comparison of UAV RGB Imagery and Hyperspectral Remote-Sensing Data for Monitoring Winter Wheat Growth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although crop-growth monitoring is important for agricultural managers, it has always been a difficult research topic. However, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with RGB and hyperspectral cameras can now acquire high-resolution remote-sensing images, which facilitates and accelerates such monitoring. To explore the effect of monitoring a single crop-growth indicator and multiple indicators, this study combines six growth indicators (plant nitrogen content, above-ground biomass, plant water content, chlorophyll, leaf area index, and plant height) into the new comprehensive growth index (CGI). We investigate the performance of RGB imagery and hyperspectral data for monitoring crop growth based on multi-time estimation of the CGI. The CGI is estimated from the vegetation indices based on UAV hyperspectral data treated by linear, nonlinear, and multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares (PLSR), and random forest (RF). The results are as follows: (1) The RGB-imagery indices red reflectance (r), the excess-red index (EXR), the vegetation atmospherically resistant index (VARI), and the modified green-red vegetation index (MGRVI), as well as the spectral indices consisting of the linear combination index (LCI), the modified simple ratio index (MSR), the simple ratio vegetation index (SR), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are more strongly correlated with the CGI than a single growth-monitoring indicator. (2) The CGI estimation model is constructed by comparing a single RGB-imagery index and a spectral index, and the optimal RGB-imagery index corresponding to each of the four growth stages in order is r, r, r, EXR; the optimal spectral index is LCI for all four growth stages. (3) The MLR, PLSR, and RF methods are used to estimate the CGI. The MLR method produces the best estimates. (4) Finally, the CGI is more accurately estimated using the UAV hyperspectral indices than using the RGB-image indices.

TI  - Unsupervised change detection of man-made objects using coherent and incoherent features of multi-temporal SAR images
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Constrained by complex imaging mechanism and extraordinary visual appearance, change detection with syn-thetic aperture radar (SAR) images has been a difficult research topic, especially in urban areas. Although existing studies have extended from bi-temporal data pair to multi-temporal datasets to derive more plentiful information, there are still two problems to be solved in practical applications. First, change indicators constructed from incoherent feature only cannot characterize the change objects accurately. Second, the results of pixel-level methods are usually presented in the form of the noisy binary map, making the spatial change not intuitive and the temporal change of a single pixel meaningless. In this study, we propose an unsupervised man-made objects change detection frame-work using both coherent and incoherent features derived from multi-temporal SAR images. The coefficients of variation in time -series incoherent features and the man-made object index (MOI) defined with coherent features are first combined to identify the initial change pixels. Afterwards, an improved spatiotemporal clustering algorithm is developed based on density-based spa-tial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and dynamic time warping (DTW), which can transform the initial results into noiseless object-level patches, and take the cluster center as a representative of the man-made object to determine the change pattern of each patch. An experiment with a stack of 10 Ter-raSAR-X images in Stripmap mode demonstrated that this method is effective in urban scenes and has the potential appli-cability to wide area change detection.

TI  - Elevation Extraction from Spaceborne SAR Tomography Using Multi-Baseline COSMO-SkyMed SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR tomography (TomoSAR) extends SAR interferometry (InSAR) to image a complex 3D scene with multiple scatterers within the same SAR cell. The phase calibration method and the super-resolution reconstruction method play a crucial role in 3D TomoSAR imaging from multi-baseline SAR stacks, and they both influence the accuracy of the 3D SAR tomographic imaging results. This paper presents a systematic processing method for 3D SAR tomography imaging. Moreover, with the newly released TanDEM-X 12 m DEM, this study proposes a new phase calibration method based on SAR InSAR and DEM error estimation with the super-resolution reconstruction compressive sensing (CS) method for 3D TomoSAR imaging using COSMO-SkyMed Spaceborne SAR data. The test, fieldwork, and results validation were executed at Zipingpu Dam, Dujiangyan, Sichuan, China. After processing, the 1 m resolution TomoSAR elevation extraction results were obtained. Against the terrestrial Lidar 'truth' data, the elevation results were shown to have an accuracy of 0.25 +/- 1.04 m and a RMSE of 1.07 m in the dam area. The results and their subsequent validation demonstrate that the X band data using the CS method are not suitable for forest structure reconstruction, but are fit for purpose for the elevation extraction of manufactured facilities including buildings in the urban area.

TI  - Remote Sensing Retrieval of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Lake Chaohu Based on Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Satellite
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a is a critical water quality parameter which can be used to evaluate the eutrophication degree of lakes. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of real-time, rapidity and wide monitoring range and has been widely used in inland lake water environment monitoring. Obtaining the chlorophyll-a concentration in lakes dynamically in real-time is significant for lake governance. The spectral characteristics of inland lakes are complex. So, it is difficult to accurately obtain the spectral characteristics of water bodies by multi-spectral remote sensing data. The Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral satellite has a broad application prospect in remote sensing monitoring of inland lakes because of its high spectral resolution and sufficient band. In this paper, the hyperspectral data of Zhuhai-1 is selected to retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentration in Chaohu Lake. First, extract the remote sensing reflectance curve at the measured point from the image, filter the bands with significant spectral characteristics according to the curve, and use the OIF index to measure the ability of different band combinations to obtain water body composition information. And finally build the band combination, which is highly correlated with the actual measurement chlorophyll-a concentration. The results show that the three-band model [R-rs (700 nm)(-1) R-rs (670 nm)(-1)] X R-rs (746 nm) constructed by Zhuhai-1 in bands 14, 16 and 19 has achieved high accuracy in retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration in Lake Chaohu, the MRE is 19. 97% and the RMSE is 10. 85 mg . m(-3), which is superior to most previous spaceborne remote sensing data sources. Retrieving the spatial distribution map of chlorophyll-a concentration of Chaohu Lake on May 10, 2019, shows that the chlorophyll-a concentration is increasing from east to west. The concentration of chlorophyll-a in the south and northeast of the lake is low, and the chlorophyll-a concentration in the north of West Chaohu The concentration of a reaches the highest concentration. The overall concentration of chlorophyll-a in West Chao Lake is the highest, especially in its northern waters, where the water quality is poor, and a certain bloom area has appeared. The main reason is that the area is close to Hefei City and is more susceptible to strong solid activities and large discharges of sewage and wastewater. The Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral satellite has certain advantages for the water quality retrieval of inland lakes, but it also has limitations such as difficulty in data processing, low band utilization, and poor universality of inversion models. It is necessary to use the Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral data to carry out more lake remote sensing research, continue to propose new methods of hyperspectral remote sensing image processing, and improve the accuracy and universality of the inversion model, fully tap the potential of the data source.

TI  - Assessing Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Deep Percolation Using Crop Evapotranspiration Derived from Earth Observations through Google Earth Engine
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Excess irrigation may result in deep percolation and nitrate transport to groundwater. Furthermore, under Mediterranean climate conditions, heavy winter rains often result in high deep percolation, requiring the separate identification of the two sources of deep percolated water. An integrated methodology was developed to estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics of deep percolation, with the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act) being derived from satellite images data and processed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. GEE allowed to extract time series of vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 enabling to define the actual crop coefficient (K-c act) curves based on the observed lengths of crop growth stages. The crop growth stage lengths were then used to feed the soil water balance model ISAREG, and the standard K-c values were derived from the literature; thus, allowing the estimation of irrigation water requirements and deep drainage for independent Homogeneous Units of Analysis (HUA) at the Irrigation Scheme. The HUA are defined according to crop, soil type, and irrigation system. The ISAREG model was previously validated for diverse crops at plot level showing a good accuracy using soil water measurements and farmers' irrigation calendars. Results show that during the crop season, irrigation caused 11 +/- 3% of the total deep percolation. When the hotspots associated with the irrigation events corresponded to soils with low suitability for irrigation, the cultivated crop had no influence. However, maize and spring vegetables stood out when the hotspots corresponded to soils with high suitability for irrigation. On average, during the off-season period, deep percolation averaged 54 +/- 6% of the annual precipitation. The spatial aggregation into the Irrigation Scheme scale provided a method for earth-observation-based accounting of the irrigation water requirements, with interest for the water user's association manager, and at the same time for the detection of water losses by deep percolation and of hotspots within the irrigation scheme.

T2  - REVISTA DA ANPOLL
M3  - Article
AB  - Blindness (2008) by Fernando Meirelles used its mode of production as a motive to situate its story in urban spaces that results in fact from an assembled city. Filming Blindness took place in Toronto, Sao Paulo, Osaka and Montevideo. The resulting globalized city blurs the insight in Saramago's novel regarding the limits of individuality by offering a homogeneous worldview that levels socio-economic differences, especially between the north and the south. Losing (clear) sight is in the original text in fact a metaphor for the inability of coping with society's inhumanity. The aim of this article is to study the film by using the concepts of e-mo-tion and indisciplinarity to reveal that Blindness is nothing more than a conventional approach towards a more complex idea on the loss of sight. By producing it for a globalized audience, the blindness is only aesthetically mimiced and thus elimenates Saramago's lucidity regarding the loss of sight of an entire civilization.

TI  - Analysing the capability of a catchment's spectral signature to regionalize hydrological parameters
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resource management in ungauged catchments is complex due to uncertainties around the hydrological parameters that characterize streamflow behaviour. These parameters are usually defined by regionalization approaches, in which the hydrological response patterns of ungauged basins are inferred from those of gauged basins. Regression-based methods using physical properties derived from cartographic data sources are widely used. The current remote sensing techniques offer new opportunities for the regionalization of hydrological parameters since the hydrological response depends on the physical attributes related to the spectral responses of a given land surface. Moreover, machine learning approaches have not been specifically applied to the regionalization of hydrological parameters in forested areas. This work studies the capability of a catchment's spectral signature based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to address a regression-based regionalization of hydrological model parameters using a machine learning approach. Hydrological modelling was conducted by the HBV-light model. We tested the random forest algorithm in several regionalization scenarios: the new approach using the catchments' spectral signature, the traditional method using physical properties and a fusion of these methods. The calibration results were excellent (median KGE = 0.83), and the regionalized parameters achieved good performance, in which the three scenarios showed almost the same goodness of fit (median KGE = 0.45-0.50). We found that the effectiveness depends on the climatic environment and that predictions in humid catchments exhibited better performance than those in the driest catchments. The physical approach (median KGE = 0.71) exhibited better performance than the spectral approach (median KGE = 0.64) in humid catchments, whereas spectral regionalization (median KGE = 0.33) enhanced the physical scenario in the driest catchments (median KGE = 0.25). Our results confirm that regionalization is still challenging in drier climates, such as in the Mediterranean environment. The new spectral approach showed promising results and it was effective in the analysis of the relationship between the spectral response of the territory and its hydrological characteristics, specially, where no cartographic data is available.

TI  - "THE POET'S INIMITABLE BREATH": THE WORD IN THE PRACTICE OF CREATING AN ARTIST'S BOOK BY MIKHAIL POGARSKY
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - In contemporary Russian book culture, a special place belongs to such a phenomenon as the artist's book. Having a long history of development, at the beginning of the 21st century, it is often correlated with the idea of overcoming the postmodernist mentality. The most characteristic example of this kind is the theoretical and practical study of the artist's book by Mikhail Pogarsky. In the Phenomenon of Artist's Book (2013, 2014) and the Artist's Book [+] (2015), Pogarsky makes an attempt to fit the artist's book into the modern cultural paradigm. He thinks of the artist's book as a manifestation of a new artistic worldview, "artlibria", which is characterized by a complex multilevel perception and transformation of reality. The artist's book by Pogarsky corresponds to the idea of "total synthesis": it integrates the old and the new, the verbal and the visual, the virtual and the real, fulfilling the main goal of the worldview - overcoming chaos and "assembling the world". By connecting word and image, the artist opens up limitless opportunities for creative self-expression and includes the viewer-reader in the active process of unraveling and creating meanings. The artist's book is characterized by a change in the status of the text, a rethinking of the correlation between the verbal and the visual. The text becomes a source of creative metamorphosis, predetermines the selection of visual objects. The idea of the artist's book is embodied by both literary means and signs of culture. Important is its visual solution; spaces selected for the demonstration of such a book can also actualize additional meanings. Pogarsky's works demonstrate different ways of incorporating text into the artist's book, allowing us to speak about the principal absence of a correlation, set once and for all, between the verbal and the visual. The book The Element and the Wind (1996) embodies the principle of superposition of meanings, the correlation of different sides of artistic reception, which is characteristic of the artist's book. In Pogarsky's practice, the principle of the so-called "moment-form" becomes a notable method of including text in the artist's book. This principle is realized in the book Labyrinths of Dreams (2000) and is reduced to a refusal of the set sequence of fragments of the text, and for the reader-viewer the sequence will also be casual. This open nature of the artist's book makes it a way of an autonomous statement, offering a special artistic optics, combining verbal and object-visual planes. The viewer-reader is included not only in the process of unraveling the artist's book, but also in the wide semantic field of culture.

TI  - Timely Plastic-Mulched Cropland Extraction Method from Complex Mixed Surfaces in Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic mulch is extensively applied in agricultural production in arid regions. It significantly influences the interactions between land and atmosphere by altering underlying surface characteristics. An accurate and timely extraction method for Plastic-Mulched Cropland (PMC) is required to understand land surface energy transfer processes, eco-hydrological cycle, the climate effect of PMC, and in the management of water resources. In this study, we proposed a Timely Plastic-mulched cropland Extraction Method (TPEM) from complex mixed surfaces with multi-source remote sensing data in the Shiyanghe River Basin (SRB), a typical representation of a complex and inhomogeneous arid region in the northwest of China. We defined TPEM in three phases; in the first phase, the spectral characteristic curves were drawn from ground object points labeled by visual interpretation with multi-source remote sensing data. In the second phase, a spectral characteristic analysis of the modified index was proposed to amplify the difference between PMC and non-PMC ground objects. Finally, the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) classifier was used to generate thresholds of indices as PMC extraction rules. The results showed that it can extract the boundary of PMC in large-scale farmland, distinguish PMC from ground objects in complex mixed surfaces, and separate the PMC from desert land that shares same spectral characteristics with PMC. The TPEM is verified to be efficient and robust, with an overall accuracy of 0.9234, quantity disagreement of 0.0541, and allocation disagreement of 0.0224, and outperformed two extensively used PMC extraction methods, especially for timely PMC extraction when satellite data only during the period that ground surface incomplete covered by plastic mulch is available. This study will provide us with an accurate and timely method to extract PMC, especially in the widely distributed complex mixed surfaces.

TI  - Modeling Shadow with Voxel-Based Trees for Sentinel-2 Reflectance Simulation in Tropical Rainforest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based gross primary production (GPP) estimation has uncertainties due to shadow fraction caused by the geometric relationship between the complex forest structure and the Sun. The virtual forests allow shadow fraction estimation without 3D measurements, but require optimal structural parameters. In this study, we developed the reflectance simulator (Canopy-level Shadow and Reflectance Simulator, CSRS) that considers tree shadows and the method to determine the optimal canopy shape for shadow fraction estimation. The target forest is any tropical evergreen forest which accounts for 58% of tropical forests. Firstly, we analyzed the effects of canopy shape on the reflectance simulation based on virtual forests created with different canopy shapes. This result was checked by Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test. Secondly, the optimal canopy shape was determined by comparing the reflectance from Sentinel-2 Band 4 (red) bottom of atmosphere reflectance with those simulated from virtual forests. Finally, the shadow fraction estimated from the virtual forest was evaluated. Since the focus of this study was to derive the optimal canopy shape, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) structure from motion (SfM) was used to obtain the parameters other than canopy shape and to validate the estimated shadow fraction. The results showed that when the Sun zenith angle (SZA) was more than 20 degrees, significant differences were observed among canopy shapes. The least root mean square error (RMSE) for reflectance simulation was 0.385 from the canopy shape of a half ellipsoid. Moreover, the half ellipsoid also showed the smallest RMSE in estimating shadow fraction (0.032), which indicated the reliability and applicability of CSRS. This study is the first attempt to determine the optimal canopy shape for estimating shadow fraction and is expected to improve the accuracy of GPP estimation in the future.

TI  - Safety evaluation of Fy Protein™ (Nutritional Fungi Protein), a macroingredient for human consumption
T2  - FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fy Protein (TM) (Nutritional Fungi Protein) is a macro-ingredient produced from the fermentation of the fungal microorganism Fusarium strain flavolapis, isolated from springs in Yellowstone National Park. Fy Protein contains all of the essential amino acids plus fiber, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals and is developed as an alternative to animal-based protein foods such as meat and dairy.Fy Protein's nutritional, digestibility, genotoxicity, allergenicity, toxicity, secondary metabolites, and pathogenicity were evaluated. Fy Protein did not show mutagenic or genotoxic potential in in vitro tests. In an allergenicity review, Fy Protein was found to be of low allergenic potential. In a 90-day sub chronic dietary study in rats, administration of Fy Protein did not produce any significant toxicologic manifestations, and the no observed effect level (NOAEL) was the highest-level fed of 150,000 ppm (15% in the diet). Regulated secondary metabolites from fungi (termed mycotoxins) were non-detectable and below regulated levels using quantitative analytical techniques. A literature review was completed to identify the potential human pathogenicity of Fusarium sp., showing that Fusarium rarely infects humans, with infections seldom developing even in immunocompromised individuals.The results of these studies confirm that Fy Protein from fermented F. str. flavolapis has low toxicological, genotoxic, pathogenic, and allergenic potential under the conditions tested and anticipated use.

TI  - Icings of the Kunlun Mountains on the Northern Margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Western China: Origins, Hydrology and Distribution
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Icing/Aufeis processes are a typical feature of permafrost hydrology in mountainous regions. Regional databases of Aufeis have been compiled since the 2010. In this study, we attempted to create an initial Aufeis database for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) to evaluate the patterns of the icing processes in the arid and high mountain regions at low latitudes. In this article, the icings/Aufeis in the Kunlun Mountains on the northern edge of the QTP were investigated. A total of 65 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images for 2017-2020 of the key sites were acquired. Icings occur at elevations of 2500-5400 m a. s. l. More than 1600 Aufeis were identified with a total ice-surface area of 2670 km(2). About 88% of these areas are related to a gigantic Aufeis (tarin) field. Artesian aquifers related to the active faults play an important role in feeding the Aufeis in the Kunlun Mountains. About 120 Aufeis fed on glacier-melt have formed in the West Kunlun Mountains. Icing development was found to vary with the order of river channels and more than half of all of the identified Aufeis are located along first- and second-order river channels. The significance of Aufeis at the QTP related to as an indicator of climate change, and a volume of surface and ground waters conserved into Aufeis should take into consideration of river runoff estimation of the region.

TI  - Predicting High-risk and High-cost Patients for Proactive Intervention
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is well known that 20% of the patients incur 80% of health care costs and many diseases and complications can be prevented or ameliorated with prompt intervention. One of the well-recognized strategies for cost reduction and better outcomes is to predict or identify high-risk and high-cost (HRHC) patients for proactive intervention. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a predictive model that can be used to identify HRHC patients more accurately for proactive intervention. Methods: This is an observational study using fiscal year (FY) 2018 administrative data to predict FY 2019 total cost at the patient level. All 5,676,248 patients who received care in both FYs 2018 and 2019 from the Veterans Health Administration were included in the analyses. The Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse was our main data source. With split-sample analyses, 3 sets of patient comorbidities and 5 statistical models were assessed for the highest predictive power. Results: The Box-Cox regression using comorbidities designated by the expanded CCSR (Clinical Classifications Software Refined) groups as predictors yielded the highest predictive power. The R (2) reached 0.51 and 0.37 for the transformed and raw scale cost, respectively. Conclusions: The predictive model developed in this study exhibits substantially higher predictive power than what has been reported in the literature. The algorithm based on administrative data and a publicly available patient classification system can be readily implemented by other value-based health systems to identify HRHC patients for proactive intervention.

TI  - Assessment and correction of radiometric calibration for the medium resolution spectral imager on FY-3C
T2  - OPTICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a keystone instrument on the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite, the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) provides global coverage of top-of-atmosphere radiances for a broad range of scientific studies of the earth system. Based on the onboard measurements of the blackbody (BB) and deep space view (SV), the modified radiometric calibration equation was first given for the MERSI thermal emission band. The accuracy of the radiometric calibration was evaluated by comparing the average irradiance corresponding to the spectral response function and the irradiance corresponding to the wavelength, whose relative error was <0.40%. Moreover, the BB-derived brightness temperature T-R calculated by the BB irradiance shows a systematic error relative to the BB equivalent temperature T-E obtained by the voltage code values of seven platinum resistors, and the value of T-R was lower 0.25 K than that of T-E. To further verify the validity of the calibration coefficient, the influences of the BB temperature, wavelength, and emissivity offsets on the derived irradiance and temperature of the earth were analyzed in detail. For the BB temperature changing by 0.10 K, the absolute values of the earth irradiance together with its equivalent temperature were 0.01 Wm(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1) and 0.10 K, respectively, whose relative errors were about 0.16% and 0.40%. When the BB wavelength and emissivity changing by 0.1 mu m and 0.005, the variations of the earth irradiance were 0.02 and 0.04 Wm(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1), respectively, whereas the relative errors of the equivalent temperature were 0.07% and 0.11%. These works provided an important theoretical guidance for the satellite data assimilations along with the quantitative remote sensing applications.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma: European consensus-based interdisciplinary guideline - Update 2022
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cutaneous malignancies. It is found predominantly in white populations and risk factors include advanced age, ultraviolet exposure, male sex, immunosuppression, such as AIDS/ HIV infection, haematological malignancies or solid organ transplantation, and Merkel cell polyomavirus infection.MCC is an aggressive tumour with 26% of cases presenting lymph node involvement at diagnosis and 8% with distant metastases. Five-year overall survival rates range between 48% and 63%. Two subsets of MCC have been characterised with distinct molecular pathogenetic pathways: ultraviolet-induced MCC versus virus-positive MCC, which carries a better prognosis. In both subtypes, there are alterations in the retinoblastoma protein and p53 gene structure and function. MCC typically manifests as a red nodule or plaque with fast growth, most commonly on sun exposed areas. Histopathology (small-cell neuroendocrine appearance) and immunohistochemistry (CK20 positivity and TTF-1 negativity) confirm the diagnosis. The current staging systems are the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for international Cancer control 8th edition. Baseline whole body imaging is encouraged to rule out regional and distant metastasis.For localised MCC, first-line treatment is surgical excision with postoperative margin assessment followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended in all patients with MCC without clinically detectable lymph nodes or distant metastasis. Adjuvant RT alone, eventually combined with complete lymph nodes dissection is proposed in case of micrometastatic nodal involvement. In case of macroscopic nodal involvement, the standard of care is complete lymph nodes dissection potentially followed by post-operative RT. Immunotherapy with anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies should be offered as first-line systemic treatment in advanced MCC. Chemotherapy can be used when patients fail to respond or are intolerant for anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy or clinical trials. Crown Copyright (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Improved Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval Algorithm for Multiangle Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The DPC is a multiangle sensor that detects atmospheric parameters. However, the retrieval of high-precision and high-spatial-resolution aerosol products from the DPC remains a great challenge due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Thus, a novel aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm was proposed using visible surface reflectance relationships (VISRRs). The VISRR algorithm accounts for the surface anisotropy and needs neither a shortwave infrared band nor a surface reflectance database that can retrieve AOD over dark and bright land cover. Firstly, moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance (MYD09) products were used to derive the preceding surface reflectance relationships (SRRs), which are related to surface types, scattering angle, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Furthermore, to solve the problem of the NDVI being susceptible to the atmosphere, an innovative method based on an iterative atmospheric correction was proposed to provide a realistic NDVI. The VISRR algorithm was then applied to the thirteen months of DPC multiangle data over the China region. AOD product comparison between the DPC and MODIS showed that they had similar spatial distribution, but the DPC had both high spatial resolution and coverage. The validation between the ground-based sites and the retrieval results showed that the DPC AOD performed best, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.88, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17, and a good fraction (Gfrac) of 62.7%. Then, the uncertainties regarding the AOD products were discussed for future improvements. Our results revealed that the VISRR algorithm is an effective method for retrieving reliable, simultaneously high-spatial-resolution and full-surface-coverage AOD data with good accuracy.

TI  - Deriving River Discharge Using Remotely Sensed Water Surface Characteristics and Satellite Altimetry in the Mississippi River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharges are critical for understanding hydrologic and ecological systems, yet in situ data are limited in many regions of the world. While approximating river discharge using satellite-derived water surface characteristics is possible, the key challenges are unknown channel bathymetry and roughness. Here, we present an application for merging mean river-reach characteristics and time-varying altimetry measurements to estimate river discharge for sites within the Mississippi River Basin (USA). This project leverages the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) River Database (SWORD) for approximating mean river-reach widths and slopes and altimetry data from JASON-2/3 (2008-Present) and Sentinel-3A/B (2015-Present) obtained from the Hydroweb Theia virtual stations. River discharge is calculated using Manning's Equation, with optimized parameters for surface roughness, bottom elevation, and channel shape determined using the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). The results of this study indicate the use of optimized characteristics return 87% of sites with KGE > -0.41, which indicates that the approach provides discharges that outperform using the mean discharge. The use of precipitation to approximate missing flows not observed by satellites results in 66% of sites with KGE > -0.41, while the use of TWSA results in 65% of sites with KGE > -0.41. Future research will focus on extending this application for all available sites in the United States, as well as trying to understand how climate and landscape factors (e.g., precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, landcover) relate to river and watershed characteristics.

TI  - Study on the Spatial Interaction between Urban Economic and Ecological Environment-A Case Study of Wuhan City
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to study the interactive relationship between urban economic and ecological environment, taking Wuhan as an example, Landsat and MODIS remote sensing satellite data and social and economic data were fused with multisource data, and multidimensional indicators were selected to construct the comprehensive evaluation index system of urban economic and ecological environment. The weights were determined by combining subjective and objective methods. Then, the decoupling elasticity coefficient method and spatial autocorrelation model were used to evaluate the dynamic relationship and spatial relationship between economic development and ecological environment in Wuhan from 2014 to 2020. The results showed that there was an interaction between the urban economic and the ecological environment in Wuhan. The ecological level index had a spatial effect, the adjustment of industrial structure had a positive effect on the improvement of the ecological level, and the improvement of the ecological level was also helpful to promote economic development. The typical districts of Huangpi District, Xinzhou District, Jiangxia District, Hannan District, Caidian District, and Hongshan District had superior location and ecological advantages, as well as high development potential. Lastly, on the basis of the empirical analysis results, policy suggestions are made from four aspects: regional differentiated construction, green development, energy consumption, and wetland construction.

TI  - Monitoring Duckweeds (<i>Lemna minor</i>) in Small Rivers Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery: Application of Vegetation and Water Indices to the Lis River (Portugal)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Duckweed species, particularly Lemna minor, are widely found in freshwaters all over the world. This macrophyte provides multiple ecosystems' functions and services, but its excessive proliferation can have negative environmental impacts (including ecological and socio-economic impacts). This work explores the use of remote sensing tools for mapping the dynamics of Lemna minor in open watercourses, which could contribute to identifying suitable monitoring programs and integrated management practices. The study focuses on a selected section of the Lis River (Portugal), a small river that is often affected by water pollution. The study approach uses spatiotemporal multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and from 2021 and investigates the potential of remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Aquatic Vegetation Index (NDAVI), Green Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)) for detecting duckweeds' infestation and its severity. The NDAVI was identified as the vegetation index (VI) that better depicted the presence of duckweeds in the surface of the water course; however, results obtained for the other VIs are also encouraging, with NDVI showing a response that is very similar to NDAVI. Results are promising regarding the ability of remote sensing products to provide insight into the behavior of Lemna minor and to identify problematic sections along small watercourses.

TI  - Forest Fire Effects on Landscape Snow Albedo Recovery and Decay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface snow albedo (SSA) darkens immediately following a forest fire, while landscape snow albedo (LSA) brightens as more of the snow-covered surface becomes visible under the charred canopy. The duration and variability of the post-fire snow albedo recovery process remain unknown beyond a few years following the fire. We evaluated the temporal variability of post-fire snow albedo recovery relative to burn severity across a chronosequence of eight burned forests burned from 2000 to 2019, using pre- and post-fire daily, seasonal, and annual landscape snow albedo data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD10A1). Post-fire annual LSA increased by 21% the first year following the fire and increased continually by 33% on average across all eight forest fires and burn severity classifications over the period of record (18 years following a fire). Post-fire LSA measurements increased by 63% and 53% in high and moderate burn severity areas over ten years following fire. While minimum and maximum snow albedo values increased relative to annual post-fire LSA recovery, daily snow albedo decay following fresh snowfall accelerated following forest fire during the snowmelt period. Snow albedo recovery over 10 years following fire did not resemble the antecedent pre-fire unburned forest but more resembled open meadows. The degradation of forest canopy structure is the key driver underlying the paradox of the post-fire snow albedo change (SSA vs. LSA).

TI  - Linear and Non-Linear Vegetation Trend Analysis throughout Iran Using Two Decades of MODIS NDVI Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is the main component of the terrestrial Earth, and it plays an imperative role in carbon cycle regulation and surface water/energy exchange/balance. The coupled effects of climate change and anthropogenic forcing have undoubtfully impacted the vegetation cover in linear/non-linear manners. Considering the essential benefits of vegetation to the environment, it is vital to investigate the vegetation dynamics through spatially and temporally consistent workflows. In this regard, remote sensing, especially Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has offered a reliable data source for vegetation monitoring and trend analysis. In this paper, two decades (2000 to 2020) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI datasets (MOD13Q1) were used for vegetation trend analysis throughout Iran. First, the per-pixel annual NDVI dataset was prepared using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) by averaging all available NDVI values within the growing season and was then fed into the PolyTrend algorithm for linear/non-linear trend identification. In total, nearly 14 million pixels (44% of Iran) were subjected to trend analysis, and the results indicated a higher rate of greening than browning across the country. Regarding the trend types, linear was the dominant trend type with 14%, followed by concealed (11%), cubic (8%), and quadratic (2%), while 9% of the vegetation area remained stable (no trend). Both positive and negative directions were observed in all trend types, with the slope magnitudes ranging between -0.048 and 0.047 (NDVI units) per year. Later, precipitation and land cover datasets were employed to further investigate the vegetation dynamics. The correlation coefficient between precipitation and vegetation (NDVI) was 0.54 based on all corresponding observations (n = 1785). The comparison between vegetation and precipitation trends revealed matched trend directions in 60% of cases, suggesting the potential impact of precipitation dynamics on vegetation covers. Further incorporation of land cover data showed that grassland areas experienced significant dynamics with the highest proportion compared to other vegetation land cover types. Moreover, forest and cropland had the highest positive and negative trend direction proportions. Finally, independent (from trend analysis) sources were used to examine the vegetation dynamics (greening/browning) from other perspectives, confirming Iran's greening process and agreeing with the trend analysis results. It is believed that the results could support achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by serving as an initial stage study for establishing conservation and restoration practices.

TI  - Mapping Plant Species in a Former Industrial Site Using Airborne Hyperspectral and Time Series of Sentinel-2 Data Sets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial activities induce various impacts on ecosystems that influence species richness and distribution. An effective way to assess the resulting impacts on biodiversity lies in vegetation mapping. Species classification achieved through supervised machine learning algorithms at the pixel level has shown promising results using hyperspectral images and multispectral, multitemporal images. This study aims to determine whether airborne hyperspectral images with a high spatial resolution or phenological information obtained by spaceborne multispectral time series (Sentinel-2) are suitable to discriminate species and assess biodiversity in a complex impacted context. The industrial heritage of the study site has indeed induced high spatial heterogeneity in terms of stressors and species over a reduced scale. First, vegetation indices, derivative spectra, continuum removed spectra, and components provided by three feature extraction techniques, namely, Principal Component Analysis, Minimal Noise Fraction, and Independent Component Analysis, were calculated from reflectance spectra. These features were then analyzed through Sequential Floating Feature Selection. Supervised classification was finally performed using various machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Regularized Logistic Regression) considering a probability-based rejection approach. Biodiversity metrics were derived from resulted maps and analyzed considering the impacts. Average Overall Accuracy (AOA) reached up to 94% using the hyperspectral image and Regularized Logistic Regression algorithm, whereas the time series of multispectral images never exceeded 72% AOA. From all tested spectral transformations, only vegetation indices applied to the time series of multispectral images increased the performance. The results obtained with the hyperspectral image degraded to the specifications of Sentinel-2 emphasize the importance of fine spatial and spectral resolutions to achieve accurate mapping in this complex context. While no significant difference was found between impacted and reference sites through biodiversity metrics, vegetation mapping highlighted some differences in species distribution.

TI  - Spatially Distributed Overstory and Understory Leaf Area Index Estimated from Forest Inventory Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest change affects the relative magnitudes of hydrologic fluxes such as evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. However, much is unknown about the sensitivity of streamflow response to forest disturbance and recovery. Several physically based models recognize the different influences that overstory versus understory canopies exert on hydrologic processes, yet most input datasets consist of total leaf area index (LAI) rather than individual canopy strata. Here, we developed stratum-specific LAI datasets with the intent of improving the representation of vegetation for ecohydrologic modeling. We applied three pre-existing methods for estimating overstory LAI, and one new method for estimating both overstory and understory LAI, to measurements collected from a probability-based plot network established by the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, for a modeling domain in Montana, MT, USA. We then combined plot-level LAI estimates with spatial datasets (i.e., biophysical and remote sensing predictors) in a machine learning algorithm (random forests) to produce annual gridded LAI datasets. Methods that estimate only overstory LAI tended to underestimate LAI relative to Landsat-based LAI (mean bias error >= 0.83), while the method that estimated both overstory and understory layers was most strongly correlated with Landsat-based LAI (r(2) = 0.80 for total LAI, with mean bias error of -0.99). During 1984-2019, interannual variability of understory LAI exceeded that for overstory LAI; this variability may affect partitioning of precipitation to ET vs. runoff at annual timescales. We anticipate that distinguishing overstory and understory components of LAI will improve the ability of LAI-based models to simulate how forest change influences hydrologic processes.

TI  - A Coherent Approach to Evaluating Precipitation Forecasts over Complex Terrain
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation forecasts provided by high-resolution NWP models have a degree of realism that is very appealing to most users of meteorological data. However, it is a challenge to demonstrate whether or not such forecasts contain more skillful information than their lower resolution counterparts. A verification procedure must be based on equally detailed observations that are also realistic in areas where ground observations are not available and remote sensing data can only increase the accuracy of the location of rain events at the cost of decreased accuracy in estimating the amount of rain that has actually reached the ground. Traditional verification methods based on station or grid point comparison yield poor results for high-resolution fields due to the double penalty error that is attributed to finite space and time displacement that such methods do not account for. A complete approach to evaluating precipitation forecasts over complex terrain is suggested. The method is based on realistic gridded precipitation observations generated by an interpolation method that uses long climate data series to determine the geographical characteristics that this parameter is best correlated with as well as remote sensing estimates as background information to cover the areas where observations are insufficient. Spatial verification methodologies are subsequently applied to a convective event that accentuate the relative skill of high-resolution COSMOGR forecasts in revealing characteristics in the precipitation patterns such as structure and intensity.

TI  - GIS-based spatio-temporal assessment of forest cover change and carbon sequestrations of District Abbottabad, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plays an important role in the climate of a country and ecosystem's balance. During the last decade, District Abbottabad of Pakistan has gone through extensive land-use changes due to accelerated development, urbanization, and agriculture. This study examines the change in forest cover due to environmental factors with the help of satellite images (Landsat, Sentinel) and their classification through supervised classification, as well as the application of change detection technique after classification using geographical information system (GIS) over the last three decades (1986-2019). The land-use transition matrix was calculated from the year 1986 to 2019. The result shows an overall significant increase of 3.17, 17.24, and 7.24% in the forest, vegetation, and built-up areas, respectively; whereas, water bodies and others (barren land) have decreased significantly by 0.69 and 26.96%, respectively. This study also provides an assessment of the incline of carbon stock from the forest area over the period of the study by 17.19%.

TI  - InSAR-based mapping of ground deformation caused by industrial waste disposals: the case study of the Huelva phosphogypsum stack, SW Spain
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Close to the city of Huelva, SW Spain, and near the Atlantic Ocean, there is a phosphogypsum (PG) stack that accumulates 100 Mt of wastes and extends over 1000 ha. The stack lies directly over estuarine unconsolidated sediments with no protective layer in between. Here, we evaluate for the first time the structural stability of the PG stack, monitoring the deformation suffered by the salt-marsh basement. Through the web-based Geohazard Exploitation Platform (GEP) of the European Space Agency (ESA), a specific differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) algorithm known as Parallel Small Baseline Subset (P-SBAS) has been used to process 279 ESA Sentinel-1 images acquired between October 2016 and June 2021. Resulting displacement maps and time-series curves reveal vertical displacements of up to 16 cm/year. This vertical motion has been associated to subsidence. In parallel with subsidence, horizontal movements > 2.5 cm/year have been also accounted and linked to talus destabilization. The analysis also demonstrates that the Huelva PG stack is vulnerable to adverse weather condition. The present study demonstrates that the InSAR-based methods are effective tools for monitoring the stability and ground motion of large waste stockpiles.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Sea Surface Temperature Products from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) products that can resolve fine scale features, such as submesoscale eddies, ocean fronts and coastal upwelling, are increasingly in demand. In response to user requirements for gap-free, highest spatial resolution, best quality and highest accuracy SST data, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) produces operational, real-time Multi-sensor SST level 3 products by compositing SST from Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors on Meteorological Operational satellite (MetOp)-B and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 18, along with SST from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA 20 polar-orbiting satellites for the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) project. Here we discuss our method to combine data from different sensors and present validation of the satellite-derived SST against in situ SST data. The Multi-sensor Level 3 Super Collated (L3S) SSTs exhibit significantly greater spatial coverage and improved accuracy compared with the pre-existing IMOS AVHRR-only L3S SSTs. When compared to the Geo Polar Blended level 4 analysis SST data over the Great Barrier Reef, Multi-sensor L3S SST differs by less than 1 degrees C while exhibiting a wider range of SSTs over the region. It shows more variability and restores small-scale features better than the Geo Polar Blended level 4 analysis SST data. The operational Multi-sensor L3S SST products are used as input for applications such as IMOS OceanCurrent and the BoM ReefTemp Next-Generation Coral Bleaching Nowcasting service and provide useful insight into the study of marine heatwaves and ocean upwelling in near-coastal regions.

TI  - Temporally-Consistent Annual Land Cover from Landsat Time Series in the Southern Cone of South America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of land cover change across the planet continues to necessitate accurate methods to detect and monitor evolving processes from satellite imagery. In this context, regional and global land cover mapping over time has largely treated time as independent and addressed temporal map consistency as a post-classification endeavor. However, we argue that time can be better modeled as codependent during the model classification stage to produce more consistent land cover estimates over long time periods and gradual change events. To produce temporally-dependent land cover estimates-meaning land cover is predicted over time in connected sequences as opposed to predictions made for a given time period without consideration of past land cover-we use structured learning with conditional random fields (CRFs), coupled with a land cover augmentation method to produce time series training data and bi-weekly Landsat imagery over 20 years (1999-2018) across the Southern Cone region of South America. A CRF accounts for the natural dependencies of land change processes. As a result, it is able to produce land cover estimates over time that better reflect real change and stability by reducing pixel-level annual noise. Using CRF, we produced a twenty-year dataset of land cover over the region, depicting key change processes such as cropland expansion and tree cover loss at the Landsat scale. The augmentation and CRF approach introduced here provides a more temporally consistent land cover product over traditional mapping methods.

AB  - In order to promote the economic development of China's provinces and provide references for the provinces to make effective economic decisions, it is urgent to investigate the trend of province-level economic development. In this study, DMSP/OLS data and NPP/VIIRS data were used to predict economic development. Based on the GDP data of China's provinces from 1992 to 2016 and the nighttime light remote sensing (NTL) data of corresponding years, we forecast GDP via the linear model (LR model), ARIMA model, ARIMAX model, and SARIMA model. Models were verified against the GDP records from 2017 to 2019. The experimental results showed that the involvement of NTL as exogenous variables led to improved GDP prediction.

TI  - A River Channel Extraction Method Based on a Digital Elevation Model Retrieved from Satellite Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The river border positioning is an important part of river surveys, which is crucial for water conservation project development, water resource use, water disasters, river regime monitoring, and many other applications related to water resources. Currently, satellite images or field measurements are used to extract river channels. However, satellite images are insufficiently precise, and field measurement requires significant manpower and cost. In this paper, a new method for river channel extraction is proposed, which is based on the combination of Jenks natural breaks classification method and digital elevation model (DEM), and then the river channel range is complemented by using the water range monitored by GF-1(Gaofen-1 satellite) in flood season. The overall precision is greater than 85%, and the Kappa values achieve moderate stability (0.41-0.60). Using this method, the extraction of river range is practicable and achievable, and the higher the DEM resolution, the better the extraction result.

T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes in the Kashmir Himalayas must be mapped and monitored for long-term development and efficient planning. This work uses geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information system to track changes in land cover trends in four main watersheds in the Kashmir Valley's north-eastern Himalayas from 2003 to 2013. Land cover maps were created using images from the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper. The watershed's land use/land cover (LULC) maps were created using supervised classification utilizing the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Over the previous decade, the LULC in the study watersheds has undergone a series of intricate changes as a result of deforestation, climate change, and agroforestry growth. A total of 11 major LULC classifications were discovered, indicating that forests are the most common land use in all four watersheds. Forest cover, river beds, water bodies, non-perennial snow, and glaciers have all decreased significantly, whereas scrubland, horticulture, rock mass, built-up areas, barren land, and agriculture have all increased significantly, except for Sindh watershed, where the scrubland class has decreased by 5.97% from 2003 to 2013. The study's methodology and conclusions point to crucial policy implications for long-term LULC management in the Kashmir Himalayas' Madhumati, Ann, Sindh, and Lidder watersheds.

TI  - Identification of Landslides in Mountainous Area with the Combination of SBAS-InSAR and Yolo Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides have been frequently occurring in the high mountainous areas in China and poses serious threats to peoples' lives and property, economic development, and national security. Detecting and monitoring quiescent or active landslides is important for predicting risks and mitigating losses. However, traditional ground survey methods, such as field investigation, GNSS, and total stations, are only suitable for field investigation at a specific site rather than identifying landslides over a large area, as they are expensive, time-consuming, and laborious. In this study, the feasibility of using SBAS-InSAR to detect landslides in the high mountainous areas along the Yunnan Myanmar border was tested first, with fifty-four IW mode Sentinel-1A ascending scenes from 12 January 2019 to 8 December 2020. Next, the Yolo deep-learning model with Gaofen-2 images captured on 5 December 2020 was tested. Finally, the two techniques were combined to achieve better performance, given each of them has intrinsic limitations on landslide detection. The experiment indicated that the combination could improve the match rate between detection results and references, which implied that the performance of landslide detection can be improved with the fusion of time series SAR images and optical images.

TI  - Monitoring of Vegetation Disturbance and Restoration at the Dumping Sites of the Baorixile Open-Pit Mine Based on the LandTrendr Algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Overstocked dumping sites associated with open-pit coal mining occupy original vegetation areas and cause damage to the environment. The monitoring of vegetation disturbance and restoration at dumping sites is important for the accurate planning of ecological restoration in mining areas. This paper aimed to monitor and assess vegetation disturbance and restoration in the dumping sites of the Baorixile open-pit mine using the LandTrendr algorithm and remote sensing images. Firstly, based on the temporal datasets of Landsat from 1990 to 2021, the boundaries of the dumping sites in the Baorixile open-pit mine in Hulunbuir city were extracted. Secondly, the LandTrendr algorithm was used to identify the initial time and duration of vegetation disturbance and restoration, while the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as the input parameter for the LandTrendr algorithm. Thirdly, the vegetation restoration effect at the dumping sites was monitored and analyzed from both temporal and spatial perspectives. The results showed that the dumping sites of the Baorixile open-pit mine were disturbed sharply by the mining activities. The North dumping site, the South dumping site, and the East dumping site (hereinafter referred to as the North site, the South site, and the East site) were established in 1999, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The restored areas were mainly concentrated in the South site, the East site, and the northwest of the North site. The average restoration intensity in the North site, South site, and East site was 0.515, 0.489, and 0.451, respectively, and the average disturbance intensity was 0.371, 0.398, and 0.320, respectively. The average restoration intensity in the three dumping sites was greater than the average disturbance intensity. This study demonstrates that the combination of temporal remote sensing images and the LandTrendr algorithm can follow the vegetation restoration process of an open-pit mine clearly and can be used to monitor the progress and quality of ecological restoration projects such as vegetation restoration in mining areas. It provides important data and support for accurate ecological restoration in mining areas.

TI  - CD_HIEFNet: Cloud Detection Network Using Haze Optimized Transformation Index and Edge Feature for Optical Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds in optical remote sensing images are an unavoidable existence that greatly affect the utilization of these images. Therefore, accurate and effective cloud detection is an indispensable step in image preprocessing. To date, most researchers have tried to use deep-learning methods for cloud detection. However, these studies generally use computer vision technology to improve the performances of the models, without considering the unique spectral feature information in remote sensing images. Moreover, due to the complex and changeable shapes of clouds, accurate cloud-edge detection is also a difficult problem. In order to solve these problems, we propose a deep-learning cloud detection network that uses the haze-optimized transformation (HOT) index and the edge feature extraction module for optical remote sensing images (CD_HIEFNet). In our model, the HOT index feature image is used to add the unique spectral feature information from clouds into the network for accurate detection, and the edge feature extraction (EFE) module is employed to refine cloud edges. In addition, we use ConvNeXt as the backbone network, and we improved the decoder to enhance the details of the detection results. We validated CD_HIEFNet using the Landsat-8 (L8) Biome dataset and compared it with the Fmask, FCN8s, U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabv3+ and CloudNet methods. The experimental results showed that our model has excellent performance, even in complex cloud scenarios. Moreover, according to the extended experimental results for the other L8 dataset and the Gaofen-1 data, CD_HIEFNet has strong performance in terms of robustness and generalization, thus helping to provide new ideas for cloud detection-related work.

TI  - Dissipation of a <i>Polykrikos geminatum</i> Bloom after Wind Events in Pearl River Estuary
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Dinoflagellates is one dominant group in coastal marine phytoplankton communities and, on occasion, form blooms in estuaries and coastal ecosystems. While relationships between dinoflagellate bloom dynamics and nutrients are well-studied, information regarding bloom dissipation in estuaries is limited. We studied the dissipation of dinoflagellate Polykrikos geminatum blooms in the Pearl River Estuary, South China Sea, during August of 2011 using ecological, molecular, and satellite remote sensing data. We found that the dinoflagellate bloom was associated with water temperatures of 29.2-31 degrees C, salinities ranging 16.4-20, and ambient water nutrient concentrations that were not limited. The abundance of the ciliate Euplotes rariseta, which feeds on P. geminatum cell debris and bacteria, functions as an indicator species of P. geminatum bloom dissipation. In situ and satellite data indicate that bloom water masses were transferred from the central to inner estuary near Shenzhen Bay, driven by continuous, strong southerly winds; at which point in time, P. geminatum blooms dissipated to a high-salinity area near the estuary mouth driven by northerly winds and freshwater discharge, whereupon the blooms rapidly vanished. A low tolerance to low or high salinities resulted in P. geminatum bloom demise in the Pearl River Estuary. We propose that interactions among salinity, wind, and freshwater incursion result in P. geminatum bloom dissipation in the Pearl River Estuary.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change on Ecosystem Productivity of the Belarusian Polesia According to Remote Data
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of an analysis of changes in the productivity of forest, swamp, and arable ecosystems in the eastern part of the Belarusian Polesia in 2000-2020 are presented based on satellite imagery (the MODIS radiometer of the Terra satellite). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to evaluate productivity. The correlation between changes in climate indicators and the NDVI has been studied. It is established that the ecosystems differ in their response to climate change. Statistically significant positive NDVI trends are found for forest and wetland ecosystems. No reliable correlation between this indicator and the average summer temperature and the amount of summer precipitation has been established. Arable ecosystems are characterized by the absence of a statistically significant trend in productivity and a significant negative correlation of the NDVI with temperature and a positive one with precipitation. The influence of climatic characteristics on the NDVI of arable ecosystems depends on their soil type.

TI  - A Review of Earth Observation-Based Drought Studies in Southeast Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Drought is a recurring natural climatic hazard event over terrestrial land; it poses devastating threats to human health, the economy, and the environment. Given the increasing climate crisis, it is likely that extreme drought phenomena will become more frequent, and their impacts will probably be more devastating. Drought observations from space, therefore, play a key role in dissimilating timely and accurate information to support early warning drought management and mitigation planning, particularly in sparse in-situ data regions. In this paper, we reviewed drought-related studies based on Earth observation (EO) products in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2021. The results of this review indicated that drought publications in the region are on the increase, with a majority (70%) of the studies being undertaken in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. These countries also accounted for nearly 97% of the economic losses due to drought extremes. Vegetation indices from multispectral optical remote sensing sensors remained a primary source of data for drought monitoring in the region. Many studies (~21%) did not provide accuracy assessment on drought mapping products, while precipitation was the main data source for validation. We observed a positive association between spatial extent and spatial resolution, suggesting that nearly 81% of the articles focused on the local and national scales. Although there was an increase in drought research interest in the region, challenges remain regarding large-area and long time-series drought measurements, the combined drought approach, machine learning-based drought prediction, and the integration of multi-sensor remote sensing products (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2). Satellite EO data could be a substantial part of the future efforts that are necessary for mitigating drought-related challenges, ensuring food security, establishing a more sustainable economy, and the preservation of the natural environment in the region.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Poplar Index for Operational Mapping of Poplar Plantations over Large Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poplar (Populus spp.) is a fast-growing tree planted to meet the growing global demand for wood products. In France, the country with the largest area planted with poplar in Europe, accurate and up-to-date maps of its spatial distribution are not available at the national scale. This makes it difficult to estimate the extent and location of the poplar resource and calls for the development of a robust and timely stable approach for mapping large areas in order to ensure efficient monitoring. In this study, we investigate the potential of the Sentinel-2 time series to map the diversity of poplar plantations at the French countrywide scale. By comparing multiple configurations of spectral features based on spectral bands and indices over two years (2017 and 2018), we identify the optimal spectral regions with their respective time periods to distinguish poplar plantations from other deciduous species. We also define a novel poplar detection index (PI) with four variants that combine the best discriminative spectral bands. The results highlight the relevance of SWIR followed by red edge regions, mainly in the growing season, to accurately detect poplar plantations, reflecting the sensitivity of poplar trees to water content throughout their phenological cycle. The best performances with stable results were obtained with the PI2 poplar index combining the B5, B11, and B12 spectral bands. The PI2 index was validated over two years with an average producer's accuracy of 92% in 2017 and 95% in 2018. This new index was used to produce the national map of poplar plantations in 2018. This study provides an operational approach for monitoring the poplar resource over large areas for forest managers.

TI  - Contrast Agents for Photoacoustic Imaging: A Review Focusing on the Wavelength Range
T2  - BIOSENSORS-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging using endogenous chromophores as a contrast has been widely applied in biomedical studies owing to its functional imaging capability at the molecular level. Various exogenous contrast agents have also been investigated for use in contrast-enhanced imaging and functional analyses. This review focuses on contrast agents, particularly in the wavelength range, for use in photoacoustic imaging. The basic principles of photoacoustic imaging regarding light absorption and acoustic release are introduced, and the optical characteristics of tissues are summarized according to the wavelength region. Various types of contrast agents, including organic dyes, semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and other inorganic nanoparticles, are explored in terms of their light absorption range in the near-infrared region. An overview of the contrast-enhancing capacity and other functional characteristics of each agent is provided to help researchers gain insights into the development of contrast agents in photoacoustic imaging.

TI  - Response of Temperature to Successive Typhoons in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons are serious natural disasters in coastal areas. During the summer of 2011, successive typhoons Nesat and Nalgae appeared in the South China Sea, providing a unique opportunity for us to study the response of the upper ocean to successive typhoons. We comprehensively use satellite data and COAWST model data to explore the effects of successive typhoons on the temperature structure of the South China Sea. Nesat caused the sea surface temperature to decrease by up to 4.4 degrees C on the right side of the typhoon path, and the ensuing Nalgae caused the temperature to decrease by up to 2.2 degrees C. Because Nesat had already cooled the ocean, the response to Nalgae was more to the left of the track than one would normally expect. The upwelling dominates the change in subsurface temperature. Based on the increase caused by Nesat, the isotherm was further raised by Nalgae. The isotherm rising amplitude is larger in the upper and deeper layer and is smaller in the middle layer in the depth range of 0-200 m. Heat budget analysis indicates that in the area close to the typhoon path, vertical diffusion is the main reason for the decrease in ocean surface temperature, while total advection suppresses the decrease in temperature. In the area with a larger distance from the typhoon path, vertical diffusion and total advection lead to the decrease in ocean surface temperature, and total advection will gradually contribute more to temperature change and become the dominant factor. On the right side of the typhoon track, the reduction of the contribution rate of vertical diffusion with distance from typhoon track is slower than that on the left side of the typhoon track. Whether Nesat or Nalgae, the intensity and depth of effects of vertical diffusion on the right side of typhoon path are greater than those on the left side of typhoon path, and the near-inertial periodic oscillation of local temperature change rate is more obvious. When the vertical diffusion is weak, the influence of vertical advection and horizontal advection is deeper. Moreover, the near-inertial periodic oscillation of the local temperature change occurs in lower depth after Nalgae passed through than that after Nesat. The typhoon intensity of the two typhoons shows the opposite change: the first typhoon increases, and the second typhoon weakens. Therefore, the special case of successive typhoons should be fully considered in typhoon prediction to improve accuracy.

TI  - A cascading reaction by hydrological spatial dynamics alternation may be neglected
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water regime changes play a critical role in the structure and function of watershed ecosystems. However, most previous studies focused only on static fixed-point quantitative change at a given time, ignoring the hydrological spatial distribution states of wetting and drying and lacking dynamic indicators for characterization. Here, we constructed a new dynamic index to characterize water alternation of wetting and drying of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, using all available Landsat images and Google Earth Engine from 1987 to 2020. In addition, we analyzed the relative contribution of the dam to water regime changes according to geographical characteristics, and a neglected cascading reaction was found between the upstream and downstream of the basin. The results showed that the alternation of Poyang Lake significantly intensified, and varied with different years. Although the apparent regulation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has no significant impact on the maximum storage of the downstream Poyang Lake and the runoff of the further Yangtze Estuary, the TGD has changed the water spatial alternation of Poyang Lake, resulting in a cascading reaction to the runoff of the Yangtze Estuary.

TI  - Mask R-CNN based automated identification and extraction of oil well sites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale land disturbances due to mining development modify the land surface cover and have cumulative detrimental impacts on the environment. Understanding the distribution of fine-scale land disturbances related to mining activities, such as oil well sites, in mining regions is of vital importance to sustainable mining development. For efficient mapping, automated identification and extraction of the oil well sites using highresolution satellite images are required. In this work, we proposed the Oil Well Site extraction (OWS) Mask RCNN based on the original Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks), to accurately extract well sites using multi-sensor remote sensing images. For improvement of mapping efficiency, two modifications were made to Mask R-CNN: (1) replacing the backbone of Mask R-CNN with D-LinkNet, and (2) adding a semantic segmentation branch to Mask R-CNN to force the whole network to focus on the relationship between line objects and oil well sites. As imagery data were from multiple sensors (RapidEye 2/3 and WorldView 3), a pretrained Residual Channel Attention Network (RCAN) was applied to super-resolve the images with different resolutions. Several key spatial features, such as nearby roads and area size, have also been used in the oil well site mapping process. The experimental results indicate that our OWS Mask R-CNN considerably improves the average precision (AP) and the F1 score of Mask R-CNN from 51.26% and 25.7% to 60.93% and 61.59%, respectively.

TI  - Modelling the Influence of Geological Structures in Paleo Rock Avalanche Failures Using Field and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the back analysis of an ancient, catastrophic rock avalanche located in the small city of Lettopalena (Chieti, Italy). The integrated use of various investigation methods was employed for landslide analysis, including the use of traditional manual surveys and remote sensing (RS) mapping for the identification of geological structures. The outputs of the manual and RS surveys were then utilised to numerically model the landslide using a 2D distinct element method. A series of numerical simulations were undertaken to perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the uncertainty of discontinuity properties on the slope stability analysis and provide further insight into the landslide failure mechanism. Both numerical modelling and field investigations indicate that the landslide was controlled by translational sliding along a folded bedding plane, with toe removal because of river erosion. This generated daylighting of the bedding plane, creating kinematic freedom for the landslide. The formation of lateral and rear release surfaces was influenced by the orientation of the discrete fracture network. Due to the presence of an anticline, the landslide region was constrained in the middle-lower section of the slope, where the higher inclination of the bedding plane was detected. The landslide is characterized by a step-path slip surface at the toe of the slope, which was observed both in the modelling and the field. This paper highlights the combined use of a geological model and numerical modelling to provide an improved understanding of the origin and development of rock avalanches under the influence of river erosion, anticline structures, and related faults and fractures.

TI  - Monitoring Cropland Abandonment in Hilly Areas with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Timeseries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Abandoned cropland may lead to a series of issues regarding the environment, ecology, and food security. In hilly areas, cropland is prone to be abandoned due to scattered planting, relatively fewer sunlight hours, and a lower agricultural input-output ratio. Furthermore, the impact of abandoned rainfed cropland differs from abandoned irrigated cropland; thus, the corresponding land strategies vary accordingly. Unfortunately, monitoring abandoned cropland is still an enormous challenge in hilly areas. In this study, a new approach was proposed by (1) improving the availability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images by a series of processes, (2) obtaining training samples from multisource data overlay analysis and timeseries viewer tool, (3) mapping annual land cover from all available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, training samples, and the random forest classifier, and (4) mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of abandoned rainfed cropland and irrigated cropland in hilly areas by assessing land-cover trajectories along with time. The result showed that rainfed cropland had lower F1 scores (0.759 to 0.8) compared to that irrigated cropland (0.836 to 0.879). High overall accuracies of around 0.90 were achieved, with the kappa values ranging from 0.851 to 0.862, which outperformed the existing products in accuracy and spatial detail. Our study provides a reference for extracting the spatiotemporal distribution of abandoned rainfed cropland and irrigated cropland in hilly areas.

TI  - Spring snow cover duration and tundra greenness in the Lena Delta, Siberia: two decades of MODIS satellite time series (2001-2021)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lena Delta in Siberia is the largest delta in the Arctic and as a snow-dominated ecosystem particularly vulnerable to climate change. Using the two decades of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite acquisitions, this study investigates interannual and spatial variability of snow-cover duration and summer vegetation vitality in the Lena Delta. We approximated snow by the application of the normalized difference snow index and vegetation greenness by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We consolidated the analyses by integrating reanalysis products on air temperature from 2001 to 2021, and air temperature, ground temperature, and the date of snow-melt from time-lapse camera (TLC) observations from the Samoylov observatory located in the central delta. We extracted spring snow-cover duration determined by a latitudinal gradient. The 'regular year' snow-melt is transgressing from mid-May to late May within a time window of 10 days across the delta. We calculated yearly deviations per grid cell for two defined regions, one for the delta, and one focusing on the central delta. We identified an ensemble of early snow-melt years from 2012 to 2014, with snow-melt already starting in early May, and two late snow-melt years in 2004 and 2017, with snow-melt starting in June. In the times of TLC recording, the years of early and late snow-melt were confirmed. In the three summers after early snow-melt, summer vegetation greenness showed neither positive nor negative deviations. Whereas, vegetation greenness was reduced in 2004 after late snow-melt together with the lowest June monthly air temperature of the time series record. Since 2005, vegetation greenness is rising, with maxima in 2018 and 2021. The NDVI rise since 2018 is preceded by up to 4 degrees C warmer than average June air temperature. The ongoing operation of satellite missions allows to monitor a wide range of land surface properties and processes that will provide urgently needed data in times when logistical challenges lead to data gaps in land-based observations in the rapidly changing Arctic.

TI  - Comparing Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients with Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis with and without Completion Axillary Lymph Node Dissection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Meta-Analysis
M3  - Systematic Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the standard method for staging and treatment of axillary lymph nodes for early-stage breast cancer is sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), while axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is used in cases with palpable axillary lymph nodes or positive SLNB cases. The aim of this review was to compare overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and axillary recurrence in early-stage breast cancer patients underwent SLNB or SLNB and completion ALND.METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched using the key words of "breast cancer", "axillary lymph node dissection", and "sentinel lymph node dissection". In addition, other sources were searched for ongoing studies (i.e., clinicaltrials.gov). The clinical trials were evaluated based on the Jadad quality criteria, and cohort studies were evaluated according to the STROBE criteria. At the end of the search, the articles were screened independently by two reviewers to check their eligibility to be included in the study. Afterwards, the data were extracted independently by two researchers.RESULTS: After searching the databases, 169 papers were retrieved. However, after removing the duplicates and studying the titles and abstracts of these papers, only ten ones underwent further investigation. After reading full-text of each article, four studies were finalized. Following a manual search, 27 papers were entered into the study for the final evaluation, 11 of which were included in the meta-analysis based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The findings showed no significant differences in OS, DFS, and axillary recurrence in early-stage breast cancer patients underwent SLNB or SLNB and completion ALND.CONCLUSION: The findings did not confirm that ALND improved OS, DFS, and axillary recurrence in patients who were clinically node-negative and positive SLNB.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Enables Nationwide Monitoring of Single Area Payment Scheme and Greening Agricultural Subsidies in Hungary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The verification and monitoring of agricultural subsidy claims requires combined evaluation of several criteria at the scale of over a million cultivation units. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is a promising data source and paying agencies are encouraged to test their pre-operational use. Here, we present the outcome of the Hungarian agricultural subsidy monitoring pilot: our goal was to propose a solution based on open-source components and evaluate the main strengths and weaknesses for Sentinel-2 in the framework of a complex set of tasks. These include the checking of the basic cultivation of grasslands and arable land and compliance to the criteria of ecological focus areas. The processing of the satellite data was conducted based on random forest for crop classification and the detection of cultivation events was conducted based on NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) time series analysis results. The outputs of these processes were combined in a decision tree ruleset to provide the final results. We found that crop classification provided good performance (overall accuracy 88%) for 22 vegetation classes and cultivation detection was also reliable when compared to on-screen visual interpretation. The main limitation was the size of fields, which were frequently small compared to the spatial resolution of the images: more than 4% of the parcels had to be excluded, although these represent less than 3% of the cultivated area of Hungary. Based on these results, we find that operational satellite-based monitoring is feasible for Hungary, and expect further improvements from integration with Sentinel-1 due to additional temporal resolution.

TI  - D-dimer as a Predictive Factor of Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Operable Breast Cancer Patients in the Teaching Hospital of Universitas Sumatera Utara.
T2  - Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in breast cancer (BC) is considered to be a significant factor in determining the diseases' extent at the moment. The spreading capacity of cancerous cells may linearly correlate with its activity level, which in turn alter the coagulation function as commonly represented by fibrin degradation biomarker i.e., D-dimer. Although ALN metastatic status is eventually should be perceptible in physical examinations or other diagnostic modalities, an additional marker to estimate the lymph node extent should be considered in the pre-operative sessions.Objective: To provide the correlation between elevated D-dimer level and ALN metastatic status positivity among BC patients.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Teaching Hospital of Universitas Sumatera Utara by retrieving outpatients' medical records from June 2018 to January 2019, encompassing 111 female patients. The ALN involvement status was recorded along with plasma D-dimer level in which the value of 500 ng/mL was considered to be elevated.Results: From the 102 eligible participants, 47.1% and 70.6% were confirmed with elevated D-dimer level and ALN involved respectively. Further analysis of those variables demonstrated a considerable diagnostic performance for sensitivity (64.4%), specificity (79.1%), PPV (80.9%), NPV (61.8%), accuracy (70.6%) and statistically significant results (P = .001).Conclusion: Elevated D-dimer level may be influenced by cancerous spread capacity in the lymphatic system, as it also eventually correlated with coagulation system dysregulation. Therefore, it is suggested that the role of D-dimer measurement is recommended to be explored further in BC diagnostic workup.

TI  - Impact of Training Set Configurations for Differentiating Plantation Forest Genera with Sentinel-2 Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantations in South Africa impose genus-specific demands on limited soil moisture. Hence, plantation composition and distribution mapping is critical for water conservation planning. Genus maps are used to quantify the impact of post-harvest genus-exchange activities in the forestry sector. Collecting genus data using in situ methods is costly and time-consuming, especially when performed at regional or national scales. Although remotely sensed data and machine learning show potential for mapping genera at regional scales, the efficacy of such methods is highly dependent on the size and quality of the training data used to build the models. However, it is not known what sampling scheme (e.g., sample size, proportion per genus, and spatial distribution) is most effective to map forest genera over large and complex areas. Using Sentinel-2 imagery as inputs, this study evaluated the effects of different sampling strategies (e.g., even, uneven, and area-proportionate) for training the random forests machine learning classifier to differentiate between Acacia, Eucalyptus, and Pinus trees in South Africa. Sample size (s) was related to the number of input features (n) to better understand the potential impact of sample sparseness. The results show that an even sample with maximum size (100%, s similar to 91n) produced the highest overall accuracy (76.3%). Although larger training set sizes (s > n) resulted in higher OAs, a saturation point was reached at s similar to 64n.

TI  - Detection of Oil Spills in the Northern South China Sea Using Landsat-8 OLI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Petroleum extraction, transportation, and consumption in the marine environment contribute to a large portion of anthropogenic oil spills into the ocean. While previous research focuses more on large oil spill accidents from oil tankers or offshore oil platforms, there are few systematic records on occasional regional oil spills. In this study, optical imagery from Landsat-8 OLI was used to detect oil slicks on the ocean surface through spatial analysis and spectral diagnosis in the northern South China Sea (NSCS). The source of the slicks was identified through datasets from traffic density and platform locations. A total of 632 oil slicks were detected in the NSCS from 2015 to 2019, where 57 were from platforms sources, and 490 were from ships. The average area of the detected slicks was 4.8 km(2), and half of the slicks had areas <1.7 km(2). Major oil spill hot spots included coastal Guangdong (ship origins), southeast and northeast Dongsha Island (ship origins), middle of south Beibu Gulf (ship and platform origins), and southeast Pearl River Estuary (platform origins). Through this study, we demonstrate the capability of medium-resolution optical imagery in monitoring regional oil spills. Such results and methods may help in near real-time oil spill monitoring and further environmental assessments.

TI  - Monitoring Changes in Land Use Land Cover and Ecosystem Service Values of Dynamic Saltwater and Freshwater Systems in Coastal Bangladesh by Geospatial Techniques
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing and modeling the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) patterns and associated ecosystem service values (ESV) has become an important global agenda for formulating sustainable land management policies. Taking the coastal region of Bangladesh (CRB) as a case study, we utilized remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze Landsat data of 1999 and 2019 to estimate the effect of LULC changes on the ESVs. The LULC classification, ESV quantification, and spatial variations were performed by semi-automated classification, per-unit value transfer, and spatial autocorrelation techniques, respectively. First, between 1999 and 2019, LULC altered dramatically (agricultural land and coastal wetlands decreased, while all other LULC types increased). Second, the total ESV decreased by 1.87%, which was mostly attributed to a 70% growth in both rural settlement and aquaculture/saltpan, and a 30% decline in both agricultural land and wetlands. Third, significant spatial correlation and moderately high spatial clustering were observed, which consisted mostly of mangrove forests, waterbodies, and wetland zones. Both high-high and low-low values increased, but spatial outliers remained unchanged. Conserving agricultural land should be prioritized in future land use plans of CRB to meet the ever-increasing food demands, control natural land conversion, and make land use sustainable.

TI  - Tuning Excitation Field Frequency for Magnetic Particle Sensing using Superparamagnetic Quantifier
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonlinear handheld detection of magnetic nanoparticles is used to assess the lymph node status of cancer patients. Joint sensitivity and resolving power of nonlinear handheld detection can be maximized by optimizing the frequency of the excitation field, which is strongly influenced by Brownian and Neel relaxation. The characteristic frequency of magnetic nanoparticles that defines sensitivity and resolving power is usually assessed by AC susceptometry. In this study, we used SPaQ data to predict handheld detection performance for magnetic nanoparticles with various particle sizes. SPaQ assesses dynamics by measuring the derivative of the magnetization originating from magnetic nanoparticles activated by an alternating excitation field. The ratio between the maximum signal difference and full-width-at-half-maximum is used to estimate the optimal excitation frequency. Thereupon, it was shown that a particle with a combination of Brownian and Neel relaxation is superior in nonlinear handheld detection compared to Brownian or Neel only particles. Moreover, the optimal excitation frequency is generally established at a slightly higher frequency compared to the characteristic IP 8.46.247 10 On: Wed 04 Jan 2023 06 10 54 frequency assessed by AC susceptometry. Consequently, this insight into the consequences of the dynamic behavior of Copyright: American Scientific Publ shers magnetic nanoparticles under an alternating magnetic field enables the optimization of nonlinear handheld detection for Delivered by Ingenta specific clinical applications.

TI  - Regional Yield Estimation for Sugarcane Using MODIS and Weather Data: A Case Study in Florida and Louisiana, United States of America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is an important sugar source in America and is mainly planted in the states of Florida and Louisiana. The purpose of this study was to predict the sugarcane yield in these two states from 2008 to 2016. Three statistical sugarcane yield models (i.e., the CNDVI, K-M, and SiPAR models) were applied to predict yield in America, using remote sensing and weather data. To verify the robustness of models, model parameters obtained in places (i.e., Reunion Island and Southwestern China) far away from America were used. The results showed that the SiPAR model outperformed the CDNVI and K-M models for yield prediction. Solar radiation was an important constraint factor to ensure the statistical model's robustness under different conditions. The CNDVI model had the lowest robustness because of the absence of solar radiation, although it could reflect the yield trend to some extent. The K-M model failed to predict the low sugarcane yield, owing to the lack of consideration of temperature and soil water stresses. Florida had a low sugarcane yield in the west and southwest; however, Louisiana had high sugarcane yield in the same directions. This study demonstrated the robustness of the SiPAR model and investigated the sugarcane yield status in Florida and Louisiana. It can be a reference for similar studies in the future.

TI  - Improvement and Assessment of Ocean Color Algorithms in the Northwest Pacific Fishing Ground Using Himawari-8, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS-SNPP
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an important marine indicator, and the improvement in Chl-a concentration retrieval for ocean color remote sensing is always a major challenge. This study focuses on the northwest Pacific fishing ground (NPFG) to evaluate and improve the Chl-a products of three mainstream remote sensing satellites, Himawari-8, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS-SNPP. We analyzed in situ data and found that an in situ Chl-a concentration of 0.3 mg m(-3) could be used as a threshold to distinguish the systematic deviation of remote sensing Chl-a data in the NPFG. Based on this threshold, we optimized the Chl-a algorithms of the three satellites by data grouping, and integrated multisource satellite Chl-a data by weighted averaging to acquire high-coverage merged data. The merged data were thoroughly verified by Argo Chl-a data. The Chl-a front of merged Chl-a data could be represented accurately and completely and had a good correlation with the distribution of the NPFG. The most important marine factors for Chl-a are nutrients and temperature, which are affected by mesoscale eddies and variations in the Kuroshio extension. The variation trend of merged Chl-a data is consistent with mesoscale eddies and Kuroshio extension and has more sensitive responses to the marine climatic conditions of ENSO.

TI  - Prediction Algorithm for Satellite Instantaneous Attitude and Image Pixel Offset Based on Synchronous Clocks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio and high image volume, a geostationary orbiting ocean remote-sensing system needs to maintain high platform stability over a long integration time because it is affected by satellite attitude changes. When the observation target is the ocean, it is difficult to extract image features because of the lack of characteristic objects in the target area. In this paper, we attempt to avoid using image data for satellite attitude and image pixel offset estimation. We obtain the satellite attitude by using equipment such as gyroscopes and performing time registration between the satellite attitude and the image data to achieve pixel offset matching between images. According to the law of satellite attitude change, we designed a Kalman-like filter fitting (KLFF) algorithm based on the satellite attitude change model and the Nelder-Mead search principle. The discrete attitude data were time-marked by a synchronization system, and high-precision estimation of the satellite attitude was achieved after fitting with the KLFF algorithm. When the measurement accuracy of the equipment was 1.0 x 10(-3)degrees, the average prediction error of the algorithm was 1.09 x 10(-3)degrees, 21.58% better than the traditional interpolation prediction result of 1.39 x 10(-3)degrees. The peak value of the fitting angle error reached 2.5 x 10(-3)degrees. Compared with the interpolation prediction result of 6.2 x 10(-3)degrees, the estimated stability of the satellite attitude improved by about 59.68%. After using the linear interpolation method to compensate for the estimated pixel offset, its discrete range was 0.697 pixels. Compared with the 1.476 pixels of the interpolation algorithm, it was 52.8% lower, which improved the noise immunity of the algorithm. Finally, a KLFF algorithm was designed based on the satellite attitude change model by using external measurement data and the synchronous clock as a benchmark. The instantaneous attitude of the satellite was accurately estimated in real time, and the offset matching between the images was realized, which lays the foundation for in-orbit satellite data processing.

TI  - Backscatter Characteristics Analysis for Flood Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection between images of pre-flood and flooding periods is a critical process for flood mapping using satellite images. Flood mapping from SAR images is based on backscattering coefficient differences. The change rules of the backscattering coefficient with different flooding depths of ground objects are essential prior knowledge for flood mapping, while their absence greatly limits the precision. Therefore, minimizing the backscattering coefficient differences caused by non-flood factors is of great significance for improving the accuracy of flood mapping. In this paper, non-flood factor influences, i.e., monthly variations of ground objects and polarization and satellite orbits, on the backscattering coefficient are studied with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images for five ground objects in Kouzi Village, Shouguang City, Shandong Province, China. Sentinel-1 images in different rainfalls are used to study the variation of the backscattering coefficient with flooding depths. Since it is difficult to measure the flooding depth of historical rainfall events, a hydrological analysis based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) is used to estimate the flooding depth. The results showed that the monthly variations of the maximum backscattering coefficients of farmland and construction and the backscattering coefficient differences caused by the satellite orbit were larger than the minimum backscattering coefficient differences caused by inundation. The flood extraction rules of five objects based on Sentinel-1 were obtained and analyzed, which improved flood extraction knowledge from qualitative to semi-quantitative analysis.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Value Estimation of Paddy Field Ecosystems Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A paddy field ecosystem (PFE) is an important component of an agricultural land ecosystem and is also a special artificial wetland with extremely high value. Taking Tianjin (a municipality city in China) as the research area and using multi-source remote sensing data, we improved the accounting framework of the ecosystem service value (ESV) of PFEs and the calibration of model parameters. The ESV of PFEs was mapped at medium-high resolution and fine-grain at the provincial scale. The results showed that: (1) the net ESV of PFEs in Tianjin in 2019 was RMB 29.68 x 10(8), accounting for 0.21% of GDP. The positive ESV was RMB 35.53 x 10(8), the negative ESV was RMB 5.84 x 10(8), and the average ESV per unit area was RMB 5.47 x 10(4)/ha; (2) as a proportion of the ESV of PFE, the value of climate regulation (61.27%) was greater than the value of carbon fixation and oxygen release (15.29%), which was greater than the value of primary products supply (8.08%). The production value of PFEs is far lower than their ESV; (3) the total net ESV in Baodi District was RMB 16.85 x 10(8), accounting for 56.77% of Tianjin's ESV, and the net ESV per unit area was RMB 5.72 x 10(4)/ha, both of which were higher than in other districts; (4) the pixel-based hot spots analysis showed that the number of hot spots (high-value ESV) and cold spots (low-value ESV) reached 98.00% (hot spots 56.9%, cold spots 41.1%) with a significant cluster distribution. The hot spots were mostly distributed in Baodi District (37.8%) and the cold spots were mostly distributed in Ninghe District (17.2%). The research results can support agricultural development, improve countermeasures according to local conditions, and provide theoretical support for regional land use planning, ecological compensation policy formulation and ecological sustainable development. Our methodology can be used to assess the impact of land use change on ESV.

TI  - An Approach for Retrieving Consistent Time Series "Urban Core-Suburban-Rural" (USR) Structure Using Nighttime Light Data from DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long time series and consistent "urban core-suburban-rural" (USR) structure in a city region is essential to understanding urban-suburban-rural interaction and urbanization pathways. It is always considered to be a single land use type (e.g., impervious area) in remote sensing research. The long-term (1992-present) nighttime light (NTL) data of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) provide the potential for retrieving time series of USR structure. In this study, we propose an improved approach to mapping the USR structure of the three subcategories based on a heuristic algorithm of Mann-Kendall mutation detection on the NTL quantile curve. First, a minor adjustment of VIIRS NTL is applied for matching the value ranges of DMSP NTL data and keeping the advantage of VIIRS to generate a long-term NTL dataset. Second, the heuristic algorithm of Mann-Kendall mutation detection is processed to find two optimal thresholds in the NTL quantile curve, which is used for USR extraction. Finally, a temporal consistency check is used to post-process the initial USR area for obtaining a more consistent and reliable USR sequence. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we retrieved the USR structures of 19 typical cities in China from 1992 to 2020 based on NTL datasets. The evaluations of spatiotemporal consistency compared with the validation data indicate that the USR retrieval results show good agreement with the land use map derived from Landsat images and the time series product from MODIS. The average overall accuracy (OA) of overall urban extent is higher than 0.95 and the average kappa coefficient (KC) reaches 0.6. Moreover, we investigated the urban dynamics and USR interactions of 19 cities from 1992 to 2020. Overall, this study proposes an improved approach for long-term USR mapping from NTL images at a regional scale and it will provide a valuable method for urbanization dynamics analysis.

TI  - Aerial Imagery-Based Building Footprint Detection with an Integrated Deep Learning Framework: Applications for Fine Scale Wildland-Urban Interface Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human encroachment into wildlands has resulted in a rapid increase in wildland-urban interface (WUI) expansion, exposing more buildings and population to wildfire risks. More frequent mapping of structures and WUIs at a finer spatial resolution is needed for WUI characterization and hazard assessment. However, most approaches rely on high-resolution commercial satellite data with a particular focus on urban areas. We developed a deep learning framework tailored for building footprint detection in the transitional wildland-urban areas. We leveraged meter scale aerial imageries publicly available from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) every 2 years. Our approach integrated Mobile-UNet and generative adversarial network. The deep learning models trained over three counties in California performed well in detecting building footprints across diverse landscapes, with an F1 score of 0.62, 0.67, and 0.75 in the interface WUI, intermix WUI, and rural regions, respectively. The bi-annual mapping captured both housing expansion and wildfire-caused building damages. The 30 m WUI maps generated from these finer footprints showed more granularity than the existing census tract-based maps and captured the transition of WUI dynamics well. More frequent updates of building footprint and improved WUI mapping will improve our understanding of WUI dynamics and provide guidance for adaptive strategies on community planning and wildfire hazard reduction.

TI  - An empirical comparison of the Extended Parallel Process Model with the Terror Management Health Model
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lay Summary In this research, we compared two psychological models that explain how people respond to fear-based health promotion campaigns. The well-established Extended Parallel Process Model predicts that when faced with a fear-arousing message, audiences evaluate their self-efficacy in performing the recommended action, as well as the efficacy of the proposed action. Next, the efficacy appraisal is weighed against the perceived level of fear and the relevance of the threat to one's personal situation to determine a response to the threat. The more recently developed Terror Management Health Model states that fear of death is a special case. When faced with a fear-arousing message that utilizes threat of death as a consequence, audiences can cling to worldviews that grant them self-esteem. As such, defensiveness evoked by the fear of death is not in response to the level of perceived threat, but the qualitative nature of the threat. This worldview defense can create undesirable responses to fear appeals containing the fear of death. Results from a laboratory experiment indicate that the established model explains audience behavior for health-related messages that utilize threats with nonfatal consequences but the Terror Management Health Model is better suited to predicting behavior for messages that utilize threat of death as a consequence.The Extended Parallel Process Model posits that fear-appeal messages are processed only when message recipients perceive a critical level of threat. The more recent Terror Management Health Model suggests that, in addition to level of perceived threat, the nature of the threat also influences how target audiences process fear appeals. Specifically, fear appeals that utilize the threat of death as a consequence trigger both conscious and nonconscious responses that influence message recipients' health-related decisions. Accounting for the influence of consciousness of death helps explain maladaptive responses that extant theory has been unable to explain. Results from an experiment indicate that, when the level of perceived fear was the same across participants, the Extended Parallel Process Model successfully predicted persuasive outcomes for fear appeals that utilized the threat of arrest or serious injury as a consequence of noncompliance. However, for fear appeals that utilized the threat of death as a consequence of noncompliance, as predicted by the Terror Management Health Model, ego involvement in the health-related behavior predicted persuasive outcomes more accurately than the dual fear control and danger control processes. These findings suggest that incorporating consciousness of death and ego involvement can avoid conceptual problems with the level-of-fear construct, provide a meaningful way to predict fear-appeal responses across target audiences, and explain maladaptive responses that have eluded the explanations of extant fear-appeal theories.

TI  - PS-InSAR Based Monitoring of Land Subsidence by Groundwater Extraction for Lahore Metropolitan City, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater dynamics caused by extraction and recharge are one of the primary causes of subsidence in the urban environment. Lahore is the second largest metropolitan city in Pakistan. The rapid expansion of this urban area due to high population density has increased the demand for groundwater to meet commercial and household needs. Land subsidence due to inadequate groundwater extraction has long been a concern in Lahore. This paper aims to present the persistent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) technique for monitoring the recent land subsidence in Lahore, based on the Sentinel-1 data obtained from January 2020 to December 2021. PS-InSAR techniques are very efficient and cost-effective, determining land subsidence and providing useful results. Areas of high groundwater discharge are prone to high subsidence of -110 mm, while the surroundings show an uplifting of +21 mm during the study period. The PS-InSAR study exposes the subsidence area in detail, particularly when the subsoil is characterized by alluvial and clay deposits and large building structures. This type of observation is quite satisfactory and similar to ground-based surface deformation pertinent to a high subsidence rate. Results will enable more effective urban planning, land infrastructure building, and risk assessment related to subsidence.

TI  - Expanding vegetated areas by human activities and strengthening vegetation growth concurrently explain the greening of Seoul
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have reported that urbanization leads to a decrease in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) due to the expansion of impervious cover. Some studies, however, have reported positive NDVI trends in urban areas due to warming and CO2 fertilization effects, as well as the creation of green space. Thus, we examined spatial and temporal variations of the growing season maximum NDVI in a megacity, Seoul, which has rapidly urbanized over the past decades, by analyzing a 32-year time series (1987 - 2018) of Landsat satellite images in Google Earth Engine. Continuous change detection and classification and random forest algorithms were integrated to classify Seoul land cover types annually. We found an overall increasing NDVI trend at the city scale (0.002 yr(-1)). Significant NDVI trends were found for approximately 46 % of Seoul, with greening and browning trends accounting for 39 % and 7 %, respectively. Greening pixels appeared mainly on impervious (23 % with a significant NDVI trend), deciduous (10 %), and evergreen (3 %) land cover as of 2018. Stable impervious, deciduous, and evergreen land cover pixels showed a greening trend over the 32 years (0.002 yr(-1)), which stemmed from the planting of trees in areas with impervious cover, such as streets and residential areas, and vegetation growth in forest areas. Disturbed area pixels showed fluctuating NDVI values, but there were more greening pixels (20 %) than browning pixels (5 %). Our findings indicate that a detailed knowledge of land use and land cover changes is required to understand NDVI trends in urban areas.

TI  - Comparison of UAS and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery for Water Quality Monitoring: A Case Study for Acid Mine Drainage Affected Areas (SW Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) and satellites are used for monitoring and assessing the quality of surface waters. Combining both sensors in a joint tool may scale local water quality retrieval models to regional and global scales by translating UAS-based models to satellite imagery. The main objective of this study is to examine whether Sentinel-2 (S2) data can complement UAS data, specifically from the MicaSense RedEdge MX-Dual sensor, for inland water quality monitoring in mining environments affected by acid mine drainage (AMD). For this purpose, a comparison between UAS reflectance maps and atmospherically corrected S2 imagery was performed. S2 data were processed with Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) and Case 2 Regional Coast Colour for Complex waters (C2X) atmospheric correction (AC) processors. The correlation between the UAS data and the atmospherically corrected S2 data was evaluated on a band-by-band and a pixel-by-pixel basis, and the compatibility of the spectral data was analyzed through statistical methods. The results showed C2RCC and C2X performed better for acidic greenish-blue and non-acidic greenish-brown water bodies concerning the UAS data than for acidic dark reddish-brown waters. However, significant differences in reflectance between the UAS sensor and both S2 AC processors have been detected. The poor agreement between sensors should be considered when combining data from both instruments since these could have further consequences in developing multi-scale models.

TI  - Inferring Mass Loss by Measuring Contemporaneous Deformation around the Helheim Glacier, Southeastern Greenland, Using Sentinel-1 InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The elastic response of solid earth to glacier and ice sheet melting, the most important consequences of climate change, is a contemporaneous uplift. Here, we use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements to detect crustal deformation and mass loss near the Helheim glacier, one of the largest glaciers in southeastern Greenland. The InSAR time series of Sentinel-1 data between April 2016 and July 2020 suggest that there is a maximum cumulative displacement of similar to 6 cm in the line of sight (LOS) direction from the satellite to the ground near Helheim. We use an exponentially decreasing model of the thinning rate, which assumes that the mass loss starts at the lower-elevation terminal region of the glacier and continues to the higher-elevation interior. A linear inversion of the derived crustal uplift in the vicinity of bedrock using this model for surface loading in an elastic half-space suggests a mass loss of 8.33 Gt/year, which agrees with the results from other studies.

TI  - Early Outcome, Cosmetic Result and Tolerability of an IOERT-Boost Prior to Adjuvant Whole-Breast Irradiation
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Our study with 139 breast cancer patients treated with intraoperative radiotherapy reports favorable data on the cosmetic outcome as well as the acute and early long-term side effects. Our oncologic control rates are comparable to the previous literature. Background/Aims: Due to its favorable dose distribution and targeting of the region at highest risk of recurrence due to direct visualization of tumor bed, intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) is used as part of a breast-conserving treatment approach. The aim of this study was to analyze tumor control and survival, as well as the toxicity profile, and cosmetic outcomes in patients irradiated with an IOERT boost for breast cancer. Materials and Methods: 139 Patients treated at our institution between January 2010 and January 2015 with a single boost dose of 10 Gy to the tumor bed during breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation were retrospectively analyzed. Results: 139 patients were included in this analysis. The median age was 54 years (range 28-83 years). The preferred surgical strategy was segmental resection with sentinel lymphonodectomy (66.5%) or axillary dissection (23.1%). Regarding adjuvant radiotherapy, the vast majority received 5 x 1.8 Gy to 50.4 Gy. At a median follow-up of 33.6 months, recurrence-free and overall survival were 95.5% and 94.9%, respectively. No patient developed an in-field recurrence. Seven patients (5.0%) died during the follow-up period, including two patients due to disease recurrence (non-in-field). High-grade (CTCAE > 2) perioperative adverse events attributable to IOERT included wound healing disorder (N = 1) and hematoma (N = 1). High-grade late adverse events (LENT-SOMA grade III) were reported only in one patient with fat necrosis. Low-grade late adverse events (LENT-SOMA grade I-II) included pain (18.0%), edema (10.5%), fibrosis (21%), telangiectasia (4.5%) and pigmentation change (23.0%). The mean breast retraction assessment score was 1.66 (0-6). Both patients and specialists rated the cosmetic result "excellent/good" in 84.8% and 87.9%, respectively. Conclusion: Our study reports favorable data on the cosmetic outcome as well as the acute and early long-term tolerability for patients treated with an IOERT boost. Our oncologic control rates are comparable to the previous literature. However, prospective investigations on the role of IOERT in comparison to other boost procedures would be desirable.

TI  - Feature Selection for SAR Target Discrimination and Efficient Two-Stage Detection Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature-based target detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is required for monitoring situations where it is difficult to obtain a large amount of data, such as in tactical regions. Although many features have been studied for target detection in SAR images, their performance depends on the characteristics of the images, and both efficiency and performance deteriorate when the features are used indiscriminately. In this study, we propose a two-stage detection framework to ensure efficient and superior detection performance in TSX images, using previously studied features. The proposed method consists of two stages. The first stage uses simple features to eliminate misdetections. Next, the discrimination performance for the target and clutter of each feature is evaluated and those features suitable for the image are selected. In addition, the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform reduces the redundancy of the selected features and maximizes discrimination performance. By applying the proposed method to actual TerraSAR-X (TSX) images, the majority of the identified clusters of false detections were excluded, and the target of interest could be distinguished.

TI  - Bearing Capacity of UHPC-Filled High-Strength Elliptical Steel Tube Composite Columns with Encased High-Strength H-Shape Steel Subjected to Eccentrical Load
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate the bearing capacity of composite columns composed of ultra-high performance concrete, (UHPC)-filled high-strength elliptical steel tube with encased high-strength H-shape steel (HUCFESTCs) were subjected to eccentric load. Forty-four HUCFESTCs were designed with varying parameters: yield strength of the steel tube (f(y)), yield strength of the H-shape steel (f(y1)), concrete-cube compressive strength (f(cu)), steel tube thickness (t), eccentricity (e), slenderness ratio (lambda), the section area of the H-shape steel (A(HS)), and long-short axis ratio (psi). Based on a bilinear elastic-plastic constitutive model of steel that considered stress hardening and a nonlinear constitutive model of UHPC, 44 HUCFESTCs models were established by ABAQUS software. The influence of different parameters on the ultimate bearing capacity of the HUCFESTCs was analyzed. The whole process of HUCFESTCs under eccentric load was studied, and the typical failure modes of HUCFESTCs are described. The results show that the main failure mode of the HUCFESTCs subjected to eccentrical load is bulging outward of the steel tube, the buckling of the H-shape steel, and crushing of the concrete in the middle part of the column and the inner part of the H-shape steel. The stiffness of HUCFESTCs increases gradually with the increase in f(y), t, and e. The ultimate eccentrical compression bearing capacity of HUCFESTCs improves gradually with increases in f(y), t, f(y1), A(HS), psi, and f(cu), but it decreases gradually with increases in lambda and e. By using statistical regression and introducing the reduction coefficient of eccentricity, the calculation formula for the eccentric bearing capacity of HUCFEST columns is developed, which can provide a basis for the application of HUCFESTCs in practical engineering.

TI  - Prediction of Corn Yield in the USA Corn Belt Using Satellite Data and Machine Learning: From an Evapotranspiration Perspective
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable prediction of corn yield for the United States of America is essential for effective food and energy management of the world. Three satellite-derived variables were selected, namely enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI) and land surface temperature (LST). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for regression, while random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) methods were selected for machine learning. The three variables serve as inputs to these methods, and their efficacy in predicting corn yield was assessed in relation to evapotranspiration (ET). The results confirmed that a high level of performance can be achieved for yield prediction (mean predicted R-2 = 0.63) by combining EVI + LAI + LST with the four methods. Among them, the best results were obtained by using LSTM (mean predicted R-2 = 0.67). EVI and LST provided extra and unique information in peak and early growth stages for corn yield, respectively, and the usefulness of including LAI was not readily apparent across the whole season, which was consistent with the field growing conditions affecting the ET of corn. The satellite-derived data and the methods used in this study could be used for predicting the yields of other crops in different regions.

TI  - Monitoring rock desert formation caused by two different origins (ice-snow melting and drying) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China by considering topographic and meteorological elements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring rock desert formation caused by two different origins (ice-snow melting and drying) through remote sensing is crucial to our understanding of the interaction between the underlying surface of different rock desert and land-atmosphere types, as well as the relationship between bare land and soil erosion. A number of achievements have been made in remote sensing monitoring of desert areas, but there is a lack of accurate classification and remote sensing identification of rock desert types based on formation mechanism. In this study, the north and south sides of the eastern Kunlun Mountains in the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China were taken as the study areas. Landsat operational landscape imager, digital elevation model, and precipitation and temperature grid data were used as data sources. By identifying the bare areas based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), we used the multi-element fusion method of contours, isotherms, and isohyets to identify the rock desert types in the ice-snow melting and dry areas. The results showed that: (1) the rock desert areas identified by remote sensing based on topographic and meteorological elements were highly accurate, with an overall accuracy of 88.45% and kappa coefficient of 0.77. The multi-element fusion method of contours, isotherms, and isohyets could effectively identify the rock desert types in the ice-snow melting and dry areas; (2) the optimal segmentation range of the ice-snow melting and dry areas was 3600 m contour, -2 degrees C-2 degrees C isotherms, and 100-130 mm isohyets. The areas with elevation less than 3600 m, annual average temperature higher than 2 degrees C, and average annual precipitation less than 100 mm were rock desert in the dry areas. The range of -2 degrees C-2 degrees C isotherms and 100-130 mm isohyets was the transition area between the ice-snow melting and dry areas. The areas with elevation higher than 3600 m, annual average temperature less than -2 degrees C, and average annual precipitation higher than 130 mm were rock desert in the ice-snow melting areas; and (3) the identification accuracy of the bare areas based on the NDVI method was better, specifically, the identification accuracy of plain bare areas was generally better than that of mountain bare areas. The remote sensing identification method considers not only the topographic factors that have great influence on the spatial distribution of the two types of rock desert areas, but also the meteorological factors, which can provide a scientific reference for the effective identification of the two types of rock desert areas.

TI  - Crop Mapping Using the Historical Crop Data Layer and Deep Neural Networks: A Case Study in Jilin Province, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning combined with satellite image time series can quickly, and reliably be implemented to map crop distribution and growth monitoring necessary for food security. However, obtaining a large number of field survey samples for classifier training is often time-consuming and costly, which results in the very slow production of crop distribution maps. To overcome this challenge, we propose an ensemble learning approach from the existing historical crop data layer (CDL) to automatically create multitudes of samples according to the rules of spatiotemporal sample selection. Sentinel-2 monthly composite images from 2017 to 2019 for crop distribution mapping in Jilin Province were mosaicked and classified. Classification accuracies of four machine learning algorithms for a single-month and multi-month time series were compared. The results show that deep neural network (DNN) performed the best, followed by random forest (RF), then decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM) the least. Compared with other months, July and August have higher classification accuracy, and the kappa coefficients of 0.78 and 0.79, respectively. Compared with a single phase, the kappa coefficient gradually increases with the growth of the time series, reaching 0.94 in August at the earliest, and then the increase is not obvious, and the highest in the whole growth cycle is 0.95. During the mapping process, time series of different lengths produced different classification results. Wetland types were misclassified as rice. In such cases, authors combined time series of two lengths to correct the misclassified rice types. By comparing with existing products and field points, rice has the highest consistency, followed by corn, whereas soybeans have the least consistency. This shows that the generated sample data set and trained model in this research can meet the crop mapping accuracy and simultaneously reduce the cost of field surveys. For further research, more years and types of crops should be considered for mapping and validation.

TI  - Daily Evapotranspiration Estimations by Direct Calculation and Temporal Upscaling Based on Field and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily evapotranspiration (ET) integration is essential to various applications of agricultural water planning and management, ecohydrology, and energy balance studies. The constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr) temporal upscaling method has been proven to be efficient in extrapolating instantaneous ET to a daily timescale. Unlike upscaling methods, the direct calculation (DC) method developed in our previous study directly estimates daily ET without calculating instantaneous ET. The present study aimed to compare daily estimations of ET using the EFr and DC methods based on field and MODIS data at a site from the ChinaFLUX network. The estimation results were validated by eddy covariance (EC) ET both with and without the correction of energy imbalance. Based on field data, the results show that (i) the DC method performed with higher accuracy when compared to uncorrected EC measurements, while daily ET from both methods was overestimated; (ii) the DC method still performed better after the EC ET was corrected by the Residual Energy scheme, and the overestimations were significantly decreased; (iii) both methods performed best when compared with corrected ET by the Bowen Ratio scheme. The results from satellite data reveal that (i) the constant EFr method overestimated daily ET by a mean-bias-error (MBE) of 5.6 W/m(2), and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 18.6 W/m(2); and (ii) the DC method underestimated daily ET by a smaller MBE of -4.8 W/m(2) and an RMSE of 22.5 W/m(2). Therefore, the DC method has similar or better performance than the widely used constant EFr upscaling method and can estimate daily ET directly and effectively.

TI  - Validation and Analysis of MISR and POLDER Aerosol Products over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-angle polarization measurement is an important technical means of satellite remote sensing applied to aerosol monitoring. By adding angle information and polarization measurements, aerosol optical and microphysical properties can be more comprehensively and accurately retrieved. The accuracy of aerosol retrieval can reflect the advantages and specific accuracy improvement of multi-angle polarization. In this study, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) V23 aerosol products and the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) GRASP "high-precision" archive were evaluated with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations over China. Validation of aerosol optical depth (AOD), absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD), and the Angstrom exponent (AE) properties was conducted. Our results show that the AOD inversion accuracy of POLDER-3/GRASP is higher with the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.902, slope of 0.896, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.264, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.190, and about 40.71% of retrievals within the expected error (EE, +/- (0.05 + 0.2 x AOD(AERONET))) lines. For AAOD, the performance of two products is poor, with better results for POLDER-3/GRASP data. POLDER-3/GRASP AE also has higher R of 0.661 compared with that of MISR AE (0.334). According to the validation results, spatiotemporal distribution, and comparison with other traditional scalar satellite data, the performance of multi-angle polarization observations is better and is suitable for the retrieval of aerosol properties.

TI  - Evaluation of SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS Datasets Using RadCalNet and Landsat 8/OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used RVUS data from RadCalNet as a benchmark to verify the radiometric accuracy and stability of operational and reprocessed SNPP/VIIRS data and the accuracy of NOAA-20/VIIRS data, as well as to assess the efficiency of the SNPP/VIIRS reprocessing algorithm. In addition, to remove the uncertainty of the RVUS site itself, we used Landsat 8/OLI as another benchmark with which to validate the accuracy and stability of VIIRS data through the RUVS site. The radiometric biases of the operational and reprocessed SNPP VIIRS bands were within +/- 4% and +/- 2%, respectively, as compared with the RUVS site and OLI, except for the M10 and M11 bands. In particular, the biases of the M5 and M7 bands were reduced by similar to 2% in this study. NOAA-20 VIIRS, on the other hand, was consistently lower than SNPP by similar to 2 to similar to 4% for all the bands. For the equivalent bands, the drift differences between operational and reprocessed SNPP/VIIRS and OLI were no larger than 0.24%/year and 0.1%/year, respectively. The reprocessing algorithm of SNPP VIIRS efficiently improved the radiometric accuracy and stability of the SNPP/VIIRS dataset to meet its specifications.

TI  - Activity of the Fushun West Open-pit Mine in China Observed by Sentinel-1 InSAR Coherence Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activity causes environmental pollution and geological hazards such as ground subsidence or landslide of which continuous monitoring is necessary. In this study, the activity on the Fushun West Open-Pit Mine (FWOPM), one of the largest open pit coal mines in Asia located in Fushun, Liaoning Province, China, was analyzed by using a time series Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence dataset. By using the difference between the two Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of the area, it was possible to confirm that there was a stockpiling activity in the western area of the FWOPM while excavation activity in the eastern area. By using RGB composite images using the yearly-averaged InSAR coherence images, the activity of the mine was confirmed by period, which was confirmed by Google Earth optical images. As a result, it was possible to confirm three landslides and the related activities on the northwest slope and the dumping activity on the west slope of FWOPM.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) and the Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (S2A/MSI) satellite data were employed to estimate the Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) values as an indicator for water clarity in the near-shore zone. As the revisit cycle of L8 and S2A satellites is 16 and 5 days, which means they may have a harmonized overpass from a particular place every 80 days, two field measurements were conducted to determine the matchup Z(sd) values around Kish Island in the northern Persian Gulf, so that both chosen dates were coincident with the two harmonized overpasses of the above-mentioned satellites from the study area. Afterward, a general combined linear and ratio transform model was formed to estimate the Z(sd) values from the satellite data, based on the matchup field measured Z(sd) values. The statistical indicators, including the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were further determined for many combinations of bands and/or band ratios to suggest the optimum model. Compared with the L8/OLI models, the results demonstrated that the S2A/MSI ones had shown slightly higher accuracy, where this development had been improved once both imagers had been utilized to produce the integrated models.

TI  - Features of implementing the Russian Orthodox Church's missionary policy towards the non-Russian peoples of Vyatka Province in the second half of the 19th century
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to single out and analyse the missionary activities of the Orthodox clergy of Vyatka Province in the second half of the 19th century. The spatial scope of the study is determined by the boundaries of the given region as of the specified period. The chronological framework of the study is due to the identified trend of intensifying missionary practice associated with the internal political processes of the post-reform era. The source base of the study was made up of various categories of historical sources. First of all, these are the acts of the Holy Synod, which make it possible to identify the directions of the state confessional policy in general. Documents of the Vyatka Committee of the Orthodox Missionary Society contain rich factual material about missionary practice in a foreign environment. Clerical records tell about the milestones of the missionary service of specific priests. The characteristics of Vyatka Province as a region with peculiarities of national and confessional structure are recreated based on published statistical sources. Publicistic sources from the periodical Vyatskie eparkhial'nye vedomosti are of paramount importance in solving the problems of the study. The methodological basis of the study is the problem-chronological approach. In accordance with it, the starting point of the study was the characteristic of the ethno-confessional situation in Vyatka Province in its evolution: from the period of the appearance of the Slavic-Russian population in the region inhabited by ethnic Finno-Ugric peoples, pagans in terms of worldview, to ascertaining the facts of the ongoing assimilation in the 16th-18th centuries, which followed the path of forming a regional ethos on the basis of Orthodox values. The result of the study within the framework of the designated problem is the formulation of several specific areas of these activities. These areas include: creation in Vyatka Province, in the context of the general imperial trend, of Orthodox societies and brotherhoods; dissemination of education among non-Russian non-Orthodox peoples through the establishment of special foreign schools; creation of new church parishes in foreign villages; organization of regular monitoring by the Holy Synod of missionary activities; strengthening of informational coverage of missionary activities in the Vyatskie eparkhial'nye vedomosti periodical of Vyatka Eparchy. Based on the results of the study, the following conclusions were drawn: missionary work was carried out by various means; regional practice was in the context of national events; the state and the church spurred missionary activities when a threat to social stability arose from a number of post-reform populist organizations. It can be argued that the non-native population of Vyatka Province turned out to be receptive to the efforts of the Orthodox clergy, which became a kind of a social bond, uniting different nationalities into a single state entity.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation in Compound Dry and Hot Events and Its Effects on NDVI in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, frequent compound dry and hot events have posed a great threat to humans and the ecological environment, especially in Inner Mongolia, which has arid and semi-arid characteristics. In this study, monthly temperature and precipitation data from 115 meteorological stations in Inner Mongolia from 1982 to 2020 were used to establish a standardized dry and hot index (SDHI). Theil-Sen median trend analysis, Mann-Kendall test, partial correlation analysis, and stepwise multiple regression models were used to characterize the changes in compound dry and hot events and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1982 to 2020, and the relationship between the SDHI and NDVI was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that the overall SDHI values in Inner Mongolia showed a significant decrease at a rate of 0.03/year from 1982 to 2020, indicating an increase in the severity of compound dry and hot events. NDVI values showed a significant increasing trend and NDVI showed mutated 2001. Among the grassland vegetation types, SDHI and NDVI trends were more significant in forests, and meadow steppe, desert steppe, and desert were more susceptible to compound dry and hot events, and forests had the greatest severity of compound dry and hot events. The results of the partial correlation analysis showed that the average value of the partial correlation coefficient between the SDHI and NDVI was 0.68, and the area of positive correlation was 84.13%. Spatially, it showed strong response characteristics in the middle and gradual weakening towards the east and west sides. The correlation between NDVI and climatic conditions varied greatly in different vegetation areas. The forest area is most sensitive to the influence of temperature, and the desert steppe area is most affected by compound dry and hot events. The overall vegetation growth in Inner Mongolia was most affected by temperature conditions, followed by compound dry and hot conditions, and the influence of drought conditions was the least significant. The results of the relative importance analysis confirmed this. The research results provide a more detailed understanding of compound dry and hot events in arid and semi-arid regions and useful insights and support for ecological protection.

TI  - Applications of Sentinel-2 satellite data for spatio-temporal mapping of deep pools for monitoring the riverine connectivity and assessment of ecological dynamics: a case from Godavari, a tropical river in India (2016-2021)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are dynamic ecosystems with diverse habitats that require ample connectivity to ensure the flow of ecosystem services, thus empowering the sustainable development of an entire basin. Geo-spatial tools offer powerful prospects for monitoring of aquatic ecosystems. The usefulness of Sentinel-2 datasets to assess river connectivity has been explored for an un-gauged seasonal river system. The present study was undertaken in five ecologically unique river reaches viz. Wainganga, Wardha, Pranhita, Godavari-mid and Manair in Godavari Basin in the Indian Deccan Plateau to map water spread dynamics at various time scales, i.e., fortnightly, monthly, seasonal, annual and demi-decadal during 2016-2021. The maximum value of perennial water spread per square kilometre of total floodplain area (2016-2021), determined using Sentinel-2 imageries, was observed in river Wardha (0.18) followed by Pranhita (0.12) and Wainganga (0.11). The water spread showed a decreasing trend, while the number of patches in the river corridor increased over time from post-monsoon to pre-monsoon season. The copious perennial habitat with relatively larger patches, incessant flow in river Pranhita and obstructed flow, large-sized patches reported in river Wardha during summer months, hold importance in terms of providing refuge to aquatic biota. This study provides evidence for the impact of water projects on spatio-temporal water spread dynamics in Godavari Basin. The demonstrated utility of Sentinel-2 imagery coupled with gauge station measurements for river continuity assessment and deep pool mapping would aid in enhancing our understanding on environmental flow at a spatial scale, which in turn would aid in effective river management to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The implications of this study for sustainable environmental management and limitations are also discussed.

TI  - NATIONAL LAND COVER MAPPING USING VARIOUS REMOTE SENSING DATASETS IN GEE
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - National land-cover maps are essential for the development of the countries as land-use patterns have shifted dramatically throughout the world in the previous decades. With the latest development in the remote sensing community, the power and ease of web-mapping and web-based map and GIS services have increased. This work investigates several datasets for land cover categorization on a national scale across North Macedonia (25,713 km(2)) using Sentinel images within Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud computing platform designed to store and process huge data sets for analysis and ultimate decision making Both single and synergetic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images have been investigated. The basic land-cover components are generated, upon which the more detailed final land-cover/land-use data were derived and defined. Comparing the results of the datasets indicate the influence of the radar data over the optical data in land cover classification. Also, the influence of the investigated data over every class is calculated. The results showed that the various datasets lead to different overall accuracy. Also, the different datasets performed differently over single classes, even though their overall accuracy was the same. As a result, a high accuracy national-level land cover classification has been created. The results have been compared to the latest Corine data. The results can be critical to making informed policy, development, planning, and resource management decisions. This provided the standardized references from which landscape changes could be determined and quantified.

TI  - Advanced Classification of Ionospheric Troughs in the Morning and Evening Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The separation and classification of ionospheric troughs in the winter evening and morning ionospheres of the southern hemisphere were performed using CHAMP satellite data for high solar activity (2000-2002). In the high-latitude ionosphere, the main ionospheric trough (MIT) was separated from the high-latitude trough (HLT). The separation was carried out using a thorough analysis of all the characteristic structures of the ionosphere in the framework of the auroral diffuse particle precipitation model. Two types of high-latitude troughs were identified: (1) a wide trough associated with zone II of diffuse precipitation on the poleward edge of the auroral oval and (2) a narrow trough of ionization, which is presumably associated with an electric field action. The poleward wall of MIT is as ever formed by diffuse precipitation in zone I on the equatorward edge of the auroral oval. The HLT and MIT separation is most difficult at the longitudes of the eastern hemisphere, where all structures are located at the highest latitudes and partially overlap. In the mid-latitude ionosphere, all the characteristic structures of the ionosphere were also identified and considered. MIT was separated from the ring ionospheric trough (RIT), which is formed by the decay processes of the magnetospheric ring current. The separation of MIT and RIT was performed based on an analysis of the prehistory of all geomagnetic disturbances during the period under study. In addition to the RIT, a decrease in the electron density equatorward of the MIT was found to be often formed at the America-Atlantic longitudes, which masks the MIT minimum. For completeness, all cases of a clearly defined polar cavity are also presented.

TI  - Assessing Surface Urban Heat Island Related to Land Use/Land Cover Composition and Pattern in the Temperate Mountain Valley City of Kathmandu, Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban growth has coincided with a substantial change in the environment, including vegetation, soil, and urban climate. The surface urban heat island (UHI) is the temperature in the lowest layers of the urban atmosphere; it is critical to the surface's energy balance and makes it possible to determine internal climates that affect the livability of urban residents. Therefore, the surface UHI is recognized as one of the crucial global issues in the 21st century. This phenomenon affects sustainable urban planning, the health of urban residents, and the possibility of living in cities. In the context of sustainable landscapes and urban planning, more weight is given to exploring solutions for mitigating and adapting to the surface UHI effect, currently a hot topic in urban thermal environments. This study evaluated the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) formation in the temperate mountain valley city of Kathmandu, Nepal, because it is one of the megacities of South Asia, and the recent population increase has led to the rapid urbanization in the valley. Using Landsat images for 2000, 2013, and 2020, this study employed several approaches, including machine learning techniques, remote sensing (RS)-based parameter analysis, urban-rural gradient analysis, and spatial composition and pattern analysis to explore the surface UHI effect from the urban expansion and green space in the study area. The results revealed that Kathmandu's surface UHI effect was remarkable. In 2000, the higher mean LST tended to be in the city's core area, whereas the mean LST tended to move in the east, south, north, and west directions by 2020, which is compatible with urban expansion. Urban periphery expansion showed a continuous enlargement, and the urban core area showed a predominance of impervious surface (IS) on the basis of urban-rural gradient analysis. The city core had a lower density of green space (GS), while away from the city center, a higher density of GS predominated at the three time points, showing a lower surface UHI effect in the periphery compared to the city core area. This study reveals that landscape composition and pattern are significantly correlated with the mean LST in Kathmandu. Therefore, in discussing these findings in order to mitigate and adapt to prominent surface UHI effects, this study provides valuable information for sustainable urban planning and landscape design in mountain valley cities like Kathmandu.

T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming together with environmental pollution threatens marine habitats and causes an increasing number of environmental disasters. Periodic monitoring of coastal water quality is of critical importance for the effective management of water resources and the sustainability of marine ecosystems. The use of remote sensing technologies provides significant benefits for detecting, monitoring, and analyzing rapidly occurring and displaced natural phenomena, including mucilage events. In this study, five water indices estimated from cloud-free and partly cloudy Sentinel-2 images acquired from May to July 2021 were employed to effectively map mucilage aggregates on the sea surface in the Izmit Bay using the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Results showed that mucilage aggregates started with the coverage of about 6 km(2) sea surface on 14 May, reached the highest level on 24 May and diminished at the end of July. Among the applied indices, the Adjusted Floating Algae Index (AFAI) was superior for producing the mucilage maps even for the partly cloudy image, followed by Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) and Mucilage Index (MI). To be more specific, indices using green channel were found to be inferior for extracting mucilage information from the satellite images.

TI  - The effects of prolonged drought on vegetation dieback and megafires in southern California chaparral
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought contributed to extensive dieback of southern California chaparral, and normalized difference vegetation index before drought and near the end of the drought was used to estimate this dieback, after accounting for other disturbances recorded in aerial photographs. Within the perimeters of two megafires that occurred after the drought, the 2017 Thomas Fire and the 2018 Woolsey Fire, there had been extensive areas of dieback. Comparing dieback with Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity measures of fire severity, there was a highly significant negative relationship between drought-caused shrub dieback and fire-caused dieback as measured by fire severity. We interpret this as further support for our remote sensing methodology for prefire dieback. Models of fire behavior suggest that one means by which dieback contributes to fire size is through increasing the density and distance of spot fires, particularly under extreme wind conditions. Lower elevation chaparral associations appear to be most vulnerable and are closer to urban environments, which should be a concern to fire managers in regions subjected to extended droughts.

TI  - Exploring Transferable Techniques to Retrieve Crop Biophysical and Biochemical Variables Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to determine the spatial transferability of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models for estimating biophysical and biochemical variables (BVs), using Sentinel-2 data. The specific objectives were to: (1) assess the effect of different proportions of training samples (i.e., 25%, 50%, and 75%) available at the Target site (D-T) on the spatial transferability of the XGBoost models and (2) evaluate the effect of the Source site (D-S) (i.e., trained) model accuracy on the Target site (i.e., unseen) retrieval uncertainty. The results showed that the Bothaville (D-S) -> Harrismith (D-T) Leaf Area Index (LAI) models required only fewer proportions, i.e., 25% or 50%, of the training samples to make optimal retrievals in the D-T (i.e., RMSE: 0.61 m(2) m(-2); R-2: 59%), while Harrismith (D-S) -> Bothaville (D-T) LAI models required up to 75% of training samples in the D-T to obtain optimal LAI retrievals (i.e., RMSE = 0.63 m(2) m(-2); R-2 = 67%). In contrast, the chlorophyll content models for Bothaville (D-S) -> Harrismith (D-T) required significant proportions of samples (i.e., 75%) from the D-T to make optimal retrievals of Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCab) (i.e., RMSE: 7.09 mu g cm(-2); R-2: 58%) and Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) (i.e., RMSE: 36.3 mu g cm(-2); R-2: 61%), while Harrismith (D-S) -> Bothaville (D-T) models required only 25% of the samples to achieve RMSEs of 8.16 mu g cm(-2) (R-2: 83%) and 40.25 mu g cm(-2) (R-2: 77%), for LCab and CCC, respectively. The results also showed that the source site model accuracy led to better transferability for LAI retrievals. In contrast, the accuracy of LCab and CCC source site models did not necessarily improve their transferability. Overall, the results elucidate the potential of transferable Machine Learning Regression Algorithms and are significant for the rapid retrieval of important crop BVs in data-scarce areas, thus facilitating spatially-explicit information for site-specific farm management.

TI  - Monitoring Land Subsidence Using PS-InSAR Technique in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a major concern in vastly growing metropolitans worldwide. The most serious risks in this scenario are linked to groundwater extraction and urban development. Pakistan's fourth-largest city, Rawalpindi, and its twin Islamabad, located at the northern edge of the Potwar Plateau, are witnessing extensive urban expansion. Groundwater (tube-wells) is residents' primary daily water supply in these metropolitan areas. Unnecessarily pumping and the local inhabitant's excessive demand for groundwater disturb the sub-surface's viability. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) approach, along with Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, were used to track land subsidence in Rawalpindi-Islamabad. The SARPROZ application was used to study a set of Sentinel-1 imagery obtained from January 2019 to June 2021 along descending and ascending orbits to estimate ground subsidence in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad area. The results show a significant increase (-25 to -30 mm/yr) in subsidence from -69 mm/yr in 2019 to -98 mm/yr in 2020. The suggested approach effectively maps, detects, and monitors subsidence-prone terrains and will enable better planning, surface infrastructure building designs, and risk management related to subsidence.

TI  - Surface Deformation Analysis of the Houston Area Using Time Series Interferometry and Emerging Hot Spot Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in the northern Gulf of Mexico, such as Houston, have experienced one of the fastest rates of subsidence, with groundwater/hydrocarbon withdrawal being considered the primary cause. This work reports substantial ground subsidence in a few parts of Greater Houston and adjoining areas not reported before. Observation of surface deformation using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data obtained from Sentinel-1A shows total subsidence of up to 9 cm in some areas from 2016 to 2020. Most of the area within the Houston city limits shows no substantial subsidence, but growing suburbs around the city, such as Katy in the west, Spring and The Woodlands in the north and northwest, and Fresno in the south, show subsidence. In this study, we performed emerging hot spot analysis on InSAR displacement products to identify areas undergoing significant subsidence. To investigate the contributions of groundwater to subsidence, we apply optimized hot spot analysis to groundwater level data collected over the past 31 years from over 71,000 water wells and look at the correlation with fault surface deformation patterns. To evaluate the contribution of oil/gas pumping, we applied optimized hot spot analysis to known locations of oil and gas wells. The high rate of water pumping in the suburbs is the main driver of subsidence, but oil/gas withdrawal plays an important role in areas such as Mont Belvieu. Displacement time series shows that the Clodine, Hockley, and Woodgate faults are active, whereas the Long Point Fault shows no motion, although it was once very active.

TI  - Wildfires in the Siberian Arctic
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are increasingly understood as an ecological driver within the entire Arctic biome. Arctic soils naturally store large quantities of C, as peat has formed throughout the Holocene. For the Siberian Arctic, we used observations from the MODIS remote sensing instrument to document changes in frequency, geographic extent, and seasonal timing of wildfires as well as vegetation productivity (GPP, NPP, EVI). We also used correlation and regression analysis to identify environmental factors of temperature, precipitation, and lightning occurrence associated with these changes. For the Siberian Arctic as a whole, we found that the decadal frequency of wildfire tripled from the 2001-2010 to the 2011-2020 periods. Increased decadal frequency was accompanied by the increased extent of the burnt area by a factor of 2.6. This increase in fire frequency and extent was not uniform, with the greatest increase in western Siberia with no marked increase for the Siberian Far East. These changes were accompanied by the northward migration of the northern limit of wildfire occurrence and an increase in duration of the wildfire season. We found that annual fire frequency and the extent of burnt areas were related to various combinations of seasonal air temperature, precipitation, ground moisture, and lightning frequency. After fires, vegetation productivity rapidly recovered to pre-fire levels. The northward spread of wildfire into the tundra will release carbon long-stored as peat. The enhanced vegetation productivity, rapid recovery of carbon fixation for burnt areas and the northward migration of boreal forest tree species may offset that release and maintain the current status of the Siberian Arctic as a C sink. Increased wildfire and loss of permafrost may threaten ongoing settlement and industrialization, particularly for western Siberia.

TI  - Identification of erosion hot spot area using GIS and gully contribution for reservoir sedimentation in the case of Abrajit reservoir, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ethiopia, dams are adversely affected by sedimentation due to soil erosion from the watershed area. Thus, this study was conducted on the Abrajit watershed and its reservoir in east Gojjam, Amhara region, Ethiopia. The general objective of this study was to the identification of erosion hot spot areas and estimation of watershed sediment yield to the reservoir. For estimation of annual soil loss from the watershed, the RUSLE model integrating with GIS and remote sensing was used. The total soil loss rate was computed spatially by overlaying the five grid layers of RUSLE factors over the Abrajit watershed using Arc GIS. The average annual soil rate of Abrajit was 4.06 tons/ha/year. In addition, from least to the maximum value, yearly soil loss in the watershed ranged from 0 to 66.75 tons/ha/year. RUSLE model has limitations to assess erosion from gullies, besides the reason that gullies are considerably affecting siltation processes, further watershed gully data were collected. The sediment load contributed from the watershed to the reservoir was high. But, only natural vegetation cover is available to reduce sediment entry to the reservoir by runoff. It is implying that this small dam is extremely affected by a high rate of sedimentation. This calls for periodic dredging of deposited sediment in a small dam to recover impounding capacity for sustainable use of the water.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen is of major public health concern as it leads to increased mortality rate, length of hospital stays, and medical expenses. Current Concepts: Korean Government enacted an Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act in 2009, and 6 MDR bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) have been legally declared as infectious diseases. According to the amendment of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act in 2020, CRE and VRSA were classified as class 2 infectious diseases, and all cases of CRE and VRSA should be reported to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii were classified as class 4 infectious diseases, and cases that occur need to be monitored at KDCA-designated sentinel hospitals to prevent further dissemination. Discussion and Conclusion: In this review, the current antimicrobial resistance status of six types of MDR bacteria, legally declared as infectious diseases, was investigated.. The Korean government is operating national antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems such as the Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System and Korean Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System, as a foundation for preventing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Certain steps need to be taken, such as establishing a surveillance system for antimicrobial usages, strengthening antimicrobial stewardship and infection control systems, and developing new antimicrobials in order for us to achieve the national goal.

TI  - Flood Inflow Estimation in an Ungauged Simple Serial Cascade of Reservoir System Using Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imageries: A Case Study of Imjin River, South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Imjin River is a representative transboundary river in the Korean Peninsula, originating from North Korea and flowing into South Korea. Upstream of Imjin River, on the North Korean side, is the Hwanggang Dam, with a 350 million m(3) of storage capacity, which is in operation for power generation and water supply. The sharing of the operation information of Hwanggang Dam has been limited due to political and military tension. South Korea has constructed the Gunnam Flood Control Reservoir downstream of the Imjin River to prevent potential flood damage due to the urgent and unilateral release from the Hwanggang Dam. However, it is difficult to manage the flood of the Imjin River basin under the situation of limited shared real-time information on the Hwanggang Dam operation. In this study, a hydrological analysis system was established to estimate the inflow and release of the Hwanggang Dam by building a lumped hydrological model and an Auto ROM (Reservoir Operation Method)-based reservoir operation algorithm. To estimate the inflow of the Gunnam Flood Control Reservoir, the water level of the Hwanggang Dam was calculated using the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images, and the hydrological analysis system was calibrated. The evaluation index of the water level of the ungauged Hwanggang Dam derived from January 2017 to August 2020 using the hydrological analysis system was shown to have a coefficient of determination of 0.76 and an RMSE of 3.97 m. In the case of the flood event in August 2020, the coefficient of determination of the flood inflow in the Gunnam Flood Control Zone was calculated to be 0.86.

TI  - High-resolution <i>in situ</i> thermal metrics coupled with acute heat stress experiments reveal differential coral bleaching susceptibility
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between thermal stress and coral bleaching has been a topic of study for decades, yet there is still a mismatch between remotely sensed bleaching predictors and population-specific bleaching responses. Recent studies have linked greater amounts of thermal variability to coral bleaching resistance over small spatial scales, yet in some sites, this variability appears to push corals beyond their thermal limits. Here, we performed a 12-month reciprocal transplant and acute heat stress experiments in populations of Porites lobata from an American Samoan backreef: the Highly Variable (HV), the Moderately Variable, and the Less Variable pools of Ofu to investigate how natural and experimental stress across different thermal environments related to coral bleaching responses during the 2016-2017 thermal anomaly. We also compared various sea surface satellite versus in situ temperature data to determine which metrics were most aligned with observed bleaching responses. We found similar to 0.6 degrees C higher maximum monthly means for in situ versus remotely sensed data, which resulted in fewer degree heating weeks. Although greater thermal variability and heat loading did not have a strong relationship with the onset of natural bleaching responses, acute heat stress revealed differences in sublethal stress responses that aligned with in situ thermal metrics. We suggest greater thermal spikes and heat loading in the HV pool, detected only in the high-resolution in situ data, best explain the decreased thermal performance seen in HV corals; demonstrating the utility of in situ data (both environmental and experimental) for understanding bleaching responses at population-specific spatial scales (< 5 km).

TI  - Clonal serotype 1c multidrug-resistant <i>Shigella flexneri</i> detected in multiple institutions by sentinel-site sequencing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shigella flexneri is a major diarrhoeal pathogen, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant S. flexneri is of public health concern. We report the detection of a clonal cluster of multidrug-resistant serotype 1c (7a) S. flexneri in Singapore in April 2022. Long-read whole-genome sequence analysis found five S. flexneri isolates to be clonal and harboring the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(TEM-1). The isolates were phenotypically resistant to ceftriaxone and had intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. The S. flexneri clonal cluster was first detected in a tertiary hospital diagnostic laboratory (sentinel-site), to which the S. flexneri isolates were sent from other hospitals for routine serogrouping. Long-read whole-genome sequence analysis was performed in the sentinel-site near real-time in view of the unusually high number of S. flexneri isolates received within a short time frame. This study demonstrates that near real-time sentinel-site sequence-based surveillance of convenience samples can detect possible clonal outbreak clusters and may provide alerts useful for public health mitigations at the earliest possible opportunity.

TI  - Detection of mucilage phenomenon in the Sea of Marmara by using multi-scale satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine mucilage outbreaks occurred in the Sea of Marmara in 2021 which severely affected the marine ecosystem. The thick mucilage blankets with different colors became a public concern due to the toxicity potential related to pathogens that accumulate in prolonged presence of mucilage. The mucilage-covered areas in the Sea of Marmara detected by remote sensing data acquired in 2021 were previously reported. However, the areal extents and spectral characteristics of the different colored mucilage types remain unknown. This study presents the spectral characteristics of different types of mucilage in the Izmit Bay in the Sea of Marmara by using medium- (Sentinel-2) and high-spatial resolution (Worldview-3) satellite images. Also, the sea surface temperatures (SST) were studied in relation with the mucilage formation from January 2015 to August 2021 by using NOAA data. Two multispectral satellite sensors Sentinel-2 and Worldview-3 were studied for their potential for mucilage mapping and characterization in the sub-region Izmit Bay. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to detect three different types of mucilage with distinguishable spectral differences in infrared region ranging from 725 to 950 nm. Three different types of mucilage were characterized based on color and texture including (a) the white mucilage aggregates with dispersed patterns which are likely freshly formed, (b) the yellow mucilage accumulations in the coasts that are wind/current transported, and (c) the brown mucilage accumulations that are probably the most-aged. Our results showed that brown mucilage and white mucilage showed similar reflectance values between 425 and 545 nm region, while yellow mucilage showed higher and more distinctive spectral reflectance than white and brown mucilages. The NOAA data showed that average surface water temperature has been increased over the years from 2015 (16.1 degrees C) to 2021 (17.6 degrees C). This increase trend in SSTs points out a likely relation with the mucilage formation and hence may suggest a potential of repeating mucilage events in the near future. This study provides a practical methodology for monitoring, classification, and efficient site selection for mucilage cleaning areas in the Sea of Marmara.

Comparison of bioconcentration factor of heavy metals between endemic fish and aquacultured fish in Maninjau Lake, West Sumatra, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 4026-4032. Fish have a high risk of accumulating metals and poses a risk of entering human bodies through the food chain. This study aims to analyze the concentration of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) spatially and temporally as well as the Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) in endemic fish (Rasbora argyrotaenia) and aquacultured fish (Oreochromis niloticus) in Maninjau Lake and its relationship to environmental parameters (pH, DO and temperature). Sampling was conducted at domestic, hydropower, fish cage, and endemic fisheries. Spatial and temporal distribution using one-way ANOVA with 95% significance, while parameter correlation using linear regression. Almost all heavy metals in both fish samples exceeded the permissible level except in endemic fisheries sites. Metal concentrations in both fish species spatially showed a significant difference, while temporally showed no significant difference. Rasbora argyrotaenia showed a slightly higher BCF value than O. niloticus. The BCF values were low accumulative with order Pb>Hg>Cd in R. argyrotaenia and Pb>Cd>Hg for O. niloticus. There is a strong and positive correlation between temperature and the BCF value of both fish species for the three different metals. Monitoring fish by keeping metal content within acceptable limits is necessary. Further research on risk analysis of fish consumption in humans is recommended.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Evapotranspiration in the Upper Minjiang River Basin Based on the SiB2 Model
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The evapotranspiration (ET) in mountainous watersheds affects the security of downstream water supply and ecological safety. Continuous time-varying ET cannot be obtained by traditional methods such as remote sensing and ground observations. In this study, a simple biosphere model 2 (SiB2) was parameterized in a typical mountainous area, the upper Minjiang River, using field observations and remote sensing data. The performance of SiB2 was then assessed by comparing it with direct measurements of the evaporation dishes. The results showed that (1) at the daily scale, the simulated ET was smaller than the measured ET. At the monthly scale, the relative errors between the simulated and measured values ranged from 1.48% to 20.72%. The relative error between the simulated and measured values of the total annual ET is 6.99%; (2) the ET of Minjiang River was characterized by a "bimodal" variation, with lower daily ET from November to February (non-growing season) and higher daily ET from March to August (growing season); (3) the ET of Minjiang River showed the spatial characteristics of low in the northwest and high in the southeast, with a high-value center located in Dujiangyan City. In summary, SiB2 is suitable for simulating ET in mountainous watersheds with spatial and temporal continuity. This study can contribute to the enhancement of water resources use planning and basin management in the upper Minjiang River.

TI  - Analysis of Space-Borne GPS Data Quality and Evaluation of Precise Orbit Determination for COSMIC-2 Mission Based on Reduced Dynamic Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - COSMIC-2 is a remote sensing satellite mission that mainly provides scientific data for weather forecasting, ionosphere, and climate research. High precise orbit is the basis for the application of remote sensing satellite data. In order to realize the precise orbit determination (POD) of COSMIC-2, we have assessed the quality of space-borne GPS observation in detail, including the utilization of GPS observations, cycle slip ratio (o/slps), multipath error, single-noise ratio (SNR) and ionospheric delay rate (IOD) of the data, realized the POD of COSMIC-2 with the reduced dynamic (RD) method, and evaluated the accuracy of the solved orbit by means of the carrier-phase residual, overlapping orbit comparison and the reference orbit comparison. The data quality assessments show that the data is less affected by the multipath effect, the utilization of the data is low, cycle slips occur frequently, and the carrier-phase data is often interrupted. The POD results indicate that the root mean square (RMS) values of the carrier-phase residuals of six COSMIC-2 satellites are between 6.0 mm and 7.5 mm, The mean RMS values of the overlapping orbit are better than 0.92 cm, 1.33 cm and 1.03 cm in the radial (R), tangential (T) and normal (N) directions respectively, and the mean RMS values of the six satellites in the 3D direction are between 1.38 cm and 1.75 cm. The mean RMS values in R, T and N directions orbit determination accuracy of the reference orbit comparison are better than 5.61 cm, 6.59 cm and 2.29 cm respectively, and the mean RMS values of the six satellites in the 3D direction are between 7.35 cm and 8.79 cm.

TI  - Assessing land surface phenology in Araucaria-Nothofagus forests in Chile with Landsat 8/Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Araucaria-Nothofagus forests are a unique ecosystem in temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina. They include red-listed species and have a high cultural importance for the ancestral population and thus require continuous monitoring to support conservation. Monitoring of phenology by satellite observations is a key tool to quantify the impact of climate variability on terrestrial vegetation. Here we aim to provide a first quantification and ecological understanding of the land surface phenology of protected Araucaria-Nothofagus forests in the Conguillio National Park in southern Chile. We exploit time series of enhanced vegetation index from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from 2016 to 2020 to derive start and end-of-season (SOS and EOS) information at 10 x 10 m spatial resolution. Results show that, on average, SOS varies between 11th October and 5th November (quantiles 25% and 75% of all pixels). SOS occurs later at higher elevation, in sparsely vegetated stands, or in stands dominated by Nothofagus antarctica. EOS occurs on average between 24th March and 14th April. EOS shows a high variability between neighboring pixels that cannot be easily associated with forest stands or topography. Comparisons with regional-aggregated temperature and precipitation time series show that SOS is delayed with colder winter and spring temperatures and EOS shows stronger (but contrasting) correlations with summer and fall precipitation. By using a machine learning approach, we find that elevation is the main control on the spatial-temporal variability of SOS and EOS, followed by aspect, slope and total tree cover. These results suggest that meteorological conditions control the inter-annual variability of the phenology of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests but the effect is modified by small-scale topography, climate and stand characteristics.

TI  - BPG-Based Automatic Lossy Compression of Noisy Images with the Prediction of an Optimal Operation Existence and Its Parameters
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - With a resolution improvement, the size of modern remote sensing images increases. This makes it desirable to compress them, mostly by using lossy compression techniques. Often the images to be compressed (or some component images of multichannel remote sensing data) are noisy. The lossy compression of such images has several peculiarities dealing with specific noise filtering effects and evaluation of the compression technique's performance. In particular, an optimal operation point (OOP) may exist where quality of a compressed image is closer to the corresponding noise-free (true) image than the uncompressed (original, noisy) image quality, according to certain criterion (metrics). In such a case, it is reasonable to automatically compress an image under interest in the OOP neighborhood, but without having the true image at disposal in practice, it is impossible to accurately determine if the OOP does exist. Here we show that, by a simple and fast preliminary analysis and pre-training, it is possible to predict the OOPs existence and the metric values in it with appropriate accuracy. The study is carried out for a better portable graphics (BPG) coder for additive white Gaussian noise, focusing mainly on one-component (grayscale) images. The results allow for concluding that prediction is possible for an improvement (reduction) in the quality metrics of PSNR and PSNR-HVS-M. In turn, this allows for decision-making about the existence or absence of an OOP. If an OOP is absent, a more "careful" compression is recommended. Having such rules, it then becomes possible to carry out the compression automatically. Additionally, possible modifications for the cases of signal-dependent noise and the joint compression of three-component images are considered and the possible existence of an OOP for these cases is demonstrated.

TI  - Fluid Migration through Permafrost and the Pool of Greenhouse Gases in Frozen Soils of an Oil and Gas Field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions originate from the biodegradation of organic matter of soils and of degrading permafrost in the Arctic. However, there is limited evidence of the activity of geological sources, and little understanding of the pathways of migration of gaseous fluids through the porous mineral matrix filled with ice. We estimated the effect of geological factors on the winter storage of the greenhouse gases in frozen soils by statistical analysis of the geodatabase, which combined a field gas survey of frozen soils, subsurface sounding, and remote sensing data. Frozen soils stored on average 0.016 g CH4 m(-3) and 11.5 g CO2 m(-3). Microseeps, recognized by isolated anomalies of helium, had 30% higher CH4 concentrations. Lineaments marking margins of tectonic blocks were estimated to have 300% higher CH4 concentrations. High concentrations of propane and ethane indicated the contribution of diffuse fluid flow from hydrocarbon-bearing beds on 95% of the 130 km(2) study area. In addition to the fluid contribution, we estimated an overwintering pool of greenhouse gases in frozen soil for the first time. Being at least 0.01-0.1% of the soil organic matter mass, these gaseous forms of carbon can be critical for the early-summer Arctic ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Fluorescent Molecular Imaging Can Improve Intraoperative Sentinel Margin Detection in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In head and neck cancer, a major limitation of current intraoperative margin analysis is the ability to detect areas most likely to be positive based on specimen palpation, especially for larger specimens where sampling error limits detection of positive margins. This study aims to prospectively examine the clinical value of fluorescent molecular imaging to accurately identify "the sentinel margin," the point on a specimen at which the tumor lies closest to the resected edge in real-time during frozen section analysis. Methods: Eighteen patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled into a prospective clinical trial and infused intravenously with 50mg of panitumumab-IRDye 800CW 1-5d before surgery. Resected specimens were imaged in a closed-field near-infrared optical imaging systemin near real-time, and custom-designed software was used to identify locations of highest fluorescence on deep and peripheral margins. The surgeon identified the sentinel margin masked to optical specimen mapping, and then the regions of highest fluorescence were identified and marked for frozen analysis. Final pathology based on specimen reconstruction was used as reference standard. Results: Resected specimens were imaged in the operating room, and fluorescence had a higher interobserver agreement with pathology (Cohen kappa value 0.96) than the surgeon (Cohen k value of 0.82) for the location of the closest margin. Plotting margin distance at the predicted sentinel margin location of each observer versus the actual closest margin distance at pathology demonstrated best correlation between fluorescence and pathology (R-2 = 0.98) with surgeon (R-2 = 0.75). Conclusion: Fluorescence imaging can improve identification of the sentinel margin in head and neck cancer resections, holding promise for rapid identification of positive margins and improved oncologic outcomes.

TI  - Estimation of genetic and phenotypic parameters for body condition score, milk yield and milk composition, and factors affecting related traits during the first 150 days of lactation in Holstein cows
T2  - LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to estimate the genetic and phenotypic parameters for BCS, milk yield and its composition in Holstein cows. The data were collected in the first 150 days in milk (DIM) of 317 Holstein cows calved between 2017 and 2018 raised at a private dairy cattle farm located in Kirsehir of Turkey. In this study, parity and DIM were included as fixed factors in the model. The cows were grouped according to their BCS: low (BCS <= 2.50), moderate (BCS=2.75-3.00) and high (BCS >= 3.25). The results showed that effects of parity and DIM on BCS, test-day milk yield (TDMY), solids-non-fat (SNF), protein content (PC), lactose (LACT), fat yield (FY) and protein yield (PY) were significantly important (P<0.05), whereas fat content (FC) was not. The highest TDMY, FY and PY were determined in cows with low BCS. FC, SNF, PC and LACT were the highest in cows with high BCS compared to those with low BCS and moderate BCS. The estimated heritability were 0.188, 0.301, 0.184, 0.197, 0.194, 0.223, 0.196 and 0.342 for BCS, TDMY, FC, SNF, PC, LACT, FY and PY, respectively. Repeatability for these traits was estimated to vary from 0.257 to 0.521. Genetic correlations between BCS and milk yield traits were generally low and ranged from -0.175 to 0.191. Low to moderate phenotypic correlations were also observed between BCS and milk yield traits (-0.234 to 0.217). Despite estimated low heritability and correlations during the early lactation period in our study, these results showed that cows with lower BCS had higher milk yield and lower milk contents, and selection programs including BCS will lead to slight improvements of milk yield traits in Holstein cows.

TI  - Etiological Surveillance of Male Urethritis Syndrome in South Africa: 2019 to 2020
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In South Africa, male urethritis syndrome (MUS) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndrome in men. We determined the distribution of STI etiologies and the susceptibility profiles of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from men presenting with MUS to 3 sentinel surveillance health care facilities. Secondary objectives were to determine the seroprevalence of coinfections (HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus 2). Methods Consecutive, consenting men with symptomatic urethral discharge were enrolled between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Genital discharge swab and blood specimens were collected and transported to a central STI reference laboratory in Johannesburg, South Africa. Results Among 769 men enrolled, N. gonorrhoeae was the commonest cause of MUS (674 [87.8%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 85.2%-89.9%), followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (161 [21.0%]; 95% CI, 18.2%-24.0%). Of 542 cultivable N. gonorrhoeae isolates, all were susceptible to ceftriaxone (modal minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.004 mg/L) and azithromycin (modal minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.128 mg/L). Seroprevalence rates of HIV, syphilis, and HSV-2 were 21.4% (95% CI, 18.5%-24.5%), 2.3%, and 50.1%, respectively. Condom use at last sexual encounter was reported by only 7%, less than 50% had been medically circumcised, and only 66.7% (58 of 87) who self-reported an HIV-positive status were adherent on antiretroviral drugs. Conclusions Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis were the predominant causes of MUS. Currently recommended dual ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy are appropriate for MUS syndromic management; however, surveillance must be maintained to timeously detect emerging and increasing gonococcal resistance. Clinic-based interventions must be intensified in men seeing sexual health care to reduce the community transmission and burden of STI and HIV.

TI  - Etiological Surveillance of Vaginal Discharge Syndrome in South Africa: 2019 to 2020
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The syndromic management of vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) is challenging because of the prevalence of mixed infection with sexually transmitted infection (STI) pathogens and non-STI causes, such as bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis (CA). We aimed to determine the relative prevalence of VDS etiologies in women presenting to sentinel primary health care clinics in South Africa. Secondary objectives were to ascertain the predictive value of speculum findings for the presence of STI pathogens and the proportion of women presenting with clinical features of CA who had identifiable yeast on vaginal smear microscopy. Methods Consecutive, consenting women with complaints of abnormal vaginal discharge were enrolled between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Genital discharge swab and blood specimens were collected and transported to a central STI reference laboratory in Johannesburg. Results A total of 364 women were enrolled at 3 sentinel sites. Bacterial vaginosis was the most common cause of VDS (163 of 361 [45.2%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 40.1%-50.3%); however, a significant proportion had STI coinfection (71 of 163 [43.6%]; 95% CI, 35.8%-51.5%). The predominant STI etiology was Chlamydia trachomatis (73 [20.2%]; 95% CI, 16.4%-24.7%). An abnormal speculum finding had poor predictive value for STIs, and Gram stain microscopy showed yeast in only 37.2% of vaginal smears from women with CA symptoms. Conclusions Bacterial vaginosis is the predominant cause of VDS in South Africa; however, STI coinfection is common. Clinical findings are poorly predictive of STI etiologies or candidiasis; therefore, a rapid and accurate STI point-of-care test would be useful in optimizing VDS management.

TI  - Etiological Surveillance of Genital Ulcer Syndrome in South Africa: 2019 to 2020
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been the leading cause of genital ulcer syndrome (GUS) in South Africa for more than a decade, and acyclovir therapy is incorporated into syndromic management guidelines. We conducted surveillance at 3 sentinel sites to define the common sexually transmitted etiologies of GUS and to determine whether current syndromic management is appropriate. Secondary objectives of surveillance were to determine the seroprevalence of coinfections (HIV, syphilis, HSV-2) in persons presenting with GUS. Methods Consecutive, consenting adult men and women presenting with visible genital ulceration were enrolled between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Genital ulcer swab and blood specimens were collected and transported to a central sexually transmitted infection reference laboratory in Johannesburg. Results Among 190 participants with GUS, HSV-2 was the most frequently detected ulcer pathogen (49.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41.9%-56.1%). The relative prevalence of the second most common ulcer-derived pathogen, Treponema pallidum, was 26.3% (95% CI, 20.5%-33.1%), with 90% of primary syphilis cases having a positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer. Male sex was independently associated with primary syphilis compared with herpetic ulcers, after adjusting for the effect of casual sex partners and other exposures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.35-9.21; P = 0.010). The overall HIV prevalence among participants was 41.3% (78 of 189; 95% CI, 34.2%-48.6%). Conclusions Herpes simplex virus 2 remains the predominant cause of GUS, justifying the continued use of acyclovir in syndromic guidelines. Adequate supplies of benzathine penicillin G for syphilis treatment are essential at primary health care level, in addition to the provision of syphilis and HIV risk reduction services.

TI  - Integrating Semi-Supervised Learning with an Expert System for Vegetation Cover Classification Using Sentinel-2 and RapidEye Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In complex classification tasks, such as the classification of heterogeneous vegetation covers, the high similarity between classes can confuse the classification algorithm when assigning the correct class labels to unlabelled samples. To overcome this problem, this study aimed to develop a classification method by integrating graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) and an expert system (ES). The proposed method was applied to vegetation cover classification in a wetland in the Netherlands using Sentinel-2 and RapidEye imagery. Our method consisted of three main steps: object-based image analysis (OBIA), integration of SSL and an ES (SSLES), and finally, random forest classification. The generated image objects and the related features were used to construct the graph in SSL. Then, an independently developed and trained ES was used in the labelling stage of SSL to reduce the uncertainty of the process, before the final classification. Different spectral band combinations of Sentinel-2 were then considered to improve the vegetation classification. Our results show that integrating SSL and an ES can result in significantly higher classification accuracy (83.6%) compared to a supervised classifier (64.9%), SSL alone (71.8%), and ES alone (69.5%). Moreover, utilisation of all Sentinel-2 red-edge spectral band combinations yielded the highest classification accuracy (overall accuracy of 83.6% with SSLES) compared to the inclusion of other band combinations. The results of this study indicate that the utilisation of an ES in the labelling process of SSL improves the reliability of the process and provides robust performance for the classification of vegetation cover.

TI  - A New Perspective on Regulation of Pituitary Plasticity: The Network of SOX2-Positive Cells May Coordinate Responses to Challenge
T2  - ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Plasticity of function is required for each of the anterior pituitary endocrine axes to support alterations in the demand for hormone with physiological status and in response to environmental challenge. This plasticity is mediated at the pituitary level by a change in functional cell mass resulting from a combination of alteration in the proportion of responding cells, the amount of hormone secreted from each cell, and the total number of cells within an endocrine cell population. The functional cell mass also depends on its organization into structural and functional networks. The mechanisms underlying alteration in gland output depend on the strength of the stimulus and are axis dependent but in all cases rely on sensing of output of the functional cell mass and its regulation. Here, we present evidence that the size of pituitary cell populations is constrained and suggest this is mediated by a form of quorum sensing. We propose that pituitary cell quorum sensing is mediated by interactions between the networks of endocrine cells and hormone-negative SOX2-positive (SOX2+ve) cells and speculate that the latter act as both a sentinel and actuator of cell number. Evidence for a role of the network of SOX2+ve cells in directly regulating secretion from multiple endocrine cell networks suggests that it also regulates other aspects of the endocrine cell functional mass. A decision-making role of SOX2+ve cells would allow precise coordination of pituitary axes, essential for their appropriate response to physiological status and challenge, as well as prioritization of axis modification.

TI  - Understanding Errors in Cloud Liquid Water Path Retrievals Derived from <i>CloudSat</i> Path-Integrated Attenuation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm that derives the nonprecipitating cloud liquid water path W-cld from CloudSat using a surface reference technique (SRT) is presented. The uncertainty characteristics of the SRT are evaluated. It is demonstrated that an accurate analytical formulation for the pixel-scale precision can be derived. The average precision of the SRT is estimated to be 34 g m(-2) at the individual pixel scale; however, precision systematically decreases from around 30 to 40 g m(-2) as cloud fraction varies from 0% to 100%. The retrievals of clear-sky W-cld have a mean bias of 0.9 g m(-2). Output from a large-eddy simulation coupled to a radar simulator shows that an additional bias of -8% may result from nonuniformity within the footprint of cloudy pixels. The retrieval yield for the SRT, measured relative to all warm clouds over ocean between 60 degrees N and 60 degrees S latitude is 43%. The SRT W-cld is compared with one estimate of W-cld from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using an adiabatic cloud profile and an effective radius derived from 3.7-mu m reflectance. A strong correlation between the mean MODIS W-cld and SRT W-cld is found across diverse cloud regimes, but with biases in the mean W-cld that are cloud-regime dependent. Overall, the mean bias of the SRT relative to MODIS is -13.1 g m(-2). Systematic underestimates of W-cld by the SRT resulting from nonuniform beamfilling cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the retrieval bias.

T2  - ANNALS OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE-ARM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To compare the biomechanical properties of the glenohumeral joint capsule between adhesive capsulitis (AC) after breast cancer surgery and idiopathic AC and demonstrate the effects of hydrodilatation (HD) with corticosteroid injection for AC after breast cancer surgery.Methods Twenty-three prospective patients with AC after breast cancer surgery (BC group) and 44 retrospective patients with idiopathic AC without breast cancer (CON group) underwent HD with corticosteroid injection and home exercise training. We compared their biomechanical characteristics (capsular capacity, maximal pressure, and capsular stiffness). In the BC group, the passive range of motion (ROM) of the affected shoulder and a questionnaire (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index [SPADI]) were evaluated at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment.Results The BC group showed higher biomechanical characteristics (maximal pressure and capsular stiffness ) than did the CON group. The mean maximal pressure and capsular stiffness were 519.67 +/- 120.90 mmHg and 19.69 +/- 10.58 mmHg/mL in the BC group and 424.78 +/- 104.42 mmHg and 11.55 +/- 7.77 mmHg/mL in the CON group (p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively). And, the BC group showed significant improvements in all ROMs (abduction, flexion, and external rotation) and the SPADI pain and disability sub-scores following the treatment.Conclusion The glenohumeral joint capsular stiffness was greater in the patients with AC after breast cancer surgery than in those with idiopathic AC. HD with corticosteroid injection was effective in treating AC after breast cancer surgery.

TI  - Spatio-temporal contamination of microplastics in shellfish farming regions: A case study
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal pattern of microplastics (MPs) contamination of the French littoral area of the Pertuis Charentais, one of the main French shellfish production regions, was assessed for the first time, between May 2019 and May 2020 at four different sites. The reference site was located at "Ile de R ' e" and the other sites were located in the estuaries of the S`evre Niortaise, Charente and Seudre rivers. Both blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas), that are considered sentinel species for the quality of the marine environment were analysed, along with sediment and seawater samples. MPs were extracted from each sample, counted, measured and sorted by colour and type. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the proportion of confirmed MPs and the polymer types. The results showed that the contamination of mussels by fibres and fragments (1.9 +/- 2.1 MPs/g ww) was significantly higher than for oysters (0.4 +/- 0.4 MPs/g ww). Specifically, the contamination by fibres in both species was significantly greater than the contamination by fragments. Significant variations of MPs contamination were observed across the seasons and sites in bivalves, and depended on the species and the type of MPs (fibres or fragments). Mean concentrations of MPs measured in water and sediment were 0.007 MPs/L and 210 MPs/kg dw, respectively. Finally, blue was the dominant colour for fibres (79 %) and fragments (81 %). Blue fragments were mainly made of PS (70 %) followed by PC (18 %) and PP, PA or PLA (3 %) whereas blue fibres were mainly made of PA (80 %) followed by PET (13 %) or PP (7 %). This rare environmental case study of long-term chronic exposure of farming areas to MPs provides new knowledge on in situ variations of plastic fibres and fragments contamination throughout the seasons.

TI  - A Dual-Attention Mechanism Deep Learning Network for Mesoscale Eddy Detection by Mining Spatiotemporal Characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies are a mechanism for ocean energy transfer, and identifying them on a global scale provides a means of exploring ocean mass and energy exchange between ocean basins. There are many widely used model-driven methods for detecting mesoscale eddies; however, these methods are not fully robust or generalizable. This study applies a data-driven method and proposes a mesoscale detection network based on the extraction of eddy-related spatiotemporal information from multisource remote sensing data. Focusing on the northwest Pacific, the study first analyzes mesoscale eddy characteristics using a combination of gridded data for the absolute dynamic topography (ADT), sea surface temperature (SST), and absolute geostrophic velocity (UVG). Then, a deep learning network with a dual-attention mechanism and a convolutional long short-term memory module is proposed, which can deeply exploit spatiotemporal feature relevance while encoding and decoding information in the gridded data. Based on the analysis of mesoscale eddy characteristics, ADT and UVG gridded data are selected to be the inputs for the detection network. The experiments show that the accuracy of the proposed network reaches 93.38%, and the weighted mean dice coefficient reaches 0.8918, which is a better score than those achieved by some of the detection networks proposed in previous studies, including U-Net, SymmetricNet, and ResU-Net. Moreover, compared with the model-driven approach used to generate the ground-truth dataset, the network method proposed here demonstrates better performance in detecting mesoscale eddies at smaller scales, partially addressing the problem of ghost eddies.

TI  - Inversion and Driving Force Analysis of Nutrient Concentrations in the Ecosystem of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Bay Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although satellite remote sensing technology is intensively used for the monitoring of water quality, the inversion of coastal water bodies and non-optically active parameters is still a challenging issue. Few ongoing studies use remote sensing technology to analyze the driving forces of changes in water quality from multiple aspects based on inversion results. By the use of Landsat 5/8 imagery and measured in situ data of the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Bay area from 1986 to 2020, this study evaluated the modeling effects of four machine learning methods named Tree Embedding (TE), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The results show that the BPNN creates the most reliable and robust results. The values of the obtained correlation coefficients (r) are 0.83, 0.92, 0.84, and 0.90, and that of the coefficients of determination (R-2) are 0.70, 0.84, 0.70, and 0.81. The calculated mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 0.41, 0.16, 0.06, and 0.02, while the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.78, 0.29, 0.12, and 0.03. The concentrations of TN and TP (C-TN, C-TP) in the Shenzhen Bay, the Starling Inlet, and the Tolo Harbor were relatively high, fluctuated from 1986 to 2010, and decreased significantly after 2010. The C-TN and C-TP in the Mirs Bay kept continuously at a low level. We found that urbanization and polluted river discharges were the main drivers of spatial and inter-annual differences of C-TN and C-TP. Temperature, precipitation, and wind are further factors that influenced the intra-annual changes of C-TN and C-TP in the Shenzhen Bay, whilethe expansion of oyster rafts and mangroves had little effect. Our research confirms that machine learning algorithms are well suited for the inversion of non-optical activity parameters of coastal water bodies, and also shows the potential of remote sensing for large-scale, long-term monitoring of water quality and the subsequent comprehensive analysis of the driving forces.

TI  - Crop Classification Based on GDSSM-CNN Using Multi-Temporal RADARSAT-2 SAR with Limited Labeled Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification is an important part of crop management and yield estimation. In recent years, neural networks have made great progress in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) crop classification. However, the insufficient number of labeled samples limits the classification performance of neural networks. In order to solve this problem, a new crop classification method combining geodesic distance spectral similarity measurement and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (GDSSM-CNN) is proposed in this study. The method consisted of: (1) the geodesic distance spectral similarity method (GDSSM) for obtaining similarity and (2) the one-dimensional convolutional neural network model for crop classification. Thereinto, a large number of training data are extracted by GDSSM and the generalized volume scattering model which is based on radar vegetation index (GRVI), and then classified by 1D-CNN. In order to prove the effectiveness of the GDSSM-CNN method, the GDSSM method and 1D-CNN method are compared in the case of a limited sample. In terms of evaluation and verification of methods, the GDSSM-CNN method has the highest accuracy, with an accuracy rate of 91.2%, which is 19.94% and 23.91% higher than the GDSSM method and the 1D-CNN method, respectively. In general, the GDSSM-CNN method uses a small number of ground measurement samples, and it uses the rich polarity information in multi-temporal fully polarized SAR data to obtain a large number of training samples, which can quickly improve the accuracy of classification in a short time, which has more new inspiration for crop classification.

TI  - Changes in Glaciers and Glacial Lakes in the Bosula Mountain Range, Southeast Tibet, over the past Two Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers and glacial lakes in the Bosula Mountain Range need special attention, because their instability may cause disastrous consequences to the downstream settlements and the Sichuan-Tibet Road. The latter is a pivotal traffic line in the Southeast Tibetan Plateau. In order to investigate the state of glaciers and glacial lakes in the Bosula Mountain Range, we estimated the changes in glacier/glacial lake boundaries, glacier surface elevation, and glacier flow velocity between 2000 and 2021 based on multisource remote sensing data. Our results showed that, from the period 2000-2013 to the period 2013-2021, the average shrinking rate of glacier area increased from 0.99 km(2)/a to 1.74 km(2)/a, and the average expanding rate of glacial lake area increased from 0.04 km(2)/a to 0.06 km(2)/a. From the period 1990-2011 to the period 2015-2019, the average thinning rate of glaciers increased from 0.83 m/a to 1.58 m/a. These results indicate the Bosula Mountain Range is one of the fastest melting glacierized regions in the High Mountain Asia, and the factors that account for this may include quick temperature rise, abundant summer rainfall, and thin debris cover. In spite of strong ice melting, the observed changes in glacier boundaries, surface elevation, and flow velocity show no sign of surge activity, and the frequency of glacier lake outburst has not increased since 1989. Currently, three proglacial lakes that expanded quickly during 2000-2021 are now prominent hazards. They are directly threatened by accidental ice calving and ice avalanche, and their outburst could cause considerable damage to the downstream settlements and the Sichuan-Tibet Road.

TI  - Fusion of optical and SAR images based on deep learning to reconstruct vegetation NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is crucial to many sustainable agricultural practices such as vegetation monitoring and health evaluation. However, optical remote sensing data often suffer from a large amount of missing information due to sensor failures and harsh atmospheric conditions. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers a new approach to filling in missing optical data based on its excessive revisit density and its potential to image without interference from clouds and rain. Due to the difference in imaging mechanisms between SAR and optical sensors, it is very difficult to fuse the data. This paper developed an advanced deep learning Spatio-temporal fusion method, i.e., Transformer Temporal-spatial Model (TTSM), to synergize the SAR and optical time-series to reconstruct vegetation NDVI time series in cloudy regions. The proposed multi-head attention and end-to-end architecture achieved satisfactory accuracy (R-2 greater than 0.88), outperforming the existing deep learning solutions. Extensive experiments were carried out to evaluate the TTSM method on large-scale areas (the spatial scale of megapixels) in northeast China with the main vegetation types of crops and forests. The R-2, SSIM, RMSE, NRMSE, and MAE of our prediction results were 0.88, 0.80, 0.06, 0.16, and 0.05, respectively. The influence of training sample size was investigated through a transfer learning study, and the result indicated that the model had good generalizability. Overall, our proposed method can fill in the gap of optical data at an extensive regional scope over the vegetated area using SAR.

TI  - Near-Surface NO<sub>2</sub> Concentration Estimation by Random Forest Modeling and Sentinel-5P and Ancillary Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a daily model is proposed for estimating the near-surface NO2 concentration in China, combining for the first time the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm with the tropospheric NO2 columns from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TropOMI) satellite and meteorological and NO2 data of surface sites in China for the year 2019. Furthermore, near-surface NO2 concentration data of ground sites during the COVID-19 outbreak from 1-5 February 2020 were used to verify the developed model. The daily model was verified by the ten-fold cross-validation method, revealing a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.78 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.04 mu g/m(3), which are reasonable and also comparable to other published studies. In addition, our model showed that near-surface NO2 in China during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly reduced compared with 2019, and these predictions were in good agreement with reference ground data. Our proposed model can also provide NO2 estimates for areas in western China where there are few ground monitoring sites. Therefore, all in all, our study findings suggest that the model established herein is suitable for estimating the daily NO2 concentration near the surface in China and, as such, can be used if there is a lack of surface sites and/or missing observations in some areas.

TI  - A Study of the Change in Surface Parameters during the Last Four Decades in the MuUs Desert Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of the Earth's environmental system, sandy soils are particularly sensitive to changes in the climatic environment. As one of the four major desert regions in China, the MuUs desert has transformed from a desert to an oasis after more than half a century of ecological management. In this paper, we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of surface albedo, evapotranspiration, and fraction vegetation cover in the MuUs desert based on the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) product with high spatial and temporal resolution and assessed the relationships between their variability and snow cover, air temperature, and precipitation. It is of great significance to understand the effect of desertification control and climate change after the conversion of land surface types in the MuUs region. The results show that the desertification control in the MuUs area has achieved remarkable results since 1982. The fraction vegetation coverage of the MuUs desert showed a significant increasing trend, with an interannual change rate of 1.32% each decade(-1). The surface albedo of MuUs desert decreased significantly. Affected by vegetation and snow cover, it was lower in summer and higher in winter. The evapotranspiration showed a significant upward trend, higher in summer and lower in winter, which is significantly correlated with the changes in surface albedo, air temperature, and vegetation. In addition, the local-scale biophysical effects caused by vegetation change have influenced the climate of the MuUs region, manifested as the increase in precipitation and air temperature. In general, with the support of relevant policies and human construction projects, the overall ecological environment in the MuUs desert is developing in a good way.

TI  - Improving Remote Estimation of Vegetation Phenology Using GCOM-C/SGLI Land Surface Reflectance Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology not only describes the life cycle events of periodic plants during the growing season but also acts as an indicator of biological responses to climate change. Satellite monitoring of vegetation phenology can capture the spatial patterns of vegetation dynamics at global scales. However, the existing satellite products of global vegetation phenology still show uncertainties in estimating phenological metrices, especially for dormancy onset. The Second-Generation Global Imager (SGLI) onboard the satellite Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) that launched in 2017 provides a new opportunity to improve the estimation of global vegetation phenology with a spatial resolution of 250 m. In this study, SGLI land surface reflectance data were employed to estimate the green-up and dormancy dates for different vegetation types based on a relative threshold method, in which a snow-free vegetation index (i.e., the normalized difference greenness index, NDGI) was adopted. The validation results show that there are significant agreements between the trajectories of the SGLI-based NDGI and the near-surface green color coordinate index (GCC) at the PhenoCam sites with different vegetation types. The SGLI-based estimation of the green-up dates slightly outperformed that of the existing MODIS and VIIRS phenology products, with an RMSE and R-2 of 11.0 days and 0.71, respectively. In contrast, the estimation of the dormancy dates based on the SGLI data yielded much higher accuracies than the MODIS and VIIRS products, with an RMSE decreased from >23.8 days to 15.6 days, and R-2 increased from <0.51 to 0.72. These results suggest that GCOM-C/SGLI data have the potential to generate improved monitoring of global vegetation phenology in the future.

TI  - Characterization of Aquifer System and Groundwater Storage Change Due to South-to-North Water Diversion Project at Huairou Groundwater Reserve Site, Beijing, China, Using Geodetic and Hydrological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater overexploitation is a critical issue in the North China Plain (NCP), resulting in groundwater level decline and surface subsidence for the last half-century. This problem, however, has been greatly alleviated by the South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) Project since 2015. Monitoring of this process has been steadily improved in recent years using water level and geodetic observations. Here, we characterize the water storage change at the Huairou groundwater reserve site (HGRS) in Beijing due to the SNWD by combining Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data of the Sentinel-1 satellites, continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) data, and well water level data observed during the same time. InSAR observations revealed subsidence up to similar to 400 mm in the Beijing plain but uplift at similar to 40 mm in the HGRS during 2015-2019, and more than 70% of the uplift occurred from October 2018 to January 2019. By integrating the most significant uplift deformation during October 2018 to January 2019 with water level observations at the same time, we estimated the storativity of the confined aquifer system at HGRS as 1.68-7.82 x 10(-3), weighing in the correction for effective stress and surface deformation for various situations. Based on the estimated aquifer storativity and the observed water level change in the unconfined and confined aquifer, the recharged water storage for the confined and unconfined aquifers was estimated as 1.20-1.39 x 10(7) m(3) and similar to 2.86 x 10(8) m(3) from 6 October 2018 to 22 January 2019, respectively, which is about 4% and 91% of the surface water recharge through river channels in the same period due to the SNWD Project. Our study demonstrates that integration of geodetic and hydrological data can provide crucial information for the assessment of groundwater circulation and assistance of groundwater management.

TI  - Monitoring Land Vegetation from Geostationary Satellite Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments have been widely used to monitor the condition of surface vegetation. Since the polar-orbiting satellite provides limited daily samples on surface, a completed spatial coverage of land vegetation is often relied on over multiple days of observations. In this study, observations from the Japanese geostationary satellite imager Advanced Himawari Imagers (AHI) are used to derive the surface vegetation index. The AHI reflectance at visible and near-infrared bands are first corrected to the surface reflectance by using the 6S radiative transfer model. The AHI surface reflectance from various viewing angles and solar geometry is further normalized to form an angular-independent reflectance by using a BRDF model. Finally, the surface vegetation index is calculated and synthesized from the daytime AHI data. It is found that the high-frequency AHI observations can significantly reduce the impact of clouds on compositing land NDVI and require a shorter time for a complete coverage of surface conditions. Also, a single NDVI image from AHI exhibits spatial distribution similar to that from 16 days of MODIS data.

TI  - Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) Atmospheric Sounding System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles are essential for weather forecasts and research. Satellite-based hyperspectral infrared observations are meaningful in detecting atmospheric profiles, especially over oceans where conventional observations can seldom be used. In this study, a HIRAS (Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder) Atmospheric Sounding System (HASS) was introduced, which retrieves atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles using a one-dimension variational scheme based on HIRAS observations. A total of 274 channels were optimally selected from the entire HIRAS spectrum through information entropy analyses, and a group of retrieval experiments were independently performed for different HIRAS fields of views (FOVs). Compared with the ECMWF reanalysis data version-5 (ERA5), the RMSEs of temperature (relative humidity) for low-, mid-, and high-troposphere layers were 1.5 K (22.3%), 1.0 K (33.2%), and 1.3 K (38.5%), respectively, which were similar in magnitude to those derived from other hyperspectral infrared sounders. Meanwhile, the retrieved temperature RMSEs with respect to the satellite radio occultation (RO) products increased to 1.7 K, 1.8 K, and 1.9 K for the low-, mid-, and high-troposphere layers, respectively, which could be attributed to the accurate RO temperature products in the upper atmospheres. It was also found that the RMSE varied with the FOVs and latitude, which may be caused by the current angle-dependent bias correction and unique background profiles.

TI  - CIVIL AIRCRAFT ASSISTED SPACE-AIR-GROUND INTEGRATED NETWORKS: AN INNOVATIVE NTN OF 5G AND BEYOND
T2  - IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To realize global coverage of 5G, non-terrestrial networks (NTN) is proposed as an vital solution. Satellite based NTN has high communication latency and limited performance. Aerial NTN needs to launch too many airborne communication platforms, which is expensive. Aiming at the problems existing in the classic NTN architecture, civil aircraft assisted space-air-ground integrated network (CAA-SAGIN) is proposed. CAA-SAGIN consists of civil aircrafts and satellites. Civil aircrafts carry airborne base stations, which provide services for users along the route while carrying out tasks. CAA-SAGIN ensures the global coverage of the network, and uses civil aircrafts to provide high throughput and low latency services for hot spot areas. Through the coverage analysis and link budget, the full coverage of CAA-SAGIN for hot spot areas and the reduction of transmission loss are determined. Finally, as an inspiration, the open issues and challenges in the new architecture are summarized.

TI  - A Factor Analysis Backpropagation Neural Network Model for Vegetation Net Primary Productivity Time Series Estimation in Western Sichuan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (VNPP) is the main factor in ecosystem carbon sink function and regulation of environmental processes. However, NPP data products have data missing in some areas, which affects the availability and overall accuracy level of data. Therefore, we adopted the Factor Analysis Backpropagation neural network model (FA-BP model) to acquire a high-accuracy and high-reliability NPP result without missing or empty areas by using a series of easily accessible datasets, such as meteorological data and remote sensing data. We selected the western Sichuan region as the study area and carried out a VNPP time series estimation from 2000 to 2016. Comparative simulations also verify the accuracy of the time series estimation results: The Pearson correlation r of VNPP prediction results ranged from 0.807 to 0.917, the mean absolute error ranged from 29.1 to 38.9, the root mean square error was between 37.3 and 51.8, and the mean relative error varies from 0.10 to 0.14. Further analysis shows that the spatial pattern of estimated VNPP during the past 17 years in western Sichuan shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest. Besides, the VNPP time series is generally on an upward trend in this period. The increasing and decreasing areas of VNPP values in the study area accounted for 81.42% and 18.58%, respectively. Moreover, we find that temperature dominates the change of VNPP in the whole western Sichuan region. The data processing method and experimental results presented in this paper can provide a reference for accurately acquiring VNPP and related studies on natural resources and climate change.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation of Long-Term Total Suspended Matter Concentration from Landsat across Lake Qinghai
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is one of the most widely used water quality parameters, which can influence the light transmission process, planktonic algae, and ecological health. A comprehensive field expedition aiming at water quality assessment was conducted for Lake Qinghai in September 2019. The in-situ measurements were used to support the calibration and validation of TSM concentration using Landsat images. A regional empirical model was established using the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of Landsat image data at the red band with a wavelength range of 640-670 nm. The coefficient of determination (R-2), mean relative error (MRE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of the TSM estimation model were 0.81, 17.91%, and 0.61 mg/L, respectively. The model was further applied to 87 images during the periods from 1986 to 2020. A significant correlation was found between TSM concentration and daily wind speed (r = 0.74, p < 0.01, n = 87), which revealed the dominance of wind speed on TSM concentration. In addition, hydrological changes also had a significant influence on TSM variations of lake estuaries.

TI  - The Importance of Adding Short-Wave Infrared Bands for Forest Disturbance Monitoring in the Subtropical Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance, such as harvest and fire, can cause a huge amount of carbon emission from soil to the atmosphere. Monitoring forest disturbance at a high spatial resolution is critical for soil carbon modeling. The short-wave infrared bands are important bands in monitoring forest disturbance. However, many high spatial resolution satellites do not contain the short-wave infrared bands in their band designs, and whether the lack of short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands will cause a large influence on forest disturbance monitoring remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the values of adding SWIR bands in forest disturbance monitoring using the modified continuous monitoring of land disturbance (COLD) approach. Results showed that without the SWIR bands the accuracy of detecting forest disturbance will be reduced by 19-26%. The highest accuracy of modified COLD using the optimal band combination with SWIR bands was 76.3% for monitoring harvest and 86.6% for monitoring fire, while it decreased to 49.8% in detecting harvest and 67.6% in detecting fire without using any SWIR bands. The results demonstrated the importance of adding SWIR bands in forest disturbance monitoring and would guide users to select the satellite data with at least one SWIR band to monitor forest disturbance for improving the soil carbon modeling.

TI  - Deriving Urban Boundaries of Henan Province, China, Based on Sentinel-2 and Deep Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate urban boundary data can directly reflect the expansion of urban space, help us accurately grasp the scale and form of urban space, and play a vital role in urban land development and policy-making. However, the lack of reliable multiscale and high-precision urban boundary data products and relevant training datasets has become one of the major factors hindering their application. The purpose of this study is to combine Sentinel-2 remote-sensing images and supplementary geographic data to generate a reliable high-precision urban boundary dataset for Henan Province (called HNUB2018). First, this study puts forward a clear definition of "urban boundary". Using this concept as its basis, it proposes a set of operable urban boundary delimitation rules and technical processes. Then, based on Sentinel-2 remote-sensing images and supplementary geographic data, the urban boundaries of Henan Province are delimited by a visual interpretation method. Finally, the applicability of the dataset is verified by using a classical semantic segmentation deep learning model. The results show that (1) HNUB2018 has clear and rich detailed features as well as a detailed spatial structure of urban boundaries. The overall accuracy of HNUB2018 is 92.82% and the kappa coefficient reaches 0.8553, which is better than GUB (Henan) in overall accuracy. (2) HNUB2018 is well suited for deep learning, with excellent reliability and scientific validity. The research results of this paper can provide data support for studies of urban sprawl monitoring and territorial spatial planning, and will support the development of reliable datasets for fields such as intelligent mapping of urban boundaries, showing prospects and possibilities for wide application in urban research.

TI  - Quantifying the Long-Term MODIS Cloud Regime Dependent Relationship between Aerosol Optical Depth and Cloud Properties over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols modify cloud properties and influence the regional climate. The impacts of aerosols on clouds differ for various cloud types, but their long-term relationships have not been fully characterized on a cloud regime basis. In this study, we quantified the cloud regime-dependent relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud properties over China using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2002 to 2019. Daily clouds in each 1 degrees by 1 degrees grid were categorized into seven cloud regimes based on the "k-means" clustering algorithm. Overall, the cloud height increased, the cloud thickness and liquid water path increased, and the total cloud cover decreased for all cloud regimes during the study period. Linear correlations between AOD and cloud properties were found within stratocumulus, deep convective, and high cloud regimes, showing consistency with the classic aerosol-cloud interaction paradigms. Using stepwise multivariable linear regression, we found that the meteorological factors dominated the variation of cloud top pressure, while AOD dominated the variation of total cloud cover for most cloud regimes. There are regional differences in the main meteorological factors affecting the cloud properties.

TI  - Real-Time Software for the Efficient Generation of the Clumping Index and Its Application Based on the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy clumping index (CI) is a key structural parameter related to vegetation phenology and the absorption of radiation, and it is usually retrieved from remote sensing data based on an empirical relationship with the Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) index. A rapid production software was developed to implement the CI algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to update current CI products and promote the application of CI in different fields. Daily, monthly, and yearly global CI products are continuously generated and updated in real-time by the software. Users can directly download the product or work with CI without paying attention to data generation. For the application case study, a change detection algorithm, LandTrendr, was implemented on the GEE to examine the global CI trend from 2000 to 2020. The results indicate that the area of increase trend (28.7%, Delta CI > 0.02) is greater than that of the decrease trend (17.1%, Delta CI < -0.02). Our work contributes toward the retrieval, application, and validation of CI.

TI  - How Are Land-Use/Land-Cover Indices and Daytime and Nighttime Land Surface Temperatures Related in Eleven Urban Centres in Different Global Climatic Zones?
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the urban thermal environment can enhance humans' well-being. Nevertheless, it was not clear which land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) indices were optimal for explaining land surface temperatures (LSTs) and how they affected LSTs in cities in different climatic zones, especially during the nighttime. Thus, the Aqua /MODIS and Landsat/OLI data were mainly used to explore the optimal indices of building, vegetation, water and bare soil and to analyze their effects on LSTs in eleven urban centers in global distinct climatic regions. Results showed several LU/LC indices had high probabilities of being optimal indices to explain LSTs under different conditions. The daytime LSTs were usually significantly negatively correlated with vegetation indices and positively correlated with building and bare soil indices (p < 0.05). These relationships were stronger in the summer than winter. The nighttime LSTs were usually significantly positively and negatively correlated with building and vegetation indices in the summer, respectively (p < 0.05). These correlations were generally weaker during the nighttime than daytime. The nighttime LSTs were significantly positively and negatively correlated with water and bare soil indices, respectively (p < 0.05). Significant linear multiple regressions commonly existed between daytime and nighttime LSTs and four kinds of LU/LC indices (p < 0.05). These findings helped optimize urban thermal comfort, downscale city LSTs, etc.

TI  - Time-Series Monitoring of Dust-Proof Nets Covering Urban Construction Waste by Multispectral Images in Zhengzhou, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has produced a huge amount of construction waste. The operations and consequences of construction and demolition can lead to windblown dust problems, profoundly affecting the living environment of residents. Fortunately, dust-proof nets have been used in construction sites to reduce and prevent pollution by fine particles such as dust, so it is important to monitor and evaluate their efficacy. In this study, Earth observation techniques were used for the extraction and monitoring of solid waste and dust-proof nets. In order to fully perceive the validity and necessity of dust-proof nets for urban air health, we conducted a case study in Zhengzhou, China. We explored the potential of multispectral remote sensing available for monitoring urban construction waste and proposed a multi-layer classification method to identify construction waste and dust-proof nets based on Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data, with an average identification accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 96.27% and 0.93 for construction waste in the study area from 2015 to 2020, respectively. In addition, our study revealed the driving factors and impact of temporal variations in regional construction waste areas and dust-proof nets coverage. The results indicate the classification can track municipal solid waste management and changes in air pollutant concentrations and is useful for achieving SDG 11.6 (reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management). This study has the potential to monitor construction waste and dust-proof nets, paving the way for better urban environmental governance and surveillance actions in the future, especially involving big data.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote Sensing Ecological Index Based on Soil and Water Conservation on the Effectiveness of Management of Abandoned Mine Landscaping Transformation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Abandoned mines are typical areas of soil erosion. Landscape transformation of abandoned mines is an important means to balance the dual objectives of regional ecological restoration and industrial heritage protection, but the secondary development and construction process of mining relics require long-term monitoring with objective scientific indicators and effective assessment of their management effectiveness. This paper takes Tongluo Mountain Mining Park in Chongqing as an example and uses a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on Landsat-8 image data to assess the spatial and temporal differences in the dynamic changes in the ecological and environmental quality of tertiary relic reserves with different degrees of development and protection in the park. Results showed that: (1) The effect of vegetation cover, which can significantly improve soil and water conservation capacity. (2) The RSEI is applicable to the evaluation of the effectiveness of ecological management of mines with a large amount of bare soil areas. (3) The mean value of the RSEI in the region as a whole increased by 0.090, and the mean values of the RSEI in the primary, secondary and tertiary relic reserves increased by 0.121, 0.112 and 0.006, respectively. (4) The increase in the RSEI in the study area is mainly related to the significant decrease in the dryness index (NDBSI) and the increase in the humidity index (WET). The remote sensing ecological index can objectively reflect the difference in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the ecological environment in tertiary relic protection, and this study provides a theoretical reference for the ecological assessment of secondary development-based management under difficult site conditions.

AB  - The specificity of the process of professional training and formation of future teachers of fine arts is due to the direction of art and pedagogical education, the use of its educational potential. Therefore, in determination of the principles of professional development of teachers of fine arts, the problem of theoretical and methodological understanding of the nature and content of decorative and applied arts in the preparation and professional development is actualized. On the one hand, this applies to how the artistic and aesthetic consciousness of the future teacher will be formed, and on the other - on what basis this teacher will educate his or her students. In accordance with the theoretical aspect of the formation of artistic and pedagogical competence of future teachers of fine arts in the process of studying of decorative and applied arts, a research was conducted. It made it possible to analyze the content, forms, methods and conditions of formation of artistic and pedagogical competence of future artiststeachers. Diagnostic research tools have been developed, which make it possible to identify the level of formation of the main structural components of artistic and pedagogical competence of future teachers of fine arts. The research showed an insufficient level of formation of artistic and pedagogical competence of future teachers of fine arts, which is characterized by a lack of thoroughness and systemness of knowledge in decorative and applied arts, by insufficient development of the emotional and sensual sphere of students and reproductive readiness for professional and creative activities.

TI  - Multiple Object Tracking of Drone Videos by a Temporal-Association Network with Separated-Tasks Structure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The task of multi-object tracking via deep learning methods for UAV videos has become an important research direction. However, with some current multiple object tracking methods, the relationship between object detection and tracking is not well handled, and decisions on how to make good use of temporal information can affect tracking performance as well. To improve the performance of multi-object tracking, this paper proposes an improved multiple object tracking model based on FairMOT. The proposed model contains a structure to separate the detection and ReID heads to decrease the influence between every function head. Additionally, we develop a temporal embedding structure to strengthen the representational ability of the model. By combing the temporal-association structure and separating different function heads, the model's performance in object detection and tracking tasks is improved, which has been verified on the VisDrone2019 dataset. Compared with the original method, the proposed model improves MOTA by 4.9% and MOTP by 1.2% and has better tracking performance than the models such as SORT and HDHNet on the UAV video dataset.

TI  - Offshore Bridge Detection in Polarimetric SAR Images Based on Water Network Construction Using Markov Tree
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to detect bridges in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images due to the inherent speckle noise of SAR images, the interference generated by strong coastal scatterers, and the diversity of bridge and coastal terrain morphologies. In this paper, we present a two-step bridge detection method for polarimetric SAR imagery, in which the probability graph model of a Markov tree is used to build the water network, and bridges are detected by traversing the graph of the water network to determine all adjacent water branch pairs. In the step of the water network construction, candidate water branches are first extracted by using a region-based level set segmentation method. The water network is then built globally as a tree by connecting the extracted water branches based on the probabilistic graph model of a Markov tree, in which a node denotes a single branch and an edge denotes the connection of two adjacent branches. In the step of the bridge detection, all adjacent water branch pairs related to bridges are searched by traversing the constructed tree. Each bridge is finally detected by merging the two contours of the corresponding branch pair. Three polarimetric SAR data acquired by RADARSAT-2 covering Singapore and Lingshui, China, and by TerraSAR-X covering Singapore, are used for testing. The experimental results show that the detection rate, the false alarm rate, and the intersection over union (IoU) between the recognized bridge body and the ground truth are all improved by using the proposed method, compared to the method that constructs a water network based on water branches merging by contour distance.

TI  - Super-Resolution Reconstruction Model of Spatiotemporal Fusion Remote Sensing Image Based on Double Branch Texture Transformers and Feedback Mechanism
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial-temporal resolution plays a vital role in the application of geoscience dynamic observance and prediction. However, thanks to the constraints of technology and budget, it is troublesome for one satellite detector to get high spatial-temporal resolution remote sensing images. Individuals have developed spatiotemporal image fusion technology to resolve this downside, and deep remote sensing images with spatiotemporal resolution have become a possible and efficient answer. Due to the fixed size of the receptive field of convolutional neural networks, the features extracted by convolution operations cannot capture long-range features, so the correlation of global features cannot be modeled in the deep learning process. We propose a spatiotemporal fusion model of remote sensing images to solve these problems based on a dual branch feedback mechanism and texture transformer. The model separates the network from the coarse-fine images with similar structures through the idea of double branches and reduces the dependence of images on time series. It principally merges the benefits of transformer and convolution network and employs feedback mechanism and texture transformer to extract additional spatial and temporal distinction features. The primary function of the transformer module is to learn global temporal correlations and fuse temporal features with spatial features. To completely extract additional elaborated features in several stages, we have a tendency to design a feedback mechanism module. This module chiefly refines the low-level representation through high-level info and obtains additional elaborated features when considering the temporal and spacial characteristics. We have a tendency to receive good results by comparison with four typical spatiotemporal fusion algorithms, proving our model's superiority and robustness.

TI  - Evaluation of Albedo Schemes in WRF Coupled with Noah-MP on the Parlung No. 4 Glacier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological variables (e.g., air temperature (T2), radiation flux, and precipitation) determine the evolution of glacier mass and characteristics. Observations of these variables are not available with adequate spatial coverage and spatiotemporal resolution over the Tibetan Plateau. Albedo is the key factor of net radiation and is determined by the land cover and snow-related variables. This study focuses on evaluating the performance of the albedo parameterization scheme in WRF coupled with Noah-MP in terms of glacio-meteorological variables, by conducting experiments applying the standard surface albedo scheme with the default vegetation and corrected to ice cover and the modified glacial albedo scheme to the Parlung No. 4 Glacier in the 2016 ablation season. In situ glacio-meteorological element observations and MODIS-retrieved albedo are selected to assess the performance of the model. The key results are as follows. First, compared to the air temperature bias of 1.56 degrees C in WRF applying the standard surface albedo scheme and the default vegetation cover, realistic land-use categories considerably reduce the model warm bias on the glacier. The model using realistic land-use categories yields similar T2 diurnal patterns to the observations, with a mean bias of only -0.5 degrees C, no matter which glacial albedo scheme is implemented. Second, the default glacial albedo scheme gives a rather high albedo value of 0.68, causing an apparent underestimation of the net shortwave radiation and net radiation; the modified glacial albedo scheme gives a mean albedo value of 0.35, close to the in situ observations, helping to relieve underestimations of net shortwave radiation and net radiation. Compared with the MODIS albedo of the glacier, WRF applying the default glacial albedo scheme apparently overestimates the albedo with a mean error of 0.18, while WRF applying the modified glacial albedo scheme slightly underestimates the albedo with a mean error of only -0.08. Third, the mean net radiation flux (142 W m(-2)) and high ground heat flux (182 W m(-2)) values that were estimated by WRF applying the corrected land cover and the modified glacial albedo scheme result in the heating of the glacier surface and subsurface, causing ice melt and the liquid water content to increase more quickly and preferentially, equating to an estimated ice thickness decrease of 1 m by mid-June in the ablation region. Our study confirms the ability of the WRF model to reproduce glacio-meteorological variables as long as a reasonable glacial albedo scheme and the corrected land cover is applied and provides a theoretical reference for researchers that are committed to further improvement of the glacial albedo scheme.

TI  - Evaluation of Various Atmospheric Correction Methods in the Processing of Landsat8/OLI Data in Jiaozhou Bay
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In ocean color remote sensing research, it is the key to obtaining the accurate remote sensing reflectance spectrum (R-rs (lambda)) data to retrieve marine biogeophysical parameters from ocean optical satellite data. In practice, R-rs is calculated according to the radiance received by the remote sensing instrument after the correction of atmospheric absorption and scattering and the correction of solar distance and solar elevation angle. Therefore, the atmospheric correction of satellite data is one of the key factors for obtaining accurate water remote sensing reflectance spectral data, which is also an important problem in the research of ocean color remote sensing. Jiaozhou Bay is a semi-closed bay in the west of the Yellow Sea of China and an important representative of the northern temperate zone bay ecosystem. A large range of Marine ranching areas are planned in this sea area, and the water's bio-optical properties are complex. Landsat is the Landsatellite program of NASA in the United States. It was initially developed to observe the land. However, its advantage of high spatial resolution (30 m) is outstanding in Marine remote sensing monitoring, which makes it become one of the data sources that can not be ignored for satellite remote sensing to monitor rivers, lakes, inland bays and other water bodies. Based on the Quality Assurance system-QA Score, we evaluate the results of five atmospheric correction algorithms in processingLandsat8/OLI data in Jiaozhou Bay. Those five atmospheric correction algorithms are NASA's ( National Aeronautics and Space Administration) standard near-infrared atmospheric correction algorithm (Seadas adopted it as the Default atmospheric correction algorithm, recorded as Seadas Default in this paper). Acolite default atmospheric correction algorithm-Dark Spectrum Fitting (recorded as Acolite DSF in this paper) and the Exponential extrapolation method of Acolite, which is recorded as Acolite SWIR, Acolite Red/NIR, Acolite NIR/SWIR respectively according to the different bands used in the Exponential extrapolation algorithm. The analysis results show that the probability (83. 95%) of QA score of R-rs (lambda) data obtained by Seadas Default atmospheric correction algorithm in Jiaozhou Bay is much higher than that of Acolite DSF (49. 66%) Acolite SWIR (4. 13%) Acolite Red/NIR (7. 25%), and Acolite NIR/SWIR (1. 38%D. The atmospheric correction algorithm of Acolite DSF is superior to that of Acolite SWIR, Acolite Red/ NIR and Acolite NIR/SWIR. Finally, MODIS/Aqua satellite data were used to compare and analyze the R-rs (lambda) data at 443, 483, 561 and 655 nm obtained by Seadas Default and Acolite DSF atmospheric correction algorithm respectively. The results show that the atmospheric corrected R-rs (lambda) results obtained by the Seadas Default algorithm are better than that obtained by the Acolite DSF algorithm at all the bands. Based on the results of this study, we suggested that the NASA standard near-infrared atmospheric correction algorithm would be the first choice when applying Landsat8/OLI data to do remote sensing application research in Jiaozhou Bay and its adjacent waters areas.

AB  - Soil moisture is a crucial component of land-atmosphere interaction systems. It has a decisive effect on evapotranspiration and photosynthesis, which then notably impacts the land surface water cycle, energy transfer, and material exchange. Thus, soil moisture is usually treated as an indispensable parameter in studies that focus on drought monitoring, climate change, hydrology, and ecology. After consistent efforts for approximately half a century, great advances in soil moisture retrieval from in situ measurements, remote sensing, and reanalysis approaches have been achieved. The quality of soil moisture estimates, including spatial coverage, temporal span, spatial resolution, time resolution, time latency, and data precision, has been remarkably and steadily improved. This review outlines the recently developed techniques and algorithms used to estimate and improve the quality of soil moisture estimates. Moreover, the characteristics of each estimation approach and the main application fields of soil moisture are summarized. The future prospects of soil moisture estimation trends are highlighted to address research directions in the context of increasingly comprehensive application requirements.

TI  - Phenological Responses to Snow Seasonality in the Qilian Mountains Is a Function of Both Elevation and Vegetation Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In high-elevation mountains, seasonal snow cover affects land surface phenology and the functioning of the ecosystem. However, studies regarding the long-term effects of snow cover on phenological changes for high mountains are still limited. Our study is based on MODIS data from 2003 to 2021. First, the NDPI was calculated, time series were reconstructed, and an SG filter was used. Land surface phenology metrics were estimated based on the dynamic thresholding method. Then, snow seasonality metrics were also estimated based on snow seasonality extraction rules. Finally, correlation and significance between snow seasonality and land surface phenology metrics were tested. Changes were analyzed across elevation and vegetation types. Results showed that (1) the asymmetry in the significant correlation between the snow seasonality and land surface phenology metrics suggests that a more snow-prone non-growing season (earlier first snow, later snowmelt, longer snow season and more snow cover days) benefits a more flourishing vegetation growing season in the following year (earlier start and later end of growing season, longer growing season). (2) Vegetation phenology metrics above 3500 m is sensitive to the length of the snow season and the number of snow cover days. The effect of first snow day on vegetation phenology shifts around 3300 m. The later snowmelt favors earlier and longer vegetation growing season regardless of the elevation. (3) The sensitivity of land surface phenology metrics to snow seasonality varied among vegetation types. Grass and shrub are sensitive to last snow day, alpine vegetation to snow season length, desert to number of snow cover days, and forest to first snow day. In this study, we used a more reliable NDPI at high elevations and confirmed the past conclusions about the impact of snow seasonality metrics. We also described in detail the curves of snow seasonal metrics effects with elevation change. This study reveals the relationship between land surface phenology and snow seasonality in the Qilian Mountains and has important implications for quantifying the impact of climate change on ecosystems.

TI  - Chinese High Resolution Satellite Data and GIS-Based Assessment of Landslide Susceptibility along Highway G30 in Guozigou Valley Using Logistic Regression and MaxEnt Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide disasters frequently occur along the highway G30 in the Guozigou Valley, the corridor of energy, material, economic and cultural exchange, etc., between Yili and other cities of China and Central Asia. However, little attention has been paid to assess the detailed landslide susceptibility of the strategically important highway, especially with high spatial resolution data and the generative presence-only MaxEnt model. Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is a first and vital step for preventing and mitigating landslide hazards. The goal of the current study was to perform LSA for the landslide-prone highway G30 in Guozigou Valley, China with the aid of GIS tools and Chinese high resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite data, and analyze and compare the performance of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and logistic regression (LR). Thirty five landslides were determined in the study region, using GF-1 satellite data, official data, and field surveys. Seven landslide conditioning factors, including altitude, slope, aspect, gully density, lithology, faults density, and NDVI, were used to investigate their existing spatial relationships with landslide occurrences. The LR and MaxEnt model performance were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve, presenting areas under the curve equal to 0.85 and 0.94, respectively. The performance of the MaxEnt model was slightly better than that of the LR model. A landslide susceptibility map was created through reclassifying the landslides occurrence probability with the classification method of natural breaks. According to the MaxEnt model results, 3.29% and 3.82% of the study region is highly and very highly susceptible to future landslide events, respectively, with the highest landslide susceptibility along the highway. The generated landslide susceptibility map could help government agencies and decision-makers to make wise decisions for preventing or mitigating landslide hazards along the highway and design schemes of highway engineering and maintenance in Guozigou Valley, the mountainous areas.

TI  - A multi-angle comprehensive solution based on deep learning to extract cultivated land information from high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate acquisition of cultivated land area and location information is of great significance to agricultural management, agro-ecological environment monitoring, and national food security. The rapid development of deep learning technology provides a new way to extract cultivated land information. However, there are many parameters involved in deep learning, so it is time-consuming to find the optimal parameters. In order to simplify the complex parameter tuning process and explore the main parameters that affect the classification accuracy of deep learning, this study uses Gaofen-2 images as data support and based on U-Net semantic segmentation model to carry out an experiment of cultivated land extraction in Henan Province, China. This study designs model training in different scenarios based on four bands(near-infrared (Nir), red, green, and blue), three backbone models, and six patch sizes (pixel resolution), and analyzes the training model and classification results from multiple perspectives such as model training time, sample size, epoch, and classification categories and quantity. After analysis and evaluation, we conducted cultivated land extraction experiments in three years and different phenological periods, and finally tested the performance of U-Net, PSPNet, Deeplab, and Random Forest in cultivated land extraction. The results show that: (1) the patch size in the model has the greatest influence on the classification accuracy, which is affected by image resolution, geographic objects and batch size. When the patch size was smaller than 112 x 112 pixels, the model recall and F1 decreased substantially, with a decrease of 23.91% and 22.64%, respectively. (2) For U-Net model, after setting reasonable band combination, backbone model, patch size, epoch and sample category, the segmentation and classification accuracy of predicted results increased by 3.27% (Intersection over Union, IoU), 2.62%(overall accuracy, OA), 3.89%(F1) and 7.89%(Kappa) on average. (3) We also determined the optimal band combination (Nir, Red, and Green), patch size (224 x 224 pixels), and backbone (Resnet34) for cultivated land extraction from Gaofen-2 images. The appropriate patch size of cultivated land extraction in the study is between 224 x 224 and 256 x 256 pixels. (4) For cultivated land extraction, relying only on binary classification is not as effective as multi-classification.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Phytoecological Methods for Mapping and Assessing Potential Ecosystem Services of the Ouled Hanneche Forest in the Hodna Mountains, Algeria
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regardless of their biogeographic origins or degree of artificialization, the world's forests are a source of a wide range of ecosystem services (ES). However, the quality and quantity of these services depend on the type of forest studied and its phytogeographic context. Our objective is to transpose the concept of ES, in particular, the assessment of forest ES, to the specific Mediterranean context of the North African mountains, where this issue is still in its infancy and where access to the data needed for assessment remains difficult. Our work presents an introductory approach, allowing us to set up methodological and scientific milestones based on open-access remote sensing data and already tested geospatial processing associated with phytoecological surveys to assess the ES provided by forests in an Algerian study area. Specifically, several indicators used to assess (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the potential ES of the Ouled Hanneche forest, a forest located in the Hodna Mountains, are derived from LANDSAT 8 OLI images from 2017 and an ALOS AW3D30 DSM. The qualitative ES typology is jointly based on an SVM classification of topographically corrected LANDSAT images and a geomorphic-type classification using the geomorphon method. NDVI is a quantitative estimator of many plant ecosystem functions related to ES. It highlights the variations in the provision of ES according to the types of vegetation formations present. It serves as a support for estimating spectral heterogeneity through Rao's quadratic entropy, which is considered a relative indicator of biodiversity at the landscape scale. The two previous variables (the multitemporal NDVI and Rao's Q), completed by the Shannon entropy method applied to the geomorphon classes as a proxy for topo-morphological heterogeneity, constitute the input variables of a quantitative map of the potential supply of ES in the forest determined by Spatial Multicriteria Analysis (SMCA). Ultimately, our results serve as a useful basis for land-use planning and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - The role of remote sensing during a global disaster: COVID-19 pandemic as case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed imagery is used as a tool to aid decision makers and scientists in a variety of fields. A recent world event in which satellite imagery was extensively relied on by a variety of stakeholders was the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article we aim to give an overview of the types of information offered through remote sensing (RS) to help address different issues related to the pandemic. We also discuss about the stakeholders that benefited from the data, and the value added by its availability. The content is presented under four sub-sections; namely (1) the use of RS in real-time decision-making and strategic planning during the pandemic; how RS revealed the (2) environmental changes and (3) social and economic impacts caused by the pandemic. And (4) how RS informed our understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for the pandemic. High resolution optical imagery offered updated on-the-ground data for e. g., humanitarian aid organizations, and informed operational decision making of shipping companies. Change in the intensity of air and water pollution after reduced anthropogenic activities around the world were captured by remote sensing - supplying concrete evidence that can help inform improved environmental policy. Several economic indicators were measured from satellite imagery, showing the spatiotemporal component of economic impacts caused by the global pandemic. Finally, satellite based meteorological data supported epidemiological studies of environmental disease determinants. The varied use of remote sensing during the COVID-19 pandemic affirms the value of this technology to society, especially in times of large-scale disasters.

TI  - A Novel Phase Compensation Method for Urban 3D Reconstruction Using SAR Tomography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) has been widely used in the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of urban areas using the multi-baseline (MB) SAR data. For urban scenarios, the MB SAR data are often acquired by repeat-pass using the spaceborne SAR system. Such a data stack generally has long time baselines, which result in different atmospheric disturbances of the data acquired by different tracks. These factors can lead to the presence of phase errors (PEs). PEs are multiplicative noise for observation data, which can cause diffusion and defocus in TomoSAR imaging and seriously affect the extraction of target 3D information. In this paper, we combine the methods of the block-building network (BBN) and phase gradient autofocus (PGA) to propose a novel phase compensation method called BBN-PGA. The BBN-PGA method can effectively and efficiently compensate for PEs of the MB SAR data over a wide area and improve the accuracy of 3D reconstruction of urban areas. The applicability of this proposed BBN-PGA method is proved by using simulated data and the spaceborne MB SAR data acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite over an area in Barcelona, Spain.

TI  - Genetic Programming for High-Level Feature Learning in Crop Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on crop spatial distribution is essential for agricultural monitoring and food security. Classification with remote-sensing time series images is an effective way to obtain crop distribution maps across time and space. Optimal features are the precondition for crop classification and are critical to the accuracy of crop maps. Although several approaches are available for extracting spectral, temporal, and phenological features for crop identification, these methods depend heavily on domain knowledge and human experiences, adding uncertainty to the final crop classification. This study proposed a novel Genetic Programming (GP) approach to learning high-level features from time series images for crop classification to address this issue. We developed a new representation of GP to extend the GP tree's width and depth to dynamically generate either fixed or flexible informative features without requiring domain knowledge. This new GP approach was wrapped with four classifiers, i.e., K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and was then used for crop classification based on MODIS time series data in Heilongjiang Province, China. The performance of the GP features was compared with the traditional features of vegetation indices (VIs) and the advanced feature learning method Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to show GP effectiveness. The experiments indicated that high-level features learned by GP improved the classification accuracies, and the accuracies were higher than those using VIs and MLP. GP was more robust and stable for diverse classifiers, different feature numbers, and various training sample sets compared with classification using VI features and the classifier MLP. The proposed GP approach automatically selects valuable features from the original data and uses them to construct high-level features simultaneously. The learned features are explainable, unlike those of a black-box deep learning model. This study demonstrated the outstanding performance of GP for feature learning in crop classification. GP has the potential of becoming a mainstream method to solve complex remote sensing tasks, such as feature transfer learning, image classification, and change detection.

TI  - Framework to Extract Extreme Phytoplankton Bloom Events with Remote Sensing Datasets: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) is an essential climate variable. Extremes of CHL events directly reflect the condition of marine ecosystems. Here, we applied the statistical framework for defining marine heatwaves to study the extremes of winter CHL blooms off the Luzon Strait (termed as LZB), northeastern South China Sea (SCS), from a set of remote sensing data. The application was enabled by a recent gap-free CHL dataset, the SCSDCT data. We present the basic properties and the long-term trends of these LZB events, which had become fewer but stronger in recent years. We further statistically analyze the LZB events' controlling factors, including the submesoscale activity quantified by a heterogeneous index or surface temperature gradients. It was revealed that the submesoscale activity was also a vital modulating factor of the bloom events in addition to the well-understood wind and upwelling controls. This modulation can be explained by the stratification introduced by submesoscale mixed-layer instabilities. In the winter, the intensified winter monsoon provides a background front and well-mixed upper layer with replenished nutrients. During the wind relaxation, submesoscale baroclinic instabilities developed, leading to rapid stratification and scattered submesoscale fronts. Such a scenario is favorable for the winter blooms. For the first time, this study identifies the bloom events in a typical marginal sea and highlights the linkage between these events and submesoscale activity. Furthermore, the method used to identify extreme blooms opens up the possibility for understanding trends of multiple marine extreme events under climate change.

TI  - Interpreting Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter Signals of Snowpack Surface Melt/Freeze, Warming, and Ripening, through Field Measurements and Physically-Based SnowModel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition of a cold winter snowpack to one that is ripe and contributing to runoff is crucial to gauge for water resource management, but is highly variable in space and time. Snow surface melt/freeze cycles, associated with diurnal fluctuations in radiative inputs, are hallmarks of this transition. C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) reliably detects meltwater in the snowpack. Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR offers consistent acquisition patterns that allow for diurnal investigations of melting snow. We used over 50 snow pit observations from 2020 in Grand Mesa, Colorado, USA, to track temperature and wetness in the snowpack as a function of depth and time during snowpack phases of warming, ripening, and runoff. We also ran the physically-based SnowModel, which provided a spatially and temporally continuous independent indication of snowpack conditions. Snowpack phases were identified and corroborated by comparing field measurements with SnowModel outputs. Knowledge of snowpack warming, ripening, and runoff phases was used to interpret diurnal changes in S1 backscatter values. Both field measurements and SnowModel simulations suggested that S1 SAR was not sensitive to the initial snowpack warming phase on Grand Mesa. In the ripening and runoff phases, the diurnal cycle in S1 SAR co-polarized backscatter was affected by both surface melt/freeze as well as the conditions of the snowpack underneath (ripening or ripe). The ripening phase was associated with significant increases in morning backscatter values, likely due to volume scattering from surface melt/freeze crusts, as well as significant decreases in evening backscatter values associated with snowmelt. During the runoff phase, both morning and evening backscatter decreased compared to reference values. These unique S1 diurnal signatures, and their interpretations using field measurements and SnowModel outputs, highlight the capacities and limitations of S1 SAR to understand snow surface states and bulk phases, which may offer runoff forecasting or energy balance model validation or parameterization, especially useful in remote or sparsely-gauged alpine basins.

TI  - A Framework for Fracture Extraction Under Glaciological Property-Based Constraints: Scientific Application on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf of Antarctica
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractures are an important indicator of ice shelf instability and predecessors of calving events. It is of great importance to identify fractures and understand the formation and propagation processes of fractures. However, automated methods of fracture identification also erroneously extract non-fracture features, which are mixed with the automatically extracted fractures, negatively impacting the accuracy of the results. In this study, a framework for fracture extraction with glaciological property-based constraints was proposed to extract fractures and filter out non-fracture features. The extraction module consists of image preprocessing and linear feature extraction. The constraints were based on glaciological property analysis, including constraints based on physical properties of fractures and structural properties of ice shelves. The framework was applied to Mosaic of Antarctica and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images to extract fractures on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The results suggest that most of the non-fracture features were successfully filtered out, accounting for about half of all linear features. Upon comparison, it was found that the proposed method detected similar to 97% of the rifts and similar to 42% of the crevasses detected by manual extraction. The spatial pattern and formation mechanisms of the fractures were analyzed based on strain maps. The formation of crevasses is closely related to shear margin and longitudinal tension, while the large rifts near the ice shelf front are likely to be related to the strikes of lateral ice flow tributaries. The constraint strategy can be further improved by utilizing more glaciological properties to obtain more-accurate fracture extraction.Plain Language Summary Ice shelf fracture is of great importance because it leads to ice shelf calving. Ice shelf calving will then accelerate ice loss in Antarctica and sea level rise. However, masses of non-fracture features are mixed into automatic fracture extraction results. To deal with this problem, an extraction framework with constraints was proposed to filter out non-fracture features. The constraints are based on the different patterns found in fractures and non-fractures. The framework was applied to two imagery sets of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The results suggest that most of the non-fracture features were successfully filtered out, which account for about half of the extraction results. The automatic extraction identified similar to 97% of rifts and similar to 42% of the crevasses of the manual extraction results. Based on the analysis of the fracture map, crevasse formation is mostly caused by shear margin and longitudinal tension, while the large rifts near the ice shelf front may be caused by strikes of lateral ice flow tributaries. The constraint strategy can be further improved by utilizing more glaciological properties to more accurately extract features.

TI  - A Novel Imaging Scheme of Squint Multichannel SAR: First Result of GF-3 Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The azimuth multichannel synthetic aperture radar (MC-SAR) is an effective means of earth observation due to its high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) imaging capability. Compared with the traditional MC-SAR, the two-dimensional (2D) spectrum of the squint multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SMC-SAR) is skewed, leading to the severe coupling between azimuth signals and range signals. Therefore, the traditional imaging algorithms are inapplicable to SMC-SAR. Currently, the existing imaging algorithms for SMC-SAR need interpolation or sub-aperture processing, which results in low efficiency. This paper proposes a novel imaging scheme for spaceborne SMC-SAR to handle this issue. With the squint angle known, the Doppler centroid can be compensated for by the spectrum shift function. Additionally, the frequency correlation method (FCM) is utilized to estimate the channel phase imbalance. After that, the azimuth multichannel data are reconstructed by the filter banks to eliminate the Doppler spectrum aliasing. Finally, the data are imaged based on the modified equivalent slant range model (MESRM). Both the simulation and Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

TI  - High-Resolution Daily Emission Inventory of Biomass Burning in the Amur-Heilong River Basin Based on MODIS Fire Radiative Energy Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Open biomass burning (OBB) is one of the major factors that influences the regional climate environment and surface vegetation landscape, and it significantly affects the regional carbon cycle process and atmospheric environment. The Amur-Heilong River Basin (ARB) is a fire-prone region in high-latitude boreal forests. In this study, we used fire radiative power (FRP) obtained from a Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate OBB emissions from the ARB and established a long-term series (2003-2020) with a high spatiotemporal resolution and a daily 1 km emissions inventory. The results show that the annual average emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NMHCs, NOx, NH3, SO2, BC, OC, PM2.5, and PM10 were estimated to be 153.57, 6.16, 0.21, 0.78, 0.28, 0.08, 0.06, 0.04, 0.39, 0.66, and 0.85 Tg/a, respectively. Taking CO2 as an example, grassland fire in the dry season (mainly in April and October) was the largest contributor (87.18 Tg/a), accounting for 56.77% of the total CO2 emissions from the ARB, followed by forest fire prone to occur in April-May (56.53 Tg/a, 36.81%) and crop fire during harvest season (9.86 Tg/a, 6.42%). Among the three countries in the ARB, Russia released the most total CO2 emissions (2227.04 Tg), much higher than those of China (338.41 Tg) and Mongolia (198.83 Tg). The major fire types were crop fires (40.73%) on the Chinese side and grass fires on the Russian (56.67%) and Mongolian (97.56%) sides. Over the past decade, OBB CO2 emissions have trended downward (-0.79 Tg/a) but crop burning has increased significantly (+0.81 Tg/a). Up to 83.7% of crop fires occurred in China (2010-2020), with a concentrated and southward trend. Comparisons with the Global Fire Emission Dataset (GFED4.1s), the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINNv2.2), and the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.2) showed that our newly established emission inventory was in good agreement with these three datasets in the ARB. However, this multi-year, daily 1 km high-resolution emission inventory has the advantages of detecting more small fire emissions that were overlooked by coarse-grid datasets. The methods described here can be used as an effective means of estimating greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions from biomass combustion.

TI  - Analysis of Landscape Pattern Evolution and Driving Forces Based on Land-Use Changes: A Case Study of Yilong Lake Watershed on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the landscape pattern evolution and driving forces of the Yilong Lake watershed, the combined method of supervised classification with manual visual interpretation based on the landsat5TM/8OLI remote sensing image data sources was used to establish a high-precision spatial distribution information database of the Yilong Lake watershed. Landscape index was used to analyze the distribution and spatial pattern change characteristics of various land-use types. Based on correlation and principal component analysis, we discuss the relationship between the change characteristics of land-use type, distribution and spatial pattern, and the interference of local socio-economic development and natural factors. The results show that: (1) In the past 30 years, the land-use types of the Yilong Lake watershed are mainly forest, garden plot and cultivated land. The forest area decreased significantly by 30.45 km(2), of which the fastest reduction stage was from 2000 to 2005, with a total reduction of 20.56 km(2). The garden plot conversion is relatively large, with a total of 181.69 km(2) transferred out, of which 28.84 km(2) has become unused land, respectively. (2) In the past 30 years, the maximum patch index decreased by 9.94% and the patch density index increased by 14.25%, indicating that the landscape fragmentation in the whole basin increased. The Shannon diversity index showed an increasing process; the aggregation index showed a decreasing process. (3) The change in landscape pattern in the watershedwas closely related to economic growth, population growth, social affluence and agricultural development. Natural factors, social factors and economic indicators are significantly positively correlated with patch density, edge density, landscape shape index and Shannon diversity index, and significantly negatively correlated with the largest patch index and the contagion index. On the whole, the wetlands in the basin are shrinking and the landscape diversity is changing. Reducing the excessive impact of human activities on the watershed ecosystem is a key factor for the local protection of wetland resources and the maintenance of wetland ecological functions.

TI  - Thirty-Four-Year Record (1987-2021) of the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Algal Blooms in Lake Dianchi from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Insights
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Dianchi is one of the most eutrophic lakes in China. The decline in water quality and the occurrence of massive algal blooms pose a significant threat to the health and environmental safety of the water ecosystem, making Lake Dianchi a key concern for algal bloom management in China. Obtaining the spatiotemporal dynamics of algal blooms for the longest time possible is crucial to algal bloom management and future prediction. However, it is difficult to acquire a long-term record of algal blooms from a single sensor in order to cover a more extended period of eutrophication in the lake due to the limitation of the spatial and temporal resolution of the sensors. In this study, Landsat and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were combined with the Floating Algae Index (FAI) to reconstruct a unified time series of bloom areas to analyze the algal bloom dynamics in Lake Dianchi in recent decades. Regarding the interannual variation, the bloom area showed an increasing trend from 1987 to 2021, with larger bloom areas in 1991-1992, 2000-2003, 2012-2013, and 2020-2021. In terms of seasonal characteristics, the bloom area was significantly more prominent in the rainy season compared with the dry season during the year. The spatial distribution of the bloom frequency showed a pattern of higher frequencies in the north and lower frequencies in the south. From 2000 to 2021, the initial bloom time and bloom duration showed a trend of delaying and then advancing and decreasing and then increasing, respectively. We analyzed the importance of long-term records of algal blooms and found that the percentage of rainy season images is an essential factor in reconstructing time series based on different sensors. In addition, the relationship between environmental factors and algal blooms was analyzed. The results show that wind speed and air temperature were the main meteorological factors controlling the interannual variation in algal blooms in Lake Dianchi. Water quality factors such as nutrients have less of an influence on the variation in algal blooms because the algal growth demand has been met. Environmental management measures taken by local governments have led to improvements in the lake's trophic state, and continued strengthening of environmental pollution control is expected to curb the algal blooms in Lake Dianchi. This study provides a long-term record of algal blooms in Lake Dianchi, which provides essential reference information for a comprehensive understanding of the development process of algal blooms in Lake Dianchi and its sustainable development.

TI  - A Global 250-m Downscaled NDVI Product from 1982 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data are useful for monitoring the changes in vegetation ecosystems in the context of global climate change. However, most of the current NDVI products cannot effectively reconcile high spatial resolution and continuous observations in time. Here, to produce a global-scale, long-term, and high-resolution NDVI database, we developed a simple and new data downscaling approach. The downscaling algorithm considers the pixel-wise ratios of the coefficient of variation (CV) between the coarse- and fine-resolution NDVI data and relative changes in the NDVI against a baseline period. The algorithm successfully created a worldwide monthly NDVI database with 250 m resolution from 1982 to 2018 by translating the fine spatial information from MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and the long-term temporal information from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data. We employed the evaluation indices of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's R) to assess the accuracy of the downscaled data against the MODIS NDVI. Both the RMSE and MAE values at the regional and global scales are typically between 0 and 0.2, whereas the Pearson's R values are mostly above 0.7, which implies that the downscaled NDVI product is similar to the MODIS NDVI product. We then used the downscaled data to monitor the NDVI changes in different plant types and places with significant vegetation heterogeneity, as well as to investigate global vegetation trends over the last four decades. The Google Earth Engine platform was used for all the data downscaling processes, and here we provide a code for users to easily acquire data corresponding to any part of the world. The downscaled global-scale NDVI time series has high potential for the monitoring of the long-term temporal and spatial dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems under changing environments.

TI  - The Impact of Opencast Lignite Mining on Rural Development: A Literature Review and Selected Case Studies Using Desk Research, Panel Data and GIS-Based Analysis
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Review
AB  - The future of opencast mining and energy production based on conventional resources is one of the most important issues being discussed in international forums. The whole discussion is becoming increasingly heated and takes on a special significance with the drastic increase in energy commodity prices that has occurred with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Especially in a country like Poland, these issues are accompanied by heated discussions between miners, the government and citizens. It should be emphasised that Polish lignite mining currently produces about 35% of the cheapest electricity in Poland and also creates many jobs. The aim of this study is to assess the possibility of continuing opencast mining and its impact on rural development-both from an environmental and socio-economic point of view. The study was conducted for two municipalities in Poland where opencast lignite mining plays an important role, namely Kleszczow and Kleczew. As a result, it was found that in the case of the studied municipalities, the presence of opencast mining has contributed to their development, and the application of modern environmental protection technologies and recultivation have reduced the difficulties associated with mining. On the other hand, the decision to start mining should be the result of a comparison between the potential environmental and social benefits and damages. In some cases, mining is beneficial for community development and leads to new opportunities for agriculture and tourism after reclamation. The study is a combination of different methods, i.e., case studies, GIS remote sensing analysis (based on Landsat data) and econometric analysis for selected socio-economic data.

TI  - MONITORING VEGETATION PHENOLOGY USING MODIS NDVI 250M IN THE CITY OF TSHWANE, SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented influx of people into urban areas has led to the horizontal and vertical growth of urban environments. One of the notable impacts of urbanisation is the encroachment of urban-like environments into non-urban areas. This is common in both developed and developing countries, and South Africa's City of Tshwane, the administrative capital of the country, has been affected by urbanisation because of migration. One of the parameters or proxies used to quantify urban growth is vegetation cover. There is a consensus that with the increase in the population of urban dwellers, vegetation cover will decrease. To assess and monitor vegetation cover, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is commonly used. In this study, MODIS NDVI data with a 250m spatial resolution was used to assess the impact of urban growth on vegetation. A time series analysis of the MODIS NDVI with a spatial resolution of 250m was used to establish the patterns of vegetation cover. Trends in vegetation change were determined in newly developed residential areas, informal settlements, and various vegetated areas. Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall 's statisticwere used to analyse the spatial trends and variations in trends among different land cover classes. The slope of the trends differs significantly but there is a general decline in vegetation cover. The temporal profiles revealed the high and low NDVI values, respectively showing greening (high vegetation) and browning (low vegetation) trends from 2000 to 2016. It is concluded that urban growth has an impact on vegetation cover. However, this does not disturb the seasonal changes in vegetation where high NDVI values prevail in summer and low values in winter.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of fossil geothermal manifestations and assessment of geothermal potential of the Tangyin rift, Southeast of Taihang Mountain in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial prediction of geothermal sites along the southeast side of Taihang Mountain in the Tangyin rift is a critical goal in the development of renewable energy resources in cities such as Hebi in Henan province, which has significant potential for geothermal energy production due to the existence of deep faults and Cenozoic volcano. The study aimed to delineate areas with high geothermal manifestations for detailed geothermal exploration and well-test drilling. To define favorable zones for geothermal potentiality, multi-source datasets were chosen to generate evidence thematic layers that demonstrate the distribution of geothermal anomalies such as geologic maps, structural maps, Land Surface Temperature maps (LST), and hydrothermal mineral alterations maps. The remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) approaches were integrated to map fossil geothermal manifestations and appraise the promising geothermal zones from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer-Digital Elevation Model (ASTER-DEM) dataset using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is one of the Mult-criteria Decision Making methods. Results show LST values ranging from 22.6 degrees C to 45.4 degrees C, with the highest values found along the faults and volcanic areas. The hydrothermal alteration minerals discriminated from band ratios of 4/2, 6/5, and 6/7 for iron oxide, ferrous minerals, and clays reveal the presence of high amount of montmorillonite and illite minerals along the faults and volcanoes which are related to hot fluid circulation from subsurface. Structural analysis shows that the major structural trend follows the NNE Tangdong and Tangxi faults, with high density on the west side of the Tangxi fault where there is good exposure of outcrop but less fault density on the east side due to sedimentation in a low land which may conceal geological structures. Lastly, all the thematic layers of geothermal factors were reclassified, ranked, and integrated by the weight overlay logic model based on the influence of geothermal suitability to map potential areas for geothermal resources whereby 5 zones were obtained ranging from very poor to very good. The promising potential sites are mostly found along the highly deep structures of the major Tangxi fault crosscutting the permeable lithology of carbonate rocks and around the Hebi volcanoes. The distribution of hot springs and geothermal wells of the Hebi field were correlated and verified against the potential geothermal anomalies map. The overall integrated method proposes an advanced technique for designing the Tangyin rift's exploration plan and development actions for geothermal resources utilization, which can be used for exploration of any unveiling geothermal potential sites.

TI  - Seasonal drought analysis of Aksehir Lake with temporal combined sentinel data between 2017 and 2021 spring and autumn
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The threat of drought has been felt almost worldwide in recent years. It is critical to determine the causes of drought and how seasonal changes affect it. Additionally, it is necessary to determine the speed and impact area of drought, monitor drought areas, and attempt to find solutions against drought. With the developing satellite sensing systems, remote sensing methods are being used to investigate topics such as the increase and extent of drought, uncontrolled water consumption in agricultural activities, and the effects of unnatural pollutants on freshwater resources such as lakes and rivers. Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data to monitor changes in water bodies is a relatively new area of study in remote sensing. The spatial extent and seasonal change (spring and autumn) of droughts between 2017 and 2021 in Aksehir Lake were determined from Sentinel-1A SAR satellite data, and the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) was calculated using Sentinel-2A optical satellite data and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in this research. In addition, a different approach was applied to determine the change of wetland boundaries more accurately by converting the linear Sigma0 band to the decibel (dB) band and applying a non-linear 3 x 3 maximum filter to the dB band to Sentinel-1A data. Consequently, it has been established that Aksehir Lake, which used to have wetlands during the spring seasons but began to dry up in the autumn seasons, had completely dried up in both periods in 2021.

TI  - Mapping of Land Degradation Vulnerability in the Semi-Arid Watershed of Rajasthan, India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global soils are under extreme pressure from various threats due to population expansion, economic development, and climate change. Mapping of land degradation vulnerability (LDV) using geospatial techniques play a significant role and has great importance, especially in semi-arid climates for the management of natural resources in a sustainable manner. The present study was conducted to assess the spatial distribution of land degradation hotspots based on some important parameters such as land use/land cover (LULC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), terrain characteristics (Topographic Wetness Index and Multi-Resolution Index of Valley Bottom Flatness), climatic parameters (land surface temperature and mean annual rainfall), and pedological attributes (soil texture and soil organic carbon) by using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and GIS techniques in the semi-arid region of the Bundi district, Rajasthan, India. Land surface temperature (LST) and NDVI products were derived from time-series Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, rainfall data products from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), terrain characteristics from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), LULC from Landsat 9, and pedological variables from legacy soil datasets. Weights derived for thematic layers from the AHP in the studied area were as follows: LULC (0.38) > NDVI (0.23) > ST (0.15) > LST (0.08) > TWI (0.06) > MAR (0.05) > SOC (0.03) > MRVBF (0.02). The consistency ratio (CR) for all studied parameters was <0.10, indicating the high accuracy of the AHP. The results show that about 20.52% and 23.54% of study area was under moderate and high to very high vulnerability of land degradation, respectively. Validation of LDV zones with the help of ultra-high-resolution Google Earth imageries indicates good agreement with the model outputs. The research aids in a better understanding of the influence of land degradation on long-term land management and development at the watershed level.

TI  - Towards an ontological approach in Translation Studies: The case of Jose Maria Arguedas
T2  - META
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a theoretical discussion on the relationship between translation and ontology. The so-called ontological turn in cultural anthropology has not only questioned the modern naturalistic ontology, which until now had been imposed as universal, but also the use of the notion of culture and cultural translation. The ontological question, however, has received little attention in analytical terms in Translation Studies from an interdisciplinary approach, especially regarding postcolonial contexts. For this reason, after illustrating the debate on the notions of culture and cultural translation in Translation Studies, this article proposes the concept of ontological translation as an indispensable theoretical device to investigate those translation processes characterized by differences that can be defined as ontological and not only cultural. In order to analyze the hermeneutic potentialities of ontological translation in Translation Studies, the case study proposed is that of the bilingual Quechua-Spanish author Jose Maria Arguedas (1911-1969) who, as an anthropologist, author and (self-)translator, reflected on the complexity of translating the Quechua worldview into Spanish.

TI  - Induction of potassium channel regulator KCNE4 in a submandibular lymph node metastasis model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer cells often metastasize to the lymph nodes (LNs) before disseminating throughout the body. Clinically, LN metastasis correlates with poor prognosis and influences treatment options. Many studies have shown that cancer cells communicate with immune and stromal cells to prepare a suitable niche for metastasis. In this study, mice were injected with B16-F10 murine melanoma cells to generate a tongue submandibular lymph node (SLN) metastasis model in which genes of interest could be investigated. Microarray analyses were performed on SLNs, identifying 162 upregulated genes, some of which are known metastasis genes. Among these upregulated genes, Kcne4, Slc7a11, Fscn1, and Gadd45b were not associated with metastasis, and increased expression of Kcne4 and Slc7a11 was confirmed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The roles of KCNE4 in chemokine production and cell adhesion were examined using primary lymphatic endothelial cells, and demonstrated that Ccl17 and Ccl19, which are involved in melanoma metastasis, were upregulated by KCNE4, as well as Mmp3 matrix metalloproteinase. Expression of KCNE4 was detected in human LNs with metastatic melanoma. In conclusion, we found that LN metastatic melanoma induces KCNE4 expression in the endothelium of LNs.

TI  - Sentinel-Based Adaptation of the Local Climate Zones Framework to a South African Context
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The LCZ framework has become a widely applied approach to study urban climate. The standard LCZ typology is highly specific when applied to western urban areas but generic in some African cities. We tested the generic nature of the standard typology by taking a two-part approach. First, we applied a single-source WUDAPT-based training input across three urban areas that represent a gradient in South African urbanization (Cape Town, Thohoyandou and East London). Second, we applied a local customized training that accounts for the unique characteristics of the specific area. The LCZ classification was completed using a random forest classifier on a subset of single (SI) and multitemporal (MT) Sentinel 2 imagery. The results show an increase in overall classification accuracy between 17 and 30% for the locally calibrated over the generic standard LCZ framework. The spring season is the best classified of the single-date imagery with the accuracies 7% higher than the least classified season. The multi-date classification accuracy is 13% higher than spring but only 9% higher when a neighborhood function (NF) is applied. For acceptable performance of the LCZ classifier in an African context, the training must be local and customized to the uniqueness of that specific area.

TI  - Forecasting seasonal sargassum events across the tropical Atlantic: Overview and challenges
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Proliferation of sargassum across the tropical Atlantic since 2011 has motivated a range of forecasting methods. Statistical methods based on basin-scale satellite data are used to address seasonal timescales. Other methods involve explicit Lagrangian calculations of trajectories for particles that are representative of drifting sargassum over days-months. This computed sargassum drift is attributed to the combined action of surface currents, winds and waves, individually or in various combinations. Such calculations are undertaken with both observed surface drift and simulated currents, each involving strengths and weaknesses. Observed drift implicitly includes the action on sargassum of winds and waves, assumed equivalent between drifters and sargassum mats. Simulated currents provide large gridded datasets that facilitate computation of ensembles, enabling some quantification of the uncertainty inherent in an eddy-rich ocean, further subject to interannual variability. A more limited number of forecasts account for in situ growth or loss of sargassum biomass, subject to considerable uncertainty. Forecasts provide either non-dimensional indices or quantities of sargassum, accumulated in specified areas or counted across specified transects over a given time interval. Proliferation of different forecast methodologies may reduce uncertainty, if predictions for given seasons are consistent in broad terms, but there is scope to coordinate different approaches with common geographical foci and predicted variables, to facilitate direct inter-comparisons. In an example of forecasting westward sargassum flux into the Caribbean during the first half of 2022, challenges and opportunities are highlighted. In conclusion, prospects for closer alignment of complementary forecasting methods, and implications for sargassum management, are identified.

TI  - Methodology for the Automatic Inventory of Olive Groves at the Plot and Polygon Level
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop and validate a methodology to carry out olive grove inventories based on open data sources and automatic photogrammetric and satellite image analysis techniques. To do so, tools and protocols have been developed that have made it possible to automate the capture of images of different characteristics and origins, enable the use of open data sources, as well as integrating and metadating them. They can then be used for the development and validation of algorithms that allow for improving the characterization of olive grove surfaces at the plot and cadastral polygon scales. With the proposed system, an inventory of the Andalusian olive grove has been automatically carried out at the level of cadastral polygons and provinces, which has accounted for a total of 1,519,438 hectares and 171,980,593 olive trees. These data have been contrasted with various official statistical sources, thus ensuring their reliability and even identifying some inconsistencies or errors of some sources. Likewise, the capacity of the Sentinel 2 satellite images to estimate the FCC at the cadastral polygon, parcel and 10 x 10 m pixel level has been demonstrated and quantified, as well as the opportunity to carry out inventories with temporal resolutions of approximately up to 5 days.

TI  - GIS investigation of the fire history of Jonkershoek Nature Reserve
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire regimes have the potential to disturb ecological aspects of a landscape and/or contribute to the maintenance of the biological diversity. Thus, a gauge of the impact of planned and unplanned fire regimes is vital to South Africa's national reserves. The Jonkershoek Nature Reserve in the Western Cape is characterized by the occurrence of indigenous Fynbos and Afromontane Forest vegetation. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) can aid the management and preservation of indigenous vegetational species. This study used knowledge of the ecological conditions of the Reserve, historical fire data, Landsat TM and Landsat OLI imagery, and geospatial analysis to investigate the impact of the fire regimes in the Reserve. Image classification was carried out from 2005 to 2015 to determine the burn patterns, with the process being aided by the fire regime history from 1970 to 2015. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) analysis was carried out to determine how abiotic factors, such as elevation, slope and aspect, impact fires in the Reserve. The assessment of fires included the ascertainment of their location, coverage, and frequency, the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR), the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). There were 39 fires recorded in the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve from 1970 to 2015. The largest fire events were recorded in 1999 (26503.6 ha.) and 2015 (8363.0 ha.). The lowest area of fire impact recorded occurred in the years 2010 (0. 15ha.), 1973 (1.1 ha.) and 1987 (3.1 ha.). With an overall classification accuracy of 94.17%, the Landsat OLI imagery performed better with an overall classification accuracy of 94.17% than the Landsat TM at 75.83%. The OLS regression showed that fire severity was positively correlated to NDVI and elevation. This may suggest that regions of healthy vegetation at any altitude may be susceptible to burnings if there is sufficient vegetation to fuel a fire. The OLS was negatively correlated to slope and aspect. This may impact fire risk as steeper slopes may have vegetation growing in their fire shadow.

TI  - The IASI Water Deficit Index to Monitor Vegetation Stress and Early Drying in Summer Heatwaves: An Application to Southern Italy
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The boreal hemisphere has been experiencing increasing extreme hot and dry conditions over the past few decades, consistent with anthropogenic climate change. The continental extension of this phenomenon calls for tools and techniques capable of monitoring the global to regional scales. In this context, satellite data can satisfy the need for global coverage. The main objective we have addressed in the present paper is the capability of infrared satellite observations to monitor the vegetation stress due to increasing drought and heatwaves in summer. We have designed and implemented a new water deficit index (wdi) that exploits satellite observations in the infrared to retrieve humidity, air temperature, and surface temperature simultaneously. These three parameters are combined to provide the water deficit index. The index has been developed based on the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer or IASI, which covers the infrared spectral range 645 to 2760 cm(-1) with a sampling of 0.25 cm(-1). The index has been used to study the 2017 heatwave, which hit continental Europe from May to October. In particular, we have examined southern Italy, where Mediterranean forests suffer from climate change. We have computed the index's time series and show that it can be used to indicate the atmospheric background conditions associated with meteorological drought. We have also found a good agreement with soil moisture, which suggests that the persistence of an anomalously high water deficit index was an essential driver of the rapid development and evolution of the exceptionally severe 2017 droughts.

TI  - Association between sentinel lymph node biopsy and micrometastasis in endometrial cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is increasingly utilized at surgical staging for early endometrial cancer. This study examined the association between SLN biopsy and micrometastasis in endometrial cancer.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study examining the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program. The study population was 6,414 women with T1-2 endometrial cancer who underwent primary hysterectomy and surgical nodal evaluation. Exclusion criteria included cases with isolated tumor cells. Exposure assignment was surgical nodal evaluation (SLN biopsy or lymphadenectomy). Main outcome measure was micrometastasis, assessed by inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score in a stage-specific fashion.Results: In T1a disease (n = 4,608), SLN biopsy was performed in 1,164 (25.3%) cases. SLN biopsy was associated with a 90% increased likeliness of identifying micrometastasis compared to lymphadenectomy (1.3% versus 0.7%, odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.02-3.55, P = 0.040). In T1b disease (n = 1,369), 270 (19.7%) cases had SLN biopsy. The incidence of micrometastasis was significantly higher in the SLN biopsy group compared to the lymphadenectomy group (8.4% versus 5.0%, odds ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.86, P = 0.028). In T2 disease (SLN biopsy in 57 [13.0%] of 437 cases), the incidence of micrometastasis was similar between the two groups (7.9% versus 7.0%, odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.30-2.60, P = 0.818).Conclusion: This study suggests that SLN biopsy protocol may identify more micrometastasis in the regional lymph nodes of T1 endometrial cancer. Whether national-level increase in the utilization of SLN biopsy for early endometrial cancer results in a stage-shifting to advanced disease on a population-basis warrants further investigation.

TI  - Developing a Long COVID Phenotype for Postacute COVID-19 in a National Primary Care Sentinel Cohort: Observational Retrospective Database Analysis
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Following COVID-19, up to 40% of people have ongoing health problems, referred to as postacute COVID-19 or long COVID (LC). LC varies from a single persisting symptom to a complex multisystem disease. Research has flagged that this condition is underrecorded in primary care records, and seeks to better define its clinical characteristics and management. Phenotypes provide a standard method for case definition and identification from routine data and are usually machine-processable. An LC phenotype can underpin research into this condition.Objective: This study aims to develop a phenotype for LC to inform the epidemiology and future research into this condition. We compared clinical symptoms in people with LC before and after their index infection, recorded from March 1, 2020, to April 1, 2021. We also compared people recorded as having acute infection with those with LC who were hospitalized and those who were not.Methods: We used data from the Primary Care Sentinel Cohort (PCSC) of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database. This network was recruited to be nationally representative of the English population. We developed an LC phenotype using our established 3-step ontological method: (1) ontological step (defining the reasoning process underpinning the phenotype, (2) coding step (exploring what clinical terms are available, and (3) logical extract model (testing performance). We created a version of this phenotype using Protege in the ontology web language for BioPortal and using PhenoFlow. Next, we used the phenotype to compare people with LC (1) with regard to their symptoms in the year prior to acquiring COVID-19 and (2) with people with acute COVID-19. We also compared hospitalized people with LC with those not hospitalized. We compared sociodemographic details, comorbidities, and Office of National Statistics-defined LC symptoms between groups. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression.Results: The long-COVID phenotype differentiated people hospitalized with LC from people who were not and where no index infection was identified. The PCSC (N=7.4 million) includes 428,479 patients with acute COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by a laboratory test and 10,772 patients with clinically diagnosed COVID-19. A total of 7471 (1.74%, 95% CI 1.70-1.78) people were coded as having LC, 1009 (13.5%, 95% CI 12.7-14.3) had a hospital admission related to acute COVID-19, and 6462 (86.5%, 95% CI 85.7-87.3) were not hospitalized, of whom 2728 (42.2%) had no COVID-19 index date recorded. In addition, 1009 (13.5%, 95% CI 12.73-14.28) people with LC were hospitalized compared to 17,993 (4.5%, 95% CI 4.48-4.61; P<.001) with uncomplicated COVID-19.Conclusions: Our LC phenotype enables the identification of individuals with the condition in routine data sets, facilitating their comparison with unaffected people through retrospective research. This phenotype and study protocol to explore its face validity contributes to a better understanding of LC.

TI  - Synergy between the Urban Heat Island and the Urban Pollution Island in Mexico City during the Dry Season
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Pollution Island (UPI) is relevant for urban studies as well as for health studies. Both phenomena have not been widely studied in Greater Mexico City (GMC). Therefore, we study the interaction between UHI and UPI in GMC where urban and rural areas are not well defined. Also, long-range transport of pollution affects GMC pollution concentration. We used 5-year data (2015???2019) from weather stations to measure the Air UHI (AUHI) and Landsat 8 data to assess the Surface UHI (SUHI). The Urban Pollution (UP) has been assessed with Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations measured near the surface by air quality monitoring stations, the Aerosol Optical Depth has been used as a measure of UP. During the dry season (February???May), at night (20:00???07:59 h LT), a positive correlation (statistically significant) between the UHI and UP has been found (r = 0.39) for the UPI defined with PM2.5 between the urban and rural stations. Whereas a significant correlation (r = 0.50) has been found between UPI defined with PM10 between the urban and rural station during the autumn.

TI  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus circulating among sheep of Portugal: a nationwide serosurvey assessment
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a widespread zoonotic pathogen that can cause mild to severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. CCHFV may be transmitted through direct contact with tissue or blood of viremic animals; however, the primary transmission route is through infected tick bites. CCHFV RNA has been detected in ticks feeding on domestic and wild animals in western Spain, suggesting an established circulation of CCHFV in Western Europe. Ruminants have been recognized as important CCHFV reservoirs and have been linked to human cases in endemic regions. Given the emergence of CCHF in neighboring Spain, and a report of two CCHFV seropositive humans in southern Portugal in 1985, we investigated the potential circulation of this virus in the country by performing a nationwide anti-CCHFV IgG serosurvey in sentinel sheep of Portugal. Sera (n = 459) randomly selected from widely distributed farms (n = 20) of Portugal were tested using a commercial double-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, yielding an overall seroprevalence of 0.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-1.56%). Positive sheep were from the southern region of Portugal (Alentejo region), which raise the seroprevalence of this region to 0.74% (95% CI 0.09-2.66%). This is the first study reporting the presence of CCHFV antibodies in sheep of Portugal, thus suggesting a geographical expansion of CCHFV to this country. It seems likely that CCHFV may exist focally in southern Portugal.

TI  - Differences in Clinical Presentation With Long COVID After Community and Hospital Infection and Associations With All-Cause Mortality: English Sentinel Network Database Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Most studies of long COVID (symptoms of COVID-19 infection beyond 4 weeks) have focused on people hospitalized in their initial illness. Long COVID is thought to be underrecorded in UK primary care electronic records.Objective: We sought to determine which symptoms people present to primary care after COVID-19 infection and whether presentation differs in people who were not hospitalized, as well as post-long COVID mortality rates.Methods: We used routine data from the nationally representative primary care sentinel cohort of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (N=7,396,702), applying a predefined long COVID phenotype and grouped by whether the index infection occurred in hospital or in the community. We included COVID-19 infection cases from March 1, 2020, to April 1, 2021. We conducted a before-and-after analysis of long COVID symptoms prespecified by the Office of National Statistics, comparing symptoms presented between 1 and 6 months after the index infection matched with the same months 1 year previously. We conducted logistic regression analysis, quoting odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.Results: In total, 5.63% (416,505/7,396,702) and 1.83% (7623/416,505) of the patients had received a coded diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and diagnosis of, or referral for, long COVID, respectively. People with diagnosis or referral of long COVID had higher odds of presenting the prespecified symptoms after versus before COVID-19 infection (OR 2.66, 95% CI 2.46-2.88, for those with index community infection and OR 2.42, 95% CI 2.03-2.89, for those hospitalized). After an index community infection, patients were more likely to present with nonspecific symptoms (OR 3.44, 95% CI 3.00-3.95; P<.001) compared with after a hospital admission (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.56-2.80; P<.001). Mental health sequelae were more strongly associated with index hospital infections (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.64-2.96) than with index community infections (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.21-1.53; P<.001). People presenting to primary care after hospital infection were more likely to be men (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.25-1.64; P<.001), more socioeconomically deprived (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.24-1.63; P<.001), and with higher multimorbidity scores (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.57; P<.001) than those presenting after an index community infection. All-cause mortality in people with long COVID was associated with increasing age, male sex (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.34-9.24; P=.01), and higher multimorbidity score (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.34-3.29; P<.001). Vaccination was associated with reduced odds of mortality (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.35; P<.001).Conclusions: The low percentage of people recorded as having long COVID after COVID-19 infection reflects either low prevalence or underrecording. The characteristics and comorbidities of those presenting with long COVID after a community infection are different from those hospitalized. This study provides insights into the presentation of long COVID in primary care and implications for workload.

TI  - Mapping Seasonal Leaf Nutrients of Mangrove with Sentinel-2 Images and XGBoost Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the seasonal leaf nutrients of mangrove forests helps one to understand the dynamics of carbon (C) sequestration and to diagnose the availability and limitation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). To date, very little attention has been paid to mapping the seasonal leaf C, N, and P of mangrove forests with remote sensing techniques. Based on Sentinel-2 images taken in spring, summer, and winter, this study aimed to compare three machine learning models (XGBoost, extreme gradient boosting; RF, random forest; LightGBM, light gradient boosting machine) in estimating the three leaf nutrients and further to apply the best-performing model to map the leaf nutrients of 15 seasons from 2017 to 2021. The results showed that there were significant differences in leaf nutrients (p < 0.05) across the three seasons. Among the three machine learning models, XGBoost with sensitive spectral features of Sentinel-2 images was optimal for estimating the leaf C (R-2 = 0.655, 0.799, and 0.829 in spring, summer, and winter, respectively), N (R-2 = 0.668, 0.743, and 0.704) and P (R-2 = 0.539, 0.622, and 0.596) over the three seasons. Moreover, the red-edge (especially B6) and near-infrared bands (B8 and B8a) of Sentinel-2 images were efficient estimators of mangrove leaf nutrients. The information of species, elevation, and canopy structure (leaf area index [LAI] and canopy height) would be incorporated into the present model to improve the model accuracy and transferability in future studies.

TI  - What Makes Genesis Different?
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to those who read Genesis 1 through 11 as myth, the story of Genesis is historical narrative with a theological purpose (theo-history). The Hebrew theo-history of creation was undergirded by a worldview that did not converge with her neighbors but significantly diverged from the surrounding nations. While the literary style of Genesis has elements common to other ancient mythologies, the content itself is quite distinct. Unlike other ancient cosmologies, the Hebrew worldview perceived the people, places, and events of Genesis as historical and not merely religious symbols. The divergence of the Hebrew worldview from all ancient Near East (ANE) cultures is illustrated in three observations: (1) Genesis is monotheism not polytheism/panentheism, (2) Genesis is special revelation not cultic theology, and (3) Genesis is theo-history not myth or mytho-history. These three distinctives of Hebrew cosmology reflect a unique worldview shaped by divine revelation, and because Genesis was written in the genre of theo-history, Hebrew cosmology offers us a dependable foundation for knowing something true about our material origins, shaping ethical priorities, safeguarding the sacredness of human life, directing moral decision making, recognizing the significance of historical progress, and guiding scientific inquiry into the book of nature.

TI  - Human Fire Use and Management: A Global Database of Anthropogenic Fire Impacts for Modelling
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Human use and management of fire in landscapes have a long history and vary globally in purpose and impact. Existing local research on how people use and manage fire is fragmented across multiple disciplines and is diverse in methods of data collection and analysis. If progress is to be made on systematic understanding of human fire use and management globally, so that it might be better represented in dynamic global vegetation models, for example, we need improved synthesis of existing local research and literature. The database of anthropogenic fire impacts (DAFI) presented here is a response to this challenge. We use a conceptual framework that accounts for categorical differences in the land system and socio-economic context of human fire to structure a meta-study for developing the database. From the data collated, we find that our defined anthropogenic fire regimes have distinct quantitative signatures and identify seven main modes of fire use that account for 93% of fire instance records. We describe the underlying rationales of these seven modes of fire use, map their spatial distribution and summarise their quantitative characteristics, providing a new understanding that could become the basis of improved representation of anthropogenic fire in global process-based models. Our analysis highlights the generally small size of human fires (60% of DAFI records for mean size of deliberately started fires are <21 ha) and the need for continuing improvements in methods for observing small fires via remote sensing. Future efforts to model anthropogenic fire should avoid assuming that drivers are uniform globally and will be assisted by aligning remotely sensed data with field-based data and process understanding of human fire use and management.

TI  - A Selection of Experiments for Understanding the Strengths of Time Series SAR Data Analysis for Finding the Drivers Causing Phenological Changes in Paphos Forest, Cyprus
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing phenological changes are important for evaluating the natural regeneration process of forests, especially in Mediterranean areas where the regeneration of coniferous forests depends on seeds and the changes in blossoming time are influenced by climate change. The high temporal resolution of Sentinel-1 data allows the time series analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, but it is still unknown how these data could be utilised for better understanding forest phenology and climate-related alternations. This study investigates the phenological cycle of Paphos forest, Cyprus using SAR data from 1992 to 2021, acquired by ERS-1/2, Envisat and Sentinel-1. An average phenological diagram was created for each space mission and a more detailed analysis was performed from October 2014 to November 2021, using the higher temporal resolution of Sentinel-1 data. Meteorological data were used to better understand the drivers of blooming alternations. Using the interquartile range (IQR), outliers were detected and replaced using the Kalman filter imputation. Forecasting trend lines were used to estimate the amplitude of the summer peaks and the annual mean. The observation of the average phenology from each satellite mission showed that there were two main blooming peaks each year: the winter and the summer peak. We argue that the winter peak relates to increased foliage, water content and/or increased soil moisture. The winter peak was followed by a fall in February reaching the lower point around March, due to the act of pine processionary (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). The summer peak should relate to the annual regeneration of needles and the drop of the old ones. A delay in the summer peak-in August 2018-was associated with increased high temperatures in May 2018. Simultaneously, the appearance of one peak instead of two in the cVH time series during the period November 2014-October 2015 may be linked to a reduced act of the pine processionary associated with low November temperatures. Furthermore, there was an outlier in February 2016 with very low backscattering coefficients and it was associated with a drought year. Finally, predicting the amplitude of July 2020 returned high relevant Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE). Seven years of time series data are limiting for predicting using trend lines and many parameters need to be taken into consideration, including the increased rainfall between November 2018 and March 2020.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of reservoir-induced landslides is essential for assessing and mitigating the associated geoenvironmental hazards. The research utilises the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique for mapping and monitoring Reservoir-Induced Landslides (RIL). The rim area of the Baglihar Dam Reservoir on the Chenab river (Jammu and Kashmir, India) along National Highway NH-244 is chosen for the analysis. The slope movements are necessarily impacted by the reservoir drawdown effect (RDE) and the rainfall. 46 images from ascending and 70 images from descending track of Sentinel 1C-band SAR satellite have been used for the analysis. Further, ascending and descending results have been combined to estimate the 3D movement. Processing of both the stacks have yielded the Line of Sight (LoS) slope movement along the reservoir rim. The velocities retrieved vary from -95.1 mm/year to +85.1 mm/year. Precipitation was derived from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data, extracted from Google Earth Engine (GEE). The temporal correlation between the displacements and the local precipitation has been qualitatively analysed. The SAR interferometry results were used to identify the active zones.

TI  - A SPATIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF BLACK PINE HABITAT IN BANAT (ROMANIA)
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Both the European continent and Romania are occupied by significate forested areas, often represented by rare species or even virgin forests. The natural distribution of the black pine (Pinus nigra ssp. Banatica) in the Banat region of Romania is still a pending spatial problem. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to assess the sustainability of morphometric parameters in modelling of Banat black pine in Domogled and Cernei Mountains, using Geographic Information Systems instruments. A set of morphometric parameters (altitude, depth, density, slope, and curvature), econometric climatic indicators (Martonne and FAT) and Vegetation indexes (NDVI and SAW) have been derived from a 10m DEM, Sentinel 2 satellite images and WorldClim gridded data. For the modeled data, a contour of the area where the Banat black pine is found, which was validated by in situ mapping, was used. For the purpose of this study the dependent data set was split up into presence - absence of the Banat black pine and also the data was split into training and validation for both categories. For spatial analysis of the data ArcGIS 10.8.1 was used and for the statistical analysis R software was used. We obtained four models that used between two and six independent variables. All models were validated using AUC and R 2 McFadden and obtained very good scores (between 0,886 and 0,904 and between 0,37 and 0,42 respectively). The most important predictors were found to be Martonne Aridity Index, slope, and SAW. Based on our finding we can conclude that a geomorphometric modeling approach can be used, successfully, in explaining the spatial distribution of a tree species in a marginal environment.

TI  - REVIEW OF CROP YIELD ESTIMATION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES
T2  - SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The agriculture sector is subjected to constant challenge of yield deficit due to rising population, improper resource management and shrinking agricultural land. Advance yield estimates help in systematic planning to reduce such losses. However, prediction of accurate estimates is still an open challenge due to geographical diversity, crop diversity & crop area. Recently non-destructive approach has gained attention due to its robustness and provides easy availability of data from heterogeneous resources compared to its counterpart; destructive approach which is computational, resource intensive and hence less utilized. This paper conducts a detailed study on utilization of non-destructive approach to estimate yield taking into account, input feature, and methodology. We consider five major observations namely, data acquisition, pre-processing techniques, features, methodology, and result. Moreover, we summarize analysis of each observation, extract most prominent technique, the adopted methods, and finally recommends integration of different models that can be explored to improve accuracy.

TI  - Hydro-Geophysical Evaluation of the Regional Variability of Senegal's Terrestrial Water Storage Using Time-Variable Gravity Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data retrieval experiment has been instrumental in characterizing the global fluctuations in terrestrial water storage (Delta TWS) over the past 20 years. Given the limited availability of hydrological data, GRACE measurements are frequently combined with other climatic models, standardized precipitation index (SPI), and standardized temperature index (STI) data to examine the likelihood of such impacts on hydrology and calculate the groundwater storage changes (Delta GWS). The characterization of the intensity and variability of drought events has been identified based on the Terrestrial Water Storage Deficit Index (TWSI), derived from GRACE mass concentration blocks (mascons) over Senegal during the studied period (April 2002-December 2021). The results are: (1) The average annual precipitation (AAP) rate for the entire period was calculated at 692.5 mm/yr. (2) The GRACE-derived Delta TWS variations were calculated at +0.89 +/- 0.34, +0.07 +/- 0.36, +1.66 +/- 1.20, and +0.63 +/- 0.08 cm/yr for Periods I (April 2002-December 2009), II (January 2010-December 2017), III (January 2018-December 2021), and the entire period (April 2002-December 2021), respectively. (3) The Delta GWS changes were estimated to be +0.89 +/- 0.31, +0.085 +/- 0.33, +1.64 +/- 1.11, and +0.63 +/- 0.08 cm/yr for Periods I, II, II, and the entire period, respectively. (4) There is good agreement in some years and seasons according to the investigation of the link between the GRACE dataset, STI, and SPI. (5) Senegal's groundwater storage is increasing at a rate of 0.63 +/- 0.08 cm/yr (1.24 +/- 0.16 km(3)/yr) between April 2002 and December 2021. (6) Considering the yearly extraction rates of 1.13 +/- 0.11 cm/yr (2.22 +/- 0.22 km(3)/yr), an average recharge rate of +1.76 +/- 0.14 cm/yr (+3.46 +/- 0.28 km(3)/yr) was calculated for the studied area. The integrated strategy is instructive and economical.

TI  - The Relationship between Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent and Temperature Changes in the Northern Hemisphere Based on Data for Recent Decades
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimates of the relationship of the snow cover and sea ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere with surface air temperature in the annual cycle and interannual variability are obtained from modern satellite data and reanalysis data over the 1979-2020 period. The results indicate a general significant coherence and negative correlation between surface air temperature and the snow cover and sea ice extent not only in the annual cycle, but also for most months in the interannual variability. At the same time, specific features appear in the fall months, associated with regional features of the variability of temperature and the snow cover during the season of its formation in Eurasia and North America. For the winter months, an increase in the absolute value of parameters of the sensitivity of the snow cover and sea ice extent to temperature variations in recent decades and of the coefficients of their correlation is noted, while for the warm months, the opposite changes are observed. Along with a statistically significant negative correlation of the total snow cover and sea ice extent with variations in the hemispheric surface air temperature in the annual cycle, cross-wavelet analysis revealed a statistically significant negative correlation for the longest-term interdecadal variations with a manifestation in recent years of significant anticorrelation for interannual variations, in particular for variations with periods typical for El Nino events.

TI  - Toward Atmospheric Correction Algorithms for Sentinel-3/OLCI Images of Productive Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of remote sensing imagery over optically complex waters is still a challenging task. Even algorithms showing a good accuracy for moderate and extremely turbid waters need to be tested when being used for eutrophic inland basins. Such a test was carried out in this study on the example of a Sentinel-3/OLCI image of the productive waters of the Gorky Reservoir during the period of intense blue-green algal bloom using data on the concentration of chlorophyll a and remote sensing reflectance measured from the motorboat at many points of the reservoir. The accuracy of four common atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms was examined. All of them showed unsatisfactory accuracy due to incorrect determination of atmospheric aerosol parameters and aerosol radiance. The calculated aerosol optical depth (AOD) spectra varied widely (AOD(865) = 0.005 - 0.692) even over a small area (up to 10 x 10 km) and correlated with the measured chlorophyll a. As a result, a part of the high water-leaving signal caused by phytoplankton bloom was taken as an atmosphere signal. A significant overestimation of atmospheric aerosol parameters, as a consequence, led to a strong underestimation of the remote sensing reflectance and low accuracy of the considered AC algorithms. To solve this problem, an algorithm with a fixed AOD was proposed. The fixed AOD spectrum was determined in the area with relatively "clean" water as 5 percentiles of AOD in all water pixels. The proposed algorithm made it possible to obtain the remote sensing reflectance with high accuracy. The slopes of linear regression are close to 1 and the intercepts tend to zero in almost all spectral bands. The determination coefficients are more than 0.9; the bias, mean absolute percentage error, and root-mean-square error are notably lower than for other AC algorithms.

AB  - In Russian modernism, the work of writer Vasily Rozanov (1856-1919) presents an understudied case of constructing a worldview based on the study of the parallel history of human physicality and artefacts, which he articulated within the framework of the physical and metaphysical. I argue that Rozanov widened the domain of what was viewed as "compelling visuality" at his time, in line with the subjective synthesising principles of his worldview. He looked in art for the manifestations of that which he considered to be eternal and trans-historical: the mystery of the metaphysical roots of human sexuality.

TI  - Simulation of land use/land cover changes and urban expansion in Estonia by a hybrid ANN-CA-MCA model and utilizing spectral-textural indices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the recent two decades, land use/land cover (LULC) drastically changed in Estonia. Even though the population decreased by 11%, noticeable agricultural and forest land areas were turned into urban land. In this work, we analyzed those LULC changes by mapping the spatial characteristics of LULC and urban expansion in the years 2000-2019 in Estonia. Moreover, using the revealed spatiotemporal transitions of LULC, we simulated LULC and urban expansion for 2030. Landsat 5 and 8 data were used to estimate 147 spectral-textural indices in the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. After that, 19 selected indices were used to model LULC changes by applying the hybrid artificial neural network, cellular automata, and Markov chain analysis (ANN-CA-MCA). While determining spectral-textural indices is quite common for LULC classifications, utilization of these continues indices in LULC change detection and examining these indices at the landscape scale is still in infancy. This country-wide modeling approach provided the first comprehensive projection of future LULC utilizing spectral-textural indices. In this work, we utilized the hybrid ANN-CA-MCA model for predicting LULC in Estonia for 2030; we revealed that the predicted changes in LULC from 2019 to 2030 were similar to the observed changes from 2011 to 2019. The predicted change in the area of artificial surfaces was an increased rate of 1.33% to reach 787.04 km(2) in total by 2030. Between 2019 and 2030, the other significant changes were the decrease of 34.57 km(2) of forest lands and the increase of agricultural lands by 14.90 km(2) and wetlands by 9.31 km(2). These findings can develop a proper course of action for long-term spatial planning in Estonia. Therefore, a key policy priority should be to plan for the stable care of forest lands to maintain biodiversity.

TI  - The Use of Sentinel-3 Altimetry Data to Assess Wind Speed from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model: Application over the Gulf of Cadiz
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the quality performance and the capabilities of altimetry derived wind speed (WS) retrievals from the altimeters on-board Copernicus satellites Sentinel-3A/B (S3A/B) for the spatial assessment of WS outputs from the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model over the complex area of the Gulf of Cadiz (GoC), Spain. In order to assess the applicability of the altimetry data for this purpose, comparisons between three different WS data sources over the area were evaluated: in situ measurements, S3A/B 20 Hz altimetry data, and WRF model outputs. Sentinel-3A/B WS data were compared against two different moored buoys to guarantee the quality of the data over the GoC, resulting in satisfying scores (average results: RMSE = 1.21 m/s, r = 0.93 for S3A and RMSE = 1.36 m/s, r = 0.89 for S3B). Second, the WRF model was validated with in situ data from four different stations to ensure the correct performance over the area. Finally, the spatial variability of the WS derived from the WRF model was compared with the along-track altimetry-derived WS. The analysis was carried out under different wind synoptic conditions. Qualitative and quantitative results (average RMSE < 1.0 m/s) show agreement between both data sets under low/high wind regimes, proving that the spatial coverage of satellite altimetry enables the spatial assessment of high-resolution numerical weather prediction models in complex water-covered zones.

TI  - Runoff estimation using satellite images in sparsely gauged basins: a case of Nzoia River Basin, Kenya
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nzoia River Basin is an important water resources development and management unit not only in Kenya but also in the region. The basin drains into Lake Victoria, frequently experiences severe flooding, and the catchment area has recently been dominated by unsustainable human activities. The resulting perturbations coupled with a changing climate could have far-reaching consequences in the near future. Efforts to understand the influence of the changes are complicated by a dwindling hydro-meteorological network. This study explored the efficacy of satellite data to estimate run-off time series for the basin. NAM model in Mike 11 was set-up, calibrated and validated. A run-off time series was then generated. The Goddard Earth Observing System model version 5 (GEOS-5) satellite data from NASA was then used to derive run-off series when calibrated and when not. The results were compared to identify which approach resulted to better estimates. The optimal runoff model parameters observed were 12.7 for Umax, 136 for Lmax, 0.2 for CQOF, 1100 for CKIF, 61.65 for CK1, 2, 0.248 for TOF, 0.198 for TIF, 0.0495 for TG and 2825 for CKBF. These gave a water balance of about 0.98 and root mean square error of about 460 with R-2 of 0.9 and 0.8 for calibration and validation, respectively. Calibrated GEOS-5 data performed reasonably well in runoff estimation for Nzoia basin. While non-calibrated satellite data was poor with an r-squared of 0.6 in relation to observed discharge, calibrated data performed way better with an r-squared of 0.96 for daily values. Satellite-derived runoff was found to overestimate the discharge especially the peak discharges. This study showed that satellite data such as NASA's GEOS-5 when adequately calibrated provide suitable estimates for discharges in basins that are sparsely gauged.

TI  - Geological and Mineralogical Mapping Based on Statistical Methods of Remote Sensing Data Processing of Landsat-8: A Case Study in the Southeastern Transbaikalia, Russia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The work considers the suitability of using multispectral satellite remote sensing data Landsat-8 for conducting regional geological and mineralogical mapping of the territory of south-eastern Transbaikalia (Russia) based on statistical methods for processing remote sensing data in conditions of medium-low-mountain relief and continental climate. The territory was chosen as the object of study due to its diverse metallogenic specialization (Au, U, Mo, Pb-Zn, Sn, W, Ta, Nb, Li, fluorite). Diversity in composition and age of ore-bearing massifs of intrusive, volcanogenic, and sedimentary rocks are also of interest. The work describes the initial data and considers the procedure for their pre-processing, including radiometric and atmospheric correction. Statistical processing algorithms to increase spectral information content of satellite data Landsat-8 were used. They include: principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction, and independent component analysis. Eigenvector matrices analyzed on the basis of statistical processing results and two-dimensional correlation graphs were built to compare thematic layers with geological material classes: oxide/hydroxide group minerals containing transition iron ions (Fe3+ and Fe3+/Fe2+); a group of clay minerals containing A1-OH and Fe, Mg-OH; and minerals containing Fe2+ and vegetation cover. Pseudo-colored RGB composites representing the distribution and multiplication of geological material classes are generated and interpreted according to the results of statistical methods. Integration of informative thematic layers using a fuzzy logic model was carried out to construct a prediction scheme for detecting hydrothermal mineralization. The received schema was compared with geological information, and positive conclusions about territory suitability for further remote mapping research of hydrothermally altered zones and hypergenesis products in order to localize areas promising for identifying hydrothermal metasomatic mineralization were made.

TI  - Smoke Plumes from Wildfires and the Electrical State of the Surface Air Layer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using ground-based observation and satellite remote sensing data from 2006 to 2020 the smoke effect from distant wildfires in Siberia on the electrical state of the surface air layer is studied. The cases are considered where smoke covers the troposphere down to the surface layer and where smoke is observed only in the middle and upper troposphere. It is found that smoke from wildfires in these cases strongly but differently affects the electrical state of the surface air layer.

TI  - Flooding in Landsat across tidal systems (FLATS): An index for intermittent tidal filtering and frequency detection in salt marsh environments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can provide critical information about the health and productivity of coastal wetland ecosystems, including extent, phenology, and carbon sequestration potential. Unfortunately, periodic inundation from tides dampens the spectral signal and, in turn, causes remote sensing-based models to produce unreliable results, altering estimates of ecosystem function and services. We created the Flooding in Landsat Across Tidal Systems (FLATS) index to identify flooded pixels in Landsat 8 30-meter data and provide an inundated pixel filtering method. Novel applications of FLATS including inundation frequency and pattern detection are also demonstrated. The FLATS index was developed to identify flooding in Spartina alterniflora tidal marshes. We used ground truth inundation data from a PhenoCam and Landsat 8 pixels within the PhenoCam field of view on Sapelo Island, GA, USA to create the index. The FLATS index incorporates a normalized difference water index (NDWI) and a phenology-related variable into a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicted the presence or absence of marsh flooding. The FLATS equation for predicting flooding is 1-1/(-1.6+20.0*NDWI)(+68.6*Pheno)(e)(4,6)(3,4), and we found that a cutoff 0.1 was the optimized value for separating flooded and non-flooded pixel classes. FLATS identified flooded pixels with an overall accuracy of 96% and 93% across training data and novel testing data, respectively. FLATS correctly identified true flooded pixels with a sensitivity of 97% and 81%, across training and testing data, respectively. We established the need to apply FLATS when conducting vegetation time-series analysis in coastal marshes in order to reduce the per-pixel reflectance variations attributed to tidal flooding. We found that FLATS identified 12.5% of pixels as flooded in Landsat 8 tidal marsh vegetation time-series from 2013 to 2020, after traditional quality control and preprocessing steps were conducted, which could then be filtered out or modeled separately in order to conduct remotely sensed vegetation assessments. Therefore, in tidal wetlands, we recommend incorporating FLATS into Landsat 8 preprocessing prior to vegetation analysis. We also demonstrated innovative applications for the FLATS index, particularly in detecting flooding frequency and flooding patterns relevant to the broader biophysical modeling framework, including mapping marsh vulnerability due to fluctuation in inundation frequency. The FLATS index represents advancements in the understanding and application of inundation indices for coastal marshes.

TI  - The Influence of Data Density and Integration on Forest Canopy Cover Mapping Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series in Mediterranean Oak Forests
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy cover (FCC) is one of the most important forest inventory parameters and plays a critical role in evaluating forest functions. This study examines the potential of integrating Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map FCC in the heterogeneous Mediterranean oak forests of western Iran in different data densities (one-year datasets vs. three-year datasets). This study used very high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth, gridded points, and field inventory plots to generate a reference dataset. Based on it, four FCC classes were defined, namely non-forest, sparse forest (FCC = 1-30%), medium-density forest (FCC = 31-60%), and dense forest (FCC > 60%). In this study, three machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), were used in the Google Earth Engine and their performance was compared for classification. Results showed that the SVM produced the highest accuracy on FCC mapping. The three-year time series increased the ability of all ML models to classify FCC classes, in particular the sparse forest class, which was not distinguished well by the one-year dataset. Class-level accuracy assessment results showed a remarkable increase in F-1 scores for sparse forest classification by integrating S-1 and S-2 (10.4% to 18.2% increased for the CART and SVM ML models, respectively). In conclusion, the synergetic use of S-1 and S-2 spectral temporal metrics improved the classification accuracy compared to that obtained using only S-2. The study relied on open data and freely available tools and can be integrated into national monitoring systems of FCC in Mediterranean oak forests of Iran and neighboring countries with similar forest attributes.

TI  - Heavy metal contamination of Diplodus vulgaris (Sparidae) in the Gulf of Annaba (North-eastern Algeria).
T2  - Ecology Environment and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate heavy metals (Lead and Cadmium) contamination in the muscles of a local sea fish species, the black-headed Sar Diploddus vulgaris. We selected two sites in the Gulf of Annaba for this study (Sidi Salem fishing site&the Port of Annaba) and compared results to a reference site (Cap de Garde), which is at a valuable distance from any source of pollution, and is considered as a relatively clean site, while Sidi Salem and Port of Annaba are known to be exposed sites to various sources of industrial, urban and harbor pollution. Analyses have been carried out on 70 samples of dorsal-lateral muscles of fishes weighting from 30 g to 280 g and sizing between 11.1 cm to 26.5 cm. The results showed the presence of both metals in all samples during the 6 months of our study (from November to June) and in the 3 sites with variable rates. Cadmium levels varied from 0.032 to 0.239 mg/kg/fw. Fish meat from Sidi Salem collected during the months of November and February displayed a rate of 0.038-0.074 mg/kg/fw of Cd before reaching a higher value in March estimated to 0.202 mg/kg/fw of Cd. From April to June, the lateral dorsal muscles were contaminated by lower Cd contents. Pb concentrations varied from 0.014 to 0.149 mg/kg/fw. The highest value was recorded during the month of March at Sidi Salem. Moreover, Pb concentrations in muscle tissues increased significantly compared to the other studied sites. Very high significance differences were found between Cap de Garde and Port of Annaba and Sidi Salem for both metals (Pb and Cd). To conclude, the presence of heavy metals in Diplodus vulgaris is due to the diet and the impact of anthropogenic activities on the biotope of the fish and therefore poses a public health problem linked to frequent consumption of this fish. Also, D. vulgaris appears to be a suitable sentinel species for the assessment of ecotoxicological risk in the Gulf of Annaba.

TI  - Effects of Iron Minerals on the Compressive Strengths and Microstructural Properties of Metakaolin-Based Geopolymer Materials
T2  - GELS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aims to investigate the influence of iron minerals on the amorphous phase content, compressive strengths and the microstructural properties of the geopolymer materials. Geopolymer materials were prepared by the substitution of metakaolin by 10 and 20 wt.% of each iron mineral sample. Sodium waterglass from rice husk ash was used as a hardener, and metakaolin was used as an aluminosilicate source. The X-ray patterns show that the iron minerals denoted FR and FB are associated with hematite and magnetite, respectively. FY contains goethite together with a significant content of kaolinite and quartz. It is observed in the XRD patterns and FTIR absorption spectra that the additions of hematite, magnetite and goethite remain largely unreacted in the geopolymer binder. The compressive strengths of the related geopolymer composites show some significant variations indicating certain effects for mechanical stability obtained: 10 wt.% replacement of metakaolin by hematite increased the compressive strength from 51.1 to 55.5 MPa, while 20 wt.% hematite caused a decrease to 44.9 MPa. Furthermore, 10 and 20 wt.% replacement with FB revealed decreased values 47.0 and 40.3 MPa, respectively. It was also found that 10 and 20 wt.% of FY caused lower values of 30.9 and 39.1 MPa, respectively. The micrographs of geopolymer materials present some voids and cracks. The denser matrix is related to a superior gel formation producing a better glue between the crystalline additions. The unsubstituted geopolymer sample provides with about 50% the highest X-ray-amorphous content, whereas the substituted samples range between 35 and 45%, indicating systematically smaller gel contents without any clear trend with the compressive strength variation, however. The strength dependencies reveal more complex interaction between the gel and crystalline additions.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Interaction Network for Multispectral Image and Panchromatic Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning (DL), an increasing number of DL-based methods are applied in pansharpening. Benefiting from the powerful feature extraction capability of deep learning, DL-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in pansharpening. However, most DL-based methods simply fuse multi-spectral (MS) images and panchromatic (PAN) images by concatenating, which can not make full use of the spectral information and spatial information of MS and PAN images, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a spectral-spatial interaction Network (SSIN) for pansharpening. Different from previous works, we extract the features of PAN and MS, respectively, and then interact them repetitively to incorporate spectral and spatial information progressively. In order to enhance the spectral-spatial information fusion, we further propose spectral-spatial attention (SSA) module to yield a more effective spatial-spectral information transfer in the network. Extensive experiments on QuickBird, WorldView-4, and WorldView-2 images demonstrate that our SSIN significantly outperforms other methods in terms of both objective assessment and visual quality.

TI  - Comparison of Stratospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Measurements by Ground- and Satellite-Based Methods
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the measurements of the CO2 content in the lower stratosphere (12-18 km altitude layer) using a ground-based Bruker 125HR Fourier-transform spectrometer and ACE satellite measurements in 2009-2019. The analysis of the two types of measurements showed a good agreement between them. On the average, the ground-based CO2 measurements exceed the satellite data by 2.8 ppm (less than 1%), the standard deviations being similar to 5.0 ppm. The correlation coefficient between the measurements by the two methods is 0.77. The ground-based and satellite CO2 measurements show weak seasonal variations, opposite to those in tropospheric CO2: the CO2 content in the lower stratosphere is maximal in summer and minimal in winter.

TI  - Methods for Characterizing Groundwater Resources with Sparse In Situ Data
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of groundwater resources is required for sustainable management. Due to the cost of installing monitoring wells and challenges in collecting and managing in situ data, groundwater data are sparse-especially in developing countries. In this study, we demonstrate an analysis of long-term groundwater storage changes using temporally sparse but spatially dense well data, where each well had as few as one historical groundwater measurement. We developed methods to synthetically estimate groundwater table elevation (WTE) times series by clustering wells using two different methods; a uniform grid and k-means-constrained clustering to create pseudo-wells. These pseudo-wells had a more complete groundwater level time history, which we then temporally and spatially interpolated to analyze groundwater storage changes in an aquifer. We demonstrated these methods on the Beryl-Enterprise aquifer in Utah, USA, where other researchers quantified the groundwater storage depletion rate, and the wells had a large number of historical measurements. We randomly used one measurement per well and showed that our methods yielded storage depletion rates similar to published values. We applied the method to a region in southern Niger where wells had only one measurement per well, and showed that our estimated groundwater storage change trend reasonably matched that which was calculated using GRACE satellite data.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Urbanization and Eco-Environmental Quality on Regional Carbon Storage: A Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Analysis Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms, intensity, and spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the impacts of urbanization and eco-environmental quality on carbon storage is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality goals. This study constructed a multiscale spatio-temporal analysis framework using multi-source remote sensing data, the InVEST model, and the multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model. Then, the effects of multiple factors on regional carbon storage were assessed in an empirical study involving 199 counties in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. The results showed that the carbon storage loss in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2010 to 2018 was 58.87 Tg C, with an annual relative loss rate of 0.16%. The MGWR model used in this study explained more than 98% of the spatial variation in regional carbon storage. In contrast, the impacts of various urbanization and eco-environmental indicators on regional carbon storage varied with the spatial and temporal variation. Overall, urban land structure and vegetation growth strongly influenced regional carbon storage resulting from urbanization and eco-environmental quality, respectively. In addition, based on an analysis of spatial context, MGWR suggests that the northwestern mountains in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region have a greater potential to store more carbon than the other regions. This study also details the impact of future sustainable land use on regional carbon storage. Our findings can provide a scientific reference for formulating relevant carbon storage conservation policies.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Pattern Analysis of Land Use and Water Yield in Water Source Region of Middle Route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The water source area of the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is an important water conservation and ecological protection area in China. Based on remote sensing data, this paper analyzed the evolution process of land use/cover change in water source region in the past 35 years. Then, based on the InVEST model, the spatial-temporal patterns of water yield in the water source region were calculated with land use cover, meteorology and soil data as inputs. The impacts of climate factors such as precipitation and temperature and land use change on water yield were discussed, and the responses of water yield to these two changes were also discussed. The results show that from 1985 to 2020, the average water yield depth in the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project increases first and then decreases, from 615 mm in 1985 to 738 mm in 2000, and then decreases to 521 mm in 2020. The spatial heterogeneity of the water-producing capacity is obvious. The high value of the water-producing capacity is concentrated in the Daba Mountain area in the south, while the low values are concentrated in the Hanzhong Basin, Ankang Basin and the eastern plain area. The spatial pattern of water producing depth has no obvious change. The average water yield depth of forest, grassland and shrub in the region was the largest, and forest and cultivated land were the main contributors to the total water yield of the region, providing 82% and 14% of the total water yield in 2020. Precipitation has a significant effect on water yield, while land use/cover change has a small effect on water yield.

TI  - Changes in Forest Conditions in a Siberian Larch Forest Induced by an Extreme Wet Event
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The taiga forest, a semi-arid and nitrogen-limited ecosystem on permafrost, has changed under extreme wet events. This study aims to understand the changes that occurred in a larch forest in Eastern Siberia after the wet event of 2006-2007. In the summer of 2018, studies were conducted at the Spasskaya Pad Experimental Forest Station near Yakutsk, Russia, where a transect (60 m x 510 m) with 34 plots (30 m x 30 m) was set. It included intact sites and affected sites with different levels of forest damage, owing to the extreme wet event. We observed spatial variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from Landsat satellite-observed data, and the foliar delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N (carbon/nitrogen) ratio obtained from the needle samples of 105 mature larch trees. Our results reveal that the affected plots had a lower NDVI than the intact plots, resulting from a difference in tree stand density. In addition, the stand density is suggested to be a controlling factor in the spatial variations in the foliar C/N and delta C-13 values based on their significant relationships with the NDVI in June. We concluded that the larch trees from the regenerating forests in the affected areas have a higher nitrogen level and light availability (relatively low C/N and high delta C-13) because of the slight competition for resources, owing to a low-stand density. This may lead to further succession of the larch forests after the extreme wet event.

TI  - Reclamation of the war affected agricultural land in east of Ukraine
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most critical components of Ukrainian economic complex is its agriculture. The development within the industry is generally determined by the current economy's state which is also impacted by the agricultural indicator. The research aims to study the renewal and reclamation of agricultural lands, which has deteriorated during the military operations especially in the east of Ukraine. Satellite data set was used, which was obtained based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images and covers the whole Ukraine with a spatial resolution of 232 m. The annual information on inactive and active agricultural land was then used to calculate the frequency of fallow/active land at each pixel level and to translate the subject/action series on neglect trajectories. The factors determining reclamation are related to the suitability of the land for agriculture. Accessibility to major cities was also important because most of the renewal and reclamation occurred closer to population centers, but this influence varied East of Ukraine. These factors suggest that renewal and reclamation patterns were primarily driven by factors related to land productivity, with renewal and reclamation focused on the most promising sites.

TI  - Combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Data in Google Earth Engine to Derive Higher Resolution Land Surface Temperature Maps in Urban Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) satellite imagery collected by multispectral scanners is important to map land surface temperature on a global scale. However, the TIR spectral bands are typically available in coarser spatial resolution than other multispectral bands of shorter wavelengths. Therefore, the spatial resolution of the derived land surface temperature (LST) is limited to around 100 m. This constrains the applications of such thermal satellite sensors in which finer detail of LST spatial pattern is relevant, especially in an urban environment where the land cover structure is complex. Among the missions deployed on the Earth's orbit, NASA's TIRS sensor onboard Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, and ASTER onboard Terra provide the highest spatial resolution of the thermal band. On the other hand, ESA's Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery is collected at a higher spatial resolution of 10 m with a 5-day temporal resolution, but scanning in the TIR band is not available. This study makes use of the known relationship between LST and land cover metrics, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), built-up index (NDBI), and water index (NDWI). We define a multiple linear regression model based on the spectral indices and LST derived from Landsat 8 data to inform the same model in which the equivalent spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 are used to predict LST at 10 m resolution. Results of this approach are demonstrated in a case study for Kosice city, Slovakia, where the multiple linear model based on Landsat 8 data achieved an R-2 of 0.642. The correlation between the observed Landsat 8 LST and predicted LST from Sentinel-2 aggregated to the same resolution as the observed LST was high (r = 0.91). Despite the imperfections of the downscaling model, the derived LST at 10 m resolution provides a better perception of the LST field that can be easily associated with land cover features present in urban environment. The LST downscaling approach was implemented into Google Earth Engine. It provides a user-friendly online application that can be used for any city or urban region for generating a more realistic spatial pattern of LST than can be directly observed by contemporary Earth observation satellites. The tool aids in urban decision making and planning on how to mitigate overheating of cities to improve the life quality of their citizens.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of land use/cover, rainfall, and flood incidents in Eti-Osa, Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding in Lagos State has been on the rise in the past two decades, especially in the Eti-Osa area of the state. This is largely due to the increased volume of rainfall associated with climate variability and sea level rise. Flooding incidents have led to loss of lives and properties. The objective of this study is to examine the dynamics of flood occurrences in the Eti-Osa area of Lagos metropolis. Rainfall data for the area covering a period of 30 years (1990 to 2019) were obtained from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) in Lagos, and analyzed using the basic descriptive statistical technique. The purpose was to evaluate rainfall characteristics that were influencing flooding events in the area. Furthermore, remotely sensed multi-date Landsat imageries of 1990, 1997, 2001, 2012, and 2017 were obtained, and analyzed to determine how land use and land cover characteristics have changed and have been affected by flooding over the study period. The data were subjected to digital image processing and supervised classification was carried out on the images of the various dates. Results showed that flooding became prevalent as more areas became built up and as vegetated areas declined Also, flooding events appeared to be responsive to the climatic extremes. Moreover, poor drainage, increased population numbers, and non-compliance to building and current environmental regulations were key factors that exacerbated the increased prevalence of flooding in the area. The study recommended that flood control policies, including land-use planning for the area, need to be pursued urgently.

TI  - Change in the Urban Landscape of the Drakensberg Mountain Region, South Africa: A Case Study of Phuthaditjhaba
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The settled landscape in the Drakensberg Mountain region of South Africa is characterized by increasing urbanization. Some of the supposedly rural settlements in the region have experienced increasing change in their landscapes over the last 3 decades, resulting in significant land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Among such settlements, Phuthaditjhaba and its environs are slowly becoming a metropolitan area. Based on conceptual considerations regarding sustainable urban development, we assessed LULC change using 4 Landsat images from 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2019 and a combination of unsupervised and supervised classification methods. The images were classified into 4 LULC classes. Between 1989 and 2019, the urban built-up area in Phuthaditjhaba increased from about 5% to 19%, representing a total increase of 270%. However, the greatest increase in land cover was in bare surface at the expense of vegetated areas, including farmland, which decreased from about 45% to 15%. The increase in bare surface could be due to fires. Built-up areas also increased due to a consistent increase in population density in the study area. We further described spatial patterns in LULC using selected landscape metrics. A decrease in patch density (PD) and cohesion, coupled with constant edge density (ED) and an increase in the fractal dimensional index (FDI), indicates fragmentation and less connectivity between 1989 and 1999; we interpret this as a sign of unsustainability. An increase in PD and cohesion and fluctuations in ED and FDI show that land patterns were more aggregated between 2009 and 2019. At the class level, an increase in PD, cohesion, and ED also showed more aggregated land patterns, which was confirmed by the mean patch size. The FDI revealed greater connectivity, which we also interpreted as unsustainable because of the increase in bare surface and built-up areas. Integrative coplanning and comanagement of land use and allocation are needed to ensure sustainable development.

TI  - Assessment of Two Stochastic Cloud Subcolumn Generators Using Observed Fields of Vertically Resolved Cloud Extinction
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate two stochastic subcolumn generators used in GCMs to emulate subgrid cloud variability enabling comparisons with satellite observations and simulations of certain physical processes. Our evaluation necessitated the creation of a reference observational dataset that resolves horizontal and vertical cloud variability. The dataset combines two CloudSat cloud products that resolve two-dimensional cloud optical depth variability of liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds when blended at & SIM;200 m vertical and & SIM;2 km horizontal scales. Upon segmenting the dataset to individual "scenes, " mean profiles of the cloud fields are passed as input to generators that produce scene-level cloud subgrid variability. The assessment of generator performance at the scale of individual scenes and in a mean sense is largely based on inferred joint histograms that partition cloud fraction within predetermined combinations of cloud-top pressure-cloud optical thickness ranges. Our main finding is that both generators tend to underestimate optically thin clouds, while one of them also tends to overestimate some cloud types of moderate and high optical thickness. Associated radiative flux errors are also calculated by applying a simple transformation to the cloud fraction histogram errors, and are found to approach values almost as high as 3 W m(-2) for the cloud radiative effect in the shortwave part of the spectrum.

TI  - Datasets for the assessment of changes in the incidence, extents, and spatial patterns of inundations in the Cambodian Mekong Delta, based on a water level - flood link calculated from in-situ water levels, and Sentinel-derived inundation maps
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This brief contains the data needed to calculate and assess the robustness of a water level - flood link (WAFL) in the Cambodian Mekong Delta, which was used to analyze changes in the long-term behavior of Monsoon inundations in the region. The data comprises the WAFL raster (.tif) files for two zones in the delta. Zone A is located on the right bank of the Bassac River, a distributary of the Mekong. Zone B is bracketed between the Mekong River and the Bassac River. The WAFL was calculated by linking water levels mea-sured by the Mekong River Commission (MRC) at the hydrological station in Koh Khel, with inundation maps derived from Sentinel-1 and-2 images taken between 2017 and 2021. The final WAFL raster files provides a basis for estimating inundation extents using in-situ water levels.Furthermore, this brief includes data used for the assessment of WAFL, including in-situ water level data and the extents of natural vegetation in the case study area in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. The former was collected using a differential pressure logger. The latter was calculated from historical Landsat image composites.Finally, raster files representing the incidence and duration of inundations in the case study area before and after the year 2008 are provided. These were calculated based on the WAFL and the MRC water levels. For each area, before- and after-images are available, as well as a raster representing the change between the two.To simplify visualization and geographical location, shapefiles (.shp) of the study area and the location of the in-situ logger are also provided.

TI  - CD-TransUNet: A Hybrid Transformer Network for the Change Detection of Urban Buildings Using L-Band SAR Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The change detection of urban buildings is currently a hotspot in the research area of remote sensing, which plays a vital role in urban planning, disaster assessments and surface dynamic monitoring. SAR images have unique characteristics compared with traditional optical images, mainly including abundant image information and large data volume. However, the majority of currently used SAR images for the detection of changes in buildings have the problems of missing the detection of small buildings and poor edge segmentation. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach based on deep learning for changing building detection, which we called CD-TransUNet. It should be noted that CD-TransUNet is an end-to-end encoding-decoding hybrid Transformer model that combines the UNet and Transformer. Additionally, to enhance the precision of feature extraction and to reduce the computational complexity, the CD-TransUNet integrates coordinate attention (CA), atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and depthwise separable convolution (DSC). In addition, by sending the differential images to the input layer, the CD-TransUNet can focus more on building changes over a large scale while ignoring the changes in other land types. At last, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using a pair of ALOS-2(L-band) acquisitions, and the comparative experimental results obtained from other baseline models show that the precision of the CD-TransUNet is much higher and the Kappa value can reach 0.795. Furthermore, the low missed alarms and the accurate building edge reflect that the proposed method is more appropriate for building changing detection tasks.

TI  - Land Use Dynamics and Impact on Regional Climate Post-Tehri Dam in the Bhilangana Basin, Garhwal Himalaya
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are a dynamic process determined by natural factors as well as the degree of human interaction in spatial and temporal perspectives. The present study focuses on analysing the LULC changes in the Bhilangana basin post-Tehri dam construction in the Garhwal Himalaya. Landsat series satellite images were used for three time periods to quantify spatial and temporal changes in the LULC using unsupervised classification techniques. The calculations of the areal coverage and change detection were carried out using the ArcGIS 10.3 software. The study finds that LULC changes were observed in the area surrounding the Tehri reservoir. The area under forest cover decreased by 54.71 km(2), which is -5.7% of the geographical area, followed by agricultural land by 6.06 km(2) (-0.4%) and scrubland and grass cover by 4.23 km(2) (-0.28%) during the decade 2000 to 2010. Gradually, due to compensatory afforestation, forest cover increased by 5.65% in the period 2010-2020. A significant relationship with climatic variability is also established with LULC change in the region. The presence of a large water surface at a high altitude modified the albedo and air temperature and increased the atmospheric humidity and precipitation pattern. This study would be vital in understanding the climatic variability in the Himalayas and its impact on the community, environment and climate.

TI  - Forecasting Live Fuel Moisture of <i>Adenostema fasciculatum</i> and Its Relationship to Regional Wildfire Dynamics across Southern California Shrublands
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In seasonally dry environments, the amount of water held in living plant tissue-live fuel moisture (LFM)-is central to vegetation flammability. LFM-driven changes in wildfire size and frequency are particularly important throughout southern California shrublands, which typically produce intense, rapidly spreading wildfires. However, the relationship between spatiotemporal variation in LFM and resulting long-term regional patterns in wildfire size and frequency within these shrublands is less understood. In this study, we demonstrated a novel method for forecasting the LFM of a critical fuel component throughout southern California chaparral, Adenostema fasciculatum (chamise) using gridded climate data. We then leveraged these forecasts to evaluate the historical relationships of LFM to wildfire size and frequency across chamise-dominant California shrublands. We determined that chamise LFM is strongly associated with fire extent, size, and frequency throughout southern California shrublands, and that LFM-wildfire relationships exhibit different thresholds across three distinct LFM domains. Additionally, the cumulative burned area and number of fires increased dramatically when LFM fell below 62%. These results demonstrate that LFM mediates multiple aspects of regional wildfire dynamics, and can be predicted with sufficient accuracy to capture these dynamics. Furthermore, we identified three distinct LFM 'domains' that were characterized by different frequencies of ignition and spread. These domains are broadly consistent with the management thresholds currently used in identifying periods of fire danger.

TI  - Cloud Removal Using Gaussian Process Regression for Optical Image Reconstruction
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud removal is often required to construct time-series sets of optical images for environmental monitoring. In regression-based cloud removal, the selection of an appropriate regression model and the impact analysis of the input images significantly affect the prediction performance. This study evaluates the potential of Gaussian process (GP) regression for cloud removal and also analyzes the effects of cloud-free optical images and spectral bands on prediction performance. Unlike other machine learning-based regression models, GP regression provides uncertainty information and automatically optimizes hyperparameters. An experiment using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images was conducted for cloud removal in the two agricultural regions. The prediction performance of GP regression was compared with that of random torest (RF) regression. Various combinations of input images and multi-spectral bands were considered for quantitative evaluations. The experimental results showed that using multi-temporal images with multi-spectral bands as inputs achieved the best prediction accuracy. Highly correlated adjacent multi-spectral bands and temporally correlated multi-temporal images resulted in an improved prediction accuracy. The prediction performance of GP regression was significantly improved in predicting the near-infrared band compared to that of RF regression. Estimating the distribution function of input data in GP regression could reflect the variations in the considered spectral band with a broader range. In particular, GP regression was superior to RF regression for reproducing structural patterns at both sites in terms of structural similarity. In addition, uncertainty information provided by GP regression showed a reasonable similarity to prediction errors for some sub-areas, indicating that uncertainty estimates may be used to measure the prediction result quality. These findings suggest that GP regression could be beneficial for cloud removal and optical image reconstruction. In addition, the impact analysis results of the input images provide guidelines for selecting optimal images for regression-based cloud removal.

TI  - Hierarchical Classification of Soybean in the Brazilian Savanna Based on Harmonized Landsat Sentinel Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Savanna presents a complex agricultural dynamic and cloud cover issues; therefore, there is a need for new strategies for more detailed agricultural monitoring. Using a hierarchical classification system, we explored the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset to detect soybean in western Bahia, Brazil. Multispectral bands (MS) and vegetation indices (VIs) from October 2021 to March 2022 were used as variables to feed Random Forest models, and the performances of the complete HLS time-series, HLSS30 (harmonized Sentinel), HLSL30 (harmonized Landsat), and Landsat 8 OLI (L8) were compared. At Level 1 (agricultural areas x native vegetation), HLS, HLSS30, and L8 produced identical models using MS + VIs, with 0.959 overall accuracies (OA) and Kappa of 0.917. At Level 2 (annual crops x perennial crops x pasturelands), HLS and L8 achieved an OA of 0.935 and Kappa > 0.89 using only VIs. At Level 3 (soybean x other annual crops), the HLS MS + VIs model achieved the best performance, with OA of 0.913 and Kappa of 0.808. Our results demonstrated the potential of the new HLS dataset for medium-resolution mapping initiatives at the crop level, which can impact decision-making processes involving large-scale soybean production and agricultural sustainability.

TI  - Impacts of disaster and land-use change on food security and adaptation: Evidence from the delta community in Bangladesh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-related disasters severely threaten the livelihoods and food security of millions of Bangladesh is living in deltaic areas. The study looked at shifting patterns of land use, the state of food security, and adaption mechanisms in pre-and post-disaster contexts to anticipate the future situation and its influence on livelihood. The study used Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images to evaluate land cover changes from 1990 to 2015. The study also used various interview tools to assess disaster impacts on land-use change, food security, and adaptive measures. In addition, logistic regression was used to determine land-use change factors and people's perceptions of disaster risk. Satellite image analysis in this study reveals significant positive changes in aquaculture and negative changes in fallow and agricultural land. The changes due to natural disasters considerably affect their socio-ecological system, family income, agriculture production, and out-migration in the study area. Land ownership has a substantial impact on food security. According to the study, disasters disrupt ecosystem services, agriculture production, and food security and impair people's capabilities. Human activity and land accretion are the major physical driving forces influencing land use and land cover changes. People's risk perceptions should be factored into disaster management planning at the local level; this could lead to a better understanding of the policy requirements for reducing food insecurity and poverty in deltaic Bangladesh, as well as strengthening community resilience.

TI  - Topographical Impact on Snow Cover Distribution in the Trans-Himalayan Region of Ladakh, India
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the distribution of seasonal snow cover in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh over the observation period of 2000-2019. Seasonal snow cover area and duration have been monitored and mapped based on the MODIS Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI). Using different MODIS cloud removal algorithms, monthly mean cloud-covered areas have been reduced to 3%. Pixel-wise approaches using Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope trend tests allow to assess seasonal and annual trends of snow cover days (SCD) and snow cover area (SCA) across seven delineated subregions of Ladakh. Analyses include the impact of topographical parameters (elevation, slope, aspect). Overall, the mean annual SCA amounts to 42%, varying from 15% in August to 71% in February. However, large differences of SCA have been detected between and within subregions. The trend analysis of SCA shows a non-significant, slight increase for summer as well as for the entire year and a decrease for spring and winter seasons. The SCD trend analysis indicates more pixels with a significant increase than a decrease. In total, 12% of all pixels show an increasing trend in summer, 6% over the entire year, 3% in autumn, and 2% in spring and winter, whereas less than 2% of all pixels show a decreasing trend in all seasons. The results are important for regional irrigated agricultural production and freshwater supply in the context of climate change.

TI  - Brief Report: Use of Remnant Specimens to Assess Use of HIV PrEP Among Populations With Risk of HIV Infection: A Novel Approach
T2  - JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: HIV-uninfected persons being evaluated for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may be good HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) candidates. We measured PrEP use in a sentinel STI patient population. Design: Cross-sectional study, New York City Sexual Health Clinics (January 2019-June 2019). Methods: Remnant serum samples from 644 HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) and 97 women diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhea, and/or early syphilis were assayed for tenofovir and emtricitabine levels using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. Using paired test results and medical records, we assessed (1) prevalence and (2) correlates of PrEP use on the day of STI diagnosis (adjusted prevalence ratios [aPRs]). Results: PrEP use among 741 patients was 32.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 29.3 to 36.0]; 37.3% for MSM and 2.1% for women. PrEP use was high among White MSM (46.8%) and lowest among women. Among MSM with rectal chlamydia/gonorrhea or early syphilis, PrEP use was associated with age [aPR = 1.7 (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.4) for ages 25-34 years and aPR = 2.0 (1.4 to 2.9) for ages 35-44 years, vs. 15 to 24 years]; number of recent sex partners [aPR = 1.4 (1.0 to 2.0) for 3-5 partners, aPR = 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0) for 6-10 partners, aPR = 2.2 (1.6 to 3.1) for >10 partners, vs. <= 2 partners]; having sex/needle-sharing partners with HIV [aPR = 1.4 (1.1-1.7)]; and inconsistent condom use [aPR = 3.3 (1.8-6.1)]. Race/ethnicity, past-year STI diagnosis, and postexposure prophylaxis use were not associated. Conclusions: One in 3 people with newly diagnosed STIs had detectable serum PrEP, and PrEP use was exceedingly rare among women. Routinely collected remnant samples can be used to measure PrEP use in populations at high risk of HIV acquisition.

T2  - FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - SEM microfractographies of Zircaloy-4 are studied by fractal analysis and the time-series method. We first develop a computer application that associates the fractal dimension and lacunarity to each SEM micrograph picture, and produce a nonlinear analysis of the data acquired from the quantitatively evaluated time series. Utilizing the phase space-embedding technique to reconstruct the attractor and to compute the autocorrelation dimension, the fracture surface of the Zircaloy-4 samples is investigated. The fractal analysis method manages to highlight damage complications and provide a description of morphological parameters of various fractures by calculating the fractal dimension and lacunarity.

TI  - Pyrological Situation in the Steppes of Northern Eurasia
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence and spreading of grass fires in the steppe regions of Northern Eurasia occurs against the background of spatial heterogeneity of landscapes and differences in the structure of nature management. The studies of the spatiotemporal regularities in the development of fires make it possible to identify complex relationships between natural and anthropogenic factors in the formation of pyrological conditions. The FIRMS (2001-2021) global archive of thermal anomalies and burnt areas and the results of interpretation of satellite images from Landsat (1984-2021) and MODIS in the key regions were used as sources of data on the fires. It was revealed that during the period under review in the study region four phases with different levels of exposure to fire phenomena have been observed. Sharp worsening of the pyrological situation in the early 2000s was caused by a reduction in agricultural production in the countries of the former Soviet Union, formation of vast regions of underused land, and continued practice of burning crop residues and other types of use of fire for economic purposes. Variations associated with the peculiarities of the meteorological conditions in individual years were observed against the background of the same type of conditions of the fire hazard phases, which is especially characteristic of the modern period, starting from 2011. The pyrological situation in the steppe regions and adjacent territories recorded in a long-term series has been developing synchronously in general, but differences were observed in parameters such as the characteristics of the seasonal development of fires, the morphometric and quantitative indicators of burnt areas, and the types of agricultural land affected.

TI  - Deep Structure of the Arctic and Antarctic according to Component Magnetic and Gravitational Anomalies
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of a study of the deep structure of the Earth's polar regions based on the interpretation of gravitational anomalies, geomagnetic-field anomalies, and seismological data are presented. Based on measurements on the CHAMP and Swarm satellites, vector models of the magnetic field of the Arctic and Antarctic have been verified. To study the magnetically active zones and roots of the lithosphere observed in near-Earth space, deep sections were constructed. Density sections were obtained from gravitational anomalies, and magnetic sections were obtained from anomalies in the modulus and components of the geomagnetic field. To estimate climate risks, a joint analysis of deep sections with satellite data on variations in the ice cover of the polar regions was carried out. It showed that vertical thermofluid channels play a significant role in the process of ice melting. Distinctive features of melting centers caused by endogenous factors are revealed. The migration paths of fluid flows destroying the ice cover are visualized in sections in the form of channels with reduced magnetic and density properties. The conducted studies allows to understand the possible reasons for the localization of centers of ice and permafrost destruction. It was shown that in the permafrost zones of ancient basement blocks, thermal areas of through taliks arise under the influence of heat flows of fluid-supply channels. Melting areas can be represented by hot spots of ore clusters, within which mineral deposits are concentrated under the influence of hydrothermal flows of mineralized fluids. Studies of the deep structure of the Arctic and Antarctic are of scientific and applied importance for solving exploratory geological and geophysical problems and estimating climate risks.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Annual Erosion Rates for Arctic Permafrost Coasts Using Sentinel-1, Deep Learning, and Change Vector Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic permafrost coasts become increasingly vulnerable due to environmental drivers such as the reduced sea-ice extent and duration as well as the thawing of permafrost itself. A continuous quantification of the erosion process on large to circum-Arctic scales is required to fully assess the extent and understand the consequences of eroding permafrost coastlines. This study presents a novel approach to quantify annual Arctic coastal erosion and build-up rates based on Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) backscatter data, in combination with Deep Learning (DL) and Change Vector Analysis (CVA). The methodology includes the generation of a high-quality Arctic coastline product via DL, which acted as a reference for quantifying coastal erosion and build-up rates from annual median and standard deviation (sd) backscatter images via CVA. The analysis was applied on ten test sites distributed across the Arctic and covering about 1038 km of coastline. Results revealed maximum erosion rates of up to 160 m for some areas and an average erosion rate of 4.37 m across all test sites within a three-year temporal window from 2017 to 2020. The observed erosion rates within the framework of this study agree with findings published in the previous literature. The proposed methods and data can be applied on large scales and, prospectively, even for the entire Arctic. The generated products may be used for quantifying the loss of frozen ground, estimating the release of stored organic material, and can act as a basis for further related studies in Arctic coastal environments.

TI  - Towards an Algorithm for Retrieval of the Parameters of the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer at High Wind Speeds Using Collocated Aircraft and Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method has been developed for the retrieval of the atmospheric boundary layer parameters in tropical cyclones, namely the dynamic speed, the wind speed at a 10 m height, and the roughness parameter. For the analysis, the wind speed profiles were obtained from NOAA GPS-dropsondes and collocated with the data from the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR). The parameters of the atmospheric boundary layer from the GPS-dropsonde data were obtained by taking into account the self-similarity of the velocity defect profile. The emissivity, determined from the radiometric measurement data, was calibrated to the field data from the GPS-dropsondes. Empirical relations between the wind speed, dynamic wind speed, and aerodynamic drag coefficient with the surface emissivity have been proposed. Based on a comparison of the measured dynamic parameters and the surface emissivity, empirical formulas have also been proposed. From an analysis of cross-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR images and collocated SFMR measurements for hurricanes Irma (2017/09/07) and Maria (2017/09/21 and 2017/09/23), we have obtained the dependences of the NRCS on the ocean surface emissivity, surface wind speed, and friction velocity. These results could potentially be used to improve the algorithm for the retrieval of boundary layer parameters in tropical cyclones from remote sensing data.

TI  - Sustainability of <i>Boro</i> rice cultivation in the canal irrigated command area of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive assessment and monitoring of rice intensification in canal irrigated command areas and its consequences on groundwater dynamics have enormous importance for the water-food-energy nexus. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal transition of Boro rice cultivation, canal irrigation practices during the cultivation season, and its effect on groundwater of a pioneering multipurpose water resource project in India. The rice maps from 1989 to 2018 were generated from Landsat and Sentinel-2A images using the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to understand the historical distribution of rice cultivation. The ISODATA clustering algorithm performed well compared to the NDVI and the EVI with medium-resolution satellite images. The impact of Boro rice cultivation on groundwater resources was investigated by considering GLDAS NOAH model-based crop evapotranspiration, rainfall, and canal water supply. The area under rice cultivation increased from 33 to 66% during 1989-2018 due to its higher stress tolerance ability and productivity. However, during the cultivation period, the canal water supply was limited to the upstream and middle section of the command area, irrigating only 19% of the rice-cultivated area on average. The unavailability of the canal water supply during the cultivation season has led to 31 m of groundwater level depletion, which, if unchecked, may lead to overexploitation of groundwater in the middle and lower sections of the command area. The results of this study can be used to identify vulnerable areas that require urgent attention and accurate implementation of any agricultural or hydrological policy.

TI  - MicroRNAs as Indicators of Malignancy in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and Cystic Pancreatic Lesions
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - The dysregulation of microRNAs has recently been associated with cancer development and progression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and cystic pancreatic lesions. In solid pancreatic tumor tissue, the dysregulation of miR-146, miR-196a/b, miR-198, miR-217, miR-409, and miR-490, as well as miR-1290 has been investigated in tumor biopsies of patients with PDAC and was reported to predict cancer presence. However, the value of the predictive biomarkers may further be increased during clinical conditions suggesting cancer development such as hyperinsulinemia or onset of diabetes. In this specific context, the dysregulation of miR-486 and miR-196 in tumors has been observed in the tumor tissue of PDAC patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Moreover, miR-1256 is dysregulated in pancreatic cancer, possibly due to the interaction with long non-coding RNA molecules that seem to affect cell-cycle control and diabetes manifestation in PDAC patients, and, thus, these three markers may be of special or "sentinel value". In blood samples, Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has also identified a set of microRNAs (miR-20a, miR-31-5p, miR-24, miR-25, miR-99a, miR-185, and miR-191) that seem to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer remarkably from healthy controls, but limited data exist in this context regarding the prediction of cancer presences and outcomes. In contrast to solid pancreatic tumors, in cystic pancreatic cancer lesions, as well as premalignant lesions (such as intraductal papillary neoplasia (IPMN) or mucinous-cystic adenomatous cysts (MCAC)), the dysregulation of a completely different expression panel of miR-31-5p, miR-483-5p, miR-99a-5p, and miR-375 has been found to be of high clinical value in differentiating benign from malignant lesions. Interestingly, signal transduction pathways associated with miR-dysregulation seem to be entirely different in patients with pancreatic cysts when compared to PDAC. Overall, the determination of these different dysregulation "panels" in solid tumors, pancreatic cysts, obtained via fine-needle aspirate biopsies and/or in blood samples at the onset or during the treatment of pancreatic diseases, seems to be a reasonable candidate approach for predicting cancer presence, cancer development, and even therapy responses.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF MANGROVE CHANGES IN THE MAHAKAM DELTA IN 2007-2017 USING ALOS/PALSAR AND LANDSAT
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove area in the Mahakam Delta has dynamically changed due to the land-use conversion for various purposes. Various remote sensing data can monitor the changes, for example, ALOS/PALSAR and Landsat imagery. However, there are limited studies that compare the use of both imageries to monitor such changes. This paper aims to compare the ability of two satellite imageries, i.e., ALOS/PALSAR and Landsat, to monitor the dynamic of mangrove areas. Two time-series data of ALOS/PALSAR and Landsat imagery for the acquisition period between 2007 and 2017 were analyzed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Landsat analysis results show an increase in the mangrove area of about 17,016 ha and a reduction of about 6,377 ha. ALOS/PALSAR images showed an increase of 15,903 ha and a reduction of 12,713 ha. The change detection results using two different imageries, i.e., Landsat and PALSAR, show slightly different results. Mangrove areas in 2007 and 2017 increased the area as detected from both Landsat and PALSAR. Landsat imaging classification is better at identifying mangroves from non-mangroves, although the 2007 classification results have flaws due to recording errors in striping. Because the quality of PALSAR 2007 and PALSAR 2017 images is not affected, the classification of PALSAR images is deemed more consistent in the area calculation. However, classification results in separating mangrove and non-mangrove near bodies of water are lacking.

TI  - Satellite Imagery-Based Identification of High-Risk Areas of <i>Schistosome</i> Intermediate Snail Hosts Spread after Flood
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snail intermediate host monitoring and control are essential for interrupting the parasitic disease schistosomiasis. Identifying large-scale high-risk areas of snail spread after floods has been greatly facilitated by remote sensing imagery. However, previous studies have usually assumed that all inundation areas carry snails and may have overestimated snail spread areas. Furthermore, these studies only used a single environmental factor to estimate the snail survival risk probability, failing to analyze multiple variables, to accurately distinguish the snail survival risk in the snail spread areas. This paper proposes a systematic framework for early monitoring of snail diffusion to accurately map snail spread areas from remote sensing imagery and enhance snail survival risk probability estimation based on the snail spread map. In particular, the flooded areas are extracted using the Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarized Water Index based on synthetic aperture radar images to map all-weather flooding areas. These flood maps are used to extract snail spread areas, based on the assumption that only inundation areas that spatially interacted with (i.e., are close to) the previous snail distribution regions before flooding are identified as snail spread areas, in order to reduce the misclassification in snail spread area identification. A multiple logistic regression model is built to analyze how various types of snail-related environmental factors, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wetness, river and channel density, and landscape fractal dimension impact snail survival, and estimate its risk probabilities in snail spread area. An experiment was conducted in Jianghan Plain, China, where snails are predominantly linearly distributed along the tributaries and water channels of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The proposed method could accurately map floods under clouds, and a total area of 231.5 km(2) was identified as the snail spread area. The snail survival risk probabilities were thus estimated. The proposed method showed a more refined snail spread area and a more reliable degree of snail survival risk compared with those of previous studies. Thus, it is an efficient way to accurately map all-weather snail spread and survival risk probabilities, which is helpful for schistosomiasis interruption.

TI  - Heat Vulnerability Index Mapping: A Case Study of a Medium-Sized City (Amiens)
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization, anthropogenic activities, and social determinants such as poverty and literacy rate greatly contribute to heat-related mortalities. The 2003 strong heat wave (Lucifer) in France resulted in catastrophic health consequences in the region that may be attributed to urbanization and other anthropogenic activities. Amiens is a medium-sized French city, where the average temperature has increased since the year 2000. In this study, we evaluated the Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) in Amiens for extreme heat days recorded during three years (2018-2020). We used the principal component analysis (PCA) technique for fine-scale vulnerability mapping. The main types of considered data included (a) socioeconomic and demographic data, (b) air pollution, (c) land use and cover, (d) elderly heat illness, (e) social vulnerability, and (f) remote sensing data (land surface temperature (LST), mean elevation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI)). The output maps identified the hot zones through comprehensive GIS analysis. The resultant maps showed that high HVI exists in three typical areas: (1) areas with dense population and low vegetation, (2) areas with artificial surfaces (built-up areas), and (3) industrial zones. Low-HVI areas are in natural landscapes such as rivers and grasslands. Our analysis can be implemented in other cities to highlight areas at high risk of extreme heat and air pollution.

TI  - Multimodal Satellite Image Time Series Analysis Using GAN-Based Domain Translation and Matrix Profile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The technological development of the remote sensing domain led to the acquisition of satellite image time series (SITS) for Earth Observation (EO) by a variety of sensors. The variability in terms of the characteristics of the satellite sensors requires the existence of algorithms that allow the integration of multiple modalities and the identification of anomalous spatio-temporal evolutions caused by natural hazards. The unsupervised analysis of multimodal SITS proposed in this paper follows a two-step methodology: (i) inter-modality translation and (ii) the identification of anomalies in a change-detection framework. Inter-modality translation is achieved by means of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, whereas, for the identification of anomalies caused by natural hazards, we adapt the task to a similarity search in SITS. In this regard, we provide an extension of the matrix profile concept, which represents an answer to identifying differences and to discovering novelties in time series. Furthermore, the proposed inter-modality translation allows the usage of standard unsupervised clustering approaches (e.g., K-means using the Dynamic Time Warping measure) for mono-modal SITS analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is shown in two use-case scenarios, namely flooding and landslide events, for which a joint acquisition of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images is performed.

TI  - Analyses of groundwater storage change using GRACE satellite data in the Usutu-Mhlatuze drainage region, north-eastern South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Usutu-Mhlatuze Water Management Area located in northern KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Study focus: Recent studies have indicated a steady decline in groundwater levels in the UsutuMhlatuze Water Management Area. However, the absence of representative aquifer storage parameter values including storativity and specific yield, lack of sufficient groundwater monitoring wells and inconsistent and erratic groundwater level observation data from existing limited networks make it difficult to understand groundwater storage changes in the region. Therefore, this study analyses groundwater storage change of the primary and secondary aquifers within the Usutu-Mhlatuze Water Management Area using GRACE satellite derived terrestrial water storage data, Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data and in-situ measured surface water storage information. New hydrological insights for the region: The GRACE derived groundwater storage anomalies for the Usutu-Mhlatuze Water Management Area showed good agreement with in-situ groundwater storage anomalies observed from the limited groundwater level monitoring piezometers in the primary and secondary aquifers. The goodness of fit (R2) between the GRACE derived and the observed groundwater storage changes in the primary and secondary aquifers were 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. The GRACE derived groundwater storage change data for the entire study period (between 2002 and 2020) indicated that the primary and secondary aquifers experienced a groundwater storage loss of 925 x 10(6) m(3) and 3614 x 10(6) m(3), respectively.

TI  - Monitoring peatland water table depth with optical and radar satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland water table depth (WTD) and wetness have widely been monitored with optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing but there is a lack of studies that have used multi-sensor data, i.e., combination of optical and SAR data. We assessed how well WTD can be monitored with remote sensing data, whether multi-sensor approach boosts explanatory capacity and whether there are differences in regression performance be-tween data and peatland types. Our data consisted of continuous multiannual WTD data from altogether 50 restored and undrained Finnish peatlands, and optical (Landsat 5-8, Sentinel-2) and Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data processed in Google Earth Engine. We calculated random forest regressions with dependent variable being WTD and independent variables consisting of 21 optical and 10 SAR metrics. The average regression performance was moderate in multi-sensor models (R-2 43.1%, nRMSE 19.8%), almost as high in optical models (R(2 )42.4%, nRMSE 19.9%) but considerably lower in C-band SAR models (R-2 21.8%, nRMSE 23.4%) trained separately for each site. When the models included data from several sites but were trained separately for six habitat type and management option combinations, the average R-2 was 40.6% for the multi-sensor models, 36.6% for optical models and 33.7% for C-band SAR models. There was considerable site-specific variation in the model performance (R-2 - 3.3-88.8% in the multi-sensor models ran separately for each site) and whether multi-sensor, optical or C-band SAR model performed best. The average regression performance was higher for undrained than for restored peatlands, and higher for open and sparsely treed than for densely treed peatlands. The most important variables included SWIR-based optical metrics and VV SAR backscatter. Our results suggest that optical data works usually better than does C-band SAR data in peatland WTD monitoring and multi-sensor approach increases explanatory capacity moderately little.

TI  - A relic of design: against proper functions in biology
T2  - BIOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The notion of biological function is fraught with difficulties-intrinsically and irremediably so, we argue. The physiological practice of functional ascription originates from a time when organisms were thought to be designed and remained largely unchanged since. In a secularized worldview, this creates a paradox which accounts of functions as selected effect attempt to resolve. This attempt, we argue, misses its target in physiology and it brings problems of its own. Instead, we propose that a better solution to the conundrum of biological functions is to abandon the notion altogether, a prospect not only less daunting than it appears, but arguably the natural continuation of the naturalisation of biology.

TI  - Comparative geospatial approach for agricultural crops identification in inter- fluvial plain- A case study of Sahiwal district, Pakistan
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural crop cover identification is a major issue and time-consuming effort to verify the crop type through surveys of the individual field or using prehistoric methods. To establish the scenario of crop identification, the stage of crop provides diverse spatial information about the variety of crops due to its spectral changes. The main aim of this study was to the identify the crop types and their behavior using remote sensing and geographical information system-based approach. Moreover, two main methods were applied to the Sentinel-2 satellite data in which one is random forest based supervised classification and another was Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) density estimation method through the google earth engine to procure the data in time-efficient way. This study also established the comparison between classified and vegetation index based seasonal compositional datasets for wheat, cotton, maize, and fodder crops. Study discussed the best fit technique for crops identification in the light of observed methods. Furthermore, the vegetation index ranges by the zonal statistics of the field samples were established according to crop precision. Results showed that-22.94,-43.72, 20.61, and 32.49 % dissimilarities existed in wheat, fodder, cotton, and maize results respectively, after comparison of both techniques. Although, the accuracy assessment was performed on the classified dataset for validation of results by confusion matrix accuracy assessment process using field sample data. Moreover, the vegetation index was used to evaluate crop land surface temperature to estimate the crop growth stage valuation that revealed noticeably enthralling outcomes. The results determined that the classified accuracies of wheat, cotton, maize and fodder were 84, 80, 81 and 71 % respectively. This study also revealed that the random forest classifier has used more features and information potentially during the classifier trainings but vegetation index just implies the limited number of features such as crop growing status.

TI  - Past and Future Land Use/Land Cover Changes in the Ethiopian Fincha Sub-Basin
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing human pressure on African regions is recognizable when looking at Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change maps, generally derived from satellite imagery. Using the Ethiopian Fincha watershed as a case study, the present work focuses on (i) identifying historical LULC change in the period 1989-2019; (ii) estimating LULC in the next thirty years, combining Geographical Information Systems (GIS) with Land Change Modelling (LCM). Landsat 5/8 images were combined with field evidence to map LULC in three reference years (1989, 2004, 2019), while the Multi-Layer Markov Chain (MPL-MC) model of LCM was applied to forecast LULC in 2030, 2040, and 2050. The watershed was classified into six classes: waterbody, grass/swamp, built-up, agriculture; forest; and shrub. The results have shown that, in the past 30 years, the Fincha watershed experienced a reduction in forest and shrubs of about -40% and -13%, respectively, mainly due to ever-increasing agricultural activities, and such a trend is also expected in the future. In fact, for the period 2019-2050, LCM simulated a significant decrease in both forest and shrubs (around -70% and -20%, respectively), in favor of more areas covered by grass (19%) and built-up (20%). It is worth noting that a decrease in natural forests can drive an increase in soil erosion, fostering siltation in the water reservoirs located in the sub-basin. The study pointed out the urgency of taking actions in the sub-basin to counteract such changes, which can eventually lead to a less sustainable environment.

TI  - Multitemporal Glacier Mass Balance and Area Changes in the Puruogangri Ice Field during 1975-2021 Based on Multisource Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to climate warming, the glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau have experienced rapid mass loss and the patterns of glacier changes have exhibited high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, especially in interior areas. As the largest ice field within the Tibetan Plateau, the Puruogangri Ice Field has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community. However, relevant studies that are based on satellite data have mainly focused on a few periods from 2000-2016. Long-term and multiperiod observations remain to be conducted. To this end, we estimated the changes in the glacier area and mass balance of the Puruogangri Ice Field over five subperiods between 1975 and 2021, based on multisource remote sensing data. Specifically, we employed KH-9 and Landsat images to estimate the area change from 1975 to 2021 using the band ratio method. Subsequently, based on KH-9 DEM, SRTM DEM, Copernicus DEM and ZY-3 DEM data, we evaluated the glacier elevation changes and mass balance over five subperiods during 1975-2021. The results showed that the total glacier area decreased from 427.44 +/- 12.43 km(2) to 387.87 +/- 11.02 km(2) from 1975 to 2021, with a decrease rate of 0.86 km(2) a(-1). The rate of area change at a decade timescale was -0.74 km(2) a(-1) (2000-2012) and -1.00 km(2) a(-1) (2012-2021). Furthermore, the rates at a multiyear timescale were -1.23 km(2) a(-1), -1.83 km(2) a(-1) and -0.42 km(2) a(-1) for 2012-2015, 2015-2017 and 2017-2021, respectively. In terms of the glacier mass balance, the region-wide results at a two-decade timescale were -0.23 +/- 0.02 m w.e. a(-1) for 1975-2000 and -0.29 +/- 0.02 m w.e. a(-1) for 2000-2021, indicating a sustained and relatively stable mass loss over the past nearly five decades. After 2000, the loss rate at a decade timescale was -0.04 +/- 0.01 m w.e. a(-1) for 2000-2012 and -0.17 +/- 0.01 m w.e. a(-1) for 2012-2021, indicating an increasing loss rate over recent decades. It was further found that the mass loss rate was -0.12 +/- 0.02 m w.e. a(-1) for 2012-2015, -0.03 +/- 0.01 m w.e. a(-1) for 2015-2017 and -0.40 +/- 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) for 2017-2021. These results indicated that a significant portion of the glacier mass loss mainly occurred after 2017. According to our analysis of the meteorological measurements in nearby regions, the trends of precipitation and the average annual air temperature both increased. Combining these findings with the results of the glacier changes implied that the glacier changes seemed to be more sensitive to temperature increase in this region. Overall, our results improved our understanding of the status of glacier changes and their reaction to climate change in the central Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - <i>FY-4A</i>/GIIRS Temperature Validation in Winter and Application to Cold Wave Monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the operational application ability of the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) new sounding dataset, in this paper, validation of the FY-4A Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder (FY-4A/GIIRS) temperature was carried out using the balloon sounding temperature from meteorological sounding stations. More than 350,000 samples were obtained through time-space matching, and the results show that the FY-4A/GIIRS temperature mean bias (MB) is 0.07 degrees C, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 1.80 degrees C, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 2.546 degrees C, and the correlation coefficient (RR) is 0.95. The FY-4A/GIIRS temperature error is relatively larger in the upper and lower troposphere, and relatively smaller in the middle troposphere; that is, the temperature at 500 hPa is better than that at 850 hPa. The temporal variation is smaller in the upper and middle troposphere than in the lower troposphere. The reconstruction of missing data of FY-4A/GIIRS temperature in cloudy areas is also carried out and the results are evaluated. The spatial distribution of reconstructed FY-4A/GIIRS temperature and the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data is consistent and completely retains the minimum temperature center with high precision of FY-4A/GIIRS. There are more detailed characteristics of intensity and position at the cold center than that of the reanalysis data. Therefore, an operational satellite retrieval temperature product with time-space continuity and high accuracy is formed. The reconstructed FY-4A/GIIRS temperature is used to monitor a strong cold wave event in November 2021. The results show that the product effectively monitors the movement and intensity of cold air activities, and it also has good indication for the phase transition of rain and snow triggered by cold wave.

TI  - Streamflow Regionalization Considering Water Balance with Actual Evapotranspiration Estimated from Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Streamflow regionalization is a technique used in areas where hydrological data are scarce or nonexistent. Although numerous studies have been conducted with the aim of improving this technique, unsatisfactory results are still evident. This study, therefore, aims to propose and evaluate the performance of a new explanatory variable for regionalization, which represents the streamflow formation process and considers the actual evapotranspiration (ETR) obtained from remote sensing products. For this purpose, the regional regression method was used to estimate long-term mean streamflow and minimum flow with 90% of permanence in time. The explanatory variables were the precipitated volume (Peq), precipitated volume minus the empirical value of 750 mm (Peq(750)), water balance for each segment of the water course (WBeq), and water balance for each hydrologically homogenous region (WBeqM). These variables were obtained using a combination of drainage area, precipitation, and ETR. The ETR was estimated using two remote sensing products: MOD16 and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model. The models of streamflow regionalization were evaluated by statistical, physical, and risk analyses. The study was applied for Grande River basin. All the variables, with the exception of Peq, presented good statistical performance, good representativeness of regionalized streamflows, and safe estimates for the planning and management of water resources. The WBeq(G) was the most recommended variable for streamflow regionalization in Grande River basin, because it considers variations in edaphoclimatic and vegetative conditions along the basin. This work contributes to improving the predictive capacity of the streamflow through a method that is potentially applicable to other areas of study, allows easy physical interpretation, utilizes easily obtained variables, and represents the streamflow formation process.

TI  - Assessment of Witch Flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (NAFO Divisions 4RST), March 2022.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - Witch Flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) are a slow growing and late maturing deepwater flatfish. In the 1970s, the mean length of a 12-year-old female in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence was only 41 cm, and the age at 50% maturity of females was 10 years. These life-history characteristics make the species particularly vulnerable to overexploitation. A fishery for Witch Flounder was developed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (NAFO Divisions 4RST) in the 1950s. Annual landings averaged over 3,500 t in the 1960s and 1970s, declining to an average of 1,800 t in the 1980s. Landings declined further in the early 1990s to a low of 320 t in 1995. Landings then increased to an average of 850 t annually in 1998-2008 but declined again in 2009-2010. While the total allowable catch (TAC) remained at 1,000 t until 2011, landings in 2011 were 425 t. The TAC was reduced to 500 t in 2012, further reduced to 300 t in 2013 and then increased back to 500 t in 2017. Landings have closely matched the TAC for the period 2013-2016 and have been below the TAC since 2017. A research vessel (RV) survey index of commercial biomass (fish 30 cm or longer) was constructed for 4RST based on the August RV survey of the northern Gulf and the September RV survey of the southern Gulf. This index, available since 1987, declined sharply in the early 1990s, increased to an intermediate level in 1999 and 2000, but then declined again, fluctuating around 40% of the 1987-1990 for the period 2001-2010 and has shown an increasing trend since. A sentinel survey index of fish 30 cm or longer, based on the July sentinel survey of the northern Gulf and the August sentinel survey of the southern Gulf, is available for the period 2003 to 2019. This index declined after 2006, was at its lowest level in 2011 and has shown an increasing trend since. A Bayesian surplus production model indicates a 90% decline in commercial biomass between 1961 and 2011 and an increasing trend since. The limit reference point (LRP) for this stock is estimated to be 10,700 t of commercial sized fish (30 cm and longer) and the Upper Stock Reference (USR) is estimated to be 21,400 t of commercial sized fish. The estimate of the biomass of fish 30 cm and longer in 2021 is 17,770 t. Based on the uncertainties in the estimates of both the 2021 biomass, the LRP and the USR, the probability that the biomass is above the LRP in 2021 is 77%. Projections of the population model indicate that the biomass is expected to increase, with probabilities of 60% that the biomass will be above the USR in 2026 with no catches, 52% with annual catches of 500 t and 44% with annual catches of 1,000 t.

TI  - Analysis of Maize Sowing Periods and Cycle Phases Using Sentinel 1&2 Data Synergy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliability of crop-growth modelling is related to the accuracy of the information used to describe the agricultural growing phases. A proper knowledge of sowing periods has a significant impact on the effectiveness of any analysis based on modeled crop growth. In this work, an estimation of maize actual sowing periods for year 2019 is presented, combining the optical and radar information from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The crop classification was conducted according to the information provided by local public authorities over an area of 30 km x 30 km, and 1154 maize fields were considered within the analysis. The combined use of NDVI and radar time series enabled a high-resolution assessment of sowing periods and the description of maize emergence through the soil, by detecting changes in the ground surface geometry. A radar-based index was introduced to detect the periods when plants emerge through the soil, and the sowing periods were retrieved considering the thermal energy needed by seeds to germinate and the daily temperatures before the emergence. Results show that 52% of maize hectares were sowed in late April, while about 30% were sowed during the second half of May. Sentinel-1 appears more suitable to describe the late growing phase of maize, since the radar backscattering is sensitive to the dry biomass of plants while the NDVI decreases because of the chromatic change of leaves. This study highlights the potential of synergy between remote sensing sources for agricultural management policies and improving the accuracy of crop-related modelling.

TI  - The near future expected wave power in the coastal environment of the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main target of the proposed work is to assess the expected wave energy dynamics in the coastal environment of the Iberian Peninsula. This study is motivated by the fact that the Iberian nearshore is considered among the most promising European coastal environments for wave energy extraction with experimental wave projects already operating there since many years. The near future period considered for this analysis is the 20-year time interval 2026-2045 under the Representative Concentration Pathway scenario 4.5 (RCP4.5). In parallel, in order to have a coherent degree of comparison, the results are compared with those corresponding to the recent past 20-year time interval 2001-2020. A wave modelling system based on the third-generation spectral phase averaged model SWAN (acronym from Simulating WAves Nearshore) was implemented for the entire North Atlantic basin and focused on the Iberian nearshore. Furthermore, calibrations and extensive validations of this wave prediction system have been performed. Thus, system reliability was evaluated both against buoy and satellite data and the results were found as having good accuracy. The wave energy data corresponding to the near future (2026-2045) are compared with those from the other 20-year period from the recent past (2001-2020). In this way, a comprehensive picture of the expected wave power dynamics in the coastal environment of the Iberian Peninsula is provided. The results show that there are no significant differences between the two periods considered, especially in the transition seasons (spring and autumn), both in terms of maximum values and also as regards the general patterns of the wave power fields. However, in the near future, a decrease of the resources is expected near to the coast in the summer season, compared to the values simulated for the recent past (from 12 kW/m to 9 kW/m). A contrary tendency corresponds to the winter season when for the near future we find a maximum value higher by about 14 kW/m than in the recent past.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Many conventional approaches to resolving armed violent conflicts, including negotiations, peace talks, and stabilization, have been adopted, especially in Asia and Africa, but sustainable peace is still illusive in some of these areas. Most of these approaches emphasize the economic and political aspects of peace negotiations and tend to ignore the spatial component. There are several innovative technologies, such as smart cell phones, the internet, Global Position Systems (GPS), and satellite data for mapping armed violent conflict resolution. However, GIS has been recognized as an invaluable tool, a decision support system, and has the potential to assist in conflict resolution. This paper aims to review literature on the application of GIS in the prevention of armed violent conflict, its resolution, post-conflict reconstruction, and peacebuilding. The literature review reveals that while GIS continues to be applied in armed violent conflict resolution and peacebuilding, several challenges remain, including amongst others, its availability, its acceptance by conflicting parties, its accessibility, the accuracy of its data, and the expertise of GIS personnel undertaking the data analysis and integration of data from different sources. A suggested area of further study includes either the application of remote sensing to violent conflict resolution or an integrated application of GIS and Remote Sensing to armed conflict resolution.

TI  - Monitoring and Prediction of the Urmia Lake Drying Trend Based on Time-Series Remotely Sensed Images and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake, which is the second largest permanent hypersaline lake in the world, is shrinking in recent decades. Since accurate spatial information about the lake is essential to managing the current and emerging crises of the lake, this study is used Urmia Lake satellite images time-series to investigate drought trends by analyzing via Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The proposed approach is comprising the following four steps. First, yearly time -series Landsat images (2000-2022) are corrected geometrically and radiometrically. Then, time-series images of 2000-2020 are classified into five land cover classes, including; deep water, shallow water, salt, soil, and vegetation. In the third step, ANN trained for 2000-2019 as input and tested for 2020 as an output. Finally, the trained ANN is proposed to predict the future land covers of the lake (for 2021 and 2022 years). In order to evaluate the proposed model, the predicted maps of 2021 and 2022 were compared with their corresponding ground truth maps and quantitative criteria were calculated. The overall accuracy of the prediction for 2021 and 2022 is equal to 92.75% and 90.62%, respectively, which indicates the high capability of the proposed method for modeling and predicting changes in Urmia Lake and its shores.

TI  - Biomass and Carbon Stock Quantification in Cork Oak Forest of Maamora Using a New Approach Based on the Combination of Aerial Laser Scanning Carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean forests, particularly Cork oak (Quercus suber L., 1927), make a major contribution to the fight against climate change through Carbon sequestration. Hence, there is a great interest in the accurate quantification of biomass and carbon stock. In this context, this study aims at assessing the performance of a new approach, based on the combination of Unmanned aerial vehicle airborne Aerial laser scanning (ALS-UAV) and Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, in the determination of dendrometric parameters (Circumference at 1.30 m and Tree Height), and consequently the estimation of biomass and carbon stock, considering field data as reference. This study takes the Maamora forest in Morocco as an example of a Mediterranean Cork oak forest. The methodology consists of collecting data at three levels: the entire area level for an ALS-UAV scan, the plot and tree levels for TLS surveys, as well as field data collection. Afterwards, dendrometric parameters (Circumference at 1.30 m and the Tree height) were estimated using individual tree segmentation and biomass; the carbon stock (aboveground, belowground, and total) was estimated using allometric equations. The comparison of the estimated dendrometric parameters with those measured in the field shows a strong relationship, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.86 and 0.83, a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.81 and 0.71, and a Root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.84 cm and 0.47 m, respectively. Concerning the biomass and carbon stock estimation, the proposed approach gives a satisfactory accuracy, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.77, an R2 of 0.83, and an RMSE of 36.40 kg for biomass and 20.24 kg for carbon stock.

TI  - Impact of Topographic Correction on PRISMA Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, remote sensing satellite sensors have significantly increased their performance and, at the same time, differed in their characteristics. Therefore, making the data repeatable over time and uniform with respect to different platforms has become one of the most challenging issues to obtain a representation of the intrinsic characteristics of the observed target. In this context, atmospheric correction has the role of cleaning the signal from unwanted contributions and moving from the sensor radiance to a quantity more closely related to the intrinsic properties of the target, such as ground reflectance. To this end, atmospheric correction procedures must consider a number of factors, closely related to the specific scene acquired and to the characteristics of the sensor. In mountainous environments, atmospheric correction must include a topographic correction level to compensate for the topographic effects that heavily affect the remote signal. In this paper, we want to estimate the impact of topographic correction on remote sensing images based on a statistical analysis, using data acquired under different illumination conditions with different sensors. We also want to show the benefits of introducing this level of correction in second level products such as PRISMA L2C reflectance, which currently do not implement it.

TI  - Spectral Analysis to Improve Inputs to Random Forest and Other Boosted Ensemble Tree-Based Algorithms for Detecting NYF Pegmatites in Tysfjord, Norway
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important source of lithium and rare earth elements (REE) and other critical elements, pegmatites are of great strategic economic interest for present and future technological development. Identifying new pegmatite deposits is a strategy adopted by the European Union (EU) to decrease its import dependence on non-European countries for these raw materials. It is in this context that the GREENPEG project was established, an EU project whose main objective is to identify new deposits of pegmatites in Europe in an environmentally friendly way. Remote sensing is a non-contact exploration tool that allows for identifying areas of interest for exploration at the early stage of exploration campaigns. Several RS methods have been developed to identify Li-Cs-Ta (LCT) pegmatites, but in this study, a new methodology was developed to detect Nb-Y-F (NYF) pegmatites in the Tysfjord area in Norway. This methodology is based on spectral analysis to select bands of the Sentinel 2 satellite and adapt RS methods, such as Band Ratios and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to be used as input in the Random Forest (RF) and other tree-based ensemble algorithms to improve the classification accuracy. The results obtained are encouraging, and the algorithm was able to successfully identify the pegmatite areas already known and new locations of interest for exploration were also defined.

TI  - Sen2Like: Paving the Way towards Harmonization and Fusion of Optical Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Earth Observation (EO) sensors are becoming a vital source of information for land surface monitoring. The concept of the Virtual Constellation (VC) is gaining interest within the science community owing to the increasing number of satellites/sensors in operation with similar characteristics. The establishment of a VC out of individual missions offers new possibilities for many application domains, in particular in the fields of land surface monitoring and change detection. In this context, this paper describes the Copernicus Sen2Like algorithms and software, a solution for harmonizing and fusing Landsat 8/Landsat 9 data with Sentinel-2 data. Developed under the European Union Copernicus Program, the Sen2Like software processes a large collection of Level 1/Level 2A products and generates high quality Level 2 Analysis Ready Data (ARD) as part of harmonized (Level 2H) and/or fused (Level 2F) products providing high temporal resolutions. For this purpose, we have re-used and developed a broad spectrum of data processing and analysis methodologies, including geometric and spectral co-registration, atmospheric and Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrections and upscaling to 10 m for relevant Landsat bands. The Sen2Like software and the algorithms have been developed within a VC establishment framework, and the tool can conveniently be used to compare processing algorithms in combinations. It also has the potential to integrate new missions from spaceborne and airborne platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles. The validation activities show that the proposed approach improves the temporal consistency of the multi temporal data stack, and output products are interoperable with the subsequent thematic analysis processes.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on a near-infrared imaging spectrometer for sensing the three most prominent greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane). The optical design of the spectrometer involves freeform optics, which enables achieving exceptional performance and allows progressing well beyond the state-of-the-art in terms of compactness, field-of-view, and spatial resolution. The spectrometer is intended to be launched on a small satellite orbiting at 700 km and observing the Earth with a wide field-of-view of 120 degrees and a spatial resolution of 2.6 km at nadir. The satellite will ultimately allow for improved climate change monitoring.

TI  - Changes in the Ice-Free Period Duration in the Kara Sea Coastal Zone from Satellite Data
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid Arctic Sea ice shrinkage in the 21st century leads to an increase in the duration of the ice-free period in the Arctic Ocean seas. The ice-free period duration is an important indicator of climate processes for coastal dynamics monitoring in the Russian Arctic zone. The considerable changes in the ice-free period duration significantly affect the functioning of coastal infrastructure, navigation, and coastal ecosystems. Recent satellite microwave sensing data covering the period of more than 40 years of observations make it possible to analyze the state and dynamics of the sea ice cover in the coastal zone of the Russian Arctic. Based on the gradient-threshold method, which was adapted for coastal data, the annual estimates of the ice-free period characteristics for the Kara Sea coastal zone over the period of 1979-2019 are obtained using satellite sea ice concentration data available from different scientific centers (JAXA, OSI SAF, and NSIDC). According to the analyzed satellite data sources, the ice-free period duration in the Kara Sea coastal zone has increased statistically significantly almost everywhere over the past decades. The ice-free period duration has increased due to both earlier melt onset (the average rate of changes is -8 days/decade), and later freeze-up (the average rate of changes is +4 days/decade). The average rates of changes in the total ice-free period duration are +12 days/decade for the period of 1979-2019. The main contribution to the formation of the total ice-free period duration is made by the dynamics of the starting dates of the period, which has high inter-annual variability and a large spatial diversity. The estimates of the ice-free period duration trends allowed for the detection of the most intensely changing areas within the Kara Sea coastal zone: the Yugorsky Peninsula, the western and northern coasts of the Yamal Peninsula. The study specifies the regional features of manifestation of sea ice climate changes within the framework of monitoring of the Russian Arctic coastal dynamics.

TI  - The electricity scene from above: Exploring power grid inconsistencies using satellite data in Accra, Ghana
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Complicated systems are complicated to monitor. The electric grid is one of the most complicated systems, and subsequently goes under-monitored in many regions around the world that cannot easily afford expensive meters. However, the electric grid is also critical for sustaining a high quality of life, and requires better monitoring than is often available to ensure consistent service is provided. Past work has shown that images taken by satellites during the night, capturing nighttime illumination ("nightlights''), could provide a proxy measurement of grid performance for minimal cost. We build upon earlier work by identifying the pixel z-score - a statistical measurement of a pixel's illumination relative to its history - as a key method for detecting electricity outages from the often-noisy nightlights dataset. We then train and validate our approach against observations from a network of on-the-ground power outage sensors in our observation area of Accra, Ghana, a dataset representing the largest collection of utility-independent electricity reliability measurements on the African continent. Using multiple machine learning techniques for estimating potential outages from nightlight images, we obtain high performance for predicting outages in Accra at scales as small as a single pixel (0.2 km(2)) and with training datasets as small as three months of illumination/sensor data. We further validate our methodology beyond the spatio-temporal coverage of the on-the-ground sensor deployment against a human-labeled dataset of outages by neighborhood throughout Accra. Delving deeper into the applications and limitations of available datasets and our work, we conclude by highlighting questions about the generality of our method vital to understanding its potential for low-cost worldwide measurements of grid reliability.

TI  - Long-Term Variability of Aerosol Concentrations and Optical Properties over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in South Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions of atmospheric pollutants are rapidly increasing over South Asia. A greater understanding of seasonal variability in aerosol concentrations over South Asia is a scientific challenge and has consequences due to a lack of monitoring and modelling of air pollutants. Therefore, this study investigates aerosol patterns and trends over some major cities in the Indo-Gangetic Plain of the South Asia, i.e., Islamabad, Lahore, Delhi, and Dhaka, by using simulations from the Modern -Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) model and satellite measurements (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, (MODIS)) from 2000 to 2020. The results show that seasonal MODIS-aerosol optical depth (AOD) during 2000-2020 in Lahore is 0.5, 0.52, 0.92, and 0.71, while in Islamabad 0.25, 0.32, 0.45, and 0.38, in Delhi 0.68, 0.6, 1.0, and 0.77, and in Dhaka 0.79, 0.75, 0.78 and 0.55 values are observed during different seasons, i.e., winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. The analysis reveals a significant increase in aerosol concentrations by 25%, 24%, 19%, and 14%, and maximum AOD increased by 15%, 14%, 19%, and 22% during the winter of the last decade (2011-2020) over Islamabad, Lahore, Delhi, and Dhaka, respectively. In contrast, AOD values decreased during spring by -5%, -12%, and -5 over Islamabad, Lahore, and Delhi, respectively. In Dhaka, AOD shows an increasing trend for all seasons. Thus, this study provides the aerosol spatial and temporal variations over the South Asian region and would help policymakers to strategize suitable mitigation measurements.

TI  - Tobacco Retail License Recognition Based on Dual Attention Mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Images of tobacco retail licenses have complex unstructured characteristics, which is an urgent technical problem in the robot process automation of tobacco marketing. In this paper, a novel recognition approach using a double attention mechanism is presented to realize the automatic recognition and information extraction from such images. First, we utilized a DenseNet network to extract the license information from the input tobacco retail license data. Second, bi-directional long short-term memory was used for coding and decoding using a continuous decoder integrating dual attention to realize the recognition and information extraction of tobacco retail license images without segmentation. Finally, several performance experiments were conducted using a largescale dataset of tobacco retail licenses. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a correction accuracy of 98.36% on the ZY-LQ dataset, outperforming most existing methods.

TI  - Space and people in the travel descriptions of missionaries from the Obdorsk mission (60-70s of the 19th century)
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the perception by the missionaries of the Obdorsk mission of the environment and the people with whom they had to communicate during their trips to the Ob North. The priests recorded all their impressions in mission itineraries. They revealed the problems of interaction with another culture, reflect the unique individual experience of communication of the authors with the local people and reflections about it. The study of the Obdorsk mission itineraries urges us to single out the key concept of overcoming: overcoming the unkind Siberian nature, inertness and indifference of the native people, their savagery and superstitions, and what is more, self-overcoming - getting rid of fears, weakness and doubts. The author examines several important subjects that characterize the attitude of missionaries to a different culture in this article. The space where the northern peoples lived did not clear boundaries, due to constant internal migration along the Ob North and adjacent territories. First of all, the description of space from the standpoint of the opposition "friend or foe", building communication through the prism of language barriers, striving to change the religious worldview. To make long-term river crossings, the missionaries had boats at their disposal, and to move around the tundra they used sledge team, which they requested from the local people. On the missionary trip, the priests were accompanied by workers, whose duties included all the technical work on the movement of a sailing boat along the river Ob and small rivulets flowing into it. Missionaries devote a special place in missionaries' itineraries to descriptions of meetings with shamans, perceiving them as the main guardians of the beliefs of the northern peoples. It is with them that missionaries honed their gift of persuasion and ability for Christian preaching. Communication with people whom missionaries become familiar with largely depended on the shamans. The missionaries paided special attention to the description of obsequial rites and the pantheon of the gods of the north peoples during their trips. One of the problems that accompanied the priests on missionary trips was related to the lack of knowledge of the language, which led to misunderstanding and discontent among the local people. The missionaries found ways to bridge this gap, learned the language, compiled dictionaries and taught children and adults to read and write, which was also reflected in their written testimonies.

TI  - Mapping Forest Stability within Major Biomes Using Canopy Indices Derived from MODIS Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation from human land use, including primary forest loss, are of growing concern. The conservation of old-growth and other forests with important environmental values is central to many international initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Current remote-sensing products largely focus on deforestation rather than forest degradation and are dependent on machine learning, calibrated with extensive field measurements. To help address this, we developed a novel approach for mapping forest ecosystem stability, defined in terms of constancy, which is a key characteristic of long-undisturbed (including primary) forests. Our approach categorizes forests into stability classes based on satellite-data time series related to plant water-carbon relationships. Specifically, we used long-term dynamics of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPAR) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2003-2018. We calculated a set of variables from annual time series of fPAR and SIWSI for representative forest regions at opposite ends of Earth's climatic and latitudinal gradients: boreal forests of Siberia (southern taiga, Russia) and tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin (Kayapo territory, Brazil). Independent validation drew upon high-resolution Landsat imagery and forest cover change data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable across forest biomes and, thereby, provides a timely and transferrable method to aid in the identification and conservation of stable forests. Information on the location of less stable forests is equally relevant for ecological restoration, reforestation, and proforestation activities.

TI  - F2F-NN: A Field-to-Field Wind Speed Retrieval Method of Microwave Radiometer Data Based on Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a method for retrieving sea surface wind speed (SSWS) from Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data. In contrast to the conventional point-to-point (P2P) retrieval methods, we propose a field-to-field (F2F) SSWS retrieval method based on the basic framework of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Considering the spatial continuity and consistency characteristics of wind fields within a certain range, we construct the model based on the basic framework of CNN, which is suitable for retrieving various wind speed intervals, and then synchronously obtaining the smooth and continuous wind field. The retrieval results show that: (1) Comparing the retrieval results with the label data, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of wind speed is about 0.26 m/s, the F2F-NN model is highly efficient in training and has a strong fitting ability to label data. Comparing the retrieval results with the buoys (NDBC and TAO) data, the RMSE of F2F-NN wind speed is less than 0.91 m/s, the retrieval accuracy is better than the wind field products involved in the comparison. (2) In the hurricane (Sam) area, the F2F-NN model greatly improves the accuracy of wind speed in the FY-3D wind field. Comparing five wind field products with the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) data, the overall accuracy of the F2F-NN wind data is the highest. Comparing the five wind field products with the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) data, the F2F-NN wind field is superior to the other products in terms of maximum wind speed and maximum wind speed radius. The structure of the wind field retrieved by F2F-NN is complete and accurate, and the wind speed changes smoothly and continuously.

TI  - Influenza incidence overlapped with COVID-19 or under COVID-19 control measures
T2  - IMMUNITY INFLAMMATION AND DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic caused infection when influenza was still prevalent. This study was conducted to examine influenza incidence overlapped with COVID-19 and the effect of the COVID-19 measures on influenza incidence as a proxy.Methods: The routine sentinel surveillance data on COVID-19 and influenza was obtained from the national integrated care electronic health record system. Data were collected in 28 points from 11 months before the outbreak (from March 2019 to January 2020) and 17 months after the outbreak (February 2020 to June 2021).Results: In Iran, the incidence rate of influenza was 51.1 cases per 100,000 populations in November 2019, while it was only 0.1 in November 2020. The average number of influenza cases specifically for the Kurdistan province during the seasonal flu peak in 2019-2020 was 2.5 cases per 100,000 populations, while the average of influenza cases in the preceding 4 years was 0.4 cases per 100,000 populations. In other words, the seasonal peak of influenza in Iran was significantly higher than that of previous and after years.Conclusion: It seems that some of the nonpharmaceutical interventions (NP1s) used to control COVID-19 are effective against influenza epidemics and the results indicated a marked decline in the number of influenza cases may cause after the implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. The results showed the seasonal peak of influenza in Iran was significantly higher than that of previous years, so it seems that the influenza winter peak season (November 2019) overlapped with SARS-CoV-2 causing observed undetected infection during influenza winter peak.

TI  - Land Cover Mapping Using GIS and Remote Sensing Databases for Al Baha Region Saudi Arabia
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover assessment plays a vital role in both current and future planning and use of natural resources for sustainable development for any country. For the good practice of the vision 2030 in Al Baha region (south-western Saudi Arabia), land cover was assessed, classified, and analyzed using remote sensing databases and time series analysis combined with spatial analysis in geographic information system (GIS) based on high-resolution Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery between the period of study 2017/2018 and 2021/2022. Based on both an accuracy assessment and kappa test, the results indicate that Esri Sentinel-2 imagery gives the highest performance compared to Landsat 8 OLI with accuracy and kappa test equal to 87% and 84%, respectively. On the other hand, the land cover classification revealed that the large area of water bodies is localized on Alaqiq (1.45 km(2)), Baljurish (0.94 km(2)), and Elmelkhwah (1.57 km(2)). Furthermore, the built area of the Al Baha region between 2017 and 2021 was estimated to increase by 144 km(2) (from 516.5 to 661.07 km(2)), which is especially significant for the Qelwah district (from 16.97 to 44.16 km(2)) which demonstrated a decrease in bare ground area of approximately 320 km(2). The crop lands have been increased by 162.74% in the 2017-2021 period from 10.39 km(2) to 16.90 km(2), particularly at Qelwah and Elmelkhwah. Finally, the results obtained by this research can help decision-makers and managers for better natural resources management in the Al Baha region.

TI  - A Blueprint for the Estimation of Seagrass Carbon Stock Using Remote Sensing-Enabled Proxies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems sequester carbon at disproportionately high rates compared to terrestrial ecosystems and represent a powerful potential contributor to climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. However, at a local scale, rich heterogeneity in seagrass ecosystems may lead to variability in carbon sequestration. Differences in carbon sequestration rates, both within and between seagrass meadows, are related to a wide range of interrelated biophysical and environmental variables that are difficult to measure holistically using traditional field surveys. Improved methods for producing robust, spatially explicit estimates of seagrass carbon storage across large areas would be highly valuable, but must capture complex biophysical heterogeneity and variability to be accurate and useful. Here, we review the current and emerging literature on biophysical processes which shape carbon storage in seagrass beds, alongside studies that map seagrass characteristics using satellite remote sensing data, to create a blueprint for the development of remote sensing-enabled proxies for seagrass carbon stock and sequestration. Applications of satellite remote sensing included measuring seagrass meadow extent, estimating above-ground biomass, mapping species composition, quantifying patchiness and patch connectivity, determining broader landscape environmental contexts, and characterising seagrass life cycles. All of these characteristics may contribute to variability in seagrass carbon storage. As such, remote sensing methods are uniquely placed to enable proxy-based estimates of seagrass carbon stock by capturing their biophysical characteristics, in addition to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and variability of these characteristics. Though the outlined approach is complex, it is suitable for accurately and efficiently producing a full picture of seagrass carbon stock. This review has drawn links between the processes of seagrass carbon sequestration and the capabilities of remote sensing to detect and characterise these processes. These links will facilitate the development of remote sensing-enabled proxies and support spatially explicit estimates of carbon stock, ensuring climate change mitigation and adaptation projects involving seagrass are accounted for with increased accuracy and reliability.

TI  - The Use of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data in Preparation of Input Data for Large-Scale Landslide Hazard Assessments
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the study is to show that landslide conditioning factors derived from different source data give significantly different relative influences on the weight factors derived with statistical models for landslide susceptibility modelling and risk analysis. The analysis of the input data for large-scale landslide hazard assessment was performed on a study area (20.2 km(2)) in Hrvatsko Zagorje (Croatia, Europe), an area highly susceptible to sliding with limited geoinformation data, including landslide data. The main advantage of remote sensing technique (i.e., LiDAR, Light Detection and Ranging) data and orthophoto images is that they enable 3D surface models with high precision and spatial resolution that can be used for deriving all input data needed for landslide hazard assessment. The visual interpretation of LiDAR DTM (Digital Terrain Model) morphometric derivatives resulted in a detailed and complete landslide inventory map, which consists of 912 identified and mapped landslides, ranging in size from 3.3 to 13,779 m(2). This inventory was used for quantitative analysis of 16 input data layers from 11 different sources to analyse landslide presence in factor classes and thus comparing landslide conditioning factors from available small-scale data with high-resolution LiDAR data and orthophoto images, pointing out the negative influence of small-scale source data. Therefore, it can be concluded that small-scale landslide factor maps derived from publicly available sources should not be used for large-scale analyses because they will result in incorrect assumptions about conditioning factors compared with LiDAR DTM derivative factor maps. Furthermore, high-resolution LiDAR DTM and orthophoto images are optimal input data because they enable derivation of the most commonly used landslide conditioning factors for susceptibility modelling and detailed datasets about elements at risk (i.e., buildings and traffic infrastructure data layers).

TI  - Investigating the performance of dust detection indices using MODIS data and products (Case study: Khuzestan province of Iran)
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In areas with a semi-arid or arid climates, dust storms are caused by winds blowing on the surfaces with loose and dry soils. Dust storms can influence different aspects of human life, such as health, agricultural practices, urban, rural, and transportation infrastructures. Since 15 years ago, dust storms, as one of the leading environmental hazards, have occurred with increased frequency, spatial extent, and intensity in the Middle East. Several satellite-based dust-detection algorithms are introduced for identifying dust emission sources and dust plumes when rising in the atmosphere. In this research, four common algorithms, namely Brightness Temperature Difference, Normalized Difference Dust Index, Thermal-Infrared Dust Index, and D-parameter, were evaluated using MODIS Level 1B and MODIS Deep Blue AOD products in two dust storms in the Khuzestan province, Iran. Detection thresholds for the indices was derived by a comparison of dust-present versus dust-free conditions data considering different coverage of land and inspecting related periods. The detection proficiency of the algorithms was different for various events; thus previously obtained thresholds were not applicable in the algorithms performed in the Khuzestan region. Initially, dust was effectively and adequately detected by MODIS AOD. It was also revealed that MODIS thermal infrared (TIR) band algorithms or algorithms combining TIR and reflectance bands could detect dust better than reflectance-based ones. However, some commission errors were caused by substantial differences among their susceptibility to distinguish dust, cloud, and the surface. Overall, among the algorithms, TDI and D-parameter performed the best over dust sources in the Khuzestan province.

TI  - A 3D Predictive Method for Deep-Seated Gold Deposits in the Northwest Jiaodong Peninsula and Predicted Results of Main Metallogenic Belts
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid depletion of mineral resources, deep prospecting is becoming a frontier field in international geological exploration. The prediction of deep mineral resources is the premise and foundation of deep prospecting. However, conventional metallogenic predictive methods, which are mainly based on surface geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing data and geological information, are no longer suitable for deep metallogenic prediction due to the large burial depth of deep-seated deposits. Consequently, 3D metallogenic prediction becomes a critical method for delineating deep prospecting target areas. As a world-class giant gold metallogenic province, the Jiaodong Peninsula is at the forefront in China in terms of deep prospecting achievements and exploration depth. Therefore, it has unique conditions for 3D metallogenic prediction and plays an important exemplary role in promoting the development of global deep prospecting. This study briefly introduced the method, bases, and results of the 3D metallogenic prediction in the northwest Jiaodong Peninsula and then established 3D geological models of gold concentration areas in the northwest Jiaodong Peninsula using drilling combined with geophysics. Since gold deposits in the northwest Jiaodong Peninsula are often controlled by faulting in the 3D space, this study proposed a method for predicting deep prospecting target areas based on a stepped metallogenic model and a method for predicting the deep resource potential of gold deposits based on the shallow resources of ore-controlling faults. Multiple characteristic variables were extracted from the 3D geological models of the gold concentration areas, including the buffer zone and dip angle of faults, the changing rate of fault dip angle, and the equidistant distribution of orebodies. Using these characteristic variables, five deep prospecting target areas in the Jiaojia and Sanshandao faults were predicted. Moreover, based on the proven gold resources at an elevation of -2000 m and above, the total gold resources of the Sanshandao, Jiaojia, and Zhaoping ore-controlling faults at an elevation of -5000--2000 m were predicted to be approximately 3377-6490 t of Au. Therefore, it is believed that the total gold resources in the Jiaodong Peninsula are expected to exceed 10,000 t. These new predicted results suggest that the northwest Jiaodong Peninsula has huge potential for the resources of deep gold deposits, laying the foundation for further deep prospecting.

TI  - Evaluating Nature-Based Solution for Flood Reduction in Spercheios River Basin Part 2: Early Experimental Evidence
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) are being used around the world in order to address various hydrometeorological hazards as a more environmentally friendly alternative to hard structures. Such a solution has been created in the Spercheios river basin in Central Greece, which is susceptible to heavy rainfall and river bank overflow due to flood water from upstream, in order to mitigate flood and drought impacts under current and future climate conditions. Here a first attempt is made to use actual measurements taken from various sources in the river, including in-situ and satellite data, in order to establish early experimental evidence of the NBS efficiency in the area. The measurements include data from automated hydrological stations from the OpenHi network, satellite remote sensing data and field measurements performed along the Spercheios River basin. For each measurement used, different analysis has been performed based on data availability and pertinence to the NBS efficiency. Preliminary results presented here show that the NBS functions as designed and provides protection against flooding in the area, and can potentially diminish the risk of drought. The results are in agreement with the numerical outputs already presented in our previous work.

TI  - Three Methods of Site-Specific Yield Mapping as a Data Source for the Delineation of Management Zones in Winter Wheat
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, three digital, site-specific, yield-mapping methods for winter wheat were examined, and their precision was evaluated. The crop yields of heterogeneous fields at three locations were determined on a site-specific basis using a yield-recording system composed of a combine harvester and algorithms based on reflection measurements made via satellites, as well as a tractor-mounted sensor. As a reference, the yield was determined with a plot harvester (ground truth data). The precision of the three methods was evaluated via statistical indicators (mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) and correlation analyses between the yield of the ground truth data and the respective method. The results show a yield variation of 4.5-10.9 t ha(-1) in the trial fields. The yield of the plot harvester was strongly correlated with the yield estimate from the sensor data (R-2 = 0.71-0.75), it was moderately correlated with the yield estimate from the satellite data (R-2 = 0.53-0.68), and it ranged from strongly to weakly correlated with the yield map of the combine harvester (R-2 = 0.30-0.72). The absolute yield can be estimated using sensor data. Slight deviations (<10%) in the absolute yield are observed with the combine harvester, and there are clear deviations (+/- 48%) when using the satellite data. The study shows differences in the precision and accuracy of the investigated methods. Further research and optimization are urgently needed to determine the exactness of the individual methods.

TI  - Ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity After Autumn Snowfall and Melt Events in a Mountain Meadow
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation productivity is increasing in the U.S. Northern Great Plains but decreasing in some nearby Northern Rocky Mountain grasslands due to increases in aridity. It is unclear if decreases to montane grassland productivity from drying autumns can be partly offset by late-season green-ups after precipitation events. These include the multiple snowfall and snowmelt periods that often characterize the summer-to-winter transition, but are difficult to observe due to logistical constraints. Here, we quantify changes to vegetation indices and ecosystem carbon uptake that occurs after snowfall and melt in climatological autumn in a montane grassland in Montana, USA using eddy covariance, phenological camera, and remote sensing analyses. Carbon dioxide flux follows a diurnal pattern after autumn snowmelt events despite overall ecosystem C loss, suggesting that post-snowmelt photosynthesis helps dampen C loss during autumn and provides fresh photosynthate to support ecosystem functioning. Light-saturated photosynthesis after three snow events was not statistically different than before snowfall (similar to 6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in 2016 and similar to 2.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in 2017). Observations are consistent with the notion that canopy photosynthesis is resistant, rather than resilient, to autumn snow. MODIS indicates that post-snow greenups can occur, but not every year. Such events likely play a small role in the annual ecosystem carbon balance but may be disproportionately important for organisms faced with dwindling late-season forage. Future efforts should seek to understand the community and ecosystem consequences of vegetation functioning during autumn as part of an expanded effort to understand phenological changes during this under-studied and changing time of year.

TI  - Sentinel-2 sampling design and reference fire perimeters to assess accuracy of Burned Area products over Sub-Saharan Africa for the year 2019
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of high-resolution reference datasets representing in space and time and with high accuracy areas affected by fires is strategic for the validation of remotely-sensed Burned Area (BA) products. This paper proposes a methodology designed to build a burned area reference dataset from Sentinel-2 (S2) images at continental scale by implementing a stratified random sampling scheme. Representative sample units are selected across biomes and regions with high/low fire activity; each unit covers the extent of a S2 tile (similar to 10 000 km(2)) where image time series are classified with a supervised Random Forest algorithm to extract fire perimeters by exploiting visible to near and short-wave infrared S2 wavebands at 10 to 20 m spatial resolution. Time series have to satisfy requirements on maximum cloud cover, maximum time interval between consecutive images and minimum length to be suitable for being selected and processed. The proposed methodology was applied to Sub-Saharan Africa for the year 2019 to select 50 S2 sample units where time series were processed to deliver fire reference perimeters for accuracy assessment of regional BA products. Average series length is 140 days with the longest series in the savanna biome (maximum length is 355 days, 29 consecutive S2 images) and a total of 695 S2 images were processed to build the 2019 reference dataset. This dataset was compared to burned areas derived from very-high resolution Planetscope images over five S2 tiles obtaining 15.5% omission and 11.6% commission errors. To exemplify the use of this reference dataset, S2 perimeters were used to validate the NASA MCD64A1 Collection 6 and the ESA FireCCI51 BA products. The reference dataset has been added to the Burned Area Reference Database (BARD) (Franquesa et al., 2020) and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.21950/VKFLCH.

TI  - The Effect of Land Use and Land Cover Changes on Flood Occurrence in Teunom Watershed, Aceh Jaya
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in land use and land cover in upstream watersheds will change the features of drainage systems such that they will impact surface overflow and affect the infiltration capacity of a land surface, which is one of the factors that contributes to flooding. The key objective of this study is to identify vulnerable areas of flooding and to assess the causes of flooding using ground-based measurement, remote sensing data, and GIS-based flood risk mapping approaches for the flood hazard mapping of the Teunom watershed. The purposes of this investigation were to: (1) examine the level and characteristics of land use and land cover changes that occurred in the area between 2009 and 2019; (2) determine the impact of land use and land cover changes on the water overflow and infiltration capacity; and (3) produce flood risk maps for the Teunom sub-district. Landsat imagery of 2009, 2013, and 2019; slope maps; and field measurement soil characteristics data were utilized for this study. The results show a significant increase in the use of residential land, open land, rice fields, and wetlands (water bodies) and different infiltration rates that contribute to the variation of flood zone hazards. The Teunom watershed has a high and very high risk of similar to 11.98% of the total area, a moderate risk of 56.24%, and a low and very low risk of similar to 31.79%. The Teunom watershed generally has a high flood risk, with a total of similar to 68% of the area (moderate to very high risk). There was a substantial reduction in forest land, agricultural land, and shrubs from 2009 to 2019. Therefore, the segmentation of flood-risk zones is essential for preparation in the region. The study offers basic information about flood hazard areas for central governments, local governments, NGOs, and communities to intervene in preparedness, responses, and flood mitigation and recovery processes, respectively.

AB  - The prolonged precipitation of solar protons into the Earth's atmosphere, which began on September 29 and October 19, 1989, was among the strongest and longest events of this kind. This allowed us to compare the precipitation-induced variations in the conductivity of the lower edge of the ionosphere on the basis of an electromagnetic experiment in the very low frequency (VLF) range, the theory of ionospheric "hops" for the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, and a self-consistent method for solving the inverse VLF problem. For this comparison, we analyzed the VLF variations during sunset hours for the radio path Aldra (Northern Norway)-Apatity (Kola Peninsula) over several days after the onset of each precipitation. The results of these solutions were the effective height and reflection coefficients of the first and second ionospheric rays ("hops") as functions of time for the radio path; the fact of a weak dependence of the complex reflection coefficients of the rays on the solar zenith angle was established. The input data for obtaining the above results were the relative amplitude and phase variations for three radio navigation frequencies of the OMEGA RNS from the interval of 10-14 kHz. For the two geophysical events, the time course of the complex reflection coefficient (its modulus and the effective reflection height of a monochromatic signal) was obtained; it was compared with the satellite data on the variations in the flux density of precipitating protons.

TI  - Maintaining Carbon Storage Does Not Reduce Fish Production from Mangrove-Fish Pond System: A Case Study in Coastal Area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and degradation of mangrove forests can be categorized as key environmental problems in Indonesia. These problems are majorly driven by overexploitation and the conversion of mangroves into brackish water aquaculture areas. One of the most common aquaculture systems traditionally developed in the coastal areas is the mangrove-fish pond system that combines fish production with existing trees. This study aims to analyze the environmental and economic aspects of mangrove-fish pond aquaculture in different levels of mangrove cover in the coastal area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia. The spatial analysis method was used to analyze mangrove distribution and identify the current coverage in the aquaculture area. The economic aspect was analyzed, based on the costs and revenue from fish production, while the environmental aspect was represented by carbon storage, which is among the crucial mangrove ecosystem services. This study estimated carbon storage in the four-carbon pools: above- and below-ground biomass, deadwood, and litterfall. Based on the combination of visual interpretation of Sentinel 2A satellite images and field observations, approximately 667 ha of mangrove-fish pond was identified. This study found that there were no significant differences in fish production and net income from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture at various levels of mangrove cover. Meanwhile, the ponds with high mangrove cover stored higher carbon than those with medium and low mangrove covers. This indicates that maintaining carbon storage does not reduce fish production from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture.

TI  - Mapping Prospective Areas of Water Resources and Monitoring Land Use/Land Cover Changes in an Arid Region Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a vital water resource for economic, agricultural, and domestic purposes in arid regions. To reduce water scarcity in arid regions, recently, remote sensing and GIS techniques have been successfully applied to predict areas with prospective water resources. Thus, this study attempted to spatially reveal groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) and to conduct change detection on the desert fringes of Wadi Asyuti, a defunct tributary of Egypt's Nile basin in eastern Sahara. Eleven influential groundwater factors generated from remote sensing imagery, and geological, hydrological, and climatic conditions were combined after giving a weight to each factor through a GIS-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with the weighted overlay technique (WOT). The results revealed six distinctive zones with scores ranging from very low (10.59%) to excellent (3.03%). Thirty-three productive groundwater wells, Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD), a land use map derived from Sentinel-2, and the delineated flooding zone derived from Landsat-8 data were used to validate the delineated zones. The GWPZs indicated that 48% of the collected wells can be classified as consistent to excellent. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and image classification were applied to the multi-temporal Landsat series and Sentinel-2 along with the InSAR CCD data derived from Sentinel-1 images to reveal dramatic changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) in terms of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities in the structurally downstream area, which is the most promising area for future developments. Overall, the integration of radar and multispectral data through the GIS technique has the ability to provide valuable information about water resources in arid regions. Thus, the tested model is a promising technique, and such information is extremely significant for the guidance of planners and decision makers in the area of sustainable development.

TI  - The Role of Surgical Axillary Staging Prior to Immediate Breast Reconstruction in the Era of De-Escalation of Axillary Management in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) following immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is associated with postoperative complications. Although the incidence of node-positive breast cancer is declining, a separate sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is still performed before mastectomy when IBR is planned, in order to evaluate nodal status and the need for PMRT. This study assessed the impact of staged SLNB on the breast reconstructive planning, and presents common clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer with macrometastatic nodal spread where staged SLNB would be beneficial to indicate PMRT. Medical records of breast cancer patients scheduled for mastectomy and IBR at Skane University Hospital, Sweden, from November 2014 to February 2020, were reviewed. Of 92 patients, node-positive disease was present in 15 (16%). Fifty-three patients underwent staged SLNB before mastectomy and IBR, and 10 (19%) presented with nodal metastasis. All patients with macrometastatic sentinel nodes were presented with palpable, multifocal, ER+ breast carcinoma of no special type with tumor size > 17.0 mm. Overall, four women received PMRT after verified metastasis by staged SLNB, and IBR was cancelled for three patients. These findings question the benefit of routine staged SLNB before mastectomy and IBR in breast cancer populations within established mammography screening programs with low risk of nodal metastasis.

TI  - Presence of Dendritic Cell Subsets in Sentinel Nodes of Breast Cancer Patients Is Related to Nodal Burden
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are both the first site where breast cancer (BC) metastases form and where anti-tumoral immunity develops. Despite being the most potent antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells (DCs) located in a nodal tissue can both promote or suppress immune response against cancer in SLNs. METHODS: In SLNs excisions obtained from 123 invasive BC patients, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD1a, CD1c, DC-LAMP, and DC-SIGN to identify different DCs populations. Then we investigated the numbers of DCs subsets in tumor-free, micrometastatic, and macrometastatic SLNs with the use of a light microscope. RESULTS: We observed that CD1c+ and DC-SIGN+ DCs were more numerous in SLNs with a larger tumor size. More abundant intratumoral DC-LAMP+ population was related to a higher number of metastatic lymph nodes. Conversely, more abundant CD1a+ DCs were associated with a decreasing nodal burden in SLNs and a lower number of involved lymph nodes. Moreover, densities of the investigated DC populations differed with respect to tumor grade, HER2 overexpression, hormone receptor status, and histologic type of BC. CONCLUSIONS: According to their subtype, DCs are associated with either lower or higher nodal burden in SLNs from invasive BC patients. These relationships appear to be dependent not only on the maturation state of DCs but also on the histological and biological characteristics of the tumor.

TI  - A Combination of Machine Learning Algorithms for Marine Plastic Litter Detection Exploiting Hyperspectral PRISMA Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant amount of the produced solid waste reaching the oceans is made of plastics. The amount of plastic debris in the ocean and coastal areas is steadily increasing and is now a major global environmental issue. The monitoring of marine plastic litter, ground-based monitoring systems and/or field campaigns are time-consuming, expensive, require great organisational efforts, and provide very limited information in terms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine debris. Earth Observation (EO) by satellite can contribute significantly to marine plastic litter detection. In 2019, a new hyperspectral satellite, called PRISMA, was launched by the Italian Space Agency. The high spectral resolution of PRISMA may allow for better detection of floating plastic materials. At the same time, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to find hidden patterns and identify complex relations among data and are increasingly employed in EO. This paper presents the development of a new method of identifying floating plastic objects in coastal areas by exploiting pan-sharpened hyperspectral PRISMA data, based on the combination of unsupervised and supervised ML algorithms. The study consisted of a configuration phase, during which the algorithms were trained in a fully controlled test, and a validation phase, in which the pre-trained algorithms were applied to satellite data collected at different sites and in different periods of the year. Despite the limited input data, results suggest that the tested ML approach, applied to pan-sharpened PRISMA data, can effectively recognise floating objects and plastic targets. The study indicates that increasing input datasets can help achieve higher-quality results.

TI  - Mapping Two Decades of New York State Forest Aboveground Biomass Change Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) provides valuable information about the carbon cycle, carbon sink monitoring, and understanding of climate change factors. Remote sensing data coupled with machine learning models have been increasingly used for forest AGB estimation over local and regional extents. Landsat series provide a 50-year data archive, which is a valuable source for historical mapping over large areas. As such, this paper proposed a machine learning-based workflow for historical AGB estimation and its change analysis from 2001 to 2019 for the New York State's forests using Landsat historical imagery, airborne LiDAR, and forest plot data. As the object-based image analysis (OBIA) is able to incorporate spectral, contextual, and textural features into the regression model, the proposed method utilizes an OBIA approach and a random forest (RF) regression model implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Results demonstrated that there is a considerable decrease of 983.79 x 10(6) Mg/ha in the AGB of deciduous forests from 2001 to 2006, followed by an increase of 618.28 x 10(6) Mg/ha from 2006 to 2011, continued with an increase of 229.12 x 10(6) Mg/ha of deciduous forests from 2011-2016. Finally, the results demonstrated a slight change in AGB from 2016 to 2019. The transferability of the proposed framework provides a practical solution for monitoring forests in other states or even on a national scale.

TI  - Analysis of Influencing Factors of SST in Tropical West Indian Ocean Based on COBE Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The time-frequency domain analysis of the sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical western Indian Ocean was conducted using wavelet analysis, cross wavelet transform (XWT), the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, and other methods based on COBE-SST data for the last 50 years (1974-2020). From the perspective of time-frequency combination, examining the data of precipitation, sea surface heat flux, total cloud cover, and long-wave radiation, helped contribute to exploring the periodic changes of SST. Moreover, the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP) was selected to analyze the role of SST from 1974 to 2020. Present results have demonstrated that the SST in the western Indian Ocean was in a stage of rising, particularly in 1998. According to the fast Fourier transform of the filtered SST time series, the tropical western Indian Ocean SST has a short period of 3-6 years, a medium period of about 10 years, and a long period of 40 years. The SST in the tropical western Indian Ocean has a resonance period of 2-6 years with precipitation, a resonance period of 2-6 years with sea surface heat flux, a resonance period of 4-5 years with total cloud cover, and a resonance period of 2-5 years with long-wave radiation. Importantly, SST was negatively associated with precipitation, total cloud cover, and long-wave radiation, and positively for sea surface heat flux before 1997. Seasonal migration activities are significantly correlated with the WHWP and the tropical western Indian Ocean SST. The spatial lattice point correlation coefficient is generally from 0.6 to 0.9, and the inter-annual serial correlation value is more than 0.89. Furthermore, the two exist with a resonance period of 2-5 years.

TI  - Successful Derivation of Absorbing Aerosol Index from the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We retrieved the absorbing aerosol index (AAI) based on the measured reflectance from the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) for the first time. EMI is a push-broom spectrometer onboard the Chinese GeoFen-5 satellite launched on 9 May 2018, which was initially developed to determine the global distribution of atmospheric composition. The EMI initial AAI results were corrected from physical stripes and yielded an offset of 5.92 as calibration errors from a background value based on the statistical method that count the EMI AAI over the Pacific Ocean under cloudless scenes. We also evaluated the consistency of the EMI AAI and data with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations. A comparison between the monthly average EMI AAI data and TROPOMI AAI revealed regional consistencies between these instruments with a similar spatial distribution of AAI (correlation coefficient, r > 0.9). The daily-scale results demonstrated that EMI was also consistent with TROPOMI AAI (r = 0.9). The spatial distribution of EMI AAI is consistent with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from TROPOMI. The daily variation of EMI AAI in an Australian wildfire event was consistent with TROPOMI (r = 0.92). Overall, we demonstrated that EMI AAI can be efficiently used to detect large aerosol events for reconstructing the spatial variability of Ultraviolet (UV) absorbing aerosols.

TI  - A Spatial Long-Term Trend Analysis of Estimated Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in Utah Lake Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in shallow, turbid Utah Lake using Landsat data from 1984 to 2021. Utah Lake is similar to 40 km by 21 km, has a surface area of similar to 390 km(2), an average depth of similar to 3 m, and loses similar to 50% of inflow to evaporation. This limits spatial mixing, allowing us to evaluate impacts on smaller lake regions. We evaluated long-term trends at the pixel level and for areas related to boundary conditions. We created 17 study areas based on differences in shoreline development and nutrient inflows. We expected impacted areas to exhibit increasing chl-a trends, as population growth and development in the Utah Lake watershed have been significant. We used the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test to evaluate trends. The majority of the lake exhibited decreasing trends, with a few pixels in Provo and Goshen Bays exhibiting slight increasing or no trends. We estimated trend magnitudes using Sen's slope and fitted linear regression models. Trend magnitudes in all pixels (and regions), both decreasing and increasing, were small; with the largest decreasing and increasing trends being about -0.05 and -0.005 mu g/L/year, and about 0.1 and 0.005 mu g/L/year for the Sen's slope and linear regression slope, respectively. Over the similar to 40 year-period, this would result in average decreases of 2 to 0.2 mu g/L or increases of 4 and 0.2 mu g/L. All the areas exhibited decreasing trends, but the monthly trends in some areas exhibited no trends rather than decreasing trends. Monthly trends for some areas showed some indications that algal blooms are occurring earlier, though evidence is inconclusive. We found essentially no change in algal concentrations in Utah Lake at either the pixel level or for the analysis regions since the 1980's; despite significant population expansion; increased nutrient inflows; and land-use changes. This result matches prior research and supports the hypothesis that algal growth in Utah Lake is not limited by direct nutrient inflows but limited by other factors.

TI  - Divergent effects of climate change on cropland ecosystem water use efficiency at different elevations in southwestern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding climatic effects on cropland water use efficiency at different elevations is imperative for managing agricultural water and production in response to ongoing climate change in climate-sensitive areas with complex topography, such as southwestern China. We investigated climatic effects on cropland water use efficiency in southwestern China at each 100-m elevation bin during 2001-2017. The maximum water use efficiency was 1.71 gC kg(-1) H2O for the 1900-1999 m elevation bin under the growing season temperature and precipitation of 14.58 +/- 0.32 degrees C and 965.40 +/- 136.45 mm, respectively. The water use efficiency slopes were dominated by the evapotranspiration slopes at elevations below 1999 m but were controlled by the gross primary productivity slopes at elevations above 2000 m. This difference was caused by the substantial responses of evaporation to climate change at lower elevations and the increased climatic sensitivity of gross primary productivity at higher elevations. In comparison to those at other elevations, croplands at lower elevations were more vulnerable to extreme drought because of the dominant role fluctuating evapotranspiration played in water use efficiency. The findings will improve cropland water management in the study area.

TI  - Comparison of KOMPSAT-5 and Sentinel-1 Radar Data for Soil Moisture Estimations Using a New Semi-Empirical Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - X-band KOMPSAT-5 provides a good perspective for soil moisture retrieval at high-spatial resolution over arid and semi-arid areas. In this paper, an intercomparison of KOMPSAT-5 and C-band Sentinel-1 radar data in soil moisture retrieval was conducted over agricultural fields in Wimmera, Victoria, Australia. Optical images from Sentinel-2 were also used to calculate the scattering contribution of vegetation. This study employed a new semi-empirical vegetation scattering model with a linear association of soil moisture with observed backscatter coefficient and vegetation indices. The Combined Vegetation Index (CVI) was proposed and first used to parameterize vegetation water content. As a result, the vegetation scattering model was developed to monitor soil moisture based on remotely sensed data and ground measurements. Application of the algorithm over dryland wheat field sites demonstrated that the estimated satellite-based soil moisture contents have good linear relationships with the ground measurements. The correlation coefficients (R) are 0.862 and 0.616, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) have the values of 0.020 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.032 cm(3)/cm(3) at X- and C-bands, respectively. Furthermore, the validation results also indicated that X-band provided higher consistent accuracy for soil moisture inversion than C-band. These results showed significant promise in retrieving soil moisture using KOMPSAT-5 and Sentinel-1 remotely sensed data at high-spatial resolution over agricultural fields, with subsequent uses for crop growth and yield estimation.

T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) has an important impact on morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. The SERENNO Sentinel system (Serenno Medical, Yokne'am Illit, Israel) is a novel device that allows automatic and continuous IAP measurements. Aims: Pre-clinical validation in a bench model study comparing the new device with the gold standard method and two other continuous IAP measurement devices. Methods: IAP measurement with the novel SERENNO device (IAP(SER)) was compared with the gold standard IAP(H2O) (water column height) and two other automatic and continuous IAP measurement devices: IAP(CiM) measured via the CiMON device (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) and IAP(SPIE) measured using the Spiegelberg device (Spiegelberg, Hamburg, Germany), which previously received the CE mark for clinical applications. The IAP measurement was performed six times (n = 6) at each pressure value (between 0 and 35 mmHg) with different methods and the height of the water column in a bench-top phantom was used as the reference IAP for further interpretations. In addition to the quadruple comparisons, intra- and inter-observer variability of IAP measurements were also calculated. Correlation studies and Bland and Altman's analyses were performed in addition to the concordance study. Results: The CiMON and Spiegelberg devices showed a greater dynamic range and standard deviation when recording IAP(CiM) and IAP(SPIE) compared with IAP(SER). In general, the maximum and minimum values of IAP recorded with each device (at each level of IAP(H2O)) were significantly different from each other. However, the average values were in very good agreement. The highest correlation was observed between IAP(SER) and IAP(H2O), and IAP(SER) and IAP(SPIE) (R = 0.99, p = 0.001 for both comparisons and intra- and inter-observer measurements). Although the CiMON and SERENNO systems were in very good agreement with each other, a slightly smaller correlation coefficient was found between them (R = 0.95, p = 0.001, and R = 0.96, p = 0.001 for intra- and inter-observer measurements, respectively). When compared to the gold standard (IAP(H2O)), Bland and Altman's analysis showed a mean difference of +0.44, -0.25, and -0.04 mmHg for the intra-observer measurements and +0.18, -0.75, and -0.58 mmHg for the inter-observer measurements for IAP(SER), IAP(CiM), and IAP(SPIE), respectively. IAP(SER) showed a small positive bias (overestimation), while IAP(CiM) and IAP(SPIE) showed a negative bias (underestimation) when compared to IAP(H2O). Further statistical analysis showed a concordance coefficient of 100% with an excellent ability of the SERENNO system in tracking IAP(H2O) changes. Conclusions: Pre-clinical validation of a new IAP monitoring device (SERENNO) showed very promising results when compared with the gold standard and other continuous techniques; however, clinical trials should be followed as the next stage of the validation process. Based on the actual research guidelines, the SERENNO system can be used interchangeably with the gold standard.

TI  - The role of wind, mesoscale dynamics, and coastal circulation in the interannual variability of the South Vietnam Upwelling, South China Sea - answers from a high-resolution ocean model
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The South Vietnam Upwelling (SVU) develops in the South China Sea (SCS) under the influence of southwest monsoon winds. To study the role of small spatiotemporal scales on the SVU functioning and variability, a simulation was performed over 2009-2018 with a high-resolution configuration (1 km at the coast) of the SYMPHONIE model implemented over the western region of the SCS. Its capability to represent ocean dynamics and water masses from daily to interannual scales and from coastal to regional areas is quantitatively demonstrated by comparison with available satellite data and four in situ datasets. The SVU interannual variability is examined for the three development areas already known: the southern (SCU) and northern (NCU) coastal upwelling areas and the offshore upwelling area (OFU). Our high-resolution model, together with in situ observations and high-resolution satellite data, moreover shows for the first time that upwelling develops over the Sunda Shelf off the Mekong Delta (MKU). Our results confirm for the SCU and OFU and show for the MKU the role of the mean summer intensity of wind and cyclonic circulation over the offshore area in driving the interannual variability of the upwelling intensity. They further reveal that other factors contribute to SCU and OFU variability. First, the intraseasonal wind chronology strengthens (in the case of regular wind peaks occurring throughout the summer for SCU or of stronger winds in July-August for OFU) or weakens (in the case of intermittent wind peaks for SCU) the summer average upwelling intensity. Second, the mesoscale circulation influences this intensity (multiple dipole eddies and associated eastward jets developing along the coast enhance the SCU intensity). The NCU interannual variability is less driven by the regional-scale wind (with weaker monsoon favoring stronger NCU) and more by the mesoscale circulation in the NCU area: the NCU is prevented (favored) when alongshore (offshore) currents prevail.

TI  - HIGH-RESOLUTION SPATIAL SOLUTION FOR AIR QUALITY ASSESSMENT IN THE TROPICAL CITY OF HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is the leading environmental agent that poses a severe threat to human health and is one of the most severe problems in cities. Of the pollutants, particulate matter (PM), especially particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter, has the most profound health impacts. Urbanization and industrialization in cities have made the air quality up there worse and worse. Our study was based on the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) feature, a parameter obtained by remote sensing that relates to the presence of airborne particles potentially associated with PM. In this study, the PM2.5 concentration data from the ground monitoring station and the MODIS AOD product of 3 km resolution were correlated to build a suitable regression function to simulate the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations. Next, the AOD was retrieved from the Landsat image based on the characteristics of the decrease in atmospheric clarity caused by the pollution particles. Landsat AOD has a 600m higher resolution than MODIS AOD. Research results on air quality (AQ) were simulated on Landsat AOD image through PM2.5 concentration distribution and air quality index (AQI), in which AQI was determined based on USEPA standards The analysis shows that the linear regression function between PM2.5 concentration and MODIS AOD correlated best with the correlation coefficient R=0.9. Then PM2.5 distribution was established on Landsat AOD image with higher spatial resolution. Case analysis for March of 2018 reflected that the average concentration of PM2.5 across Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) was higher than the allowable threshold specified in QCVN05:2013/BTNMT. PM2.5 concentration in central districts tended to be higher than in suburban districts. The study also found that the city average AQI-PM2.5 was around 97.38, peaking at 159, which was in the Unhealthy range, especially for sensitive groups. The result of the study provides potential solutions for AQ monitoring at the city level with a detailed spatial distribution.

TI  - Assessment of spatial-temporal changes in water bodies and its influencing factors using remote sensing and GIS - a model study in the southeast coast of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns have been raised about the threat of ecological imbalance due to the loss of water bodies in densely populated areas. The present study explored the changes in water bodies in terms of area, number, and size in northern districts of Tamil Nadu, India, between 1978 and 2018 using satellite data, geographic information system, spatial analysis, ground truth verification, and field validation. The analysis indicated that the water bodies' area has reduced by 3027 ha and 4363 ha in the Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur Districts, respectively. Almost 179 water bodies have entirely disappeared, and 628 water bodies have been partly converted for other purposes. Of the disappeared water bodies, small, medium, and large water bodies account for 53, 93, and 33, respectively. The main reason for the changes in water bodies was the conversion to agriculture and buildings. Overall, the water bodies' area and number have been reduced by 9% and 12%, respectively, while the population has grown by 37%. The water bodies lost due to anthropogenic activities demand the scientific inventory of water bodies and integrated water resources management at a state or national level with strict monitoring regulations to protect them.

TI  - Technology for Position Correction of Satellite Precipitation and Contributions to Error Reduction-A Case of the '720' Rainstorm in Henan, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In July 2021, an extreme precipitation event occurred in Henan, China, causing tremendous damage and deaths; so, it is very important to study the observation technology of extreme precipitation. Surface rain gauge precipitation observations have high accuracy but low resolution and coverage. Satellite remote sensing has high spatial resolution and wide coverage, but has large precipitation accuracy and distribution errors. Therefore, how to merge the above two kinds of precipitation observations effectively to obtain heavy precipitation products with more accurate geographic distributions has become an important but difficult scientific problem. In this paper, a new information fusion method for improving the position accuracy of satellite precipitation estimations is used based on the idea of registration and warping in image processing. The key point is constructing a loss function that includes a term for measuring two information field differences and a term for a warping field constraint. By minimizing the loss function, the purpose of position error correction of quantitative precipitation estimation from FY-4A and Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals of GPM are achieved, respectively, using observations from surface rain gauge stations. The errors of different satellite precipitation products relative to ground stations are compared and analyzed before and after position correction, using the '720' extreme precipitation in Henan, China, as an example. The experimental results show that the final run has the best performance and FY-4A has the worse performance. After position corrections, the precipitation products of the three satellites are improved, among which FY-4A has the largest improvement, IMERG final run has the smallest improvement, and IMERG late run has the best performance and the smallest error. Their mean absolute errors are reduced by 23%, 14%, and 16%, respectively, and their correlation coefficients with rain gauge stations are improved by 63%, 9%, and 16%, respectively. The error decomposition model is used to examine the contributions of each error component to the total error. The results show that the new method improves the precipitation products of GPM primarily in terms of hit bias. However, it does not significantly reduce the hit bias of precipitation products of FY-4A while it reduces the total error by reducing the number of false alarms.

TI  - Implications and interrelations of litho-boundaries and vicinity of lineaments for hydrothermal alteration zones under remote sensing and GIS environment
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The applicability and significance of remote sensing images varies according to capability of synoptic view. These synoptic views of satellite images have tremendous utility to solve many geological enigmas due to constraints of limitations of investigations (manual/mapping error) in the field of geology. To prepare more accurate remote locations, structural maps such as lineament, fold, faults, shear zone, geomorphology, lithology and mineralogy of remote sensing image helps to solve these problems. In the research work of the hydrothermal alteration minerals zoning and identification completed through spectroscopic and advanced visible-infrared imaging spectroscopy new generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral remote sensing data. To establish intercorrelation and implications of lineaments with hydrothermal alteration zone of the study area prepared lineament map through manual and auto extraction using Landsat 7 ETM + and ASTER digital elevation model (DEM) remote sensing data with the applications of algorithms such as Sobels filtering and "LINE" tool of PCI Geomatica. The networks of lineaments have a significant role in demarcation of potential mineral zones. To get vicinity of lineaments, prepared a lineament density map through extracted lineaments. In the final output the vicinity of lineaments density, mineral sample locations, mineral map and regolith zones have shown strong correlation among each other. So, the conclusion is that there is a strong significance in intercorrelation of hydrothermal alteration zones, lineaments and litho-boundaries. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Feasibility of Monitoring Great Plains Playa Inundation with the Sentinel 2A/B Satellites for Ecological and Hydrological Applications
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Playas are ecologically and hydrologically important ephemeral wetlands found in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Urbanization, changes in agricultural land use and irrigation practices, and climate change all threaten playas. While variations in playa inundation on the Great Plains of North America have been previously analyzed by satellite using annual and decadal time scales, no study to our knowledge has monitored the Great Plains playa inundation area using sub-monthly time scales. Thousands of playas smaller than similar to 50 m in diameter, which were not previously identified by the Landsat satellite platform, can now be captured by higher resolution satellite data. In this preliminary study, we demonstrate monitoring spatial and temporal changes in the playa water inundation area on sub-monthly times scales between September 2018 and February 2019 over a region in West Texas, USA, using 10 m spatial resolution imagery from the Sentinel-2A/B satellites. We also demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits of using the Sentinel-2A/B satellite retrievals, in combination with precipitation and evaporation data, to monitor playas for environmental, ecological, groundwater recharge, and hydrological applications.

TI  - Characterizing a Heavy Dust Storm Event in 2021: Transport, Optical Properties and Impact, Using Multi-Sensor Data Observed in Jinan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 15 March 2021, the strongest sandstorm of the last 10 years occurred in China. The MODIS, MPL lidar, EDM 180, ADI 2080 and Meteorological observation instruments were used to observe the dust in Jinan, China, while the HYSPLIT model was also employed to find the source. It was found that the dust originated from Mongolia and the Gobi desert and was transported to Jinan at night on 14th March, lasting until the 18th. Multi-layer dust was observed, of which the dust below the height of 1 km was strongest with the VDR about 0.2 and the maximum extinction coefficient up to 3 km(-1). The values of AOD and AE were greater than 2 and less than 0.25, respectively. The mass concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 increased rapidly, and were up to 573 mu g/m(3) and 3406 mu g/m(3), respectively. Additionally, the mass concentration ratio decreased rapidly, with a minimum of 17%. The particle size of the dust was mainly distributed between 0.58-6.50 micros due to larger particles increasing dramatically; simultaneously, both the proportion and the value for calcium ions in PM2.5 went up. The dust had an obvious impact on the vertical structure of the air temperature, resulting in occurrence of a strong inversion layer.

TI  - MTBF-33: A multi-temporal building footprint dataset for 33 counties in the United States (1900 - 2015)
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Despite abundant data on the spatial distribution of contemporary human settlements, historical datasets on the longterm evolution of human settlements at fine spatial and temporal granularity are scarce, limiting our quantitative understanding of long-term changes of built-up areas. This is because commonly used large-scale mapping methods (e.g., computer vision) and suitable data sources (i.e., aerial imagery, remote sensing data, LiDAR data) have only been available in recent decades. However, there are alternative data sources such as cadastral records that are digitally available, containing relevant information such as building construction dates, allowing for an approximate, digital reconstruction of past building distributions. We conducted a non-exhaustive search of open and publicly available data resources from administrative institutions in the United States and gathered, integrated, and harmonized cadastral parcel data, tax assessment data, and building footprint data for 33 counties, wherever building footprint geometries and building construction year information was available. The result of this effort is a unique dataset that we call the Multi-Temporal Building Footprint Dataset for 33 U.S. Counties (MTBF-33). MTBF-33 contains over 6.2 million building footprints including their construction year, and can be used to derive retrospective depictions of built-up areas from 1900 to 2015, at fine spatial and temporal grain. Moreover, MTBF-33 can be employed for data validation purposes, or to train statistical learning models aiming to extract historical information on human settlements from remote sensing data, historical maps, or similar data sources.

TI  - Analysis of the Understanding and Worry about Lymphedema of Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymphedema is a potential lifelong sequela of breast cancer treatment. We sought to: (1) evaluate the worry and knowledge of patients about lymphedema, (2) quantify patients reporting lymphedema education and screening, and (3) determine willingness to participate in lymphedema screening and prevention programs. Patients and Methods A survey evaluating lymphedema-related knowledge and worry was sent to patients treated for stage 0-III breast cancer. Exclusion criteria included > 10 years since diagnosis, missing clinical staging, and those without axillary surgery. Responses were linked with clinicopathologic information. Results Of 141 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 89% of those without lymphedema were not at all or slightly worried about lymphedema. Higher levels of worry were associated with clinical stage II-III disease [odds ratio (OR) 2.63, p = 0.03], a history of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (OR 4.58, p < 0.01), and employment (OR 2.21, p = 0.05). A total of 102 (72%) patients recalled receiving lymphedema education. Lymphedema knowledge was limited, with < 25% of respondents answering > 50% of the risk factor questions correctly. Worry and knowledge were not significantly associated. Of patients without lymphedema, 36% were interested in learning more about lymphedema and 64% were willing to participate in or learn more about a screening program. Most (66%) felt that lymphedema information should be provided before and after cancer treatment. Discussion A majority of our breast cancer survivors had limited knowledge about lymphedema risk factors. While most patients were not worried about developing lymphedema, higher worry was seen in patients with a higher clinical stage at diagnosis, ALND, and employment. Our findings suggest potential targets and timing for patient-centered educational interventions.

TI  - Multisource and temporal thermal infrared remote sensing of Hasandag Stratovolcano (Central Anatolia, Turkey)
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hasandag is a double-peaked long-dormant volcano, where associated volcanic risk is poorly known and needs to be assessed. Weak fumaroles and water vapor emissions have been observed at several vents, on the western flank of the Greater Hasandag summit, between 3000 and 3100 m (a.s.l.). The highest temperature and CO2 values measured in those vents were similar to 70 degrees C and > 100,000 ppm respectively. Multisource and wide-period thermal remote sensing analyses were performed to investigate the thermal state and to test the possibilities of remote thermal monitoring of the volcano.MODIS daily surface temperature data were analyzed for a period of 18 years. We used a statistical approach using the Seasonal Decomposition of Time-series procedure to decompose the temperature data into the trend, seasonal, and remainder components. The trend component was used to analyze temporal thermal anomalies in comparison to the decomposed meteorological temperature data. 56 nighttime ASTER TIR imagery acquired between 2001 and 2018 had been used to derive and analyze the Surface temperature, Surface temperature anomaly and Relative radiative heat flux. High-resolution ground-based and aerial thermal mosaic images were built to investigate the thermal radiation over the summit fumarole zone and its structural dependence.A baseline reference value for thermal monitoring of the fumarole zone was achieved using remotely sensed data and time-series decomposition of long-term TIR data. The resolution of the thermal imagery positively affects the mapping and monitoring capability. A permanent ground-based thermal observation station should be established for direct and remote thermal monitoring of the fumarole zone.

TI  - Comparison of Long-Term Albedo Products against Spatially Representative Stations over Snow
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple satellite products are available to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface albedo. They are extensively assessed over snow-free surfaces but less over snow. However, snow albedo is critical for climate monitoring applications, so a better understating of the accuracy of these products over snow is needed. This work analyzes long-term (+20 years) products (MCD43C3 v6/v6.1, GLASS-AVHRR, C3S v1/v2) by comparing them against the 11 most spatially representative stations from FLUXNET and BSRN during the snow-free and snow-covered season. Our goal is to understand how the performance of these products is affected by different snow cover conditions to use this information in an upcoming product inter-comparison that extends the analysis spatially and temporally. MCD43C3 has the smallest bias during the snow season (-0.017), and more importantly, the most stable bias with different snow cover conditions. Both v6 and v6.1 have similar performance, with v6.1 just increasing slightly the coverage at high latitudes. On the contrary, the quality of both GLASS-AVHRR and C3S-v1/v2 albedo decreases over snow. Particularly, the bias of both products varies strongly with the snow cover conditions, underestimating albedo over snow and overestimating snow-free albedo. GLASS bias strongly increases during the melting season, which is most likely due to an artificially extended snow season. C3S-v2 has the largest negative bias overall over snow during both the AVHRR (-0.141) and SPOT/VGT (-0.134) period. In addition, despite the improvements from v1 to v2, C3S-v2 still is not consistent enough during the transition from AVHRR to SPOT/VGT.

T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Alpha im: The Axillary Reverse Mapping technique in breast cancer, was adopted in order to minimize the risk of upper limb lymphedema. Currently, there is only limited evidence available regarding its oncological safety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of upper limb nodes in surgical specimens following axillary lymphadenectomy, and its relative predictive relevance. Patients and Methods: All patients undergoing axillary lymphadenectomy were enrolled in the current prospective observational study. Indocyanine green was injected into the ipsilateral arm, followed by the standard axillary surgical procedure. Subsequently, the surgical specimens were examined in order to identify any resected upper limb nodes. Results: Out of 22 patients, 5 (22.7%) exhibited fluorescent nodes in the surgical specimen. At univariate analysis, these patients presented statistically significant differences in terms of neoadjuvant treatment, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki67 index and position of fluorescent lymph nodes (p=0.021, p=0.033, p=0.002, p=0.049 and p=0.001, respectively). At multivariate analysis, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Ki67 index were associated with the risk of resecting fluorescent nodes during a standard lymphadenectomy (p=0.005 and p=0.018, respectively). Conclusion: Axillary Reverse Mapping should be individually tailored for patients with advanced axillary breast cancer and those undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. Suspected metastases or upper limb nodes identified in unusual positions must always be resected.

TI  - Remote Monitoring of Atmospheric and Hydrophysical Characteristics of the Water Surface Based on Microwave Radiometric Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work summarizes the main characteristics of atmospheric and hydro-physical parameters of the water surface derived from microwave radiometric data. First, current knowledge based on experimental measurements and model calculations of emissivity of the atmosphere and water surface in the microwave spectrum is presented. Emphasis is placed on remote radio-physical methods that have the peculiarity of being related to atmospheric radio-transparency which is one of the main advantages of the microwave radiometric method compared to optical and infrared methods. A detailed presentation is attempted with specific examples of classification of water surface phenomena using software modules included in the system used for the processing of data of radio-physical experiments by the Cosmos-1500 satellite. In addition, the statistical characteristics of the "spotting" of radio-brightness temperatures obtained for the most informative thresholds are analyzed and it is argued that these characteristics for the Pacific areas can also be used to detect abnormal phenomena on the water surface of the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, it is emphasized that the results obtained from this work make it possible to rapidly evaluate various parameters such as temperature, water surface waves, foam formation areas, etc., providing predictions and allocating irregular areas.

TI  - Normalized Sand Index for Identification of Bare Sand Areas in Temperate Climates Using Landsat Images, Application to the South of Romania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of bare sand surfaces indicates a tendency towards desertfication in certain periods as a result of the improper agricultural use of sand soils and of the significant changes in the climate in the past 30 years. The Normalised Sand Index (NSI) is a new index used to identify bare sand areas and their spatio-temporal evolution in SW Romania. Landsat scenes (1988, 2001, 2019), spectral and soil texture analysis (36 samples), covariates (e.g., soil map), and field observations allowed for the validation of the results. The performance of the NSI was compared with indices from the sand index family (e.g., Normalized Differential Sand Areas Index) and supervised classifications (e.g., Maximum Likelihood Classification) based on 47 random control square areas for which the soil texture is known. A statistical analysis of the NSI showed 23.6% (27,310.14 hectares) of bare sands in 1988, followed by an accelerated increase to 47.2% (54,737.73 hectares) in 2001 because of economic and land-use changes, and a lower increase by 2019, which reached 52.5% (60,852.42 hectares) due to reforestation programs. Compared to the NSI, the bare sand areas obtained with the tested indicator were almost 20% higher. The traditional classification shows smaller areas of bare sands but uses a higher complexity of land use classes, while the producer accuracy values are lower than those of the NSI. The new index has achieved a correct spatial delimitation of soils in the interdune-dune and major riverbed-interfluvial areas, but it is limited to the transition Arenosols-Chernozems by humus content and agrotechnical works. The new spectral index favours bare sand monitoring and is a fast and inexpensive method of observing the desertification trend of temperate sandy agroecosystems in the context of climate change.

TI  - NASIMI'S POETRY IN THE DISCOURSE OF TURKISH RENAISSANCE: PHILOSOPHICAL AND AESTHETICAL ISSUES
T2  - SYNESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the paper, the authors examine the works of the classic of Azerbaijani literature Imadeddin Nasimi (1369-1417) through the prism of the theory of Nikolai Konrad. He stated that the Renaissance as a cultural era originated and developed first in Asian literature and then flourished in Europe. The dominant features of the Renaissance worldview, their manifestation in European and Asian literatures are determined. Nasimi was a prominent apologist for Hurufism, promoted it by literary means, but his work was much broader than the popularization of Hurufite teachings and had a universal significance. Interpretation of Nasimi's works shows that his glorification of a human being, recognition of godliness, national intentions, creativity in the native Azerbaijani language, along with the `book' language of Farsi, reinforces self-knowledge, synthesis of faith with personal doubts, cult of feelings (love) giving grounds that Nasimi's work organically fits into the context of Renaissance culture. These features determine the greatness and genius of Imadeddin Nasimi's poetry.

TI  - Global 10 m Land Use Land Cover Datasets: A Comparison of Dynamic World, World Cover and Esri Land Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency's Sentinel satellites have laid the foundation for global land use land cover (LULC) mapping with unprecedented detail at 10 m resolution. We present a cross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google's Dynamic World (DW), ESA's World Cover (WC) and Esri's Land Cover (Esri) products for the first time in order to inform the adoption and application of these maps going forward. For the year 2020, the three global LULC maps show strong spatial correspondence (i.e., near-equal area estimates) for water, built area, trees and crop LULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased towards over-estimating grass cover, Esri towards shrub and scrub cover and DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground truth data with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m(2), we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75%) compared to DW (72%) and WC (65%). Across all global maps, water was the most accurately mapped class (92%), followed by built area (83%), tree cover (81%) and crops (78%), particularly in biomes characterized by temperate and boreal forests. The classes with the lowest accuracies, particularly in the tundra biome, included shrub and scrub (47%), grass (34%), bare ground (57%) and flooded vegetation (53%). When using European ground truth data from LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) with a minimum mapping unit of <100 m(2), we found that WC had the highest accuracy (71%) compared to DW (66%) and Esri (63%), highlighting the ability of WC to resolve landscape elements with more detail compared to DW and Esri. Although not analyzed in our study, we discuss the relative advantages of DW due to its frequent and near real-time data delivery of both categorical predictions and class probability scores. We recommend that the use of global LULC products should involve critical evaluation of their suitability with respect to the application purpose, such as aggregate changes in ecosystem accounting versus site-specific change detection in monitoring, considering trade-offs between thematic resolution, global versus. local accuracy, class-specific biases and whether change analysis is necessary. We also emphasize the importance of not estimating areas from pixel-counting alone but adopting best practices in design-based inference and area estimation that quantify uncertainty for a given study area.

TI  - Evaluation of Simulated AVIRIS-NG Imagery Using a Spectral Reconstruction Method for the Retrieval of Leaf Chlorophyll Content
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a vital parameter that indicates plant production, stress, and nutrient availability. It is critically needed for precision farming. There are several multispectral images available freely, but their applicability is restricted due to their low spectral resolution, whereas hyperspectral images which have high spectral resolution are very limited in availability. In this work, hyperspectral imagery (AVIRIS-NG) is simulated using a multispectral image (Sentinel-2) and a spectral reconstruction method, namely, the universal pattern decomposition method (UPDM). UPDM is a linear unmixing technique, which assumes that every pixel of an image can be decomposed as a linear composition of different classes present in that pixel. The simulated AVIRIS-NG was very similar to the original image, and its applicability in estimating LCC was further verified by using the ground based measurements, which showed a good correlation value (R = 0.65). The simulated image was further classified using a spectral angle mapper (SAM), and an accuracy of 87.4% was obtained, moreover a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the classifier was also plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated with values greater than 0.9. The obtained results suggest that simulated AVIRIS-NG is quite useful and could be used for vegetation parameter retrieval.

TI  - Identifying Land-Use Related Potential Disaster Risk Drivers in the Ayeyarwady Delta (Myanmar) during the Last 50 Years (1974-2021) Using a Hybrid Ensemble Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) dynamics significantly impact deltas, which are among the world's most valuable but also vulnerable habitats. Non-risk-oriented LULCCs can act as disaster risk drivers by increasing levels of exposure and vulnerability or by reducing capacity. Making thematically detailed long-term LULCC data available is crucial to improving understanding of those dynamics interlinked at different spatiotemporal scales. For the Ayeyarwady Delta, one of the least studied mega-deltas, such comprehensive information is still lacking. This study used 50 Landsat and Sentinel-1A images spanning five decades from 1974 to 2021 in five-year intervals. A hybrid ensemble model consisting of six machine-learning classifiers was employed to generate land-cover maps from the images, achieving accuracies of about 90%. The major identified potential risk-relevant LULCC dynamics include urban growth towards low-lying areas, mangrove deforestation, and the expansion of irrigated agricultural areas and cultivated aquatic surfaces. The novel area-wide LULCC products achieved through the analyses provide a basis to support future risk-sensitive development decisions and can be used for regionally adapted disaster risk management plans and models. Developed with freely available data and open-source software, they hold great potential to increase research activity in the Ayeyarwady Delta and will be shared upon request.

TI  - Cleaner Skies during the COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - During spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused massive reductions in emissions from industry and ground and airborne transportation. To explore the resulting atmospheric composition changes, we conducted the BLUESKY campaign with two research aircraft and measured trace gases, aerosols, and cloud properties from the boundary layer to the lower stratosphere. From 16 May to 9 June 2020, we performed 20 flights in the early COVID-19 lockdown phase over Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. We found up to 50% reductions in boundary layer nitrogen dioxide concentrations in urban areas from GOME-2B satellite data, along with carbon monoxide reductions in the pollution hot spots. We measured 20%-70% reductions in total reactive nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and fine mode aerosol concentration in profiles over German cities compared to a 10-yr dataset from passenger aircraft. The total aerosol mass was significantly reduced below 5 km altitude, and the organic aerosol fraction also aloft, indicative of decreased organic precursor gas emissions. The reduced aerosol optical thickness caused a perceptible shift in sky color toward the blue part of the spectrum (hence BLUESKY) and increased shortwave radiation at the surface. We find that the 80% decline in air traffic led to substantial reductions in nitrogen oxides at cruise altitudes, in contrail cover, and in resulting radiative forcing. The light extinction and depolarization by cirrus were also reduced in regions with substantially decreased air traffic. General circulation-chemistry model simulations indicate good agreement with the measurements when applying a reduced emission scenario. The comprehensive BLUESKY dataset documents the major impact of anthropogenic emissions on the atmospheric composition.

TI  - Small dams: determining the minimum waterbody surface area that can be successfully detected using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a scarce resource in South Africa, and approximately 62% of the water used in South Africa is for irrigation. This water is stored in many small dams scattered across the country. If not managed correctly, they could have a negative effect on catchment areas and on the availability of water. As such, there is a need for a new monitoring and management system to be developed. This study determined the minimum surface area that would be required for a waterbody to be detected on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. A Random Forest classifier was used to detect waterbodies on a Sentinel-1 image calculated from a time series of imagery taken over a period of three months. Steep incidence angles outperformed shallow incidence angles, with the classification having an overall accuracy of 80%. Detection rates were almost 90% for waterbodies of one hectare and greater, with no false positives, and a 10% false negative rate. These findings provide the foundation for developing a detection and monitoring system, which would allow for the better management of water resources in South Africa.

TI  - Evaluating the efficiency of coarser to finer resolution multispectral satellites in mapping paddy rice fields using GEE implementation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate estimation of rice-growing areas and forecasting of production can provide crucial information for governments, planners, and decision-makers in formulating policies. While there exists studies focusing on paddy rice mapping, only few have compared multi-scale datasets performance in rice classification. Furthermore, rice mapping of large geographical areas with sufficient accuracy for planning purposes has been a challenge in Pakistan, but recent advancements in Google Earth Engine make it possible to analyze spatial and temporal variations within these areas. The study was carried out over southern Punjab (Pakistan)-a region with 380,400 hectares devoted to rice production in year 2020. Previous studies support the individual capabilities of Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for paddy rice classification. However, to our knowledge, no study has compared the efficiencies of these three datasets in rice crop classification. Thus, this study primarily focuses on comparing these satellites' data by estimating their potential in rice crop classification using accuracy assessment methods and area estimation. The overall accuracies were found to be 96% for Sentinel-2, 91.7% for Landsat-8, and 82.6% for MODIS. The F1-Scores for derived rice class were 83.8%, 75.5%, and 65.5% for Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS, respectively. The rice estimated area corresponded relatively well with the crop statistics report provided by the Department of Agriculture, Punjab, with a mean percentage difference of less than 20% for Sentinel-2 and MODIS and 33% for Landsat-8. The outcomes of this study highlight three points; (a) Rice mapping accuracy improves with increase in spatial resolution, (b) Sentinel-2 efficiently differentiated individual farm level paddy fields while Landsat-8 was not able to do so, and lastly (c) Increase in rice cultivated area was observed using satellite images compared to the government provided statistics.

TI  - An analysis of fire dynamics in and around indigenous territories and protected areas in a Brazilian agricultural frontier
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable land management is integral to conserving tropical ecosystems and reducing carbon emissions. Human-set fires are part of the land cover change process and are the most common driver of deforestation and carbon emissions in Amazonia. Analyzing the behavior of major fire events provides insight into the effectiveness of current protections. This study aims to quantify the role of Indigenous Territories and Protected Areas (ITPAs) in characterizing anthropogenic fire regimes over the 2020 fire season in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Because of the rapid rate of land cover change and lack of widespread ground validation data in the region, we used a combination of ESA's Sentinel-5 Precursor Aerosol Index, NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, and high resolution Planet satellite imagery for the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project to analyze spatial and temporal patterns by fire type. ITPAs cover 25% of the study area's land and contained approximately 20% of significant recorded fires in 2020. Recently deforested areas, forest, grassland, and cropland fires showed varying seasonality and lower frequencies inside ITPAs, but mean fire start dates for all fire types occurred in mid-September. Results suggest that the overall density of major fires is reduced in ITs. PAs only inhibit the density of crop or pastureland fires, but no major fires occurred past 10 km inside their borders. Burn severity of major fires had a weak relationship to distance from ITPAs for some fire types. This study highlights the advantages of near real-time data for individual fire events, provides further evidence of the effect of ITPAs on fire behavior, and demonstrates the importance of adequate protection strategies for mitigating fire activity.

TI  - Observational Constraints on Southern Ocean Cloud-Phase Feedback
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortwave radiative feedbacks from Southern Ocean clouds are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. Much of this uncertainty arises from changes in cloud scattering properties and lifetimes that are caused by changes in cloud thermodynamic phase. Here we use satellite observations to infer the scattering component of the cloud-phase feedback mechanism and determine its relative importance by comparing it with an estimate of the overall temperature-driven cloud feedback. The overall feedback is dominated by an optical thinning of low-level clouds. In contrast, the scattering component of cloud-phase feedback is an order of magnitude smaller and is primarily confined to free-tropospheric clouds. The small magnitude of this feedback component is a consequence of counteracting changes in albedo from cloud optical thickening and enhanced forward scattering by cloud particles. These results indicate that shortwave cloud feedback is likely positive over the Southern Ocean and that changes in cloud scattering properties arising from phase changes make a small contribution to the overall feedback. The feedback constraints shift the projected 66% confidence range for the global equilibrium temperature response to doubling atmospheric CO2 by about +0.1 K relative to a recent consensus estimate of cloud feedback. Significance StatementUnderstanding how clouds respond to global warming is a key challenge of climate science. One particularly uncertain aspect of the cloud response involves a conversion of ice particles to liquid droplets in extratropical clouds. Here we use satellite data to infer how cloud-phase conversions affect climate by changing cloud albedo. We find that ice-to-liquid conversions increase cloud optical thickness and shift the scattering angles of cloud particles toward the forward direction. These changes in optical properties have offsetting effects on cloud albedo. This finding provides new insight about how changes in cloud phase affect climate change.

TI  - A Joint Method for Wave and Wind Field Parameter Inversion Combining SAR with Wave Spectrometer Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and wave spectrometer are common methods for observing the ocean wind field and waves on the sea surface, but both have limitations. Due to the influence of velocity bunching modulation, SAR wave observation is limited by the azimuth cut-off phenomenon. Meanwhile, SAR relies on an external wind direction source, so it is difficult for SAR to observe wind fields independently. There is no azimuthal cut-off phenomenon when the spectrometer observes the sea surface, but its azimuth resolution is much lower than SAR. Combining the above characteristics, the joint inversion of SAR and wave spectrometer for sea-state parameters becomes possible. In this paper, a joint method for wind field and wave parameter inversion combining SAR with spectrometer data is proposed. In this method for wave parameter inversion, the wave spectrum of the spectrometer was used as a first-guess spectrum of SAR wave spectrum inversion, the fit wave spectrum obtained by joint inversion and the modified wave spectrum of the spectrometer were fused to form a new spectrum, and the wave parameters were calculated. For wind field parameter inversion, wind direction was obtained using a wave spectrometer, and was used as the input of the SAR wind field inversion. Wind speed was obtained using the CMOD5.N method. Collocated data from Sentinel-1 SAR, the wave spectrometer, the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) are used to verify the proposed method. Sea parameters retrieved from the spectrometer and SAR are compared to the buoy and ECMWF data. The results show that the root mean square errors of significant wave height, mean wave period, wind direction and wind speed are 0.37 m, 1.02 s, 22.7 degrees and 1.06 m/s with ECMWF data, and 0.35 m, 0.78 s, 18.22 degrees and 0.92 m/s with buoy data, respectively. By comparing the inversion results with the L2 products of SAR and SWIM, it can be concluded that the inversion accuracy of the joint method is higher in the middle and low sea conditions. Therefore, the joint inversion method for wind field and wave parameters proposed in this paper has good results, which verifies the accuracy of the joint inversion method.

TI  - A Framework for Improving Wall-to-Wall Canopy Height Mapping by Integrating GEDI LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially continuous canopy height is a vital input for modeling forest structures and functioning. The global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) waveform can penetrate a canopy to precisely find the ground and measure canopy height, but it is spatially discontinuous over the earth's surface. A common method to achieve wall-to-wall canopy height mapping is to integrate a set of field-measured canopy heights and spectral bands from optical and/or microwave remote sensing data as ancillary information. However, due partly to the saturation of spectral reflectance to canopy height, the product of this method may misrepresent canopy height. As a result, neither GEDI footprints nor interpolated maps using the common method can accurately produce spatially continuous canopy height maps alone. To address this issue, this study proposes a framework of point-surface fusion for canopy height mapping (FPSF-CH) that uses GEDI data to calibrate the initial wall-to-wall canopy height map derived from a sub-model of FPSF-CH. The effectiveness of the proposed FPSF-CH was validated by comparison to canopy heights derived from (1) a high-resolution canopy height model derived from airborne discrete point cloud lidar across three test sites, (2) a global canopy height product (GDAL RH95), and (3) the results of the FPSF-CH sub-model without fusing with the GEDI canopy height. The results showed that the RMSE and rRMSE of FPSF-CH were 3.82, 4.05, and 3.48 m, and 18.77, 16.24, and 13.81% across the three test sites, respectively. The FPSF-CH achieved improvement over GDAL RH95, with reductions in RMSE values of 1.28, 2.25, and 2.23 m, and reductions in rRMSE values of 6.29, 9.01, and 8.90% across the three test sites, respectively. Additionally, the better performance of the FPSF-CH compared with its sub-model further confirmed the effectiveness of integrating GEDI data for calibrating wall-to-wall canopy height mapping. The proposed FPSF-CH integrates GEDI LiDAR data to provide a new avenue for accurate wall-to-wall canopy height mapping critical to applications, such as estimations of biomass, biodiversity, and carbon stocks.

TI  - Detecting Mountain Forest Dynamics in the Eastern Himalayas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest dynamics is critical to forested ecosystems, and considerable efforts have been devoted to monitoring long-term forest dynamics with the goals of sustainable management and conservation of forests. However, little attention has been given to mountain forests, which are more challenging to monitor due to complex topography, weather, and their distribution. We developed a 30-m resolution tree-canopy cover (TCC) and forest change dataset for the Eastern Himalayas from 1986 to 2021. The tree-canopy cover estimation was validated against estimates from the space-borne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), demonstrating strong consistency (R-square greater than 0.81). A comprehensive assessment for the forest change dataset was performed using 448 visually interpreted points and reported high accuracy of the dataset, i.e., 97.7% and 95.9% for forest loss and gain, respectively. Higher producer and user accuracies were reported for forest loss (PA = 78.0%, UA = 60.9%) than these for forest gain (PA = 61.7%, UA = 56.7%). The results indicated that (1) the mean tree-canopy cover in the region increased by 2.76% over the past three decades, from 40.67% in 1990 to 43.43% in 2020, suggesting the forests have improved during the period; (2) forest loss was identified for a total area of 6990 km(2) across the study area, which is less than the 10,700 km(2) identified as forest gain; (3) stronger forest gains were found at elevations greater than 3000 m asl, indicating faster forest growth in high elevations likely influenced by the warming temperatures in the Eastern Himalayas.

TI  - Ecological-Economic Assessment and Managerial Significance of Water Conservation in the Headwaters of the Yellow River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The water conservation function plays a vital role in the land-water cycle. As the "Chinese water tower", the headwaters of the Yellow River are of great significance to the safety of the Yellow River basin and even the global ecosystem. Taking the grassland ecosystem in the Yellow River source area as the research object, the InVEST water yield model with modified parameters and the ecological value evaluation of the modified equivalent factor method were used to explore the simulated spatio-temporal changes and the value of grassland water conservation from 2001 to 2020. The results show that: (1) the average total amount of water conservation in the source area is 549 x 10(8) m(3), which is 16% of the runoff in the Yellow River basin, with a growth rate of 7.5 mm/year 1 and a contribution rate of 30%; (2) the total ecological value of grassland water conservation in 2020 is USD 340.03 x 10(8). The proportion of improved grassland in ecological restoration and management is only 0.51%, while the proportion of original alpine meadow reaches 67% and its ecological function and value are irreplaceable; (3) based on the comprehensive indicators of water conservation capacity, value and importance, Qumalai, Chengduo and Maduo counties are ranked as priority areas for the ecological protection of water resources.

TI  - Retrieval of Dust Retention Distribution in Beijing Urban Green Space Based on Spectral Characteristics
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the political center of China and a super large city of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, the urbanization process of Beijing has been rapid in the past 40 years, and the pollution problems of atmospheric particles and dust particles are prominent. It is of great practical significance to play the role of green space dust retention. This paper combines hyperspectral technology and remote sensing technology to retrieve the urban scale green space dust distribution. This study selected Euonymus japonicus, a common green space vegetation in Beijing, as the research object. The dust retention capacity, spectral reflectance and leaf area of leaf samples were obtained through outdoor sampling and indoor experiments. The original spectral curve and the first derivative of reflectance before and after dust retention were compared, and the effects of different dust retention on spectral reflectance were analyzed, To explore the band which is highly sensitive to dust retention of leaves. Using the spectral response function, the narrow band spectral reflectance data collected on the ground are transformed into the wide band spectral reflectance data of remote sensing satellite. The regression model of vegetation index ratio and dust retention capacity of corresponding satellite band is established. The regression model with the best fitting effect is selected as the dust retention inversion model. Combined with the green space range extracted from the GF-2 image, the dust retention distribution of Beijing urban green space was obtained using the dust retention inversion model. The spatial autocorrelation model is used to test the spatial aggregation characteristics. The results show that; in the 740 similar to 1 870 nm band, the spectral reflectance after dust retention is significantly lower than before dust retention. Dust retention has no obvious effect on the position of the red edge, yellow edge and blue edge but has pronounced effect on the "red edge amplitude" and "red edge area". EVI index calculated by Sentinel-2 image has the highest correlation with dust retention. The coefficients of determination (R-2) of the linear and quadratic regression models are 0. 705 and 0. 751, respectively. Based on the Sentinel-2 images on April 7, 2021, and June 3, 2021, the distribution trend of green space dust retention in the Beijing urban area is as follows; the city center is higher than the suburbs, the north is higher than the south, and the East is higher than the West. The central, northern and eastern parts of Beijing are prone to dust pollution. The pollution distribution is aggregated and not completely random.

TI  - A Modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) for Assessment of Surface Soil Moisture Based on MODIS Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal dynamic monitoring of soil moisture is highly important to management of agricultural and vegetation ecosystems. The temperature-vegetation dryness index based on the triangle or trapezoid method has been used widely in previous studies. However, most existing studies simply used linear regression to construct empirical models to fit the edges of the feature space. This requires extensive data from a vast study area, and may lead to subjective results. In this study, a Modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) was used to monitor surface soil moisture status using MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing data, in which the dry edge conditions were determined at the pixel scale based on surface energy balance. The MTVDI was validated by field measurements at 30 sites for 10 d and compared with the Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI). The results showed that the R-2 for MTVDI and soil moisture obviously improved (0.45 for TVDI, 0.69 for MTVDI). As for spatial changes, MTVDI can also better reflect the actual soil moisture condition than TVDI. As a result, MTVDI can be considered an effective method to monitor the spatio-temporal changes in surface soil moisture on a regional scale.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Structure Analysis and Droplet Spectrum Characteristics of Southwest Vortex Precipitation System Based on GPM-DPR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the first in the region to use Global Precipitation Mission Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM-DPR) and Fengyun-2G (FY-2G) observations to qualitatively and quantitatively study the Southwest Vortex evolution characteristics during the flood season from 2019 to 2021. Furthermore, vertical characteristics of the two main precipitation types in the Southwest Vortex, stratiform and convective, were statistically analyzed at different life stages, including horizontal and vertical distribution of precipitation particles, droplet spectrum characteristics, and vertically layered precipitation contribution. The results showed that: (1) The typical convective precipitation (CP) in the developing and mature stages has strong reflectivity distribution centers in the upper and lower layers, showing characteristics related to terrain. Additionally, the high-level hydrometeor particles are mainly solid precipitation particles, and particles in the lower layers collide and coalesce in the violent vertical motion of the airflow. (2) For the three stages of CP, the reflectivity below melting layer (ML) first showed a rapid weakening trend toward the surface and then remained unchanged, significantly changing its vertical structure. The main rainfall type of the Southwest Vortex system was stratiform precipitation (SP) in the three stages. (3) In the two types of cloud precipitation, the developing stage is generally composed of large and sparse precipitation particles, the mature stage of large and dense precipitation particles, and the dissipating stage of small and sparse precipitation particles. The findings of this study reveal the three-dimensional refined structure and vertical variation characteristics of different life stages of the Southwest Vortex precipitation cloud system and provide important tools and references for improving the accuracy of numerical models and the forecast level of short-term heavy precipitation under complex terrain.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Monitoring Method Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Applied to the Case of the Temi Landslide
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging to monitor landslides due to their heavy concealment and the extreme destructiveness during the long development of landslides. Many landslide monitoring tools are somewhat onefold. In this paper, a comprehensive landslide monitoring method involving multiple factors from time-series multi-data sources is proposed. We focus on the changes in three aspects consisting of the vegetation condition, the surface deformation information and the landslide susceptibility. Firstly, the fractional vegetation cover of the landslide is extracted from optical remote sensing Gaofen-1 (GF-1) images using the dimidiate pixel model. Next, the surface deformation information of the landslide is derived from SAR remote sensing Sentinel-1A images applying the SBAS-InSAR method. Then, the landslide susceptibility based on GF-1, Sentinel-1A images and DEM data is computed using the analytic hierarchy process method. Finally, the spatio-temporal correlations of the vegetation condition, the surface deformation information and the landslide susceptibility are compared and interpreted. The Temi landslide is located along the Jinsha River and poses a high risk of blocking the river. Taking the Temi landslide as the study area, it is indicated from the results that the fractional vegetation cover, surface deformation information and landslide susceptibility reveal a consistency in the patterns of changes in spatial and temporal terms. As the surface deformation information improves, the status of the landslide vegetation also deteriorates and the landslide susceptibility becomes high, which indicates an increased probability of the creep and even the occurrence of landslides. In contrast, when the surface deformation information drops, the vegetation condition of the landslide becomes superior and the landslide becomes less susceptible, which means the likelihood of sliding declines. This study provides a new idea for a landslide monitoring method and potential way for natural disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Disentangling Soil, Shade, and Tree Canopy Contributions to Mixed Satellite Vegetation Indices in a Sparse Dry Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) for vegetation monitoring can involve mixed pixels with contributions from vegetation and background surfaces, causing biases in signals and their interpretations, especially in low-density forests. In a case study in the semi-arid Yatir forest in Israel, we observed a mismatch between satellite (Landsat 8 surface product) and tower-based (Skye sensor) multispectral data and contrasting seasonal cycles in near-infrared (NIR) reflectance. We tested the hypothesis that this mismatch was due to the different fractional contributions of the various surface components and their unique reflectance. Employing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), we obtained high-resolution multispectral images over selected forest plots and estimated the fraction, reflectance, and seasonal cycle of the three main surface components (canopy, shade, and sunlit soil). We determined that the Landsat 8 data were dominated by soil signals (70%), while the tower-based data were dominated by canopy signals (95%). We then developed a procedure to resolve the canopy (i.e., tree foliage) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the mixed satellite data. The retrieved and corrected canopy-only data resolved the original mismatch and indicated that the spatial variations in Landsat 8 NDVI were due to differences in stand density, while the canopy-only NDVI was spatially uniform, providing confidence in the local flux tower measurements.

TI  - Rising temperature threatens China's cropland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising demand for calories and protein together with urbanization, pose significant challenges to China's food security. The determination of policy actions requires accurate estimates of climatic impacts on both crop yields (intensive margin) and cropland area (extensive margin). However, the analysis of the latter has been limited, especially in developing countries. Here, we assess the impact of temperature on land use in China by matching high-resolution satellite data on land use with daily weather data from 1980 to 2010. We find that extremely hot weather (daily average temperature above 30 degrees C) has a long-lasting effect on reducing cropland in China. Combining climate projections from 39 downscaled climate models, we predict that climate change is likely to reduce China's cropland area by 2.09%-25.51% under IPCC's slowest and fastest-warming scenarios by the end of this century. In addition, we find that non-irrigated land is more susceptible to rising temperatures in the short term; however, irrigated land is subject to a similar impact in the long term. This result suggests that the adaptive effect of irrigation could be limited under persistent rising in temperature.

TI  - Traditional beliefs, culture, and local biodiversity protection: An ethnographic study in the Shaluli Mountains Region, Sichuan Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Located on the southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Shaluli Mountains Region (SMR) is an important conservation priority area in Southwest China's highly biodiverse Hengduan Mountains. The SMR's ecology is complex and topographically diverse, with unique composition of abundant flora and fauna. Historically and currently a majority-Tibetan region, Tibetan Buddhism has significantly affected most local people's views on the natural environment. According to Tibetan religious theories and doctrines, the Shaluli Tibetans traditionally abstain from killing wild animals, believe in reincarnation (e.g., karmic cause and effect), the equality of all living beings, and the belief that everything has spirits. To understand how these beliefs and practices influenced the SMR's ecology and biodiversity, and how modernization pressures affect them, we conducted a three-year ethnobiological field investigation in seven SMR counties and a neighboring city. The traditional worldview in this relatively remote region has profoundly shaped the lifestyles, customs, and behavioral norms of the local religiously-observant Tibetans. These beliefs have influenced their perspective on the natural world, having an overall positive role in the long-term protection of the local ecological environment and biodiversity. As the surrounding regions have experienced increasing development and modernization pressures that threaten this biodiversity hotspot, Shaluli's Tibetan Buddhist temples and monks have assumed an active role promoting environmental protection, forest resource stewardship, and wildlife conservation. However, we found that modernization pressures and changing socio-economic conditions have negatively influenced these traditions, resulting in greater likelihood of biological invasions and pollution of the local soil and water sources.

TI  - Losses of Tree Cover in California Driven by Increasing Fire Disturbance and Climate Stress
T2  - AGU ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests provide natural climate solutions for sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change, yet are increasingly threatened by increasing temperature and disturbance. Understanding these threats requires accurate information on vegetation dynamics and their drivers, which is currently lacking in many regions experiencing rapid climate change such as California. To address this, we combined remote sensing observations with geospatial databases to develop annual maps of vegetation cover (tree, shrub, and herbaceous) and disturbance type (fire, harvest, and forest die-off) in California at 30 m resolution from 1985 to 2021. Considering both changes in cover fraction and areal extent, California lost 4,566 km(2) of its tree cover area (6.7% relative to initial cover) since 1985. Substantial gains in tree cover area during the 1990s were more than offset by fire-driven declines since 2000, resulting in greater shrub and herbaceous cover area. Tree cover loss occurred in all ecoregions but was most severe in the southern mountains, where losses from wildfire were not compensated by regrowth in undisturbed areas. Fires and tree cover area loss generally occurred where summer temperatures were greater than 17.5 degrees C, whereas net tree cover gain often occurred in cooler areas, suggesting that ongoing climate warming is threatening forests in many areas. California's vegetation is undergoing rapid transformation, with disturbance rates and climate change posing substantial potential risks to the integrity of California's terrestrial carbon sink.

TI  - Land Cover Changing Pattern in Pre- and Post-Earthquake Affected Area from Remote Sensing Data: A Case of Lushan County, Sichuan Province
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Extremely hard-hit areas face frequent secondary geological hazards and difficulties in vegetation recovery, and subsequent effects have a significant impact on land cover changes. At present, there is a lack of research on the dynamic restoration of, and changes in, the ecological environment before and after an earthquake, and especially a lack of quantitative assessment of the impact of earthquakes on land cover at the microscopic scale of spatial distribution of landscape indices. Taking the Lushan earthquake in Sichuan Province as an example, this paper obtained land cover data from the study area between 2012 and 2020, and analyzes the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of land cover change frequency by using a comprehensive land cover degree index, land cover transfer matrix and landscape ecology index. The results show that the types of cropland, forest, built-up and bare land have changed significantly in the study area. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive land cover index of the study area showed an increasing trend, and land cover has been continuously improved under the effect of artificial measures and natural restoration. After 2013, patch density (PD) and landscape shape index (LSI) values decreased and aggregation index (AI) values increased for the vast majority of landscape land classes, indicating a benign ecological development across the region in the post-earthquake period. The research results are not only helpful to establish scientific ecological environmental management in the earthquake-stricken areas, but also helpful to formulate medium- and long-term ecological environmental monitoring and ecological restoration plans based on land cover change patterns.

TI  - Dual-Coupled CNN-GCN-Based Classification for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning techniques have brought substantial performance gains to remote sensing image classification. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can extract rich spatial and spectral features from hyperspectral images in a short-range region, whereas graph convolutional networks (GCN) can model middle- and long-range spatial relations (or structural features) between samples on their graph structure. These different features make it possible to classify remote sensing images finely. In addition, hyperspectral images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images can provide spatial-spectral information and elevation information of targets on the Earth's surface, respectively. These multi-source remote sensing data can further improve classification accuracy in complex scenes. This paper proposes a classification method for HS and LiDAR data based on a dual-coupled CNN-GCN structure. The model can be divided into a coupled CNN and a coupled GCN. The former employs a weight-sharing mechanism to structurally fuse and simplify the dual CNN models and extracting the spatial features from HS and LiDAR data. The latter first concatenates the HS and LiDAR data to construct a uniform graph structure. Then, the dual GCN models perform structural fusion by sharing the graph structures and weight matrices of some layers to extract their structural information, respectively. Finally, the final hybrid features are fed into a standard classifier for the pixel-level classification task under a unified feature fusion module. Extensive experiments on two real-world hyperspectral and LiDAR data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art baseline methods, such as two-branch CNN and context CNN. In particular, the overall accuracy (99.11%) on Trento achieves the best classification performance reported so far.

TI  - Object-Based Automatic Mapping of Winter Wheat Based on Temporal Phenology Patterns Derived from Multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although winter wheat has been mapped by remote sensing in several studies, such mapping efforts did not sufficiently utilize contextual information to reduce the noise and still depended heavily on optical imagery and exhausting classification approaches. Furthermore, the influence of similarity measures on winter wheat identification remains unclear. To overcome these limitations, this study developed an object-based automatic approach to map winter wheat using multitemporal Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. First, after S1 and S2 images were preprocessed, the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm was used to conduct image segmentation to obtain homogeneous spatial objects with a fusion of S1 and S2 bands. Second, the temporal phenology patterns (TPP) of winter wheat and other typical land covers were derived from object-level S1 and S2 imagery based on the collected ground truth samples, and two improved distance measures (i.e., a composite of Euclidean distance and Spectral Angle Distance, (ESD) and the difference-similarity factor distance (DSF)) were built to evaluate the similarity between two TPPs. Third, winter wheat objects were automatically identified from the segmented spatial objects by the maximum between-class variance method (OTSU) with distance measures based on the unique TPP of winter wheat. According to ground truth data, the DSF measure was superior to other distance measures in winter wheat mapping, since it achieved the best overall accuracy (OA), best kappa coefficient (Kappa) and more spatial details for each feasible band (i.e., NDVI, VV, and VH/VV), or it obtained results comparable to those for the best one (e.g., NDVI + VV). The resultant winter wheat maps derived from the NDVI band with the DSF measure achieved the best accuracy and more details, and had an average OA and Kappa of 92% and 84%, respectively. The VV polarization with the DSF measure produced the second best winter wheat maps with an average OA and Kappa of 91% and 80%, respectively. The results indicate the great potential of the proposed object-based approach for automatic winter wheat mapping for both optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery.

TI  - Assessment of GF3 Full-Polarimetric SAR Data for Dryland Crop Classification with Different Polarimetric Decomposition Methods
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification is one of the most important agricultural applications of remote sensing. Many studies have investigated crop classification using SAR data, while few studies have focused on the classification of dryland crops by the new Gaofen-3 (GF3) SAR data. In this paper, taking Hengshui city as the study area, the performance of the Freeman-Durden, Sato4, Singh4 and multi-component decomposition methods for dryland crop type classification applications are evaluated, and the potential of full-polarimetric GF3 data in dryland crop type classification are also investigated. The results show that the multi-component decomposition method produces the most accurate overall classifications (88.37%). Compared with the typical polarization decomposition techniques, the accuracy of the classification results using the new decomposition method is improved. In addition, the Freeman method generally yields the third-most accurate results, and the Sato4 (87.40%) and Singh4 (87.34%) methods yield secondary results. The overall classification accuracy of the GF3 data is very positive. These results demonstrate the great promising potential of GF3 SAR data for dryland crop monitoring applications.

TI  - How Good Are Global Layers for Mapping Rural Settlements? Evidence from China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Global urbanization has brought about a significant transition to rural areas. With the development of remote sensing technologies, land use/land cover (LULC) datasets allow users to analyze the changes in global rural settlements. However, few studies have examined the performances of the LULC datasets in mapping rural settlements. Taking China as the study area, this research selected eight of the latest LULC datasets (ESRI Land Cover, WSF, ESA WorldCover, GHS-BUILT-S2, GISD30, GISA2.0, GLC30, and GAIA) to compare their accuracy for rural settlement detection. Spatial stratified sampling was used for collecting and sampling rural settlements. We conducted omission tests, area comparison, and pixel-based accuracy tests for comparison. The results show that: (1) the performances of the 10 m resolution datasets are better than those of the 30 m resolution datasets in almost all scenarios. (2) the mapping of villages in Western China is a challenge for all datasets. (3) GHS-BUILT-S2 performs the best in almost every scenario, and can allow users to adjust the threshold value for determining a proper range of rural settlement size; ESRI outperforms any other dataset in detecting the existence of rural settlements, but it dramatically overestimates the area of rural settlements. (4) GISD30 is the best among the 30 m resolution datasets, notably in the Pearl River Delta. Finally, we provide useful suggestions on ideal map selection in various regions and scenarios.

TI  - Landscape Impacts on Ecosystem Service Values Using the Image Fusion Approach
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape is a complex mosaic of physical and biological patches with infrastructures, cultivable lands, protected ecosystems, water bodies, and many other landforms. Varying land-use changes are vulnerable to the world and need the mitigation and management of landforms to achieve sustainable development, which without proper oversight, may lead to habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. In this study, we quantify the land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes using downscaled satellite imagery and assess their effects on ecosystem services (ES) and economic values in Ningxia Province, China. Various landscape metrics are derived to study the pattern and spatial configuration over 15 years (2005-2020), in which the landscapes are evolving. The impact of LULC change in various ES is analyzed using ecosystem service values (ESV) and validated with a sensitivity index. Finally, the level of urban sprawl (US) due to overpopulation is established using Renyi's entropy. Using Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) datasets, we downscaled the MODIS data of 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 to prepare the LULC map through a rotation forest algorithm. Results demonstrate that water bodies, woodlands, and built-up landscapes increased in their spatial distribution over time and that there was a decrease in farmlands. Results further suggest that the connectivity and uniformity of the landscape pattern improved in the later period due to several plans formulated by the government with a slight improvement in landscape diversity. Overall ESV get improved, while LULC classes such as farmland and water bodies have decreased and increased ESV, respectively, and a sensitivity analysis is used to test the reliability of ESV on LULC classes. The level of US is 0.91 in terms of Renyi's entropy, which reveals the presence of a dispersion of settlements in urban fringes. The simulated US for 2025 shows urbanization is more severe over a prolonged time and finally the impacts of the US in ESV are analyzed. Using an interdisciplinary approach, several recommendations are formulated to maintain the ESV despite rapid LULC changes and to achieve sustainable development globally.

TI  - Surface Soil Moisture Inversion and Distribution Based on Spatio-Temporal Fusion of MODIS and Landsat
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays an important role in hydrology, climate, agriculture, and ecology, and remote sensing is one of the most important tools for estimating the soil moisture over large areas. Soil moisture, which is calculated by remote sensing inversion, is affected by the uneven distribution of vegetation and therefore the results cannot accurately reflect the spatial distribution of the soil moisture in the study area. This study analyzes the soil moisture of different vegetation covers in the Wushen Banner of Inner Mongolia, recorded in 2016, and using Landsat and MODIS images fused with multispectral bands. Firstly, we compared and analyzed the ability of the visible optical and short-wave infrared drought index (VSDI), the normalized differential infrared index (NDII), and the short-wave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) in monitoring the soil moisture in different vegetation cover soils. Secondly, we used the stepwise multiple regression analysis method in order to correlate the multispectral fusion bands with the field-measured soil water content and established a soil moisture inversion model based on the multispectral fusion bands. As the results show, there was a strong correlation between the established model and the measured soil water content of the different vegetation cover soils: in the bare soil, R2 was 0.86; in the partially vegetated cover soil, R2 was 0.84; and in the highly vegetated cover soil, R2 was 0.87. This shows that the established model could better reflect the actual condition of the surface soil moisture in the different vegetation covers.

TI  - Subsidence Monitoring and Mechanism Analysis of Anju Airport in Suining Based on InSAR and Numerical Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous area of southwest China is characterized by significant topography and complex geological conditions, which pose great challenges to the airport's site selection, construction, and safe operation. Suining Anju Airport, one of the key projects under construction in southwest China, is essential in alleviating and dredging the air passenger flow in Sichuan Province. Because the overlying quaternary strata's physical and mechanical properties, thickness, and distribution range are fairly different in the longitudinal and transverse directions, the Anju Airport's foundation in the hilly area has typical inhomogeneity. Large-scale excavation and filling pose a challenge to the ground stability of the airport. To comprehensively monitor Anju Airport's uneven ground subsidence during the construction period, this paper selected SAR image data collected by the Sentinel-1A satellite from May 2018 to June 2021 to extract time-series ground subsidence measurements based on the SBAS-InSAR method. Furthermore, based on the simulation of roadbed filling in the airport's parallel slide fill area, the dynamic evolution analysis of soil stress field and internal subsidence caused by roadbed filling activities was carried out to further reveal the occurrence mechanism of ground subsidence. The monitoring results show that the subsidence centers of Anju Airport are mainly distributed in the filling areas, and the average annual subsidence is -20 similar to-75 mm/yr from May 2018 to June 2021. Comparative analysis with in situ data indicates that the RMSE of InSAR monitoring results was +/- 6.12 mm. The numerical simulation shows that the subsidence of the airport parallel slide is mainly caused by a load of subgrade filling body and the compression of its weight. The results of this study can provide reference methodology and data support for the construction and future safe operation of Suining Anju Airport.

TI  - Response of vegetation productivity to drought in the Qinling.Daba Mountains, China from 2001 to 2020
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - To quantitatively evaluate the effects of drought on vegetation productivity in the Qinling-Daba Mountains, we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of gross primary productivity (GPP) and drought, identified the fluctuation of negative GPP extremes under different vegetation types, and quantified the drought vul-nerability and drought risk of GPP from 2001 to 2020 with MODIS GPP products and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The results showed that the annual GPP from 2001 to 2020 had an increasing trend in 98.0% of areas in the Qinling-Daba Mountains. The GPP of all vegetation types except wetlands increased significantly. SPEI decreased in 23.8% of area in the Qinling-Daba Mountains from 2001 to 2020. The number of negative GPP extremes had no significant trend, but abnormal GPP fluctuations had intensified, especially in the cultivated land. After 2011, the proportion of concurrent negative GPP extreme and drought had decreased for all vegetation types, but the spatial and temporal range of drought in these negative GPP extremes showed an expanding trend. Compared with the pattern during 2001-2010, the proportion of area with positive drought vulnerability and drought risk increased by 104.1% and 6.7% after 2011, indicating that the area with drought. induced GPP decline had expanded. Among all the vegetation types, drought caused the largest decrease of GPP in wetlands. The results revealed that drought led to an aggravation of GPP fluctuations and increased frequency of GPP extremes in the Qinling-Daba Mountains from 2001 to 2020, which resulted in GPP decline with different magnitudes in most vegetation types.

TI  - Can Machine Learning Algorithms Successfully Predict Grassland Aboveground Biomass?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate estimation of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is important. Machine learning (ML) has been widely used in the past few decades to deal with complex relationships. In this study, based on an 11-year period (2005-2015) of AGB data (1620 valid AGB measurements) on the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), combined with remote sensing data, weather data, terrain data, and soil data, we compared the predictive performance of a linear statistical method, machine learning (ML) methods, and evaluated their temporal and spatial scalability. The results show that machine learning can predict grassland biomass well, and the existence of an independent validation set can help us better understand the prediction performance of the model. Our findings show the following: (1) The random forest (RF) based on variables obtained through stepwise regression analysis (SRA) was the best model (R-vad(2) = 0.60, RMSEvad = 1245.85 kg DW (dry matter weight)/ha, AIC = 5583.51, and BIC = 5631.10). It also had the best predictive capability of years with unknown areas (R-indep(2) = 0.50, RMSEindep = 1332.59 kg DW/ha). (2) Variable screening improved the accuracy of all of the models. (3) All models' predictive accuracy varied between 0.45 and 0.60, and the RMSE values were lower than 1457.26 kg DW/ha, indicating that the results were reliably accurate.

TI  - A Strategy for Variable-Scale InSAR Deformation Monitoring in a Wide Area: A Case Study in the Turpan-Hami Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, increasing available synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data and gradually developing interferometric SAR (InSAR) technology have provided the possibility for wide-scale ground-deformation monitoring using InSAR. Traditionally, the InSAR data are processed by the existing time-series InSAR (TS-InSAR) technology, which has inefficient calculation and redundant results. In this study, we propose a wide-area InSAR variable-scale deformation detection strategy (hereafter referred to as the WAVS-InSAR strategy). The strategy combines stacking technology for fast ground-deformation rate calculation and advanced TS-InSAR technology for obtaining fine deformation time series. It adopts an adaptive recognition algorithm to identify the spatial distribution and area of deformation regions (regions of interest, ROI) in the wide study area and uses a novel wide-area deformation product organization structure to generate variable-scale deformation products. The Turpan-Hami basin in western China is selected as the wide study area (277,000 km(2)) to verify the proposed WAVS-InSAR strategy. The results are as follows: (1) There are 32 deformation regions with an area of >= 1 km(2) and a deformation magnitude of greater than +/- 2 cm/year in the Turpan-Hami basin. The deformation area accounts for 2.4 parts per thousand of the total monitoring area. (2) A large area of ground subsidence has occurred in the farmland areas of the ROI, which is caused by groundwater overexploitation. The popularization and application of facility agriculture in the ROI have increased the demand for irrigation water. Due to the influence of the tectonic fault, the water supply of the ROI is mainly dependent on groundwater. Huge water demand has led to a continuous net deficit in aquifers, leading to land subsidence. The WAVS-InSAR strategy will be helpful for InSAR deformation monitoring at a national/regional scale and promoting the engineering application of InSAR technology.

TI  - Deep Learning Augmented Data Assimilation: Reconstructing Missing Information with Convolutional Autoencoders
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data play a critical role in improving numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, the physical principles of radiation dictate that data voids frequently exist in physical space (e.g., subcloud area for satellite infrared radiance or no-precipitation region for radar reflectivity). Such data gaps impair the accuracy of initial conditions derived from data assimilation (DA), which has a negative impact on NWP. We use the barotropic vorticity equation to demonstrate the potential of deep learning augmented data assimilation (DDA), which involves reconstructing spatially complete pseudo-observation fields from incomplete observations and using them for DA. By training a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) with a long simulation at a coarse "forecast" resolution (T63), we obtained a deep learning approximation of the "reconstruction operator," which maps spatially incomplete observations to a model state with full spatial coverage and resolution. The CAE was applied to an incomplete streamfunction observation (similar to 30% missing) from a high-resolution benchmark simulation and demonstrated satisfactory reconstruction performance, even when only very sparse (1/16 of T63 grid density) observations were used as input. When only spatially incomplete observations are used, the analysis fields obtained from ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) assimilation exhibit significant error. However, in DDA, when EnSRF takes in the combined data from the incomplete observations and CAE reconstruction, analysis error reduces significantly. Such gains are more pronounced with sparse observation and small ensemble size because the DDA analysis is much less sensitive to observation density and ensemble size than the conventional DA analysis, which is based solely on incomplete observations. Significance StatementData assimilation plays a critical role in improving the skills of modern numerical weather prediction by establishing accurate initial conditions. However, unobservable regions are common in observation data, particularly those derived from remote sensing. The nonlinear relationship between data from observable regions and the physical state of unobservable regions may impede DA efficiency. As a result, we propose that deep learning be used to improve data assimilation in such cases by reconstructing a spatially complete first guess of the physical state with deep learning and then applying data assimilation to the reconstructed field. Such deep learning augmentation is found effective in improving the accuracy of data assimilation, especially for sparse observation and small ensemble size.

TI  - A Systematic Classification Method for Grassland Community Division Using China's ZY1-02D Hyperspectral Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main feature of grassland degradation is the change in the vegetation community structure. Hyperspectral-based grassland community identification is the basis and a prerequisite for large-area high-precision grassland degradation monitoring and management. To obtain the distribution pattern of grassland communities in Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, we propose a systematic classification method (SCM) for hyperspectral grassland community identification using China's ZiYuan 1-02D (ZY1-02D) satellite. First, the sample label data were selected from the field-collected samples, vegetation map data, and function zoning data for the Nature Reserve. Second, the spatial features of the images were extracted using extended morphological profiles (EMPs) based on the reduced dimensionality of principal component analysis (PCA). Then, they were input into the random forest (RF) classifier to obtain the preclassification results for grassland communities. Finally, to reduce the influence of salt-and-pepper noise, the label similarity probability filter (LSPF) method was used for postclassification processing, and the RF was again used to obtain the final classification results. The results showed that, compared with the other seven (e.g., SVM, RF, 3D-CNN) methods, the SCM obtained the optimal classification results with an overall classification accuracy (OCA) of 94.56%. In addition, the mapping results of the SCM showed its ability to accurately identify various ground objects in large-scale grassland community scenes.

TI  - Classification of Alpine Grasslands in Cold and High Altitudes Based on Multispectral Landsat-8 Images: A Case Study in Sanjiangyuan National Park, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use-cover change (LUCC)/vegetation cover plays a critical role in Earth system science and is a reflection of human activities and environmental changes. LUCC will affect the structure and function of ecosystems and a series of other terrestrial surface processes, such as energy exchange, water circulation, biogeochemical circulation, and vegetation productivity. Therefore, accurate LUCC mapping and vegetation cover monitoring are the bases for simulating the global carbon and hydrological cycles, studying the interactions of the land surface and climate, and assessing land degradation. Based on field GPS surveys and UAV data, with cloud-free and snow/glacier algorithms and the SVM classifier to train and model alpine grassland, the alpine grassland and LUCC were extracted by using Landsat-8 OLI satellite images in Sanjiangyuan National Park in this paper. The latest datasets of vegetation types with 30 m x 30 m spatial resolution in the three parks were prepared and formed. The classification results show that the SVM classifier could better distinguish the major land-use types, and the overall classification accuracy was very high. However, in the alpine grassland subcategories, the classification accuracies of the four typical grasslands were relatively low, especially between desert steppes and alpine meadows, and desert steppes and alpine steppes. It manifests the limitations of Landsat-8 multispectral remote sensing imageries in finer-resolution grassland classifications of high-altitude alpine mountains. The method can be utilized for other multispectral satellite imageries with the same band matching, such as Landsat 7, Landsat 9, Sentinel-2, etc. The method described in this paper can rapidly and efficiently process annual alpine grassland maps of the source areas of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Lancang River. It can provide timely and high-spatial-resolution datasets for supporting scientific decisions for the sustainable management of Sanjiangyuan National Park.

TI  - A spatial and temporal assessment of nonresponse in the national forest inventory of the U.S
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In nearly all national forest inventories (NFI), some sample plots are unable to be measured such that nonresponse may be an issue of concern. Thus, it is of particular interest to understand the phenomenon in terms of current status and temporal change in nonresponse rates and the associated spatial distribution on the landscape. In the NFI of the USA, denial of access permission on privately owned forest land and hazardous conditions has led to an overall nonresponse rate of 9.8% with some areas exceeding 20% of plots being inaccessible. Further, it was found that nearly 50% of the areas studied were exhibiting increasing rates of nonresponse over time. Comparisons between response and nonresponse plots via remote sensing characteristics suggested there may be systematic differences in some parts of the country, which may cause bias in the sample and resulting estimates. The findings indicate that improved communication strategies with private landowners are needed to reduce nonresponse rates. Due to the unlikelihood of eliminating nonresponse entirely, methods to mitigate potential nonresponse bias should be considered for incorporation into the estimation of population parameters.

TI  - Multitemporal seagrass carbon assimilation and aboveground carbon stock mapping using Sentinel-2 in Labuan Bajo 2019-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass is considered one of the most effective and efficient natural carbon sinks. In order to fully understand how it can help to adapt and mitigate climate change, information on the variability of the extent of its area, carbon stock, assimilation, sequestration, and potential emission is critical. However, details on spatially and temporally explicit seagrass biomass carbon stock, assimilation and sequestration are lacking in many parts of the world, including Indonesia as the seagrass biodiversity hot spot. To address this issue, this research aims to develop a remote sensing model to map aboveground seagrass carbon stock (AGC) and seagrass carbon assimilation rates (CA) based on multitemporal Sentinel-2 image analysis that can be used to assess the variability of seagrass over times and assess the potential carbon loss and emission reduction by seagrass. Sentinel-2 images with ideal conditions (cloud, haze, sunglint-free) and less ideal ones (cloud and haze-free, but with sunglint) were both used as the basis to develop the model. The research used two regression models, the random forest (RF) regression and stepwise regression (SW), and four input types, i.e., the reflectance bands, deglint bands, Principal Component (PC) bands, and co-occurrence texture bands. Field AGC and CA data estimated from percent cover were used to train and assess the accuracy of each model. Cross-validation was also performed to determine the model consistency when applied to images with different conditions. The results showed that the SW regression model using reflectance and deglint bands produced the most accurate and consistent AGC and CA maps. Applied to a 24-month Sentinel-2 image, from 2019 until 2020, the model showed a consistent pattern where the AGC and CA were lower from September to February and higher in March to August for both 2019 and 2020. Based on the twoyear seagrass AGC and CA maps, the monthly average AGCs for 2019 and 2020 were estimated at 28.4 +/- 2.7 and 28.4 +/- 1.3 g C/m2, respectively, while the monthly average CAs were 6.7 +/- 1.4 and 6.6 +/- 0.7 Mg C/ha/year. The total AGCs in 2019 and 2020 were 113.8 +/- 10.9 and 113.9 +/- 5.2 Mg C, and the total CAs were 2648.3 +/- 623.4 and 2636.9 +/- 281.4 Mg C/year. All these values were from 400.71 ha of seagrass meadows. Finally, the availability of such remote sensing models helps to solve the time and cost-effectiveness challenges in acquiring spatially and temporally extensive seagrass AGC and CA information. Moreover, the research was able to produce the first map of multitemporal seagrass AGC and CA in specific seagrass meadow environments in Indonesia, which can be further improved to map these data rapidly at the national level and will

TI  - Serum miRNA-204-5p as a potential non-invasive biomarker for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer with sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lymph node status is one of the most critical prognostic factors used in determining adjuvant treatment in endometrial cancer (EC). Lymphadenectomy is associated significant surgical and postoperative risks. The use of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) has emerged as an alternative method to complete lymphadenectomy in EC. However, there remains controversy surrounding the use of SLNM in high-risk disease and its false-negative rate (3%). The authors previously identified miR-204-5p as a tumor-suppressor miRNA associated with lymph node metastasis in EC tissues. The present study demonstrated that serum miR-204-5p in patients with EC has the potential for use as an early diagnostic biomarker combined with SLNM to assess the lymph node status prior to surgery. The present study also aimed to identify the optimal cut-off value of serum miR-204-5p. The relative expression levels of miR-204-5p were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR in the serum of 52 patients with EC (total SLNM). A total of 20 patients diagnosed with ovarian cysts, 20 patients diagnosed with myoma, and 20 participants diagnosed with endometrial polyps or endometrial hyperplasia were included as the control group. miR-204-5p expression was also detected in lymph node tissues using in situ hybridization. The results revealed that serum miR-204-5p expression was downregulated in patients with EC compared with its expression in patients with benign ovarian cysts, myoma and endometrial hyperplasia/polyps (P<0.01). In accordance with the final pathological evaluation, patients with EC with a positive SLN status had a significantly lower level of miR-204-5p compared with those with a negative SLN status (P<0.01). The area under the ROC curve of miR-204-5p was 0.923, 95% CI (0.847-1.000), and the diagnostic value had a sensitivity of 87.2% and specificity of 80.0%, with an optimal cut-off value of 0.253. On the whole, it was demonstrated that a lower miR-204-5p expression is associated with lymph node metastasis in these SLN(+) EC tissues, indicating that the downregulation of serum miR-204-5p in patients with EC has potential for use as an early diagnostic biomarker combined with SLNM. In addition, with a cut-off value of 0.253, it appeared optimal for the prediction of lymph node metastasis in EC.

TI  - Deformation Monitoring of Tailings Reservoir Based on Polarimetric Time Series InSAR: Example of Kafang Tailings Reservoir, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Safe operation of tailings reservoirs is essential to protect downstream life and property, but current monitoring methods are inadequate in scale and refinement, and most reservoirs are built in low coherence areas far from cities. Use of polarization data to monitor deformation may improve area coherence and thus point selection density. With the example of the Kafang tailings reservoir and dual-polarization Sentinel-1 data from 9 August 2020 to 24 May 2021, homogeneous points of different polarization channels were identified with the hypothesis test of the confidence interval method. Results were fused, and BEST, sub-optimum scattering mechanism (SOM), and equal scattering mechanism (ESM) methods were used to optimize phase quality of persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) pixels and obtain more detailed deformation information on the area with time series processing. The fusion of homogeneous point sets obtained from different polarization intensity data increased the number of homogeneous points, which was 3.86% and 8.45% higher than that of VH and VV polarization images, respectively. The three polarization optimization methods improved point selection density. Compared with the VV polarization image, the high coherence point density increased by 1.83 (BEST), 3.66 (SOM), and 5.76 (ESM) times, whereas it increased by 1.17 (BEST), 1.84 (SOM), and 2.04 (ESM) times in the tailings reservoir. The consistency and reliability of different methods were good. By comparing the monitoring results of the three methods using polarization data, the hypothesis test of the confidence interval (HTCI) algorithm, and the polarization optimization method will effectively increase the point selection number of the study area, and the ESM method can show the deformation of tailings area more comprehensively. Monitoring indicated deformation of the tailings reservoir tended to diffuse outward from the area with the largest deformation and was relatively stable.

TI  - Identifying Coastal Wetlands Changes Using a High-Resolution Optical Images Feature Hierarchical Selection Method
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are dynamic and fragile ecosystems where complex changes have taken place. As they are affected by environmental changes and human activities, it is of great practical significance to monitor coastal wetlands changes regularly. High-resolution optical data can observe changes in coastal wetlands, however, the impact of different optical features on the identification of changes in coastal wetlands is not clear. Simultaneously, the combination of many features could cause the "dimension disaster" problem. In addition, only small amounts of training samples are accessible at pre- or post-changed time. In order to solve the above problems, the feature hierarchical selection method is proposed, taking into account the jumping degree of different image features. The influence of different optical features on wetland classification was analyzed. In addition, a training samples transfer learning strategy was designed for wetland classification, and the classification result at pre- and post-changed times were compared to identify the "from-to" coastal wetlands changes. The southeastern coastal wetlands located in Jiangsu Province were used as a study area, and ZY-3 images in 2013 and 2018 were used to verify the proposed methods. The results show that the feature hierarchical selection method can provide a quantitative reference for optimal subset feature selection. A training samples transfer learning strategy was used to classify post-changed optical data, the overall accuracy of transferred training samples was 91.16%, and it ensures the accuracy requirements for change identification. In the study area, the salt marsh increased mainly from the sea area, because salt marshes expand rapidly throughout coastal areas, and aquaculture ponds increased from the sea area and salt marshes, because of the considerable economic benefits of the aquacultural industry.

TI  - Investigation of Potential of GNSS-R Polarization: Theoretical Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reflectometry (GNSS-R) developed into a promising remote sensing technique. However, few previous related studies considered the potential of its polarization. Owing to lack of sufficient in situ measurement data to support comprehensive investigation of GNSS-R polarization, this study used theoretical models and reference to our previous work to explore this topic. The commonly used microwave scattering models are employed to get the bare soil or vegetation scattering properties of GNSS-R configurations, i.e., the random surface scattering model and the first-order radiative transfer equation were improved and then employed to obtain the scattering properties of both bare soil and vegetation. Since the final output of the space-borne GNSS-R missions is a delay Doppler map (DDM), a spaceborne (DDM) simulator, oriented for the Chinese FengYun-3E (FY-3E) GNSS-R payload, was utilized to obtain the final output at different polarizations. Using the developed models (such as the bare soil and vegetation scattering models), corresponding polarization simulations were performed. That is to say, not only the commonly used LR (left hand circular polarizations (LHCP) received and the right hand circular polarizations (RHCP) received) can be presented, but also the scattering properties at RR, VR, and HR (the transmitted signals are RHCP, while the received polarizations are RHCP, vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarizations, respectively) can be predicted by our developed models. Results reveal obvious polarization differences for the bistatic scattering and DDM. Therefore, the use of GNSS-R polarization information has potential to provide competitive and fruitful results in the future detection of land surface geophysical parameters.

TI  - Bayesian Posterior-Based Winter Wheat Yield Estimation at the Field Scale through Assimilation of Sentinel-2 Data into WOFOST Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely regional crop yield information, particularly field-level yield estimation, is essential for commodity traders and producers in planning production, growing, harvesting, and other interconnected marketing activities. In this study, we propose a novel data assimilation framework. Firstly, we construct the likelihood constraints for a process-based crop growth model based on the previous year's statistical yield and the current year's field observations. Then, we infer the posterior sets of model-simulated time-series LAI and the final yield of winter wheat with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for each meteorological data grid of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (v5ERA5). Finally, we estimate the winter wheat yield at the spatial resolution of 10 m by combining Sentinel-2 LAI and the WOFOST model in Hengshui, the prefecture-level city of Hebei province of China. The results show that the proposed framework can estimate the winter wheat yield with a coefficient of determination R-2 equal to 0.29 and mean absolute percentage error MAPE equal to 7.20% compared to within-field measurements. However, the agricultural stress that crop growth models cannot quantitatively simulate, such as lodging, can greatly reduce the accuracy of yield estimates.

TI  - Evaluating the Efficacy of Five Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Algorithms in Chesapeake Bay (USA) for Operational Monitoring and Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This manuscript describes methods for evaluating the efficacy of five satellite-based Chlorophyll-a algorithms in Chesapeake Bay, spanning three separate sensors: Ocean Land Color Imager (OLCI), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The algorithms were compared using in situ Chlorophyll-a measurements from 38 separate stations, provided through the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP). These stations span nearly the entire 300 km length of the optically complex Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States. Overall accuracy was examined for the entire dataset, in addition to assessing the differences related to the distance from the turbidity maximum to the north by grouping the results into the upper bay, middle bay, or lower bay. The mean bias and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as well as the median bias and Median Absolute Error (MedAE) were conducted for comparison. A two-band algorithm, that is based on the red-edge portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (RE10), when applied to OLCI imagery, exhibited the lowest overall MedAE of 36% at all stations. As a result, it is recommended that the RE10 algorithm be applied to OLCI and provided as an operational product through NOAA's CoastWatch program. The paper will conclude with results from a brief climatological analysis using the OLCI RE10 algorithm.

TI  - Analyzing the structural characteristics of the Sichuan basin vortex based on CloudSat satellite data
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Using the CloudSat data for the Sichuan Basin vortices (SBVs) from June to August (2007-2016) and dividing the data based on whether the SBVs moved eastward, the cloud, precipitation, and thermal structural characteristics of the SVBs were comprehensively analyzed to cultivate a deeper understanding of these vortices. The results show that a direct correlation between vortex structure and precipitation intensity. The variations in radar reflectivity are completely opposite vertical distribution above and below a height of 5 km. The proportion of deep convective clouds is more than 30% of the total vortex depth, and the distribution differences are reflected by the middle and lower clouds. This occurs because stratiform precipitation commonly takes place in the Sichuan Basin. When an SBV moves eastward, the proportion of convective precipitation increases with increasing vortex enhancement. The distribution differences of ice particle parameters embody the effective precipitation mechanisms of sowing and supplying. The locations of intense vortices are indicative of the locations of rainfall centers. The instantaneous precipitation rate increases as the vortex center moves southward. There is a warm central region with a temperature of over 0 degrees C within 200 km of the vortex center for both type I and type III in the radial direction. The wet region appears below the warm region, and the vertical scope of the wet center is less than 4 km. The ranges and intensities of both the warm and wet centers increase gradually with the eastward development of the SBV.

TI  - Using Clean Energy Satellites to Interpret Imagery: A Satellite IoT Oriented Lightweight Object Detection Framework for SAR Ship Detection
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the lightweight deep learning object detection algorithm to detect ship targets in SAR images that can be deployed on-orbit and accessed in the space-based IoT. Traditionally, remote sensing data must be transferred to the ground for processing. With the vigorous development of the commercial aerospace industry, computing, and high-speed laser inter-satellite link technologies, the interconnection of everything in the intelligent world has become an irreversible trend. Satellite remote sensing has entered the era of a big data link with IoT. On-orbit interpretation gives remote sensing images expanse application space. However, implementing on-orbit high-performance computing (HPC) is difficult; it is limited by the power and computer resource consumption of the satellite platform. Facing this challenge, building a processing algorithm with less computational complexity, less parameter quantity, high precision, and low computational power consumption is a key issue. In this paper, we propose a lightweight end-to-end SAR ship detector fused with the vision transformer encoder: YOLO-ViTSS. The experiment shows that YOLO-ViTSS has lightweight features, the model size is only 1.31 MB; it has anti-noise capability is suitable for processing SAR remote sensing images with native noise, and it also has high performance and low training energy consumption with 96.6 mAP on the SSDD dataset. These characteristics make YOLO-ViTSS suitable for porting to satellites for on-orbit processing and online learning. Furthermore, the ideas proposed in this paper help to build a cleaner and a more efficient new paradigm for remote sensing image interpretation. Migrating HPC tasks performed on the ground to on-orbit satellites and using solar energy to complete computing tasks is a more environmentally friendly option. This environmental advantage will gradually increase with the current construction of large-scale satellite constellations. The scheme proposed in this paper helps to build a novel real-time, eco-friendly, and sustainable SAR image interpretation mode.

TI  - Estimating Fractional Vegetation Cover Changes in Desert Regions Using RGB Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important indicator of ecosystem changes. Both satellite remote sensing and ground measurements are common methods for estimating FVC. However, desert vegetation grows sparsely and scantly and spreads widely in desert regions, making it challenging to accurately estimate its vegetation cover using satellite data. In this study, we used RGB images from two periods: images from 2006 captured with a small, light manned aircraft with a resolution of 0.1 m and images from 2019 captured with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a resolution of 0.02 m. Three pixel-based machine learning algorithms, namely gradient enhancement decision tree (GBDT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF), were used to classify the main vegetation (woody and grass species) and calculate the coverage. An independent data set was used to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithms. Overall accuracies of GBDT, KNN and RF for 2006 image classification were 0.9140, 0.9190 and 0.9478, respectively, with RF achieving the best classification results. Overall accuracies of GBDT, KNN and RF for 2019 images were 0.8466, 0.8627 and 0.8569, respectively, with the KNN algorithm achieving the best results for vegetation cover classification. The vegetation coverage in the study area changed significantly from 2006 to 2019, with an increase in grass coverage from 15.47 +/- 1.49% to 27.90 +/- 2.79%. The results show that RGB images are suitable for mapping FVC. Determining the best spatial resolution for different vegetation features may make estimation of desert vegetation coverage more accurate. Vegetation cover changes are also important in terms of understanding the evolution of desert ecosystems.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation of Land Surface Temperature in Recent 20 Years and Analysis of the Effect of Land Use in Jiangxi Province, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of global warming, it is of great significance to study the temporal and spatial evolution of land surface temperature (LST) on long-time scale and the impacts of land use in the fields of urban thermal environment and regional climate change. Based on MODIS LST long time series remote sensing data, the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of pixel-wise LST in Jiangxi Province, the middle inland province of China from 2000 to 2020 were analyzed by using Theil-Sen + Mann-Kendall, coefficient of variation and Hurst index, and the response of LST to land use was identified by combining the contribution and diversity index. The results showed as follows: (1) LST was generally distributed as "high in Middle-East-West-South and low in North-northwest-southeast direction". LST showed an overall downward trend, indicating a weakening of the warming trend. The dynamic trend of LST was characterized by more descending than ascending tendency. The dynamic stability showed a coexistence of high and low fluctuation tendency, with a higher proportion of medium and low fluctuation areas having obvious spatial differences. The overall dynamic sustainability was characterized by uncertainty of future change trend. (2) The LST were strongly affected by land use in the past 20 years. Firstly, the areas of high LST were mostly located in construction land and unused land, while the areas of low LST were mostly in water area and forest land. However, forest land and water area of high temperature were gradually turned to construction land later on. Secondly, the land use structure and pattern had an strong effects on LST. With the increase of the area proportion of different land use, the LST showed significant differences. The more complex the spatial pattern of land use, the more obvious its impact on LST. The research results will provide some reference for the regions with the same characteristics as Jiangxi Province to deal with LST under the background of global climate change.

TI  - Land Use Transition and Effects on Ecosystem Services in Water-Rich Cities under Rapid Urbanization: A Case Study of Wuhan City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems can provide ecosystems service for human society. Exploring the impact of land use transition of water-rich cities on ecosystem service can obtain a large amount of scientific data, and its findings have certain significance for building a sustainable city land use transition pattern. This study takes Wuhan, a water-rich city, as the study area, combines remote sensing image data and macro-economic data in the region from 2000 to 2020, and uses spatial analysis methods, the equivalent factor calculation method, and hot spot analysis to portray the spatial-temporal patterns of land use transition in Wuhan and its effect on ecosystem service values. The results show that: (1) farmland, water, and built-up land are the main land use types in Wuhan, and the continuous expansion of built-up land area is an important factor in the decrease of farmland, wetland, and grassland areas; (2) The change in ecosystem service values in Wuhan is influenced by the fluctuation of water area, and the overall ecosystem service values in Wuhan increased from CNY (Chinese Yuan) 56.498 billion (USD 8.47 billion) in 2000 to CNY 56.749 billion (USD 8.508 billion) in 2020, with an increase of CNY 251.3 million (USD 37.676 million) between 2000 and 2020. Among them, the ecosystem services values of water increased by CNY 1.223 billion (USD 183.358 million), and the ecosystem service values of its assumed hydrological regulation function also increased by CNY 995.7 million (USD149.28 million) during this period; (3) In the period 2000-2020, the hotspot areas for the value supply of ecosystem services were mainly distributed in Jiangxia, Hongshan, Hannan, Xinzhou, Huangpi and some areas of Caidian, which are covered with a large proportion of water, while the cold spots are mainly distributed in Jiang'an, Jianghan, Qiaokou, and Qingshan districts, which have more built-up land, and Huangpi, Caidian, Jiangxia, and Xinzhou districts, which have more farmland. Sustainable land planning solutions should take into account typical regional land use transition patterns and incorporate them into smart land planning practices. This study can provide key information for smart land planning.

TI  - A Comprehensive Comparison of Machine Learning and Feature Selection Methods for Maize Biomass Estimation Using Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices, and Biophysical Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate estimation of maize biomass is critical for predicting crop productivity. The launched Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) missions offer a new opportunity to map biomass. The selection of appropriate response variables is crucial for improving the accuracy of biomass estimation. We developed models from SAR polarization indices, vegetation indices (VIs), and biophysical variables (BPVs) based on gaussian process regression (GPR) and random forest (RF) with feature optimization to retrieve maize biomass in Changchun, Jilin province, Northeastern China. Three new predictors from each type of remote sensing data were proposed based on the correlations to biomass measured in June, July, and August 2018. The results showed that a predictor combined by vertical-horizontal polarization (VV), vertical-horizontal polarization (VH), and the difference of VH and VV (VH-VV) derived from S-1 images of June, July, and August, respectively, with GPR and RF, provided a more accurate estimation of biomass (R-2 = 0.81-0.83, RMSE = 0.40-0.41 kg/m(2)) than the models based on single SAR polarization indices or their combinations, or optimized features (R-2 = 0.04-0.39, RMSE = 0.84-1.08 kg/m(2)). Among the S-2 VIs, the GPR model using a combination of ratio vegetation index (RVI) of June, normalized different infrared index (NDII) of July, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of August achieved a result with R-2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 0.39 kg/m(2), much better than single VIs or their combination, or optimized features (R-2 of 0.31-0.77, RMSE of 0.47-0.87 kg/m(2)). A BPV predictor, combined with leaf chlorophyll content (CAB) in June, canopy water content (CWC) in July, and fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER) in August, with RF, also yielded the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.38 kg/m(2)) compared to that of single BPVs or their combinations, or optimized subset. Overall, the three combined predictors were found to be significant contributors to improving the estimation accuracy of biomass with GPR and RF methods. This study clearly sheds new insights on the application of S-1 and S-2 data on maize biomass modeling.

TI  - COVID-19: Evaluation of Fever Clinic and Fever Sentinel Configuration-A Case Study of Harbin, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has placed the inequalities in health services in countries around the world under severe pressure. As crucial pillars in the prevention and control of COVID-19, fever clinics and fever sentinels are important sites for the screening, diagnosis, and isolation of patients. This study comprehensively evaluated the spatial-layout characteristics, configuration quantity, and service capacity of 42 fever clinics and 418 fever sentinels in Harbin from the perspective of supply by using GIS spatial-analysis methods such as kernel density analysis. From the perspective of demand, we evaluated the accessibility of fever clinics with the modified two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method; the OD cost matrix method and Voronoi diagram method were used to evaluate the accessibility and service pressure of fever sentinels. This study found that a monocentric clustering characterizes the spatial layout of fever clinics, and the design of fever clinics in new urban areas and marginal rural areas is relatively lacking. The spatial layout of fever sentinels includes blank areas, and the service pressure in the central city area is relatively high. Combined with the assessment results, the study discussed optimization strategies and implementation paths for improving the public health and epidemic prevention system for COVID-19 in terms of four aspects: the transformation of governance practice, the spatial-planning response, the digital infrastructure response, and guarantees of policies and regulations.

TI  - Development of Land-River Two-Way Hydrologic Coupling for Floodplain Inundation in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain inundation links river and land systems through significant water, sediment, and nutrient exchanges. However, these two-way interactions between land and river are currently missing in most Earth System Models. In this study, we introduced the two-way hydrological coupling between the land component, E3SM Land Model, and the river component, Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport, in Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to study the impacts of floodplain inundation on land and river processes. We calibrated the river channel geometry and developed a new data-driven inundation scheme to improve the simulation of inundation dynamics in E3SM. The new inundation scheme captures 96% of the spatial variation of inundation area in a satellite inundation product at global scale, in contrast with 7% when the default inundation scheme of E3SM was used. Global simulations including the new inundation scheme performed at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees resolution with and without land-river two-way coupling was used to quantify the impact of coupling. Comparisons show that two-way coupling modifies the water and energy cycle in 20% of the global land cells. Specifically, riverine inundation is reduced by two-way coupling, but inland inundation is intensified. Wetter periods are more impacted by the two-way coupling at the global scale, while regions with different climates exhibit different sensitivities. The two-way exchange of water between the land and river components of E3SM provides the foundation for enabling two-way coupling of land-river sediment and biogeochemical fluxes. These capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the interactions between water and biogeochemical cycles and their response to human perturbations.

TI  - Development of a Novel Burned-Area Subpixel Mapping (BASM) Workflow for Fire Scar Detection at Subpixel Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate detection of burned forest area is essential for post-fire management and assessment, and for quantifying carbon budgets. Therefore, it is imperative to map burned areas accurately. Currently, there are few burned-area products around the world. Researchers have mapped burned areas directly at the pixel level that is usually a mixture of burned area and other land cover types. In order to improve the burned area mapping at subpixel level, we proposed a Burned Area Subpixel Mapping (BASM) workflow to map burned areas at the subpixel level. We then applied the workflow to Sentinel 2 data sets to obtain burned area mapping at subpixel level. In this study, the information of true fire scar was provided by the Department of Emergency Management of Hunan Province, China. To validate the accuracy of the BASM workflow for detecting burned areas at the subpixel level, we applied the workflow to the Sentinel 2 image data and then compared the detected burned area at subpixel level with in situ measurements at fifteen fire-scar reference sites located in Hunan Province, China. Results show the proposed method generated successfully burned area at the subpixel level. The methods, especially the BASM-Feature Extraction Rule Based (BASM-FERB) method, could minimize misclassification and effects due to noise more effectively compared with the BASM-Random Forest (BASM-RF), BASM-Backpropagation Neural Net (BASM-BPNN), BASM-Support Vector Machine (BASM-SVM), and BASM-notra methods. We conducted a comparison study among BASM-FERB, BASM-RF, BASM-BPNN, BASM-SVM, and BASM-notra using five accuracy evaluation indices, i.e., overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), intersection over union (IoU), and Kappa coefficient (Kappa). The detection accuracy of burned area at the subpixel level by BASM-FERB's OA, UA, IoU, and Kappa is 98.11%, 81.72%, 74.32%, and 83.98%, respectively, better than BASM-RF's, BASM-BPNN's, BASM-SVM's, and BASM-notra's, even though BASM-RF's and BASM-notra's average PA is higher than BASM-FERB's, with 89.97%, 91.36%, and 89.52%, respectively. We conclude that the newly proposed BASM workflow can map burned areas at the subpixel level, providing greater accuracy in regards to the burned area for post-forest fire management and assessment.

TI  - Annual Maps of Built-Up Land in Guangdong from 1991 to 2020 Based on Landsat Images, Phenology, Deep Learning Algorithms, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of built-up land is essential for urbanization monitoring and ecosystem research. At present, remote sensing is one of the primary means used for real-time and accurate surveying and mapping of built-up land, due to the long time series and multi-information advantages of existing remote sensing images and the ability to obtain highly precise year-by-year built-up land maps. In this study, we obtained feature-enhanced data regarding built-up land from Landsat images and phenology-based algorithms and proposed a method that combines the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and deep learning approaches. The Res-UNet++ structural model was improved for built-up land mapping in Guangdong from 1991 to 2020. Experiments show that overall accuracy of built-up land map in the study area in 2020 was 0.99, the kappa coefficient was 0.96, user accuracy of built-up land was 0.98, and producer accuracy was 0.901. The trained model can be applied to other years with good results. The overall accuracy (OA) of the assessment results every five years was above 0.97, and the kappa coefficient was above 0.90. From 1991 to 2020, built-up land in Guangdong has expanded significantly, the area of built-up land has increased by 71%, and the proportion of built-up land has increased by 3.91%. Our findings indicate that the combined approach of GEE and deep learning algorithms can be developed into a large-scale, long time-series of remote sensing classification techniques framework that can be useful for future land-use mapping research.

TI  - Impact of Snow Cover Phenology on the Vegetation Green-Up Date on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in snow cover resulting from global warming inevitably affect alpine vegetation growth on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but our knowledge of such influences is still limited. Here, we investigated the relationship between snow cover and alpine vegetation during 2003-2020 on the TP using the satellite-derived vegetation green-up date (GUD) and metrics of snow cover phenology, namely the snow cover onset date (SCOD), snow cover end date (SCED), snow cover duration (SCD), and snowmelt onset date (SMOD). In this study, we first analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in the GUD and the snow cover phenology metrics on the TP. Pearson's correlation, gray relation analysis, and linear regression were then employed to determine the impact of snow cover phenology on the GUD. Overall, with the SCOD, SCED, and SMOD delayed by one day, the GUD was advanced by 0.07 and 0.03 days and was postponed by 0.32 days, respectively, and a one-day extension of the SCD resulted in a 0.04-day advance in the GUD. In addition, the roles of vegetation type, topography, and climate factors (temperature and precipitation) in modulating the relationships between snow cover phenology and the GUD were evaluated. The GUD of alpine steppes was negatively correlated with the SCOD and SCED, contrary to that of the other vegetation types. The GUD of alpine steppes was also more sensitive to snow cover phenology than that of other vegetation types. The increase in elevation generally enhanced the sensitivity of the GUD to snow cover phenology. The GUD showed a stronger negative sensitivity to the SCD in warmer areas and a stronger positive sensitivity to the SMOD in wetter areas. Our findings revealed the essential impact of variation in snow cover phenology on the GUD and indicated the complex interference of environmental factors in the relationship between snow cover and vegetation growth.

TI  - Estimating Large-Scale Interannual Dynamic Impervious Surface Percentages Based on Regional Divisions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface information is an important indicator to describe urban development and environmental changes. The substantial increase in impervious surface area will have a significant impact on the regional landscape and environment. Therefore, the timely and accurate acquisition of large-scale impervious surface percentage (LISP) is of great significance for urban management and ecological assessment. However, previous LISP estimation methods often ignored the impact of regional geographic environment and climate differences on remote sensing information, resulting in low overall accuracy and obvious regional differences in the estimated results. Thus, in this study, based on the time-series characteristics of multi-temporal remote sensing images combined with the information on geographical environment and climate heterogeneity, a method of time-series remote sensing image fusion and LISP estimation based on regional divisions was proposed. Firstly, the entire region was divided into several regions according to the spatial differences of Koppen-Geiger climate data and MODIS NDVI time-series data. Subsequently, adaptive time-series image fusion methods and remote sensing feature construction methods were proposed for different regions. Finally, the proposed method was used to estimate the percentage of impervious surfaces in other years in Asia. The results indicate that the overall R-2 of each region is better than 0.82, and the estimation models have a good ability to transfer across time and can directly estimate the impervious surface percentage in other years without using additional samples. In addition, compared with other existing impervious surface products, the proposed method has higher overall estimation accuracy and regional consistency.

TI  - A Bibliometric and Visualized Analysis of Research Progress and Trends in Rice Remote Sensing over the Past 42 Years (1980-2021)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important food crops around the world. Remote sensing technology, as an effective and rapidly developing method, has been widely applied to precise rice management. To observe the current research status in the field of rice remote sensing (RRS), a bibliometric analysis was carried out based on 2680 papers of RRS published during 1980-2021, which were collected from the core collection of the Web of Science database. Quantitative analysis of the number of publications, top countries and institutions, popular keywords, etc. was conducted through the knowledge mapping software CiteSpace, and comprehensive discussions were carried out from the aspects of specific research objects, methods, spectral variables, and sensor platforms. The results revealed that an increasing number of countries and institutions have conducted research on RRS and a great number of articles have been published annually, among which, China, the United States of America, and Japan were the top three and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang University, and Nanjing Agricultural University were the first three research institutions with the largest publications. Abundant interest was paid to "reflectance", followed by "vegetation index" and "yield" and the specific objects mainly focused on growth, yield, area, stress, and quality. From the perspective of spectral variables, reflectance, vegetation index, and back-scattering coefficient appeared the most frequently in the frontiers. In addition to satellite remote sensing data and empirical models, unmanned air vehicle (UAV) platforms and artificial intelligence models have gradually become hot topics. This study enriches the readers' understanding and highlights the potential future research directions in RRS.

TI  - Space Geodetic Evidence of Basement-Involved Thick-Skinned Orogeny and Fault Frictional Heterogeneity of the Papuan Fold Belt, Papua New Guinea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the fault kinematics underlying the Papuan Fold Belt is important for better understanding the evolution of the orogen, but the active and long-term tectonics of the region remain widely debated. The 2018 M-w 7.5 Papua New Guinea earthquake provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the active fault structure deep in the Papuan Fold Belt. Here, we use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data from four ALOS-2 acquisitions to study coseismic and postseismic ground deformation and invert for fault slip models. The results show that the oblique reverse earthquake reactivated a flat-ramp structure and ruptured through most of the crust with the majority of coseismic slip confined between 5 and 25 km. Additionally, we found three separated postseismic slip zones with variable spatial complementarity between coseismic and postseismic slip, dip-slip/strike-slip ratio, and seismic/aseismic budget at three separated postseismic slip zones. Our results demonstrate that thick-skinned tectonics dominate the current state of Papua New Guinea frontal orogen evolution.

TI  - Analysis on Management Policies on Water Quantity Conflict in Transboundary Rivers Embedded with Virtual Water-Using Ili River as the Case
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current studies neglect how virtual water transfer (VWT) between countries within a drainage basin affects water stress and then yields an invisible effect on the water quantity conflict in transboundary rivers, which would further make management policies on water quantity conflict less fair and reasonable. Therefore, this study first constructs the Inequality Index of VWT and water stress index (WSI) to assess water stress. Next, different types are set according to the Inequality Index and WSI to analyze management policies, with Ili River as the case. Results show: (1) Within the study period, from 1996, the Inequality Index of VWT between China and Kazakhstan stayed at 0.368 (0.368 < 0.5), indicating a relatively high inequality of VWT between the two countries-China at a disadvantage, while Kazakhstan having the upper hand. (2) According to the remotely sensed data, WSI in the riparian zones of the Ili River rose from 0.288 to 0421 in China, and 0214 to 0.402 in Kazakhstan, showing intermediate scarcity. (3) China and Kazakhstan both fall into Type 2, and Kazakhstan has the advantageous position. Therefore, while allocating the water resources of the Ili River, Kazakhstan should lower its expectation and proactively ask to exchange benefits in other aspects to reverse the outward transfer of its physical water. In addition, the two countries should find suitable ways to go about water rights trading to reduce the possibility of potential water quantity conflict.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Global NDVI Research Trends from 1985 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - As one of the earliest remote sensing indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been employed extensively for vegetation research. However, despite an abundance of NDVI review articles, these studies are predominantly limited to either one subject area or one area, with systematic NDVI reviews being relatively rare. Bibliometrics is a useful method of analyzing scientific literature that has been widely used in many disciplines; however, it has not yet been applied to comprehensively analyze NDVI research. Therefore, we used bibliometrics and scientific mapping methods to analyze citation data retrieved from the Web of Science during 1985-2021 with NDVI as the topic. According to the analysis results, the amount of NDVI research increased exponentially during the study period, and the related research fields became increasingly varied. Moreover, a greater number of satellite and aerial remote sensing platforms resulted in more diverse NDVI data sources. In future, machine learning methods and cloud computing platforms led by Google Earth Engine will substantially improve the accuracy and production efficiency of NDVI data products for more effective global research.

TI  - Eco-Environmental Effects and Spatial Heterogeneity of "Production-Ecology-Living" Land Use Transformation: A Case Study for Ningxia, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal changes to the eco-environmental quality index (EQI) and determination of their spatial differentiation characteristics are important bases for land management and ecological environment protection. This study evaluates the changes in EQI and its spatial distribution characteristics with reference to the three dominant functions of land use, namely "production-ecology-living" (PEL), based on the interpretation of land use remote sensing data in 2000, 2010 and 2018. The spatial diversity of ecological environment quality and its driving factors were quantitatively analyzed by gravity center transfer, cold and hot spot analysis, and the GeoDetector model. The results showed that: (1) The transformation of land in Ningxia from 2000 to 2018 mainly manifested by the increase in industrial and mining production land (IMPL), urban living land (ULL) and rural living land (RLL), and the decrease of grassland ecological land (GEL), especially in the north of Ningxia. (2) The ecological environment quality decreased slightly during the research period, but there was an improvement trend in the north. High environment quality values were concentrated in the Liupan Mountain area in the south of Ningxia, while the low values were mainly in the desert areas of Shapotou County and Zhongning County in the west. (3) The interaction between land use intensity and topographic factors led to spatial change in EQI in the research area. Effects of land use intensity are the dominant factor, reflecting the degree of impact of human activities on natural ecosystems. Our results suggest that topographic factors and human disturbances should be fully taken into account in future land and spatial development decisions to minimize human-ecological conflicts.

TI  - Swamp Wetlands in Degraded Permafrost Areas Release Large Amounts of Methane and May Promote Wildfires through Friction Electrification
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by global warming, permafrost degradation releases a large amount of methane gas, and this part of flammable methane may increase the frequency of wildfires. To study the influence mechanism of methane emission on wildfires in degraded permafrost regions, we selected the northwest section of Xiaoxing'an Mountains in China as the study area, and combined with remote sensing data, we conducted long-term monitoring of atmospheric electric field, temperature, methane concentration, and other observation parameters, and further carried out indoor gas-solid friction tests. The study shows that methane gas (the concentration of methane at the centralized leakage point is higher than 10,000 ppm) in the permafrost degradation area will release rapidly in spring, and friction with soil, surface plant residues, and water vapor will accelerate atmospheric convection and generate electrostatic and atmospheric electrodischarge phenomena on the surface. The electrostatic and atmospheric electrodischarge accumulated on the surface will further ignite the combustibles near the surface, such as methane gas and plant residues. Therefore, the gradual release of methane gas into the air promotes the feedback mechanism of lightning-wildfire-vegetation, and increases the risk of wildfire in degraded permafrost areas through frictional electrification (i.e., electrostatic and atmospheric electrodischarge).

TI  - Response of China's Wetland NDVI to Climate Changes
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation dynamics are of vital importance for comprehending changes in ecosystem structure and function. In the context of global climate change, it is still unclear the change in trends occurring to wetland vegetation in China. Using Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index product (NDVI3g), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Vegetation Health Products (VHP), and climate data, this study explored the response of wetland vegetation NDVI to climate change in China from 1981 to 2015. The results show that: 1) NDVI of wetland vegetation in China exhibited a downward trend on the whole after the year 2004. 2) In water-limited zones, wetland vegetation NDVI was positively correlated with precipitation; while in temperature-limited zones, it was positively correlated with temperature. We also discussed the impact of climate change to wetland vegetation and the complexity of wetland vegetation response to climate change. This study has the potential to provide guidance and support decision-making for the protection, assessment, restoration and management of wetlands.

T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] To explore the classification effect of deep learning models on forest vegetation using multi-temporal Sentinel-2A/B images. [Method] In this study, based on the multi-temporal Sentinel-2A/B images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Mengjiagang Forest Farm in Heilongjiang Province, the JM distance of each forest category was used to determine the best single-phase. The characteristics of multi-temporal vegetation index and red edge index (DVI, mNDVI, Clred-edge, NDre1) were analyzed. Support vector machine and optimized U-Net model were used to carry out classification experiments on single-phase + DEM and single-phase + DEM + multi-temporal vegetation index respectively. [Result] (1) On the basis of single-phase + DEM, when adding multi-phase vegetation index, the accuracy of U-Net model was 76.37%, which was 5.7% higher than that of single-phase + DEM; (2) The accuracy of U-Net model was higher than that of support vector machine. In addition, the deep learning U-Net model could avoid the "salt and pepper" phenomenon, and the classification results were more delicate. [Conclusion] Based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2A/B images, the vegetation index and red edge index time series characteristics are constructed, and the U-Net model can improve the classification accuracy of forest types to a certain extent.

TI  - Effects of Ecological Water Conveyance on Soil Salinization in the Shiyang River Basin's Terminal Lake-Qingtu Lake-Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Recently, secondary soil salinization has frequently occurred in ecological water conveyance and irrigation areas. Therefore, monitoring the information on soil salinization in the conveyance irrigation area and analyzing the change process of soil salinization are of great significance to both environmental improvement and salinization management. (2) Methods: This study takes the Shiyang River's terminal lake-Qingtu Lake-and its surroundings as the research area. The salinization index was extracted by remote sensing data and methods, and a comprehensive salinization model (CSI) was established. Firstly, the spatial distribution regular of soil salinization, since ecological water conveyance was explored, and the change trends in soil salinization were analyzed. Secondly, the relationship between the change characteristics of soil salinization and groundwater, water area changes and land use types were analyzed. (3) Results: The Kappa coefficient between the soil salinization extracted by CSI and the measured data reached 0.703, and CSI can accurately monitor soil salinization information. From 2011 to 2020, the non-salinized land increased by 2.1%, mild and moderate salinization decreased by 5.7% and 3.9%, respectively, and severe salinization increased by 7.5%. The salinization in the lake area showed a decreasing trend, and the periphery of the lake area showed an increasing trend. Groundwater, water area changes and land use type have certain influences on soil salinization in the study area. (4) Conclusion: Since ecological water conveyance, the total proportion of soil salinized area in Qingtu Lake and its surrounding areas has not changed much, but there are certain changes between different grades of salinized land. The areas with changes to the level of salinization are mainly shallow, unstable water areas, saline-alkali land, wetlands and sandy land, and there are secondary salinization problems in these areas.

TI  - Remote Sensing Prescription for Rice Nitrogen Fertilizer Recommendation Based on Improved NFOA Model
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise fertilization of rice depends on the timely and effective acquisition of fertilizer application recommended by prescription maps in large-scale cropland, which can provide fertilization spatial information reference. In this paper, the prescription map was discussed based on the improved nitrogen fertilizer optimization algorithm (NFOA), using satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, and supplemented by meteorological data. Based on the principles of NFOA, firstly, remote sensing data and meteorological data were collected from 2019 to 2021 to construct a prediction model for the potential yield of rice based on the in-season estimated yield index (INSEY). Secondly, based on remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) and spectral features of bands, the grain nitrogen content (GNC) prediction model constructed using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to improve the values of GNC taken in the NFOA. The nitrogen demand for rice was calculated according to the improved NFOA. Finally, the nitrogen fertilizer application recommended prescription map of rice in large-scale cropland was generated based on UAV multispectral images, and the economic cost-effectiveness of the prescription map was analyzed. The analysis results showed that the potential yield prediction model of rice based on the improved INSEY had a high fitting accuracy (R-2 = 0.62). The accuracy of GNC estimated with the RF algorithm reached 96.3% (RMSE = 0.07). The study shows that, compared with the non-directional and non-quantitative conventional tracking of N fertilizer, the recommended prescription map based on the improved NFOA algorithm in large-scale cropland can provide accurate information for crop N fertilizer variable tracking and provide effective positive references for the economic benefits of rice and ecological benefits of the field environment.

TI  - Time-frequency optimization of RSEI: A case study of Yangtze River Basin
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) is one of the most widely used ecological quality assessment indicators. Due to the noise caused by adverse atmoshperic conditions and other factors, the RSEI calculated from the original image usually has the phenomena of lack of information and unstable image quality. Therefore, based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, this study adopts three common data reconstruction algorithms firstly, namely: Savitory-Golay filter (SG), harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS), Whittaker Smoother (WS), which are used to reconstruct the original MODIS time series data in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) from 2000 to 2020, in order to optimize the calculation process of RSEI. At the same time, three indicators (correlation coefficient (R), standard deviation (STD), root mean square error (RMSE)) are used for the accuracy evaluation. The results show that data reconstruction can fill gaps in RSEI, the reconstruction performance of WS and SG for four parameters is better than HANTS, and the four SG reconstructed sequences have the strongest correlation with the original sequences (R between 0.8 ~ 1), while the WS reconstruction sequence has the lowest error value (both STD and RMSE are less than 1), both of them can correct the pixel value, which is conducive to maintaining the stability of RSEI in the temporal dimension; the RSEI produced by HANTS has the best accuracy, that is, R, STD, RMSE are respectively 0.898, 0.130, 0.104. As shown by the research, it is necessary to de-noise each parameter before synthesizing RSEI. This study can provide a theoretical basis for applying time-frequency algorithms to optimize the ecological monitoring performance of RSEI.

TI  - A Micro Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Chang'e-5 Sample
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chang'e-5 (CE-5) mission has successfully returned samples from a site that is much younger than the sites of all previous lunar sampling missions. Sample analysis results reported so far have revealed a more complex sampling area than previously thought, casting uncertainties over the interpretation of remote sensing spectral data and the U and Th abundance derived from the orbital data. Laboratory spectral measurement of the returned samples can serve as validation of remote sensing observations and thus help refine our understanding of the geological evolution of the landing region. In this study we report detailed micro mid-infrared (MIR) spectral characteristics of individual soil grains of CE-5 samples. The spectral analysis results show that the CE-5 olivine grains have low Fo (molar Mg/[Mg + Fe] x 100) consistent with previous studies, indicating a Fe-rich source region of the mantle or a highly evolved magma. These olivine grains show high level of crystallinity, implying low degree of space weathering. Most of the CE-5 glasses analyzed are spectrally consistent with mare impact glasses, despite that a few of them may have a volcanic origin. These laboratory spectral analysis of CE-5 samples in the MIR wavelengths at a micro scale, together with the derived MIR optical constants of the olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and glass grains, provide important input for the modeling and interpretation of thermal remote sensing data of the Moon.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation and Influencing Factors of Vegetation Growth in Mining Areas: A Case Study in a Colliery in Northern China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on MODIS EVI data of August collected from 2010 to 2021, and taking the Yingpanhao coal mine as an example, the spatiotemporal variation features of vegetation are analyzed using time series analysis, trend analysis and correlation analysis methods in the eco-geo-environment of the phreatic water desert shallows oasis. A significant increase trend is found for vegetation variation, and its development has improved generally in most areas. There is an obvious positive correlation between precipitation and vegetation growth, and a negative correlation between coal mining intensity and vegetation growth, but the influence of atmospheric precipitation on vegetation growth is stronger than that of coal mining intensity in the eco-geo-environment. The research results effectively reflect that atmospheric precipitation is the primary factor advancing the vegetation growth status in the coal mining regions. Vegetation development response to coal mining would be degraded first, then improved, and finally restored in areas with a deeply buried phreatic water level; that would promote the transformation of vegetation species from hydrophilous plants to xerophyte plants in areas with a shallowly buried phreatic water level. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out reasonable mine field planning according to the phreatic water level and the vegetation type distribution and to adopt different coal mining methods or corresponding engineering and technical measures to realize water conservation to avoid damaging the original hydrogeological conditions as far as possible. This information is helpful for promoting the eco-geo-environmental protection and further establishing the need for the dynamic monitoring of the eco-environment in the coal mining regions in the arid and semi-arid ecologically vulnerable areas of Northern China, which play a significant role in the long-term protection and rehabilitation of the eco-geo-environment and in the promotion of sustainable development.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based measurements of the electric field from a station located in the arid Negev region of southern Israel have been conducted continuously since 2013. We present here results of observations of the electric field (Potential Gradient, PG) variability during 22 cloudy days, with varying cloud types and cloud base heights, and compare the measured values with the mean fair-weather PG. The results show an increase of PG (similar to+10 to +70 V m(-1)) from mean fair weather values during times of low clouds. During times of mid-altitude (alto) clouds or during a superposition of low and high clouds, there were small departures in the PG values (similar to 0 to -30 V m(-1)) compared to mean fair weather PG values. During times of high-altitude cirrus clouds there is a clear decrease of the PG (similar to-40 to -90 V m(-1)). The data was compared with the Israeli meteorological service cloud data and with MODIS 7 satellite cloud top height maps. In addition, AERONET aerosol optical depth values and wind speed magnitude from a local meteorological station were analyzed.

TI  - Machine Learning in Extreme Value Analysis, an Approach to Detecting Harmful Algal Blooms with Long-Term Multisource Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term satellite observations have the ability to provide early warnings of harmful algal blooms (HABs). However, detecting HABs in optically complex coastal waters is somewhat challenging. In this article, we propose a two-step scheme, combining long short-term memory (LSTM) with extreme value analysis (EVA), for HAB detection. Essentially, the LSTM network builds a normal time series model on selected coordinate of long-term multisource satellite data. This model detects potential HAB dates by utilizing the LSTM predictive errors for an approximated Gaussian distribution. For each potential HAB date, the EVA approach then extracts the HAB distribution from the selected coordinate by considering the spatial correlation. A case study in Zhejiang coastal waters shows that our method exploits the advantages of both LSTM and EVA models, which not only has the strong prediction capability of LSTM for reducing HAB false alarm rate, but also achieves a dynamic HAB extraction through the EVA fitting.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Pattern Analysis of Land Use Functions in Contiguous Coastal Cities Based on Long-Term Time Series Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Bohai Sea Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term accumulated remote sensing data and the emerging cloud-based geospatial processing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) enable the mining of the spatiotemporal pattern of land-use (LU) functional changes in the contiguous area of large coastal cities. This study proposes a spatiotemporal pattern mining technique for land use function in a large area, which consists of two parts: (1) long-term time series land cover mapping based on the random forest (RF) classification algorithm in the GEE platform and a pixel-by-pixel temporal consistency correction, and (2) spatiotemporal pattern mining based on the constructed spatial temporal cubes (STCs). Specifically, for each LU functional series, we constructed the STC and applied change point detection, time series clustering, and emerging hot spot analysis to mine the spatiotemporal change patterns of LU functions. The study shows that (1) the construction land in the Bohai Sea region from 1990 to 2020 expanded significantly, with the development intensity increasing from 2.08% to 9.77%, having formed a contiguous area of large cities; at the same time, the arable land area decreased significantly, from 57.94% to 47.83%; (2) the emerged construction land experienced three periods: fluctuation, rise, and decline, with 2004 and 2014 being the change points during the period; and (3), the spatial and temporal pattern of the expansion of construction land shows a spatial gradient change in the scale and rate of expansion along the central cities and major axes. This study demonstrates the potential of using long-term time series remote sensing data towards cognizing the generation mechanisms of contiguous coastal big cities.

TI  - Dynamic Changes of Plantations and Natural Forests in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River and Their Relationship with Climatic Factors
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat TM/ETM/OLI images and MODIS NDVI time series remote sensing data from 1999 to 2015, the changes of land use/cover types (including natural forests and plantations) through NDVI trends and their relationship with meteorological factors in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) were analyzed by supervised classification, coefficient of variation, trend analysis, rescaled range analysis, and partial correlation analysis. The results showed that, in the past 17 years, the main landscape type in the MRYR is forestland (accounting for more than 50%), and the built-up land and plantations area increased by four fifths and one fifth, respectively. The area of natural forests had been reduced by one fifth. Additionally, NDVI showed an upward trend (0.37%), especially in natural forests (0.57%). Two thirds of the natural forests had NDVI values greater than 0.80, and 89.21% of them were significantly improved. The area with an uncertain future development trend of all vegetation was more than half of the area. At the same time, partial correlation analysis with climate factors showed that relative humidity had an inhibitory effect on vegetation growth (p < 0.05). Climate factors had a certain lag effect on the growth of natural forests and plantations. Generally speaking, sunshine duration had a positive effect on forests growth, while relative humidity had a negative effect. The results showed that if the forest land was studied as a whole, many of the problems of natural forests and plantations would be ignored. The continuous decrease of natural forests and possible further degradation in the future are worthy of attention. The results could provide a reference for forest ecological protection in other areas.

TI  - Evaluation of the Consistency of the Vegetation Clumping Index Retrieved from Updated MODIS BRDF Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The clumping index (CI) quantifies the foliage grouping within distinct canopies relative to randomly distributed canopies, which plays an important role in the vegetation radiative regime. Among the vegetation structure parameters, the global CI map can be retrieved by using multiangle remote sensing observations. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/Albedo product (MCD43) of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is the crucial input data of the global CI product, which provides validated spatiotemporal continuous directional reflectance data. To determine the impacts of updating the MCD43 product on the consistency and performance of global CI products, CIs retrieved from different MCD43 versions (Collection V005/V006, C5/6) were compared on a global scale and validated with field-measured CI data. The results showed that the global and seasonal comparisons of C5 and C6 CI data are generally consistent. Compared to C5 CI data, C6 CI data have improved quality with more main algorithm retrievals and fewer case of missing data. The comparisons over the field measurements indicate that both versions of CI data agree with field-measured CI data in terms of values and seasonal variations, while C6 CI data (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.05, bias = 0.02) are closer to field CIs than C5 CI data (R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.07, bias = 0.03), indicating a higher accuracy for C6 CI data. The monthly CI is recommended for characterizing the overall seasonal patterns of surface CIs.

TI  - Spatial portability of random forest models to estimate site-specific air temperature for prediction of emergence dates of the Asian Corn Borer in North Korea
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The air temperature estimates derived from satellite data products would facilitate site-specific prediction of pest outbreaks. Here we propose an approach to estimate air temperature with spatial portability using both land surface temperature (LST) and atmospheric profile (AP) products based on MODIS satellites. In the approach, quantitative and qualitative variables were used as inputs to assess and improve the spatial portability of random forest (RF) models. Daily temperature data at sites in the Korean peninsula were collected from a weather database operated by the Korean Meteorological Administration. Sets of input variables were defined to represent temperature data from the LST (LT) and AP (AT) products, geographical properties (GE), data quality and cloud conditions (QC), land cover type (LC), and auxiliary properties (AX), respectively. The combinations of these sets were used as inputs to the RF models, which were cross-validated using satellite data and weather observation data in South Korea from 2013 to 2019. Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Spatial Portability Index (SPI) were determined to compare the accuracy of the RF models across the sites of interest. The RF model that uses AT, LT, and QC variable sets as inputs (RFo) tended to have high values of CCC among test sites in South Korea, which ranged from 0.91 to 0.99. RFo also had higher values of SPI at sites in North Korea than the other models in which either AT or LT was excluded. Furthermore, the emergence date of Asian Corn Borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) was predicted with high values of CCC (0.94-0.97) across the study sites when RFo was used to prepare the input data to an insect phenology model. Our results suggest that both LST and AP products would contribute to higher spatial portability of air temperature estimation. This also hints that the temperature estimation model with high spatial portability would facilitate the pest models, which can be used to reduce the risk of food insecurity in developing countries with sparse weather station networks.

TI  - Identifying the Impact of Regional Meteorological Parameters on US Crop Yield at Various Spatial Scales Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the influence of meteorological parameters such as temperature and precipitation on gross primary production (GPP) in the continental United States (CONUS) during boreal summer using satellite-based temperature and precipitation indices and GPP data at various scales (i.e., pixel, county, and state levels). The strong linear relationship between temperature and precipitation indices is presented around the central United States, particularly in the Great Plains, where the year-to-year variation of GPP is very sensitive to meteorological conditions. This sensitive GPP variation is mostly attributable to the semi-arid climate in the Great Plains, where crop productivity and temperature are closely related. The more specific information for the regionality of the relationships across the variables manifests itself at higher resolutions. The impact of the summer meteorological condition on the annual crop yield is particularly significant. Maize and soybean yields show a strong correlation with both Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) in the Great Plains, with a relatively higher relationship with TCI than PCI, which is consistent with the relationship compared with GPP. This study suggests that in-depth investigations into the relationship between maize and soybean yields and the climate are required. The region-dependent relationship between GPP and meteorological conditions in our study would guide agricultural decision making in the future climate.

TI  - Coal fire identification and state assessment by integrating multitemporal thermal infrared and InSAR remote sensing data: A case study of Midong District, Urumqi, China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal fire disasters generally occur in major coal-producing countries. They destroyed many coal resources and triggered various environmental problems. The identification and state assessment of coal fire areas are paramount to coal fire management. In this paper, a method for identifying coal fires by integrating land surface temperatures (LSTs) from multitemporal thermal infrared remote sensing and subsidence information from multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) is proposed. The method primarily consists of estimating the LSTs and subsidence values, normalizing and equidistantly partitioning the LSTs, estimating the thermal anomaly frequency (TAF), extracting high-subsidence areas, determining the thermal anomaly frequency threshold (TAFT), and identifying coal fire areas according to the TAFT. The coal fire ratio index (CRI) was developed to quantitatively evaluate the severity of coal fires and its variations. Midong District, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China, was selected as the study area. Forty-five Landsat 8 images and sixty-one Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to retrieve LST and subsidence time series, respectively. The proposed method and CRI were applied to identify and evaluate coal fires in the study area. The results demonstrate the satisfactory reliability of these methods compared with field surveys. The maximum CRI was 6.145 x 10(-4) (July 28, 2019), and the minimum CRI was 2.685 x 10(-5) (January 13, 2020). Coal fires in summer were more severe than those in winter. The CRI profile presented seasonal and annual periodicities and was affected by the local climate. The soil cohesion and humidity are higher in winter due to possible snowmelt, which weakens the interaction between oxygen and coal seams and the subsequent combustion of coal. The LST, thermal anomaly, and deformation information were combined in a time series overlay analysis to reveal the differences in the LSTs and subsidence values among mining areas, coal fire areas, and areas with both mining and coal fires. The results verify the applicability and reliability of the proposed method.

TI  - Simulating the Changes of Invasive <i>Phragmites australis</i> in a Pristine Wetland Complex with a Grey System Coupled System Dynamic Model: A Remote Sensing Practice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasion has been one of the reasons that coastal wetlands gradually lose their ecological services. The current study investigates the spread of a commonly found invasive species in coastal wetlands in Northeastern US, the Phragmites australis. Within a relatively pristine wetland complex in coastal New Jersey, we collected high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images for eight years (2011-2018), in both winter and summer seasons. The land cover/land use status in this wetland complex is relatively simple, contains only five identifiable vegetation covers and water. Applying high accuracy machine learning algorithms, we are able to classify the land use/land cover in the complex and use the classified images as the basis for the grey system coupled system dynamics simulative model. The simulative model produces land use land cover change in the wetland complex for the next 25 years. Results suggest that Phragmites australis will increase in coverage in the future, despite the stable intensity of anthropogenic activities. The wetland complex could lose its essential ecological services to serve as an exchange spot for nekton species from the sea.

TI  - Global Pattern of Ecosystem Respiration Tendencies and Its Implications on Terrestrial Carbon Sink Potential
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest component of carbon export from terrestrial ecosystems, ecosystem respiration (RECO), together with vegetation productivity, determines the carbon stock changes in terrestrial ecosystems, so it is crucial to reveal the response of RECO to climate change. However, the simulation of RECO is usually inaccurate due to the neglect of the lagged response of respiration to changes in water conditions. In this study, we integrated meteorological data, remote sensing data, and soil data, and introduced the indicators of the previous water conditions into the deep learning model to simulate RECO. The conclusions are as follows: (a) There is a 1-2 years' lagged response of RECO to changes in water conditions. (b) It is necessary to consider the influence of previous water conditions when simulate RECO. It not only improved the simulation accuracy of RECO, but also reflected its inter-annual fluctuations and change trends more accurately, avoiding the underestimation of RECO inter-annual fluctuations. (c) There is an inconsistency in carbon input and carbon output change trends which impacts the carbon sink pattern and potential of terrestrial ecosystems. The growth trend of Gross Primary Production (GPP) in global terrestrial ecosystems is greater than that of RECO, with a trend of increasing carbon sinks, especially in the northern extra-tropics; while the carbon sink capacity of tropical regions has gradually saturated, showing that the change trend of RECO is close to that of GPP, which poses a potential risk to the sustainable carbon sink capacity of global ecosystems in the future.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qilian Mountains (QLMs) has functioned as an ecological barrier area; water connotation area; priority area for biodiversity conservation; practice area; bearing area; and demonstration area for the construction of ecological civilization in China; and its ecological function and demonstration role cannot be ignored. To investigate the response of vegetation to climate change and human activities, the GIMMS NDVI3g, MODIS NDVI, meteorological data, and nighttime light data were analyzed using Theil-Sen trend analysis, Mann-Kendall significance test, Hurst index, and correlation analysis to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics and trends of vegetation in the QLMs from 1982 to 2020. The results show that from 1982 to 2020, the NDVI in the QLMs showed an increasing trend in the interannual, growing season (0.0011/a), and through the four seasons-spring (0.0003/a), summer (0.0015/a), autumn (0.0007/a), and winter; and demonstrated a high spatial pattern in the southeast and low spatial pattern in the northwest. The NDVI showed a gradual increase in the improved area (46.43% -* 79.32%), a gradual decrease in the unchanged area (50.81% -* 18.23%), and a stable degraded area (2.76% -* 2.45%), but the distribution of the degraded area shifted from the northern part of Daxue Mountain to the Qinghai Lake and Datong River basin, and the intersection of Qinghai South Mountain and Laji Mountain. Additionally, the vegetation cover was not persistent, and the area of unclear future was more than half and distributed in the central and western parts of the QLMs, with obvious anti-sustainability characteristics. Temperature was the dominant climatic factor for vegetation growth in the QLMs, and from the spatial distribution, the area controlled by temperature (63.81%) was significantly higher than that controlled by precipitation (29.95%). On a temporal scale, NDVI during spring, autumn, and winter was positively correlated with the temperature and negatively correlated with precipitation; and vegetation growth was influenced by temperature for a longer period of time during the year. NDVI has an obvious lagging effect on climate change, with a maximum response to temperature and precipitation lagging by approximately 2-3 months and 0-1 month, respectively. Human activities have both promoting and inhibiting effects on vegetation. In human activity areas, NDVI shows an increasing trend, and the ecological environment is improving annually.

T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the geomorphological and geochemical investigation of the water bodies on the Samoylov and Kurunghnakh Islands, the Lena River delta. We used GIS-analyze analysis for identifying water body groups, depending on their geomorphological features. The studied water bodies are located on two principally different surfaces: the first and the third terraces of the Lena Delta. The water bodies occupy thermokarst hollow bottoms, which have various elevations above sea level. We identified the altitudes of the water bodies' water surfaces by analysing with ArcticDEM. Additionally, we estimated the area of the water bodies by hand after mapping the borders of the water bodies in UAV imageries. We sampled the bottom sediments and water's chemical composition. All water bodies were divided into groups: (1) small water bodies on the Yedoma upland surface; (2) water bodies in six thermokarst hollows; (3) water bodies on the first terrace. The water bodies bottom sediments on the Yedoma are depleted by the As and enriched by the Zn and Mo in comparison with sediments of other groups. The Rare Earth Elements concentrations in the bottom sediments of Yedoma water bodies and several water bodies on poorly degraded surfaces of the third terrace are lower than in other water bodies, except La.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental pollution is one of the most significant issues in industrial regions. Land snails are commonly used as suitable organisms to monitor environmental pollution. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the effects of anthropogenic pollution on biochemical biomarkers in land snails, Cantareus aspersus. Snails were obtained from four sites of northeastern Algeria, namely El-Hadaiek, Azzaba, Ben-Azzouz (Skikda city) and El-Kala (El-Taref city). The sites of Skikda city were selected in this study because of their proximity to industrial factories, while the El-Kala site was used as a reference site (control site) for its far location from pollution sources. Moreover, the enzymatic activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the three energy reserves (glycogens, lipids and proteins) were measured in the digestive gland of snails collected from each site during the winter and spring seasons. The results revealed a significant variation in the AChE activity and energy reserves between sites and seasons, along with significant correlations between the enzymatic and non-enzymatic biomarkers. The highest activity of GST and total proteins were observed during spring in snails of Azzaba site, identified as the closest site to potential pollution sources. In addition, AChE activity was significantly decreased during spring, as well as depletion of lipid and glycogen contents with the highest values was recorded in the site of Azzaba. Conclusively, the land snails, C. aspersus are proven as sentinel organisms effectively used in biomonitoring of terrestrial environment in Skikda region.

TI  - Distribution and Structure Analysis of Mountain Permafrost Landscape in Orulgan Ridge (Northeast Siberia) Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of the landscape spatial structure and diversity in the mountain ranges of Northeast Siberia is essential to assess how tundra and boreal landscapes may respond to climate change and anthropogenic impacts in the vast mountainous permafrost of the Arctic regions. In addition, a precise landscape map is required for knowledge-based territorial planning and management. In this article, we aimed to explore and enhanced methods to analyse and map the permafrost landscape in Orulgan Ridge. The Google Earth Engine cloud platform was used to generate vegetation cover maps based on multi-fusion classification of Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI time series data. Phenological features based on the monthly median values of time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) were used to recognize geobotanical units according to the hierarchical concept of permafrost landscapes by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, geomorphological variables of megarelief (mountains and river valleys) were identified using the GIS-based terrain analysis and landform classification of the ASTER GDEM scenes mosaic. The resulting environmental variables made it possible to categorize nine classes of mountain permafrost landscapes. The result obtained was compared with previous permafrost landscape maps, which revealed a significant difference in distribution and spatial structure of intrazonal valleys and mountain tundra landscapes. Analysis of the landscape structure revealed a significant distribution of classes of mountain Larix-sparse forests and tundra. Landscape diversity was described by six longitudinal and latitudinal landscape hypsometric profiles. River valleys allow boreal-taiga landscapes to move up to high-mountainous regions. The features of the landscape structure and diversity of the ridge are noted, which, along with the specific spatial organization of vegetation and relief, can be of key importance for environmental monitoring and the study of regional variability of climatic changes.

TI  - A novel full-polarization SAR image ship detector based on scattering mechanisms and wave polarization anisotropy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is suitable for earth observation due to its unique advantages. In this study, we constructed an adaptive ship detector using full-polarization SAR images. First, we thoroughly investigated the differences in scattering characteristics between ships, their background, and the wave polarization anisotropy. We then constructed a novel ship detector that incorporates scattering and anisotropy (known as joint scattering-anisotropy [joint-SA]). We found that joint-SA is an effective physical quantity representing the difference between the ship and its background; thus, joint-SA can be used for ship detection using full-polarization image data. Second, we used generalized gamma distribution to characterize joint-SA statistics of sea clutter with a large homogeneity range. Third, an adaptive constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method was implemented based on joint-SA. Finally, RADARSAT-2 and GF-3 data in the C-band and ALOS data in the L-band were used for verification. We tested five datasets, and the experimental results verified the correctness and superiority of the CFAR method based on joint-SA. The results show that the signal-clutter ratio of the proposed ship detector (33.17 dB, 35.98 dB, and 57.25 dB) was higher than that of DBSP (8.92 dB, 3.43 dB, and 25.40 dB) and RsDVH (17.28 dB, 11.17 dB, and 54.55 dB). Furthermore, the proposed detector has a higher detection accuracy and lower false alarm rate than those of the other two other methods.

TI  - A New Method for Calculating Water Quality Parameters by Integrating Space-Ground Hyperspectral Data and Spectral-In Situ Assay Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective integration of aerial remote sensing data and ground multi-source data has always been one of the difficulties of quantitative remote sensing. A new monitoring mode is designed, which installs the hyperspectral imager on the UAV and places a buoy spectrometer on the river. Water samples are collected simultaneously to obtain in situ assay data of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, COD, turbidity, and chlorophyll during data collection. The cross-correlogram spectral matching (CCSM) algorithm is used to match the data of the buoy spectrometer with the UAV spectral data to significantly reduce the UAV data noise. An absorption characteristics recognition algorithm (ACR) is designed to realize a new method for comparing UAV data with laboratory data. This method takes into account the spectral characteristics and the correlation characteristics of test data synchronously. It is concluded that the most accurate water quality parameters can be calculated by using the regression method under five scales after the regression tests of the multiple linear regression method (MLR), support vector machine method (SVM), and neural network (NN) method. This new working mode of integrating spectral imager data with point spectrometer data will become a trend in water quality monitoring.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice in Complex Landscapes with Landsat Time Series Data and Superpixel-Based Deep Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial pattern and temporal variation in paddy rice areas captured by remote sensing imagery provide an effective way of performing crop management and developing suitable agricultural policies. However, fragmented and scattered rice paddies due to undulating and varied topography, and the availability and quality of remote sensing images (e.g., frequent cloud coverage) pose significant challenges to accurate long-term rice mapping, especially for traditional pixel and phenological methods in subtropical monsoon regions. This study proposed a superpixel and deep-learning-based time series method to analyze Landsat time series data for paddy rice classification in complex landscape regions. First, a superpixel segmentation map was generated using a dynamic-time-warping-based simple non-iterative clustering algorithm with preprocessed spectral indices (SIs) time series data. Second, the SI images were overlaid onto the superpixel map to construct mean SIs time series for each superpixel. Third, a multivariate long short-term memory full convolution neural network (MLSTM-FCN) classifier was employed to learn time series features of rice paddies to produce accurate paddy rice maps. The method was evaluated using Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020 in Cengong County, Guizhou Province, China. Results indicate that the superpixel MLSTM-FCN achieved a high performance with an overall accuracy varying from 0.9547 to 0.9721, which presents an 0.17-1.23% improvement compared to the random forest method. This study showed that combining spectral, spatial, and temporal features with deep learning methods can generate accurate paddy rice maps in complex landscape regions.

TI  - Reflectance Anisotropy from MODIS for Albedo Retrieval from a Single Directional Reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance anisotropy and insufficient multi-angular observations are the main challenges in albedo estimation from satellite observations. Numerous studies have been developed for albedo retrieval from a single directional reflectance by associating the anisotropy information extracted from coarse-resolution bidirectional-reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data. The contribution of land-cover type (LCT) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in distinguishing reflectance anisotropy in these methods remains controversial. This study first proposed an approach to extracting a priori BRDF (F) from the MODIS BRDF/albedo product by considering the distribution characteristics of the model parameters. LCT- and NDVI-based F were also extracted from the corresponding subset. Then, the F-based albedo was derived from simulated or satellite directional reflectance and the anisotropic information of F. Finally, the directional reflectance and F-based albedo were compared with the MODIS albedo or ground measurement, in order to show the ability of F to compensate for the effect of reflectance anisotropy in the albedo retrieval process. The method was fully validated by the global and time-series MODIS BRDF data. The results showed that reflectance anisotropy has an aggregated distribution pattern, and F can represent the reflectance anisotropy of most pixels within a tile. The improvement of LCT and NDVI only occurs when the tile contains a large area of vegetated and barren ground. With the exception of the hotspot and large viewing-zenith-angle area in the forward hemisphere, the F-based shortwave albedo has high consistency with the MODIS albedo product. A comparison with the ground measurements and MODIS albedo showed that the F-based albedo from a single directional reflectance generally achieves an absolute accuracy requirement, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.027 and 0.036.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection with Dual-Polarimetric Sentinel-1 SAR Using Superpixel-Level Image Stretching and Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely applied in oil spill detection on the sea surface due to the advantages of wide area coverage, all-weather operation, and multi-polarization characteristics. Sentinel-1 satellites can provide dual-polarized SAR data, and they have high potential for successful application to oil spill detection. However, the characteristics of the sea surface and oil film on different images are not the same when imaging at different locations and in different conditions, which leads to the inconsistent accuracy of these images with the application of the current oil spill detection methods. In order to avoid the above limitation, we propose an oil spill detection method using image stretching based on superpixels and a convolutional neural network. Experiments were carried out on eight Sentinel-1 dual-pol data, and the optimal superpixel number and image stretching parameters are discussed. Mean intersection over union (MIoU) was used to evaluate classification accuracy. The proposed method could effectively improve the classification accuracy; when the expansion and inhibition coefficients of image stretching were set to 1.6 and 1.2 respectively, the experiments achieved a maximum MIoU of 85.4%, 7.3% higher than that without image stretching.

TI  - Extraction of Urban Built-Up Area Based on Deep Learning and Multi-Sources Data Fusion-The Application of an Emerging Technology in Urban Planning
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid expansion of urban built-up areas in recent years, it has become particularly urgent to develop a fast, accurate and popularized urban built-up area extraction method system. As the direct carrier of urban regional relationship, urban built-up area is an important reference to judge the level of urban development. The accurate extraction of urban built-up area plays an important role in formulating scientific planning thus to promote the healthy development of both urban area and rural area. Although nighttime light (NTL) data are used to extract urban built-up areas in previous studies, there are certain shortcomings in using NTL data to extract urban built-up areas. On the other hand, point of interest (POI) data and population migration data represent different attributes in urban space, which can both assist in modifying the deficiencies of NTL data from both static and dynamic spatial elements, respectively, so as to improve the extraction accuracy of urban built-up areas. Therefore, this study attempts to propose a feasible method to modify NTL data by fusing Baidu migration (BM) data and POI data thus accurately extracting urban built-up areas in Guangzhou. More accurate urban built-up areas are extracted using the method of U-net deep learning network. The maximum built-up area extracted from the study is 1103.45 km(2), accounting for 95.21% of the total built-up area, and the recall rate is 0.8905, the precision rate is 0.8121, and the F1 score is 0.8321. The results of using POI data and BM data to modify NTL data to extract built-up areas have not been significantly improved due to the fact that the more data get fused, the more noise there would be, which would ultimately affect the results. This study analyzes the feasibility and insufficiency of using big data to modify NTL data through data fusion and feature extraction system, which has important theoretical and practical significance for future studies on urban built-up areas and urban development.

TI  - Bayesian Aerosol Retrieval-Based PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimation through Hierarchical Gaussian Process Models
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) data are widely used to estimate land surface PM2.5 concentrations in areas not covered by ground PM2.5 monitoring stations. However, AOD data obtained from satellites are typically at coarse spatial resolutions, limiting their applications on small or medium scales. In this paper, we propose a new two-step approach to estimate 1-km-resolution PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai using high spatial resolution AOD retrievals from MODIS. In the first step, AOD data are refined to a 1 x 1 km(2) resolution via a Bayesian AOD retrieval method. In the second step, a hierarchical Gaussian process model is used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. We evaluate our approach by model fitting and out-of-sample cross-validation. Our results show that the proposed approach enjoys accurate predictive performance in estimating PM2.5 concentrations.

TI  - Negative Associations between Quality of Urban Green Spaces and Health Expenditures in Downtown Shanghai
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The health-beneficial value of urban green spaces (UGS) is increasingly accepted by scholars. However, compared to the large number of studies focused on UGS-health associations, whether UGS in high-density cities could reduce public health expenditures remains less investigated. In particular, few studies have examined the association of UGS quality with health expenditures. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study in downtown Shanghai to examine such associations. A population-based household survey (n = 1000) was conducted to collect relevant information about different aspects of health expenditure and the characteristics of UGS. Specifically, a new method was proposed to measure UGS quality based on the supply-demand of 20 types of UGS activities. We also measured the perceived quality of different types of UGS and quantified the amount of UGS using GIS based on remote sensing data. Regression models were applied for statistical analysis. The results showed that both UGS quality based on user needs and perceived UGS quality have a significant negative association with total health expenditures. This study provides insights for UGS quality measurement, contributes to the understanding of the health-related economic benefits of UGS, and also highlights the importance of UGS optimization in high-density urban areas.

TI  - Data-Free Area Detection and Evaluation for Marine Satellite Data Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainty verification of satellite ocean color products and the bias analysis of multiple data are both indispensable in the evaluation of ocean color products. Incidentally, ocean color products often have missing information that causes the methods mentioned above to be difficult to evaluate these data effectively. We propose an analysis and evaluation method based on data-free area. The objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of ocean color products with respect to information integrity and continuity. First, we use an improved Spectral Angle Mapper, also called ISAM. It can automatically obtain the optimal threshold value for each class of objects. Then, based on ISAM, we perform spectral information mining on first-level Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea data obtained from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI). In this manner, quantitative results of information related to data-free areas of ocean data products are obtained. The findings indicate that the product data of OLCI are optimal with respect to both completeness and continuity. GOCI and MODIS have striking similarities in their quantitative or visualization results for both evaluation metrics. Moreover, a concomitant phenomenon of ocean-covered objects is apparent in the data-free area with temporal and spatial distribution characteristics. The two characteristics are subsequently explored for further analysis. The evaluation method adopted in this study can help to enrich the content of ocean color product evaluation, facilitate the research of cloud detection algorithms and further understand the composition of the data-free regional information of marine data products. The method proposed in this study has a wide application value.

TI  - Identification of Urban Agglomeration Spatial Range Based on Social and Remote-Sensing Data-For Evaluating Development Level of Urban Agglomeration
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification of urban agglomeration spatial area is helpful in understanding the internal spatial relationship under urban expansion and in evaluating the development level of urban agglomeration. Previous studies on the identification of spatial areas often ignore the functional distribution and development of urban agglomerations by only using nighttime light data (NTL). In this study, a new method is firstly proposed to identify the accurate spatial area of urban agglomerations by fusing night light data (NTL) and point of interest data (POI); then an object-oriented method is used by this study to identify the spatial area, finally the identification results obtained by different data are verified. The results show that the accuracy identified by NTL data is 82.90% with the Kappa coefficient of 0.6563, the accuracy identified by POI data is 81.90% with the Kappa coefficient of 0.6441, and the accuracy after data fusion is 90.70%, with the Kappa coefficient of 0.8123. The fusion of these two kinds of data has higher accuracy in identifying the spatial area of urban agglomeration, which can play a more important role in evaluating the development level of urban agglomeration; this study proposes a feasible method and path for urban agglomeration spatial area identification, which is not only helpful to optimize the spatial structure of urban agglomeration, but also to formulate the spatial development policy of urban agglomeration.

TI  - Analysis of the water color transitional change in Qinghai Lake during the past 35 years observed from Landsat and MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Qinghai Lake, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China Study focus: Water color has been recognized as an essential climate variable for lakes and oceans. Forel-Ule index (FUI), as one representative water color quantization parameter, is a useful indicator that shows water turbidity variations in lakes. In this study, the time series of FUI images were constructed for Qinghai Lake, the largest salt water lake in China, from 1986 to 2020 based on Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The multi-source satellite data were first evaluated and compared with regard to the derivation of FUI; then, the spatial and temporal variations of water color in Qinghai Lake and its driving forces were analyzed. New hydrological insights for the region: The results revealed that the FUI showed a significant decreasing trend in Qinghai Lake from 1986 to 2004 and a significant increasing trend from 2004 to 2020, which temporally coincided with the water level variations in Qinghai Lake. The water level, water temperature, precipitation, and runoff were strongly correlated with the changes of FUI (correlation coefficients of 0.65-0.78). The substantial increases in precipitation and water temperature after 2004 can be the major causes for the transitional increase of water color in Qinghai Lake. This reflects one response mode of water quality in lakes to climate change.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based 500 m Spatio-Temporally Continuous Air Temperature Generation by Fusing Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The all-weather high-resolution air temperature data is crucial for understanding the urban thermal conditions with their spatio-temporal characteristics, driving factors, socio-economic and environmental consequences. In this study, we developed a novel 5-layer Deep Belief Network (DBN) deep learning model to fuse multi-source data and then generated air temperature data with 3H characteristics: High resolution, High spatio-temporal continuity (spatially seamless and temporally continuous), and High accuracy simultaneously. The DBN model was developed and applied for two different urban regions: Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WMA) in China, and Austin, Texas, USA. The model has a excellent ability to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between temperature and different predictive variables. After various adjustments to the model structure and different combinations of input variables, the daily 500-m air temperature in Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WMA) was initially generated by fusing remote sensing, reanalysis and in situ measurement products. The ten-fold cross-validation results indicated that the DBN model achieved promising results with the RMSE of 1.086 degrees C, MAE of 0.839 degrees C, and R-2 of 0.986. Compared with conventional data fusion algorithms, the DBN model also exhibited better performance. In addition, the detailed evaluation of the model on spatial and temporal scales proved the advantages of using DBN model to generate 3H temperature data. The spatial transferability of the model was tested by conducting a validation experiment for Austin, USA. In general, the results and fine-scale analyses show that the employed framework is effective to generate 3H temperature, which is valuable for urban climate and urban heat island research.

TI  - ZY-1 02D Hyperspectral Imagery Super-Resolution via Endmember Matrix Constraint Unmixing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an endmember matrix constraint unmixing method for ZY-1 02D hyperspectral imagery (HSI) super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) to overcome the low resolution of ZY-1 02D HSI. The proposed method combines spectral unmixing and adds novel smoothing constraints to traditional non-negative matrix factorization to improve details and preserve the spectral information of traditional SRR methods. The full utilization of the endmember spectral matrix and endmember abundance matrix of HSI and multispectral imagery (MSI) reconstructs the high spatial resolution and high spectral fidelity HSI. Furthermore, given the ZY-1 02D HSI infrared bands are seriously corrupted by noise, the influence of denoising on the SRR accuracy is also discussed. Experiments show that the proposed method restores spatial details and spectral information and is robust for noise, preserving more spectral information. Therefore, the proposed method is a ZY-1 02D HSI SRR method with high spatial resolution and high spectral fidelity, which improves the spatial resolution while simultaneously solving spectral mixing and provides the possibility for the data further expansion.

TI  - Forest Damage by Super Typhoon Rammasun and Post-Disturbance Recovery Using Landsat Imagery and the Machine-Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon Rammasun landed on the southern coastal region of Guangdong and Hainan Provinces on 18 July 2014, and is the strongest recorded typhoon since the 1970s in China. It caused enormous losses in human lives, property, and crop yields in two provinces; however, its impact on forests and subsequent recovery has not yet been assessed. Here we detected forest damage area and severity from Typhoon Rammasun using Landsat 8 OLI imagery, the Random Forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm, and univariate image differencing (UID) methods, and the controlling factors on damage severity and canopy greenness recovery were further analyzed. The accuracy evaluations against sample plot data indicated that the RF approach can more accurately detect the affected forest area and damage severity than the UID-based methods, with higher overall accuracy (94%), Kappa coefficient (0.92), and regression coefficient (R-2 = 0.81; p < 0.01). The affected forest area in Guangdong and Hainan was 13,556 km(2) and 3914 km(2), accounting for 13.8% and 18.5% total forest area, respectively. The highest affected forest fractions reached 70% in some cities or counties. The proportions of severe damage category accounted for 20.85% and 21.31% of all affected forests in Guangdong and Hainan, respectively. Our study suggests that increasing tree density and choosing less sensitive tree species would reduce damage from typhoons in vulnerable areas such as fringe, scattered, and high-slope forests. The canopy greenness of damaged forests recovered rapidly within three months for both provinces; however, management strategies should still be applied in the severely damaged areas to sustain forest functions since the persistent forest canopy structure and biomass may require a longer time to recover.

TI  - Associations between nighttime light and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the United States
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 has caused almost 770,000 deaths in the United States by November 2021. The nighttime light (NTL), representing the intensity of human activities, may reflect the degree of human contacts and therefore the in-tensity of COVID-19 transmission. This study intended to assess the associations between NTL differences and COVID-19 incidence and mortality among U.S. counties. The COVID-19 data of U.S. counties as of 31 December 2020 were collected. The average NTL values for each county in 2019 and 2020 were derived from satellite data. A negative binomial mixed model was adopted to assess the relationships between NTL intensity and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Compared to the counties with the lowest NTL level (0.14-0.37 nW/cm2/sr), those with the highest NTL level (1.78-59.61 nW/cm2/sr) were related with 15% higher mortality rates (mortality rate ratio:1.15, 95 %CI: 1.02-1.30, p-value: 0.02) and 23% higher incidence rates (incidence rate ratio:1.23, 95 %CI: 1.13-1.34, p-value < 0.0001). Our study suggested that more intensive NTL was related with higher incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19, and NTL had a stronger correlation with the COVID-19 incidence rate than mortality rate. Our findings have contributed solid epidemiological evidence to the existing COVID-19 knowl-edge pool, and would help policymakers develop interventions when faced with the potential risk of the following outbreaks.

TI  - Cloudformer V2: Set Prior Prediction and Binary Mask Weighted Network for Cloud Detection
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is an essential step in optical remote sensing data processing. With the development of deep learning technology, cloud detection methods have made remarkable progress. Among them, researchers have started to try to introduce Transformer into cloud detection tasks due to its excellent performance in image semantic segmentation tasks. However, the current Transformer-based methods suffer from training difficulty and low detection accuracy of small clouds. To solve these problems, this paper proposes Cloudformer V2 based on the previously proposed Cloudformer. For the training difficulty, Cloudformer V2 uses Set Attention Block to extract intermediate features as Set Prior Prediction to participate in supervision, which enables the model to converge faster. For the detection of small clouds, Cloudformer V2 decodes the features by a multi-scale Transformer decoder, which uses multi-resolution features to improve the modeling accuracy. In addition, a binary mask weighted loss function (BW Loss) is designed to construct weights by counting pixels classified as clouds; thus, guiding the network to focus on features of small clouds and improving the overall detection accuracy. Cloudformer V2 is experimented on the dataset from GF-1 satellite and has excellent performance.

TI  - Spatial Expansion and Correlation of Urban Agglomeration in the Yellow River Basin Based on Multi-Source Nighttime Light Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese government proposed a major national strategy for ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin. The Framework of the Plan for Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development of the Yellow River Basin proposes building a dynamic development pattern characterized by "one axis, two regions and five poles" in the Yellow River Basin with high-quality and high-standard urban agglomerations along the Yellow River. The urban agglomeration is the economic growth pole of the Yellow River Basin and the main carrier of the population and productivity. This study integrates DMSP/OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System) and NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) night light remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020 and uses methods such as spatial expansion measurement, the center of gravity offset, urban primacy, and the gravity model to study the spatial expansion and correlation characteristics of five urban agglomerations. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, urban agglomeration in the Yellow River Basin continued to expand, and the area increased by 6.4 times. The total amount of nighttime lights in the city presents a spatial distribution pattern that is high in the east and low in the west. (2) The expansion centers of the five major urban agglomerations all shifted. The centers of gravity of the Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration, the Jiziwan urban agglomeration of the Yellow River, the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration, and the Lanzhou-Xining urban agglomeration all shifted westward, while the center of gravity of the Central Plains urban agglomeration shifted to the southeast. (3) Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Xi'an and Lanzhou are the primate cities of the four urban agglomerations of the Shandong Peninsula, Central Plains, Guanzhong Plain, and Lanzhou-Xining, respectively. The primate city in the Jiziwan urban agglomeration of the Yellow River was changed from Taiyuan to Yinchuan and then to Yulin. (4) The density of the gravitational network of the urban agglomeration in the Yellow River Basin and the distribution of the maximum gravitational line show the spatial differentiation characteristics of being dense in the east and sparse in the west.

TI  - Recognition and Changes Analysis of Complex Planting Patterns Based Time Series Landsat and Sentinel-2 Images in Jianghan Plain, China
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on crop planting patterns is crucial for research on sustainable agriculture, regional resources, and food security. However, existing spatial datasets have few high-precision and wide-range planting pattern maps. The production may be limited by the unbalanced spatiotemporal resolution, insufficient massive field sample data, low local computer processing speed, and other factors. To overcome these limitations, we proposed semi-automatic expansion and spatiotemporal migration strategies for sample points and performed a pixel-and-phenology-based random forest algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform to generate crop planting pattern maps at high spatiotemporal resolution by integrating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 time series image data. In this study, we report planting pattern maps for 2017-2021 at a 10-m spatial resolution of the Jianghan Plain, including six crops and nine planting patterns, with an overall accuracy of 84-94% and a kappa coefficient of 0.80-0.93. The spatiotemporal distribution is driven by multiple factors, such as subjectivity and social economy. This research indicates that the proposed approach is effective for mapping large-scale planting patterns and can be readily applied to other regions.

TI  - Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals a New Class of Melanocytic Neoplasms With Hybrid Genomic Features of PEM Including Protein Kinase R 1 Alpha Gene Inactivation and Spitz Tumor-Defining Protein Kinase Fusions
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM) is a subtype of melanocytic tumor with frequent involvement of the sentinel lymph node but rare distant metastasis. Rendering a diagnosis and prognosis based on histology can be challenging. Recent genomic studies identified 2 molecular variants of PEM. One variant is characterized by the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and inactivation of the PRKAR1a gene. The other is associated with genomic fusions involving the protein kinase C (PRKC) gene family. Objective: We investigated the molecular and clinicopathologic features of previously unreported PEM cases to improve tumor classification and report new classes of PEM. Methods: Next-generation sequencing and histomorphologic assessment was performed on 13 PEM cases. Results: We identified 2 novel PEM classes. Three cases harbored PRKAR1a inactivation and genomic fusions (ALK, NTRK, and MAP3K8). These tumors had overlapping histologic features with pigmented Spitz neoplasms. Three cases had genomic fusions involving PRKCB. These cases had overlapping features with PRKCA fusions but, in 2 cases, had a notable spindle cell component. Limitations: The overall sample size and amount of clinical follow-up is limited, leaving some uncertainty regarding the expected clinical course of these novel cases. Conclusions: PRKAR1a-inactivated/Spitz fusion-associated PEMs and PRKCB fusion-associated PEMs represent 2 new molecular classes of PEM.

TI  - The Classification of Reflectance Anisotropy and Its Application in Albedo Retrieval
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface albedo reflects the ability of the surface to reflect solar radiation and is a critical physical variable in the study of the Earth's energy budget and global climate change. Algorithms for the retrieval of albedo usually require multi-angle measurements due to surface anisotropy. However, most of the satellites cannot currently provide sufficient and well-distributed observations; therefore, the accuracy of remotely sensed albedo is constrained. Based on the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo product (MCD43A1), this study proposed a method to further subdivide reflectance anisotropy and build an updated database of BRDF archetype, using both the Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) and Perpendicular Anisotropic Flat Index (PAFX). The BRDF archetypes were used to fit the corresponding MODIS BRDF, and the optimal number of BRDF archetype categories was determined according to the tendency of fitting error. The effect of surface anisotropy and observation noise on albedo retrieval were explored based on simulated MODIS reflectance. Finally, the BRDF archetype A2P2 was taken as prior knowledge to retrieve albedo from a different number of MODIS observations, and the result was validated by the high-quality MODIS albedo product. The results show that the fitting error between BRDF archetypes and MODIS BRDF shows a rapid decline when introducing the PAFX in the classification process. A 3-by-3 matrix of BRDF archetypes, which occupy 73.44% and 70.13% of the total decline in the red and NIR band, can be used to represent the characteristics of reflectance anisotropy. The archetype A2P2 may be used as prior knowledge to improve the albedo retrieval from insufficient observations. The validation results based on MODIS observations show that the archetype A2P2-based albedo can reach root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of no more than 0.03.

TI  - Snow Cover Phenology Change and Response to Climate in China during 2000-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover phenology (SCP) is critical to the climate system. China has the most comprehensive snow cover distribution in the middle and low latitudes and has shown dramatic changes over the past few decades. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of SCP parameters and their sensitivity to meteorological factors (temperature and precipitation) under different conditions (altitude, snow cover classification, or season) in China are insufficiently studied. Therefore, using improved daily MODIS cloud-gap-filled (CGF) snow-cover-extent (SCE) products, the spatiotemporal characteristics (distribution and variation) and respond to climate of snow cover area (SCA), snow cover start (SCS), snow cover melt (SCM), and snow cover days (SCD) are explored from 2000 to 2020. The results show that in the past 20 years, snow cover in China has demonstrated a trend of decreasing SCA, decreasing SCD, advancing SCS, and advancing SCM, with SCM advancing faster than SCS. The greatest snowfall occurs in January, mainly in northeastern China, northern Xinjiang, and the Tibet Plateau. Spatially, the slope of SCP was mainly within +/- 0.5 day/year (d/y) Statistics indicated that the area proportion where SCD is significantly reduced is greater than increased; SCD, SCS, and SCM are shortened or advanced in three snow-covered area classifications. Moreover, compared with precipitation, the significantly correlated regions (6-47.2% more than precipitation) and correlation degree (1.23-8.33 times precipitation in significantly correlated snow cover classification) between temperature and SCP in different seasons are larger. For stable snow-covered areas (SSA), SCD are mainly affected by spring temperature below 1500 m and mainly by autumn temperature above 1500 m; the precipitation is more affected in autumn. The correlation of SCP with temperature and precipitation has obvious spatial and seasonal differences and shows characteristic variation with altitude. These results can provide important data support for climate prediction, hydrological research, and disaster warning.

TI  - Identifying Urban Functional Regions from High-Resolution Satellite Images Using a Context-Aware Segmentation Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic identification of urban functional regions (UFRs) is crucial for urban planning and management. A key issue involved in URF classification is to properly determine the basic functional units, for which popular practices are usually based upon existing land use boundaries or road networks. Such practices suffer from the unavailability of existing datasets, leading to difficulty in large-scale mapping. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a method to automatically obtain functional units for URF classification using high-resolution remote sensing images. We develop a context-aware segmentation network to simultaneously extract buildings and road networks from remote sensing images. The extracted road networks are used for partitioning functional units, upon which five main building types are distinguished considering building height, morphology, and geometry. Finally, the UFRs are classified according to the distribution of building types. We conducted experiments using a GaoFen-2 satellite image with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m acquired in Fuzhou, China. Experimental results showed that the proposed segmentation network performed better than other convolutional neural network segmentation methods (i.e., PSPNet, Deeplabv3+, DANet, and JointNet), with an increase of F1-score up to 1.37% and 1.19% for road and building extraction, respectively. Results also showed that the residential regions, accounting for most of the urban areas, identified by the proposed method had a user accuracy of 94%, implying the promise of the proposed method for deriving the spatial units and the types of urban functional regions.

TI  - A Multitemporal and Multilevel Land Surface Temperature Regional Attribute Change Analysis in Henan, China, Using MODIS Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is an important aspect of land-atmosphere studies and plays a key role in urban environmental change. With the continuous development of satellite remote sensing sensors, remote sensing technology has become an important means of obtaining large-scale land surface temperature (LST) data. LST can be calculated from the thermal infrared band data of remote sensing images to analyze changes in temperature and determine its relationship with the surface type. In this study, a multitemporal multilevel (MTML) method for analyzing remotely sensed LST data is presented that analyzes attribute changes and correlations of remotely sensed LST data in different periods and at different temperature levels. First, the LST data were obtained under the same climatic conditions at different times, and the influence of climatic conditions on the LST data was excluded. Threshold superposition analysis was then performed on the temperature data to generate temperature-connected regions of different levels, and a tree structure was constructed. Each node in the tree structure represented a connected region. Finally, the attribute information of different connected regions at different levels was calculated, and the attribute changes and correlations between different times and levels were analyzed. In this study, five MODIS LST datasets from 15 May 2006, 1 May 2010, 7 May 2014, 29 April 2017, and 8 May 2021 in Henan Province of China were obtained, and MTML analysis was carried out. The experimental results showed that a negative correlation exists between temperature and the vegetation index, while a positive correlation exists between temperature and the built-up index. However, with an increase in the temperature level, the correlation between temperature and the surface feature type index decreased. In addition, there were more concentrated high-temperature areas in the northern, central, and western regions of Henan Province and lower temperatures in the eastern and southern regions.

TI  - Rapid and Automated Mapping of Crop Type in Jilin Province Using Historical Crop Labels and the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change, the remote sensing identification of crops is extremely important for the rapid development of agricultural economy and the detailed assessment of the agro-meteorological disasters. The Jilin Province is the main grain production area in China, with a reputation of being a "golden corn belt". The main crops in the Jilin Province are rice, corn, and soybean. A large amount of remote sensing data and programming codes from the Google Earth engine (GEE) platform allow for large-area farmland recognition. However, the substantial amount of crop sample information hinders the mapping of crop types over large farmland areas. To save costs and quickly and accurately map the crop types in a study area, multi-source remote sensing data and historical crop labels based on the GEE platform were used in this study, together with the random forest classification method and optimal feature selection to classify farming areas in the Jilin Province. The research steps were as follows: (1) select samples based on the historical crop layer of the farmland; and (2) obtain the classification characteristics of rice, corn, and soybean using multi-source remote sensing data, calculating the feature importance scores. Using different experimental combinations, an optimal classification method was then selected to classify crops in the Jilin Province. The results indicated variable impacts of vegetation indices (of different periods) on crop classification. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) in June exerted a significant impact on the classification of rice, corn, and soybean, respectively. The overall accuracy of crop classification during different periods based on historical crop labels reached 0.70, which is acceptable in crop classification research. The study results demonstrated that the proposed method has promising potential for mapping large-scale crop areas.

TI  - Integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based photogrammetry and InSAR for mining subsidence and parameters inversion: a case study of the Wangjiata Mine, China
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A method of monitoring the surface mining subsidence basin (SMSB) by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is proposed in this paper. In this method, subsidence with a small deformation gradient was calculated by InSAR, whereas large-scale subsidence was calculated by UAV photogrammetry technology. And then, the two types of data were fused through Kriging interpolation to obtain a complete and high-precision SMSB. Based on this fusion method, the dynamic surface subsidence induced by the mining of the 2S201 working face of Wangjiata coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, was obtained by using the two phases of UAV images collected on June 9, 2018, and September 4, 2018, and the 8 SAR images of Sentinel-1A taken during this period. The results showed that the maximum subsidence extracted by the fusion method was 2.487 m. The accuracy of this method was evaluated by the data of 15 ground observation stations, measured by total station, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of subsidence was 0.095 m. Finally, through the dynamic inversion method of mining subsidence parameters (MSP), a more reliable MSP is acquired, in which q was 0.72 and tan beta was 1.9. UAV/InSAR integration technology provides a new technical approach to solving the monitoring problem of geological environment damage induced by large-scale and high-intensity mining and has a good prospect of application.

TI  - Study on wetland landscape pattern evolution in the Dongping Lake
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland structure evolution is a basis of healthy ecosystem and one of the important indicators for restoration and protection of wetlands. In this paper, based on the Landsat remote sensing images from 1980 to 2020, the wetland structure was extracted by using the supervised classification method in the Dongping Lake. A CA-Markov Model was put forward to set up wetland transfer matrix and to improve the space and quantity of simulation results. The temporal-spatial evolution of the wetland and landscape indicators were studied, and the evolution trend as well as driving forces were analyzed. The studied results show that, in recent years, the wetland landscape pattern transfer were occurred continuously, in which the area of bare land significantly decreased, the infrastructure land use significantly increased, the natural water surface increased gradually. The studied landscape pattern indices show that the wetland landscape evenness index increased, the landscape diversity index tends to be decreased, the degree of wetland landscape fragmentation is basically balanced, but the overall trend is increasing, and the landscape diversity tends to be simple. At present, the area of wild reeds takes the dominant trend in the main wetland area, which accounts for 55% of the total wetland area. The proportion of forest and grass land area accounts for 9%.

TI  - Wetland landscape pattern evolution and prediction in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting from the overall pattern of wetland evolution in the Yellow River Delta, the combination of CA-Markov model and MLP model is studied. Based on the low-medium resolution Landsat data and the field survey data, the evolution trend of wetland landscape pattern in the Yellow River Delta is simulated and predicted by using the proposed models. Taking high resolution (2 m) data in 2016 as the precision verification, the model simulation results are validated. The results show that the area of natural wetlands in the Delta was decreased from 2593.63 km(2) in 1976 to 1639.60 km(2) in 2016, a total area of 954.03 km(2)wasreduced. According to the model simulation, the natural wetland area in 2026 is predicted to be 1252.7 km(2), the constructed wetland area will be 1265.0 km(2), and the non-wetland area will be 924.5 km(2). The constructed wetland in the Yellow River Delta is increasing and spreading into the sea, but the area of natural wetland has been decreasing. If this trend be developed, the national natural wetland conservation target would not be realized. The results are of great significance to the wetland development planning, management and protection in the Yellow River Delta.

TI  - Mapping global urban greenspace: An analysis based on open land-cover data
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greenspace plays a positive role in improving the urban living environment, and thus extensive studies have paid attention to the mapping of urban greenspace for various applications. Recently, open and highresolution land-cover (LC) data have been viewed as essential sources for urban greenspace mapping. However, few studies have performed a global-scale analysis; moreover, as there are commonly different LC types in an LC dataset, few studies have investigated how the definition or selection of different LC types as greenspace impacts urban greenspace mapping. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the spatial pattern of urban greenspace at a global scale and the impact on selecting different LC types for urban greenspace mapping. We employed two global open datasets (FROM-GLC10 and GHS-UCDB) and identified 13,079 global urban areas. Various LC types that potentially relate to urban greenspace and three different selections of LC types were analyzed. Results show that: 1) The spatial pattern of global urban greenspace may vary with the use of different selections; 2) The impact of whether or not to select each LC type as urban greenspace relates to not only the LC type itself but also the geographic locations. The findings may benefit urban planners and designers to select proper LC type(s) for urban greenspace studies.

TI  - Ecological Responses to Climate Change and Human Activities in the Arid and Semi-Arid Regions of Xinjiang in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the impacts and extent of both climate change and human activities on ecosystems is crucial to sustainable development. With low anti-interference ability, arid and semi-arid ecosystems are particularly sensitive to disturbances from both climate change and human activities. We investigated how and to what extent climate variation and human activities influenced major indicators that are related to ecosystem functions and conditions in the past decades in Xinjiang, a typical arid and semi-arid region in China. We analyzed the changing trends of evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP) and leaf area index (LAI) derived from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite product and the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) model in Xinjiang for different climate zones. We separated and quantified the contributions of climate forcing and human activities on the trends of the studied ecosystem indicators using the residual analysis method for different climate zones in Xinjiang. The results show that GPP and LAI increased and ET decreased from 2001 to 2015 in Xinjiang. Factors that dominate the changes in ecosystem indicators vary considerably across different climate zones. Precipitation plays a positive role in impacting vegetation indicators in arid and hyper-arid zones and temperature has a negative correlation with both GPP and LAI in hyper-arid zones in Xinjiang. Results based on residual analysis indicate that human activities could account for over 72% of variation in the changes in each ecosystem indicator. Human activities have large impacts on each vegetation indicator change in hyper-arid and arid zones and their relative contribution has a mean value of 79%. This study quantifies the roles of climate forcing and human activities in the changes in ecosystem indicators across different climate zones, suggesting that human activities largely influence ecosystem processes in the arid and semi-arid regions of Xinjiang in China.

TI  - The Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Ecological Environment Quality in Karst Ecologically Fragile Areas Driven by Poverty Alleviation Resettlement
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scholars are skeptical about the poverty reduction effect and the ecological effect of poverty alleviation resettlement (PAR). This study evaluates the spatial and temporal evolution of the ecological environment quality (EEQ) to analyze the effectiveness of ecological restoration from PAR. Based on cloud computing using the Google Earth Engine platform, remote-sensing data were obtained and reconstructed from 2000 to 2020. The remote-sensing ecological index (RSEI) was used to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of EEQ. The results show that the RSEI of the study area increased by 13.07% after the implementation of PAR, and the rate of increase was higher than that in the period before PAR; the Pu'an and Qinglong areas improved most obviously, in terms of the fragile ecological environment and the prominent contradiction between peasants and land. The residual trends method indicated that the contribution rate of improvement in RSEI due to PAR was 70.56%, 88.38%, and 82.96% in 2017, 2018, and 2020, respectively. An increase in RSEI was more obvious in the area with a greater relocated population and a higher corresponding coupling coordination level. PAR has a promoting effect on EEQ improvement but does not have ecological restoration benefits in every region. It is not satisfactory in terms of the degeneration of the LST indicator and the ecological impact of human wells.

Based on the remote sensing monitoring data of the land use status of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration collected in 2010 and 2020, the spatial differentiation characteristics and influencing factors of land urbanization in the area were analyzed comprehensively using hot spot analysis, kernel density estimation, the multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model and other methods. The results indicated the following: (1) From 2010 to 2020, the average annual growth rate of land urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration was 0.50%, and nearly 64.28% of the counties had an average annual growth rate that lagged behind the overall growth rate. It exhibited dynamic convergence characteristics. (2) The differentiation pattern of land urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration was obvious from the southeast to the northwest. The hot spots of land urbanization were consistently concentrated in the southeastern coastal areas and showed a trend of spreading, while the cold spots were concentrated in the northwest of Anhui Province, showing a shrinking trend. (3) Compared with the GWR model and the OLS model, the MGWR model has a better fitting effect and is more suitable for studying the influencing factors of land urbanization. In addition, there were significant spatial differences in the scale and degree of influence of different influencing factors. Analyzing and revealing the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving mechanism of land urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration has important theoretical value and practical significance for the scientific understanding of new-type urbanization and the implementation of regional integration and rural revitalization strategies.

TI  - Vegetation Greenness Trend in Dry Seasons and Its Responses to Temperature and Precipitation in Mara River Basin, Africa
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mara River Basin of Africa has a world-famous ecosystem with vast vegetation, which is home to many wild animals. However, the basin is experiencing vegetation degradation and bad climate change, which has caused conflicts between people and wild animals, especially in dry seasons. This paper studied the vegetation greenness (VG), vegetation greenness trends (VGT), and their responses to climate change in dry seasons in the Mara River Basin, Africa. Firstly, based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and Sentinel-2 images, the vegetation distribution map of the Mara River Basin was drawn. Then dry seasons MODIS NDVI data (January to February and June to September) were used to analyze the VGT. Finally, a random forest regression algorithm was used to evaluate the response of VG and VGT to temperature and precipitation derived from ERA5 from 2000 to 2019 at a resolution of 250 m. The results showed that the VGT was fluctuating in dry seasons, and the spatial differentiation was obvious. The greenness increasing trends both upstream and downstream were significantly larger than that of in the midstream. The responses of VG to precipitation were almost twice larger than temperature, and the responses of VGT to temperature were about 1.5 times larger than precipitation. The climate change trend of rising temperature and falling precipitation will lead to the degradation of vegetation and the reduction of crop production. There will be a vegetation degradation crisis in dry seasons in the Mara River Basin in the future. Identifying the spatiotemporal changes of VGT in dry seasons will be helpful to understand the response of VG and VGT to climate change and could also provide technical support to cope with climate-change-related issues for the basin.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping with Integrated SBAS-InSAR Technique: A Case Study of Dongchuan District, Yunnan (China)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) are often used by government departments to carry out land use management and planning, which supports decision makers in urban and infrastructure planning. The accuracy of conventional landslide susceptibility maps is often affected by classification errors. Consequently, they become less reliable, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of decision-makers. Therefore, it is proposed in this paper to reduce classification errors and improve LSM reliability by integrating the Small Baseline Subsets-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique and LSM. By using the logistic regression model (LR) and the support vector machine model (SVM), experiments were conducted to generate LSM in the Dongchuan district. It was classified into five classes: very high susceptibility, high susceptibility, medium susceptibility, low susceptibility, and very low susceptibility. Then, the surface deformation rate of the Dongchuan area was obtained through the ascending and descending orbit sentinel-1A data from January 2018 to January 2021. To correct the classification errors, the SBAS-InSAR technique was integrated into LSM under the optimal model by constructing the contingency matrix. Finally, the LSMs obtained before and after correction were compared. Moreover, the correction results were validated and analyzed by combining remote sensing images, InSAR deformation results, and field surveys. According to the research results, the susceptibility class of 66,094 classification error cells (59.48 km(2)) was significantly improved in the LSM after the integration of the SBAS-InSAR correction. The enhanced susceptibility classes and the spectral characteristics of remote sensing images are highly consistent with the trends of InSAR cumulative deformation and the results of field investigation. It is suggested that integrating SBAS-InSAR and LSM is effective in correcting classification errors and further improving the reliability of LSM for landslide prediction. The LSM obtained by using this method plays an important role in guiding local government departments on disaster prevention and mitigation, which is conducive to eliminating the risk of landslides.

TI  - Using an Ensemble Filter to Improve the Representation of Temporal Source Variations in a Volcanic Ash Forecasting System
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of ensemble models to forecast the dispersion and transport of airborne volcanic ash in operational contexts is increasingly being explored. The ensemble members are usually constructed to represent a priori uncertainty estimates in meteorological fields and volcanic ash source parameters. Satellite data can be used to further filter ensemble members within an analysis time window by rejecting poorly performing members, leading to improved forecasts. In this study, the ensemble filtering technique is used to improve the representation of temporal source variations. Ensemble members are initially created by representing the source time variations as random functions of time that are modulated by crude initial estimates of the variations estimated from satellite imagery. Ensemble filtering is then used to remove members whose fields match poorly with observations within a specified analysis time window that are represented by satellite retrievals of volcanic ash properties such as mass load, effective radius, and cloud top height. The filtering process leads to an ensemble with statistics in closer agreement with the observations. It is shown in the context of the 30 May 2014 Sangeang Api eruption case study that this method leads to significantly enhanced forecasting skill beyond the analysis time window-about 20% improvement on average-when compared to a system that assumes constant emission rates for the duration of the eruption, as is the case in many operational volcanic ash forecasting systems.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Changes of Carbon Source/Sink in Terrestrial Vegetation Ecosystem and Response to Meteorological Factors in Yangtze River Delta Region (China)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part and the core link of a terrestrial ecosystem, terrestrial vegetation is the main means for human to regulate climate and mitigate the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is an urban agglomeration with the strongest comprehensive strength among developing countries (China). In the context of global climate change, a rapid, comprehensive, and detailed understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics and variation tendency of the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of vegetation and its response to climate during the rapid development of the YRD region is important for protecting ecological land, strengthening land management, and optimizing urban planning. The monthly mean temperature and rainfall data from 63 meteorological stations, the MODIS net primary productivity product, and a land cover product in the YRD region were used to estimate the NEP from 2000 to 2019 based on the soil respiration model, and the correlation between NEP and meteorological factors (such as temperature and rainfall) was analyzed. The results showed that: (1) From 2000 to 2019, the carbon sink area was much larger than the carbon source area in terrestrial vegetation in the Yangtze River Delta, the mean NEP of the vegetation ecosystem in the past 20 years was 253.2 g C center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1), and the spatial distribution presented a trend that was higher in the south and lower in the north, higher in the east and lower in the west, and that gradually increased from northwest to southeast; moreover, the NEP of mountain areas was generally higher than that of river courses and urban surroundings. The interannual fluctuation of NEP was small, but presented a slightly increasing trend, and the interannual variation of NEP was significantly correlated with the maximum NEP in this region. (2) The carbon sink capacity of different vegetation cover types was (from strong to weak): forestlands > grasslands > wetlands approximate to croplands. (3) The area with the NEP change rate (theta(slope)) > 0 accounted for 69.0%; however, there was certain spatial difference, the proportions of the areas with theta(slope) < 0 were (from large to small) 14.50% (Zhejiang Province, China), 9.10% (Anhui Province, China), 6.65% (Jiangsu Province, China), and 0.79% (Shanghai, China). In terms of the individual changes of these provinces and municipalities, Shanghai > Zhejiang Province > Jiangsu Province approximate to Anhui Province. (4) There was a correlation between NEP and the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation in some regions.

TI  - Fire Regions as Environmental Niches: A New Paradigm to Define Potential Fire Regimes in Africa and Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the widespread use of the "fire regime" concept for describing spatial and temporal patterns and ecosystem impacts of fire, this concept lacks an unambiguous, quantitative definition. By adopting from the ecological literature the concept of climate niche, that is, the environmental conditions that allow a specie to exist, we propose a new framework where variables that promote fuel accumulation and desiccation were used to define the environmental space at the continental level, later divided into regions ("fire regions") with distinct fire potential. Our proposed approach emphasizes climate controls on fire patterns, distinct from the controls that humans exert on observed fire activity. By applying this framework, we identified nine fire regions in Africa and eight in Australia, distinguishing differences in fire patterns between continents as a result of changes in environmental gradient. Not only did we find that fire size and intensity varied significantly between continents, but biomes at a continental level were also found to be heterogeneous in terms of fire frequency, size, and intensity. For example, within African tropical savannas, the total annual rainfall and tree cover change drastically North and South of the equator, resulting in fire regions with significantly different fire characteristics. Meanwhile, in Australia, a strong gradient of annual temperature and precipitation seasonality was observed within tropical savannas and xeric shrublands, which was recognized by dividing those biomes into five regions with statistically different fire activity. Additionally, human presence led to some heterogeneity of fire patterns within delineated fire regions that also varied across biomes.

TI  - DRAGONFLIES DIVERSITY AND LAND COVER CHANGES IN THE BATUBOLONG RIVER, WEST LOMBOK DISTRICT.
T2  - Biotropia
M3  - Article
AB  - West Lombok District is the second largest district in Lombok Islands. The diversity of dragonflies (Order Odonata) as a bioindicator of environmental quality has not been widely studied in the West Lombok region. This study aimed to determine the species diversity of dragonflies (Order Odonata) found in Batubolong River, West Lombok District and its relation to the occurring land cover changes. This study was carried out by using a descriptive explorative method, where the sampling technique was done by means of line transects. Maps of study and sampling locations as well as land cover changes were made using ArcGIS 10.4.1 software based on primary and secondary data. The results showed that there were 11 species of dragonflies with a Shannon-Wiener diversity index value (H') of 2.212 (medium diversity), a population density index (C) of 0.126 (low dominance), and a species evenness index (E) of 0.923 (high uniformity). Our study also found two rare species of dragonfly in Lombok Island i.e., 3 individuals of Nososticta emphyla (Lieftinck, 1936) with 9% relative abundance and 1 individual of Drepanosticta berlandi (Lieftinck, 1939) with 3% relative abundance. The discovery of D. berlandi in Lombok is the third time after the findings in 1896 and the 19th century. Analysis of satellite data around the sampling area within the period 2013-2020 showed that there has been an increase in land cover of 6,149.29 m<sup>2</sup>. The increase in land cover changes may have caused the disappearance of several Odonata species in the sampling location.

TI  - How Did the Mild and Humid Areas of China Turn Green? A Case Study on Chongqing
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the implementation of the Natural Forest Resources Protection Project (NFRP) and the Grain for Green Program (GFGP), two key ecological projects related to forestry, the vegetation cover in Chongqing, has improved significantly. Existing studies have revealed the effects of climate change and human activity on vegetation cover in arid regions. However, more studies are needed to reveal the influence of drivers on vegetation cover in mild and humid areas, to quantify the relative contribution of drivers and to analyze the overall land use characteristics in different regions. In this study, we used Theil-Sen slope analysis and the Mann-Kendall test to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover in Chongqing. Further, we used Pearson correlation analysis to analyze the correlations between vegetation cover and drivers, quantitatively analyzing the relative contributions of these drivers. Complex network model analysis was used for different regions to obtain their land-use system characteristics, and the Hurst index was adopted to predict future vegetation-cover changes. The results of this study showed that the average vegetation cover in Chongqing increased significantly from 2000 to 2020, and the overall greening trend was most obvious in winter. Precipitation and temperature influenced the vegetation cover of Chongqing city to a certain extent, and the positive correlation between vegetation cover and precipitation was more significant than that with temperature. In terms of the precipitation factor, the areas with significant positive correlations were mainly concentrated in the central and southern parts of Chongqing, which could be related to the higher precipitation in the southern part of the city. Under the combined influence of climate change and human activity, vegetation cover increased in 71.95% of the total area. Human activity had a relative contribution of 70.39% and 69.14% in the areas where vegetation cover decreased and increased, respectively. The analysis results of the complex network model showed that woodlands and grasslands contributed more to areas where the vegetation cover exhibited an increasing trend. In the future, it is estimated that 72.92% of the vegetation cover in Chongqing will exhibit a degradation trend. This study helps us further understand vegetation-cover changes in mild and humid areas, providing new research directions for informing forestry-related policies.

T2  - MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The surge-type Uisu glacier and its forefield in the Tajik part of Eastern Pamir are described. To this end, 1977-2019 Landsat satellite imagery, the DEM, and a high-resolution orthophotomap were used, and detailed geomorphological mapping was carried out. The results show that the present-day position of the terminus of the studied glacier results from a surge that occurred before 1947. Currently, the glacier is losing mass. However, despite the visible characteristics of its thawing, the extent of the terminal zone has remained stable for several decades. Outside the glacier, there are no glacial landforms. This indicates that advances of surging glaciers may not create any surge-diagnostic features in their forefields. On the other hand, the genesis and interactions of landforms can reveal glacier surge, even in the absence of terminal and lateral glacial landforms.

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporal variations in land surface temperature and SUHI intensity with a cloud based computational system over five major cities of India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI) is one of the most evident climate phenomena in low- and mid-latitude cities. Extensive growth and intense urbanization has brought a phenomenal change to the urban landscape. The rapid expansion of cities have the potential to generate distinctive local urban climates by increasing land surface temperature (LST) and the intensities of surface urban heat islands (SUHI). The study uses Landsat data in a cloud based computational system to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of land use land cover (LULC) for five major cities (Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Ahmadabad) from 2007 to 2020. Selected biophysical parameters like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) are used. The interrelationship with the dynamics of LST to analyze the SUHI profiles reveals that the mean LST has a positive correlation for impermeable surfaces and a negative correlation for green surfaces, which are common for all Indian cities and results in degradation of environmental quality. The results obtained from this study showed that all cities have undergone a change in LULC pattern, which induced a rise in overall temperature and SUHI intensity. The expansion of the urban landscape along with the changing vegetation and cropping patterns due to the rise in anthropogenic activities has resulted in susceptible climatic conditions and necessitates further environmental investigations. The findings of the study can be recommended to monitor the impacts of SUHI intensity at different locations for future studies to adapt sustainable urban planning of cities.

TI  - Textbook dune: Is there a representative and scale-invariant beach-dune profile?
T2  - CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Coastal Dune Model, used to examine controls on dune development and evolution, includes negative feedback between the wind and the evolving topography that results in a scale-invariant beach-dune profile. While a limited number of reference profiles appear to support the Coastal Dune Model assumption of scale-invariance, previously published studies and conceptual models suggest that the beach-dune profile is not scale-invariant. Using a combination of journal articles, textbooks, and remotely sensed data from Prince Edward Island, Washington state, and Texas, this short communication finds that there is no evidence for a scale-invariant beach-dune profile within and between field sites. Variability in the beach-dune profile is due to site-specific and scale-dependent controls on the beach and the dune that are often highlighted in the conceptual models that authors use to depict the controls on sediment supply and transport from the beach to the dune. Results highlight a need to critically evaluate the assumptions and applications of models such as the Coastal Dune Model, and to explore how and when sites can be considered representative and in support of model results.

TI  - Spatial scale transformation-based estimation model for fresh grass yield: a case study of the Xilingol Grassland, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the grass yield of a grassland area is of vital theoretical and practical significance for determining grazing capacity and maintaining ecological balance. Due to the spatial inconsistency between sampling and remote sensing data, improving the accuracy of fresh grass yield (FGY) estimation based on remote sensing is difficult. Using vegetation coverage at different spatial scales, this paper proposes a spatial scale transformation (SST)-based estimation model for FGY adopting normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as its estimation factor, using the grassland in Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia, as the study area. Results showed that the SST-based FGY estimation model was able to greatly improve estimation precision; the relative estimation error (REE) of the estimation models constructed using linear with intercept zero (linear-0) and power functions were 18.16% and 18.35%, respectively. The estimation models constructed using linear-0 and power functions were employed to estimate the grass yield of the grassland in Xilingol League, and the total FGYs estimated were 8.777 x 10(10) kg and 8.583 x 10(10) kg, respectively. The two models obtained roughly the same estimates, but there were significant differences between them in the spatial distributions of FGY per unit. Taking net primary productivity (NPP) as an example, the effectiveness of other remote sensing data as estimation factors was further verified, and the results showed that SST-based estimation for FGY also effectively improved the estimation accuracy of grass yield.

TI  - Modeling plant phenology by MODIS derived photochemical reflectance index (PRI)
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of ecosystem responses to climate change, and thus the accurate estimation of vegetation phenology is critical to evaluate the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Common structural vegetation indices (VIs) such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Near-infrared Reflectance of Vegetation (NIRv) and Plant Phenology Index (PPI), are the most widely used indicators of phenology, but they have limited potential in tracking autumn phenology, especially for evergreen species with low seasonal variability of canopy greenness. Given the important role of carotenoid pigments in regulating photosynthetic activity and plant phenology, we hypothesize that satellite-based indicators of leaf pigments derived from MODIS ocean bands could be useful for phenology modeling. Using 624 site-years of flux data at 84 FLUXNET sites and 9979 ground observations at 138 PEP725 sites, we first explored the potential of different forms of scaled photochemical reflectance index (sPRI(ref)) in monitoring photosynthetic activity, and found that band 10 and band 13 were more suitable for tracking gross primary productivity (GPP) than other reference bands. By comparing with canopy photosynthetic phenology, sPRI(10) and sPRI(13) showed improved representation of phenological transitions (the start and end of growing season, SOS and EOS, respectively) than structural VIs. In spring, all VIs exhibited comparable performances for estimating SOS at deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF) and grasslands (GRA) sites; however, sPRI(10) and sPRI(13) were better predictors of SOS than structural VIs at evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) and mixed forests (MF) sites. In autumn, sPRI(10) and sPRI(13) showed improved predictive strength of EOS than structural VIs for ENF, MF and GRA sites. Further investigations using the ground observed phenological records also confirmed the improved performances of sPRI(10) and sPRI(13) for both SOS and EOS estimation. We also investigated the spatial patterns of sPRI(10)-derived SOS and EOS over the Northern Hemisphere with respect to different plant functional types. We showed that sPRI(10) reliably tracked plant phenology with 83.0% and 78.8% success in detecting SOS and EOS, respectively. Spatial patterns of SOS exhibited obvious latitudinal gradients, while EOS showed a strong regional heterogeneity. In addition, sPRI(10) predicted an overall earlier SOS (61.8%) and later EOS (51.2%) than the MODIS phenology product (VNP22Q2 v001) estimated from structural VI, suggesting the latter underestimated the greening potential of the Northern Hemisphere. Our results suggest that MODIS PRI could be useful to monitor vegetation phenology, and further reveal the importance of underappreciated carotenoid pigments in tracking plant seasonal changes, particularly in autumn months.

TI  - Field-scale estimation of sugarcane leaf nitrogen content using vegetation indices and spectral bands of Sentinel-2: Application of random forest and support vector regression
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen is an essential factor for assessing the quality of sugarcane during the growing season, as deficiency of this component significantly reduces crop yield . The Kjeldahl method is the most common approach to measuring sugarcane nitrogen, but it is a laborious, costly, and time-consuming process. Conversely, multi -spectral satellite imagery can provide timely, cost-effective, and large-scale information on the nitrogen content in sugarcane fields. The current study applied random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models to estimate sugarcane leaf nitrogen using vegetation indices and spectral bands of Sentinel-2. In-situ data was taken from 45 farms (1125 ha) in a sugarcane production agro-industrial complex in southwest Iran. The global environmental monitoring index (GEMI), chlorophyll index green (Clgreen), and Sentinel-2 red-edge position index (S2REP) were found to be the most important variables related to sugarcane nitrogen. The coefficient of determination (R2) for RF and SVR was 0.59 and 0.58, respectively, and the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.08 and 0.09, respectively. Despite the similar performances of the two models, RF showed higher accuracy; however, to improve the results, the use of multi-temporal data for model calibration is recommended.

TI  - Processing CORONA image for generation of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and orthophoto of Bilaspur district, Himachal Pradesh
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Declassified CORONA images provide stereo pairs that could be used for preparation of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and orthophotos that could be an invaluable resource in accounting historical information. In the present work, KH-9 Hexagon CORONA images of Bilaspur district, Himachal Pradesh, India are used for the generation of DEM and orthophoto using photogrammetric techniques and tools. ASTER DEM and TanDEM-X were used to validate the generated CORONA DEM. The CORONA DEM elevation profiles at three different locations were compared with ASTER DEM and TanDEM-X. These profiles match very closely with each other. The change percentage of elevation is within 1%, between CORONA DEM and ASTER DEM, and TanDEM-X when computed for random 100 points. However, the elevation at the Bhakra dam has submeter level variation when measured using CORONA DEM. According to published reports, the elevation of the Bhakra dam is 487.68 m, while that is estimated to be 487.88 m in CORONA DEM. Furthermore, Landsat-3 MSS (1979) data is used to validate the orthophoto generated from the stereo pairs. The Govind Sagar reservoir in the study area is demarcated using object-based classification and it showed a difference of 75.91 ha between CORONA orthophoto and Landsat-3 satellite images for 1979. The water bodies are extracted in the study area between 1979 and 2010 using the object-based image classification technique. The area of the water reservoir is decreased by - 7.70%, - 4.57%, and - 19.50% between 1979 and 1990, 1990 and 2000, and 2000 and 2010. We found that annual rainfall is decreasing with an increase in temperature which could be the reason for declining reservoir area. This decrease in reservoir area could also be attributed to depleting water resources, enhanced water extraction, and increased sedimentation near the reservoir. The DEM prepared using the CORONA images can be used for the representation of the earlier earth's surface and can be used as a reference for change detection and deformation studies.

TI  - Diurnal dynamics of heat exposure in Xi'an: A perspective from local climate zone
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the heat exposure in communities is important for finely managing the urban thermal environment. Although remote sensing data has been widely applied for evaluating heat exposure, rare studies discuss it by using diurnal land surface temperature (LST) at the block level, let alone integrating the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme. Therefore, we classified 716 urban blocks into 10 LCZ types and then combined them with the Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station LST data to investigate the diurnal spatio-temporal heterogeneity of heat exposure. First, we found that surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) reached the maximum value of 2.3 degrees C at noon. Compact built-up LCZs were heat islands over the day, while the open and dispersed built-up LCZs had greater uncertainties. Specifically, LCZ 4 and LCZ 9 can be cold or heat islands over the day. Second, the distribution characteristics of SUHII was highly consistent with that of heat exposure levels, i.e., high SUHII zones have high heat exposure level. Third, the heat exposure intensity levels among compact building zones (LCZ 1-LCZ 3) had a reverse change during daytime and nighttime and the same phenomenon was observed among open building zones (LCZ 4-LCZ 6). Our results implied that LCZ 3 and LCZ 2 should be given more priority to alleviate heat exposure risks than other built-up LCZs.

TI  - Research on Inversion of Suspended Sediment Concentration in Estuary Surface Based on Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of suspended sediments at the estuarine surface (SSC) is a crucial indicator for monitoring water bodies. Given the current situation in which SSC remote sensing inversion is primarily based on low-resolution satellites, this study first discusses remote sensing and GIS technologies before employing the Sentinel-2 satellite, whose resolution can exceed 10 m after resampling. Inversion and comparison of SSC content during wet and dry periods. In addition, based on the neural network's ability to compensate for the inherent errors of traditional empirical techniques, this study designs and develops an artificial neural network-based neural network corrector to perform secondary correction on the empirical inversion results. In this study, the B2, B3, B4, and B8 inversion models are used to generate the sensitive bands, and the ratio of these bands is used to generate the inversion model. The results indicate that the model has a high level of precision, which can aid in reducing the model's inherent error and ensuring inversion precision.

TI  - Towards automation of in-season crop type mapping using spatiotemporal crop information and remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Mapping crop types from satellite images is a promising application in agricultural systems. However, it is a challenge to automate in-season crop type mapping over a large area because of the insufficiency of ground truth and issues of scalability, reusability, and accessibility of the classification model. This study introduces a framework for automatic crop type mapping using spatiotemporal crop information and Sentinel-2 data based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The main advantage of the framework is using the trusted pixels extracted from the historical Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to replace ground truth and label training samples in satellite images. OBJECTIVE: This paper will achieve three objectives: (1) assessing spatiotemporal crop information derived from the historical crop cover maps; (2) mapping crop cover, mainly crop fields without regular historical crop rotation patterns, from remote sensing data using supervised learning classification and validating mapping results; and (3) automating in-season crop mapping and exploring the scalability of the framework.METHODS: The proposed crop mapping workflow consists of four stages. The data preparation stage preprocesses CDL and Sentinel-2 data into the required structure. The spatiotemporal crop information sampling stage extracts trusted pixels from the historical CDL time series and labels Sentinel-2 data. Then a crop type classification model can be trained using the supervised learning classifier in the model training stage. In the mapping/validation stage, an in-season crop cover map over the full Sentinel-2 tile will be produced using the trained model and the classification performance will be validated using CDL or other ground truth data.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We systematically perform a group of experiments for in-season mapping of five major crop types (corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and soybeans-wheat double cropping) over the Mississippi Delta region. The result indicates that the crop cover map of the study area is expected to reach 80%-90% agreement with CDL within the growing season. To further facilitate the use of the framework, we also develop a GEE -enabled online prototype, In-season Crop Mapping Kit, and explore its scalability over agricultural fields in various ecoregions including California, Idaho, Kansas, and Illinois.SIGNIFICANCE: The mapping-without-ground-truth approach described in this paper can significantly reduce ground truthing process and save substantial resource needs and labor costs, which is applicable to the pro-duction of in-season CDL-like data for the entire United States. The findings and outputs will benefit the agri-culture community and other agricultural sectors ranging from government, academia, and companies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction and study of air pollution is a complex process due to the presence of controlling factors, different land use, and different sources for the elaboration of pollution. In this study, we applied the machine learning technique (Random Forest) with time series of particulate matter pollution records to predict and develop a particulate matter pollution susceptibility map. The applied method is to strict measures and to better manage particulate matter pollution in Ras Garib city, Egypt as a case study. Air pollution data for the period between 2018 and 2021 is collected using five air quality stations. Some of these stations are located near highly urbanized locations and could be dense with the current rates of development in the future. The random forest was applied to verify and visualize the relationships between the particulate matter and different independent variables. Spectral bands of Landsat OLI 8 imaginary and land cover/land use indices were used to prepare independent variables. Analysis of the results reveals that the proper air quality distribution monitoring stations would provide a deep insight into the pollution distribution over the study site. Distance from the roads and the land surface temperature has a significant effect on the distribution of air quality distribution. The obtained probability and classification maps were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The outcome prediction maps are reasonable and will be helpful for future air quality monitoring and improvements. Furthermore, the applied method of pollutant concentration prediction is able to improve decision-making and provide appropriate solutions.

TI  - Modern Management of Chest Wall Recurrences after Mastectomy
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review A chest wall recurrence after mastectomy for breast cancer requires multimodality treatment. In this article, we review local and systemic therapy treatments for recurrent chest wall disease. Recent Findings There appears to be a survival benefit for patients who can undergo local resection in combination with radiation therapy. Retrospective series have shown an overall benefit with minimal risk of re-irradiation. The success of performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy after a mastectomy and after a previous sentinel node biopsy has been reported. Overall, there is limited data on systemic therapy options; however, there is no benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy compared to endocrine therapy alone with the non-metastatic hormone-receptor-positive disease. Local resection may require a comprehensive surgical team to achieve negative margins and reconstruct defects. Radiation therapy should be considered, even if the setting of previous radiation and systemic therapy is based on receptor status and previous systemic treatment.

TI  - Environmental Concern and Public Attitudes Toward Marine Life in Coastal China
T2  - ANTHROZOOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between people's concern for the environment and their attitudes toward marine life remains ambiguous, especially in developing countries such as China. This paper reports results from an online survey (n = 500) conducted in 22 Chinese coastal cities regarding the relationship between public attitudes toward marine life and environmental concern, as well as environment-related behavior. The New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale was used to assess respondents' environmental concern. Attitudes toward marine life protection were measured using a revised version of the Animal Attitude Scale (AAS). Including some questions on demographics and environment-related behaviors and preferences, the survey also aimed to investigate human-marine life interactions in coastal Chinese society. The data revealed that people living in coastal China mostly endorsed a pro-ecological worldview, but they were rather passive in environmental public participation. All five dimensions of environmental concern were positively correlated with marine life attitude and associated with selected AAS content categories (human moral dominance, food, medical research, and hunting/fishing) to varying degrees. Anti-anthropocentrism was found to be the most important dimension of NEP in understanding marine life protection and the use of marine life. It was also discovered that some environment-related behaviors, such as beach visits, NGO membership/donations, and transportation preferences, were predictors of attitudes toward marine life and marine life usage. The findings from this study highlight three significant concepts in shaping public perception of marine life: the recognition of human domination, moderation, and potential environmental risks.

TI  - Research on Monitoring Methods for the Appropriate Rice Harvest Period Based on Multispectral Remote Sensing
T2  - DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice production is highly seasonal, and the timing for conducting harvest operations has a relatively significant impact on yields, especially the appropriate timing of the harvesting operations. Using scientific methods to monitor the appropriate harvest period can effectively reduce harvesting losses. Most of the existing studies in this field focus on yield changes that occur during the harvest period of rice and also use multispectral remote sensing for inversion of the crop canopy. However, there has been no research on combining the yields and spectral characteristics of the harvest period. In this article, a monitoring method for the appropriate harvest period of rice based on multispectral remote sensing was established. Remote sensing data of the rice canopy were acquired using UAV equipped with multispectral (550 nm, 660 nm, 735 nm, and 790 nm) cameras, and physiological characteristic data of rice moisture content, thousand-grain weight, and tassel ratios were determined simultaneously. Single-band and combined-band spectral reflectance were introduced as model input variables to compare the BP neural network, SVM, and decision tree; a quantitative inversion model of the physiological characteristics of rice was established. The accuracy of the inversion model with different input variables and model methods was evaluated, and the optimal inversion model for rice moisture content and thousand-grain weight was selected, which could be used to determine whether the crop was harvested during the appropriate period. The continuous monitoring of two rice varieties (South Japonica 46 and South Japonica 5055) indicated that the moisture content of South Japonica 46 decreased linearly during the 20-day trial period, while its thousand-grain weight showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. The moisture content of South Japonica 5055 showed a fluctuating downward trend, and its thousand-grain weight also showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. The spectral reflectance at 735 nm increased gradually, and that of both rice varieties increased from about 35% at the beginning of the trial to about 75% in the later stage. The spectral reflectance at the other three bands did not show significant change with the harvest date. The inverse model of spectral reflectance with rice thousand-grain weight and moisture content was established using the BP neural network, SVM, and decision tree. In single-band inversion models, the regression effect at 735 nm was relatively good in the BP neural network model, with the highest determination coefficients of spectral reflectance and thousand-grain weight of both rich varieties and the smallest RMSE of prediction results. In combined-band inversion models, the regression effects at 550 + 660+735 nm and 660 + 735+790 nm were the best in the SVM and thousand-grain weight inversion models.

TI  - A Prospective Double-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing the Intraoperative Injection of Technetium Tc 99m Tilmanocept with Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid in Breast Cancer Lymphatic Mapping
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Technetium-labeled sulfur colloid (TSC) is a radiolabeled mapping agent commonly used for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx). Tilmanocept, a CD206 receptor-targeted mapping agent, has gained recent popularity due to potential advantages of rapid and quick uptake to the SLNs. The objectives of this study were to assess (1) the difference in the number of SLNs harvested using tilmanocept versus TSC and (2) the difference in time to transcutaneous localization when using an intraoperative injection approach. Methods. Patients undergoing breast conservation and SLNBx were consented and randomized to receive either 0.5 mCi of filtered TSC or 0.5 mCi of tilmanocept injected intradermally immediately after induction of anesthesia. Axillary transcutaneous gamma detector probe counts were taken at 1-minute intervals until a hot spot was identified. SLNs were then identified and excised. Additional nodes were excised if their counts per second (cps) were greater than 10% of the cps of the hottest SLN. The number of SLNs was based on both number of nodes collected intraoperatively and the number recorded in the final pathology report. Results. The study population consisted of 86 patients, 48 randomized to tilmanocept and 38 to TSC. There were no significant differences in patient or tumor characteristics between the two groups. Localization rates were 100% for both cohorts. The mean number of SLNs identified and removed was not significantly different (p=0.34, intraoperatively; p=0.57, pathology reported). Time to transcutaneous localization was 3.3 +/- 2.0 minutes for tilmanocept and 3.9 +/- 2.3 minutes for TSC (p=0.19). The average cps for the hottest node was 2,180.0 +/- 2,460.5 in the tilmanocept group compared to 2,679.3 +/- 2,687.5 in the TSC group (p=0.94). Conclusion. There was no significant difference in the number of SLNs harvested or in the time to transcutaneous localization when using tilmanocept versus TSC as the radiolabeled mapping agents for intraoperative injection and mapping. Either agent can be used without any significant difference in performance.

TI  - Correlation between Vegetation Coverage and Thickness of Chestnut Soil Layer in Typical Grassland Based on Multisource Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to study the correlation between the vegetation coverage of typical grassland and the thickness of chestnut calcium soil layer, three typical geomorphic types of Wuzhumuqin typical grassland in Inner Mongolia were selected as experimental plots. It uses 3S technology and the methods of landscape ecology and geostatistics to test the image data and field quadrat in the past three years. It closely combines vegetation ecology with soil environment, the relationship between soil characteristics and vegetation landscape, and makes a correlation analysis on the synergistic evolution of chestnut soil thickness. The relationship between chestnut soil thickness, soil water content, and vegetation coverage under three different geomorphic conditions was obtained. Based on the quantitative analysis of the temporal and spatial differences between the vegetation coverage of typical grassland and the thickness of chestnut soil, the spatial distribution patterns of different soil types are revealed. Based on Landsat 8 TM image data, this paper makes statistics of vegetation index (NDVI) at three test sites. The spatial overlap method and the actual observation data are abandoned for spatial interpolation, and the similarity conclusion is obtained. The study shows that among the three sample plots in 2021, except for the original wavy high flat sample plot whose natural environment has been greatly damaged, the correlation coefficient between chestnut calcium soil layer thickness and vegetation coverage in the other two sample plots is also significant in the significance of 0.01 or 0.05 (two-sided test). It shows that there is a very significant positive correlation between the thickness of chestnut calcium soil layer and the thickness of chestnut calcium soil layer. The purpose of this paper is to use hyperspectral images to classify different kinds of plants, so as to realize the monitoring of chestnut soil. It will provide rapid and dynamic technical support for desertification control in the future.

AB  - Sentinel-2 (S2) images have been used in several projects to detect large accumulations of marine litter and plastic targets. Their limited spatial resolution though hinders the detection of relatively small floating accumulations of marine debris. Thus, this study aims at overcoming this limit through the exploration of fusion with very high-resolution WorldView-2/3 (WV-2/3) images. Various state-of-the-art approaches (component substitution, spectral unmixing, deep learning) were applied on data collected in synchronized acquisitions of plastic targets of various sizes and materials in seawater. The fused images were evaluated for spectral and spatial distortions, as well as their ability to spectrally discriminate plastics from water. Several WV-2/3 band combinations were investigated and five litter indexes were applied. Results showed that: a) the VNIR combination is the optimal one, b) the smallest observable plastic target is 0.6 x 0.6 m2 and c) SWIR bands are important for marine litter detection.

TI  - Enhanced atmospheric pollution due to the Uttarakhand fire event of April 2016 and its radiative impact
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests, though very critical for life on Earth, are threatened by various factors and the frequently occurring forest fires are one of the significant causes. Forest fires drastically contribute to climate change on both regional and global scales. Forest fires-of both natural and anthropogenic origins-induce aerosols in the atmosphere and have a significant impact on the health and climate of the region. In this study, we simulate the Uttarakhand (29-31 degrees N, 78-80 degrees E) fire event in India, which occurred in April 2016, using the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to estimate the radiative impact of the aerosols emitted due to this fire event and probe into the extent of their transport into the atmosphere. Multiple data from ground-based and satellite observations are used to access the model performance. Our analysis showed that the high values of aerosol optical depths (AODs) during the fire event simulated by WRF-Chem compared very well with MODIS AODs over the Uttarakhand region. The model simulations of the vertical profile of BC corroborate with elevated smoke aerosols derived from CALIPSO. An enhancement of smoke aerosols is observed up to 5-km altitude during the fire event both in the model simulations and observations. The fire has increased the near-surface air temperatures by 1-3 degrees C and decreased the relative humidity by similar to 10% over the affected areas. The NET (shortwave + longwave) atmospheric radiative forcing due to fire varied between similar to 10 and similar to 40 Wm(-2) in the entire affected areas, with the highest values over the source region. The fire-induced atmospheric heating rate varied between 0.5 and 1.4 K/day over the Uttarakhand region.

TI  - Coastal vulnerability assessment based on multi-hazards and bio-geophysical parameters. case study-northwestern coastline of Guinea-Bissau
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Guinea-Bissau's coasts are considered highly vulnerable to coastal hazards, and this vulnerability is expected to increase under future climate change scenarios. Multi-hazards assessment studies have not been fully carried out to better understand the vulnerability index in the Northwestern Coastline of Guinea-Bissau. In this study, we coupled remote sensing data with the InVEST Model to develop a comprehensive coastal vulnerability index, establish the rate of sea-level rise, and determine the role of coastal habitats in protecting the shoreline from coastal hazards. The study area covered a coastline of 87 km that are classified in different levels of vulnerability. The results show that about 45 km of coastline are recorded in areas of high to very-high vulnerability index. 17 km are recorded in areas of moderate vulnerability, while 25 km are recorded in areas of low to very-low vulnerability index. The study concluded that, the very-high vulnerability index observed in Zone-B is mainly influenced by wind and wave exposure, as this zone is largely exposed to Atlantic Ocean. The low relief of less than 5 m and flat slope that vary between 0 and 5 degrees, made zone-A more vulnerable to storm surge and sea-level that rises by 8.79 mm/year, however, the coastal habitats of this zone play a vital role in protecting the shoreline from coastal hazards. The low vulnerability recorded in Zone-C is due to the relative high relief of above 10 m combined with coastal geomorphological structures and natural habitats. Zone-A and B, deserve special attention from the conservation bodies and coastal community. These findings can be a baseline to assist policymakers and coastal managers in sustainable coastal management and cost-effective mitigation plans for ecological restoration and conservation.

TI  - Country-level fire perimeter datasets (2001-2021)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Fire activity is changing across many areas of the globe. Understanding how social and ecological systems respond to fire is an important topic for the coming century. But many countries do not have accessible fire history data. There are several satellite-based products available as gridded data, but these can be difficult to access and use, and require significant computational resources and time to convert into a usable product for a specific area of interest. We developed an open source software package called Fire Event Delineation for python (FIREDpy) which automatically downloads and processes all of the source files for an area of interest from the MODIS burned area product, and runs a spatiotemporal flooding algorithm that converts those hundreds of grids into a single fire perimeter shapefile. Here we present a collection of fire event perimeter datasets for every country on the globe that we created using the FIREDpy software. We will continue to improve the efficiency and flexibility of the underlying algorithm, and intend to update these datasets annually.

TI  - Percutaneous transeptal mitral valve endocarditis debulking with AngioVac aspiration system
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vacuum assisted aspiration with the AngioVac system has been well described for; right sided endocarditis, venous thrombus, lead related infection/thrombus aspiration and right sided cardiac mass evacuation. Percutaneous transeptal debulking with AngioVac for mitral valve endocarditis (MVE) in the inoperable or high surgical risk patient has not been well defined. A significant proportion of high/prohibitive surgical risk patients with left sided infective endocarditis (IE) are not offered valve surgery as patients in the acute active phase of IE have a high surgical mortality. Nonetheless, sequala of acute IE ie stroke, sepsis or hemodynamic instability in itself is associated with high morbidity and mortality without surgical treatment. A case report of an inoperable patient with methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus MVE who was offered MV vegetation debulking with the AngioVac Gen3 C 180 MV system is described. Preprocedural planning with attention to; optimal transeptal height puncture, use of sentinel cerebral protection device to decrease risk of procedure related cerebral embolism and venous extracorporeal membrane cannula, rather than arterial cannula for reinfusion, is described to avoid large bore arterial access related vascular complications. Further studies in a randomized manner are warranted to test these procedural techniques and determine outcomes of percutaneous aspiration of left sided IE with the AngioVac system in this highrisk inoperable cohort of patients.

TI  - Optimized building extraction from high-resolution satellite imagery using deep learning
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Building extraction is very essential in various urban dynamics like disaster management and change detection, finding the estimated population, and so on. Building extraction from satellite data is a challenging task as the images may be subjected to different illumination or structure due to very large variations of the appearance of buildings which may correspond to the different area/terrain. Although satellite imagery is readily available from various sources, translating the imagery includes intensive effort. Many computer-vision tasks have been carried out successfully but understanding the impact of them on building extraction with remote sensing imagery is a growing need.To overcome this kind of problem, an algorithm is proposed which extends the convolutional neural network for pixel-wise classification of images. Furthermore, to resolve the problem of extraction and masking of images, Mask-RCNN (i.e., Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm is used which makes this process easier and more efficient.The model is trained on a complex dataset that is significantly larger. Also, to make this algorithm more scalable, an advanced image augmentation technique is used in the pre-processing step.The results show that the algorithm achieves better performance in terms of accuracy.

TI  - Large-area mapping of active cropland and short-term fallows in smallholder landscapes using PlanetScope data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland mapping in smallholder landscapes is challenged by complex and fragmented landscapes, labor-intensive and unmechanized land management causing high within-field variability, rapid dynamics in shifting cultivation systems, and substantial proportions of short-term fallows. To overcome these challenges, we here present a large-area mapping framework to identify active cropland and short-term fallows in smallholder landscapes for the 2020/2021 growing season at 4.77 m spatial resolution. Our study focuses on Northern Mozambique, an area comprising 381,698 km(2). The approach is based on Google Earth Engine and time series of PlanetScope mosaics made openly available through NorwaYs International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) data program. We conducted multi-temporal coregistration of the PlanetScope data using seasonal Sentinel-2 base images and derived consistent and gap-free seasonal time series metrics to classify active cropland and short-term fallows. An iterative active learning framework based on Random Forest class probabilities was used for training rare classes and uncertain regions. The map was accurate (area-adjusted overall accuracy 88.6% + 1.5%), with the main error type being the commission of active cropland. Error-adjusted area estimates of active cropland extent (61,799.5 km(2) +/- 4,252.5 km(2)) revealed that existing global and regional land cover products tend to under-, or over-estimate active cropland extent, respectively. Short-term fallows occupied 28.9% of the cropland in our reference sample (13% of the mapped cropland), with consolidated agricultural regions showing the highest shares of short-term fallows. Our approach relies on openly available PlanetScope data and cloud-based processing in Google Earth Engine, which minimizes financial constraints and maximizes replicability of the methods. All code and maps were made available for further use.

TI  - Satellite data-driven multi-objective simulation-optimization modeling for water-environment-agriculture nexus in an arid endorheic lake basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the arid endorheic lake basin with highly developed agriculture, water scarcity drives the nexus of water -environment-agriculture (WEA) while potential evapotranspiration (ETp) is a critical element linking basin -scale irrigation water demand and agro-economic development. The study proposes a satellite remote sensing data-driven multi-objective simulation-optimization (S-O) framework to implement the basin-scale WEA nexus management. The hydrological model (MODFLOW-NWT) combined with the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) based ET(p )estimation with a 500-m spatial resolution simulates the monthly surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) irrigation practices. Then, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (epsilon-MOMA) is applied to solve management model which includes maximization of agro-economic benefit and environmental flow and minimization of environmental risk of total nitrogen loading subject to irrigation water demand, land availability and food supply. The S-O framework is validated in an arid endorheic lake basin with intensive agricultural irrigation in northwestern China. The four-dimensional Pareto-optimal solutions are achieved to optimize crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation in order to avoid cognitive myopia triggered by low-dimensional or single objective optimization. The results highlight the trade-off among the high value crop planting, SW-GW irrigation and environmental flows, and indicating that lowering nitrogen loading is more sensitive to agro-economic benefit. Historical maximum and minimum ETp scenarios are tailored to quantify the impact of ETp change on WEA nexus management. Results show the increasing ET(p )has a great negative effect on the environmental flow objectives. Therefore, how multi-sectoral interests change depending on the basin-wide development goals may be difficult to regulate due to complex WEA nexus and associated deep uncertainty in the future.

TI  - The nexus between land use, land cover dynamics, and soil erosion: a case study of the Temecha watershed, upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - At the current times, soil erosion is the major problem that affects land and water resources, especially in Ethiopia's highlands. Due to the dynamics of land use land cover change, land degradation, and soil erosion increase significantly and result in a loss of fertile soil every year and lead reduction in agricultural production. This study was therefore designed to explore the land use land cover (LULC) dynamics from 1986 to 2020, to estimate mean annual soil erosion rates and identify erosion hotspot areas from 1986 to 2020, and finally, to evaluate the impacts of land use land cover change on soil loss of 1986 to 2020. For this, Landsat imageries of 4 years from 1986 to 2020 were used. Maximum likelihood supervised classification methods were used to classify LULCs. The dynamics of LULC change were used as an input for measuring soil loss by employing the combination of geospatial technologies with the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The LULC maps of 1986, 1997, 2009, and 2020 were used for identifying crop management (C) factor and conservation practice (P) factor. Rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), and slope length and steepness factor (LS) were also used as sources of data. Based on the five factors, soil erosion intensity maps were prepared for each year. Results showed that the annual soil loss in the watershed ranged from 0 to 3938.66 t/ha/year in 1986, 0 to 4550.94 t/ha/year in 1997, 0 to 5011.21 t/ha/year in 2009, and 0 to 6953.23 t/ha/year in 2020. The annual soil loss for the entire watershed was estimated at 36.889, 42.477, 47.805, and 48.048 t/ha/year in 1986, 1997, 2009, and 2020, respectively. The mean soil loss of 1986, 1997, 2009, and 2020 was higher in cultivated land followed by shrub land, grazing land, and forest land. Mean soil loss increased from 1986 to 1997, from 1997 to 2009, and from 2009 to 2020. This is because of the expansion of agricultural land at the expense of grazing land and shrub land. Therefore, urgent soil and water conservation practices should be made in hotspot areas.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Many studies forecast floods using models, but these methods require a lot of hydro-meteorological data and complex cycle calculations. With the rich source of satellite images and the perfection of the technique, it is possible to effectively monitor and forecast floods and natural disasters. The study's objective is to monitor the status of the flood situation in the Mekong River Basin using satellite images. The study used MODIS images at 8-day temporal and 500-meter spatial resolution. Consider a mixed pixel object as the surface water. If the EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and LSWI (Land Surface Water Index) are < 0.1, then it remains submerged for an extended time. As a flood, if EVI > 0.1 but < 0.3. The classification of continuous flooded areas as long-term inundated objects, with the flood and mixed pixels and water-related pixels with a flood duration > 180 days. There was a high correlation between EVI and LSWI. Risk flood maps are the foundation for delineating a flood forecasting approach during the flood season. The precision is 91 percent. This low-cost weekly flood forecasting system provided a new method for disaster early warning utilizing satellite images.

TI  - Atypical seasonal variability of the Kuroshio Current affected by intraseasonal signals at its origin based on direct mooring observations
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution and temporal variability of the Kuroshio Current (KC) was investigated with three moorings deployed at 122.7 degrees E, 123 degrees E, and 123.3 degrees E along 18 degrees N from January 2018 to the spring of 2020. It is shown that the core of the KC is located to the west of 122.7 degrees E along 18 degrees N. With the increase in longitude, the KC extended its vertical scale and attenuated its intensity gradually. The satellite data indicated that the KC was strongest in winter and spring, while it was weakest in autumn along 18 degrees N. However, the seasonal cycle of the KC from mooring observations was atypical compared with that from the satellite data. The seasonal variation of the KC was not obvious in 2018, and a summer peak of KC occurred in 2019. The atypical seasonal variability of the KC was attributed to the strong intraseasonal signals generated by eddy activity. Eddies propagated from east and were enhanced to the west of 140 degrees E, leading to the westward intensified intraseasonal signals. In addition, the intraseasonal signals varied interannually, that is why the variation of the KC in 2018 was quite different with that in 2019.

TI  - Radiation estimation and crop growth trajectory reconstruction by novel algorithms improve MOD16 evapotranspiration predictability for global multi-site paddy rice ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimations in evapotranspiration (ET) of paddy rice ecosystems by satellite products are critical because of their important roles in regional hydrological processes and climate change. However, the NASA MODIS ET products (MOD16A2) and its derivatives do not have good correlations with all global paddy rice ET observations. In this research, MOD16 model sensitivity analyses and parameter optimization strategies were conducted in order to solve the problem. Results suggested that underestimation of daily net radiation (R-n) in overcast conditions and less satisfactory reconstruction of field-scale leaf area index (LAI) growth trajectory from the start date of field flooding and transplanting (FFTD) to the end of growing seasons by MODIS coarse vegetation index were identified as two major causes. A Light and Temperature-Driven Growth model and a Phenology-based LAI temporal Smoothing method fusion algorithm (LTDG_PhenoS) and an improved R-n estimation method were introducted and evaluated in paddy rice fields in South Korea, Japan, China, Philippines, India, Spain, Italy, and the USA from 2002 to 2019. The LTDG_PhenoS algorithm considers Landsat and MODIS EVI observations and meteorological data as input variables and 30-m LAI daily time series as outcomes. Introducing the global cloudy index algorithm resulted in improved estimations of daily R(n )under all-sky conditions, with a significant decrease of root mean square error (RMSE) from 1.87 to 1.11 MJ m(-2) day(-1). The LTDG_PhenoS algorithm well reconstructed crop LAI growth dynamics from the FFTD to the end of rice growing seasons, with a substantial decline of RMSE from 1.49 to 0.27 m(2)/m(-2). The FFTD estimations by the LTDG_PhenoS algorithm had an R-2 of 0.97 and a small RMSE of less than 12-days. Daily ET rates estimated by novel algorithms had a substantial decline in RMSE from 2.88 to 0.90 mm day (-1).

TI  - Variability of surface solar radiation under clear skies over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: Role of aerosols and water vapor
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface solar radiation (SSR) plays a vital role in the global energy cycle and the interaction between the earth and atmosphere. It has a significant impact on climate change. Aerosols and water vapor are important factors affecting the variations in clear-sky SSR. This study analyzed the effects of aerosols and water vapor on clear-sky SSR in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change, over the past 20 years. The results show that the 87.0% of the monthly clear-sky SSR over QTP can be explained by the monthly aerosols and water vapor. The aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) value in most QTP areas (93.35%) is lower than-10 W m- 2. The effect of water vapor on the monthly value of clear-sky SSR is greater than that of aerosols. The reduced clear-sky SSR (about 61.36% of QTP areas) in the past 20 years is mainly concentrated at the south-north boundary. The significant increases in sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols from India have contrib-uted to the decrease in clear-sky SSR in the South. Moreover, the increasing water vapor influx from the southern boundary is also an important reason for the reduction in clear-sky SSR in the South and North. The results also indicate that the decrease in dust aerosols, originating from the Taklamakan and Qaidam Deserts, results in the increase in clear-sky SSR in the Northeast.

TI  - Luminal A Breast Cancer: How Feasible is Omitting Axillary Dissection Without Neoadjuvant Therapy
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Luminal A breast cancer has a good prognosis and the criteria for adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are not clear. The aim of this study was to present our results of upfront surgery and long-term survival in luminal A tumors as well as the rates of protection from axillary dissection. Material and Methods. 271 Luminal A breast cancer patients who had operated at our center were evaluated retrospectively. In patients with 2 or less sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy and underwent breast-conserving surgery, axillary lymph node dissection was omitted (OAD). Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in patients with positive SLN who did not meet these criteria (axillary dissection after sentinel/ADAS). Results. While Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) was performed in 212 (77.9%) patients, SLNB + Axillary Dissection (AD) was performed in 58 (21.3%), and direct axillary dissection was performed in 1 (0.8%) patient. OAD was applied to 18 (23.6%) of the positive patients. Discussion/Conclusions. ALND rates are still strikingly high in luminal A breast cancer treatment, despite the disease's milder clinical course. In order to avoid complications of axillary dissection, patients should be considered for NAC as much as possible. Novel neoadjuvant or other therapy options are also required.

TI  - Water-soluble near-infrared fluorescent heptamethine dye for lymphatic mapping applications
T2  - BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN) is an important method for prognostic evaluation and minimally invasive staging of metastatic tumors. Here, we report a series of near-infrared fluorescent heptamethylamine dyes (series A, B and C) with central cycloalkene ring modified by tyrosine or N-Boc tyrosine via ether linkage. N- Boc tyrosine/tyrosine modification provided enhanced absorption coefficient and fluorescence quantum yield in DMSO, however with slight hypsochromic shift compared to the mother dyes in DMSO. In PBS, series A and B were found to be more fluorescent than ICG and showed brighter images. Compound A1 was found to exhibit the most favorable imaging performance among all the dyes investigated and was selected for in vivo sentinel lymph node mapping experiments in mice. A1 showed faster response and stronger fluorescence emission than FDA -approved ICG. The lymph node tracing with A1 could be assisted by MB staining. Ex vivo imaging of har-vested organs indicated that similar metabolic characteristics of A1 and ICG. Overall, A1 is advantageous over ICG and is very promising for non-invasive lymph node imaging.

TI  - High-resolution satellite products improve hydrological modeling in northern Italy
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based Earth observations (EO) are an accurate and reliable data source for atmospheric and environmental science. Their increasing spatial and temporal resolutions, as well as the seamless availability over ungauged regions, make them appealing for hydrological modeling. This work shows recent advances in the use of high-resolution satellite-based EO data in hydrological modeling. In a set of six experiments, the distributed hydrological model Continuum is set up for the Po River basin (Italy) and forced, in turn, by satellite precipitation and evaporation, while satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) and snow depths are ingested into the model structure through a data-assimilation scheme. Further, satellite-based estimates of precipitation, evaporation, and river discharge are used for hydrological model calibration, and results are compared with those based on ground observations. Despite the high density of conventional ground measurements and the strong human influence in the focus region, all satellite products show strong potential for operational hydrological applications, with skillful estimates of river discharge throughout the model domain. Satellite-based evaporation and snow depths marginally improve (by 2 % and 4 %) the mean Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) at 27 river gauges, compared to a baseline simulation (KGE(mean) = 0.51) forced by high-quality conventional data. Precipitation has the largest impact on the model output, though the satellite data on average shows poorer skills compared to conventional data. Interestingly, a model calibration heavily relying on satellite data, as opposed to conventional data, provides a skillful reconstruction of river discharges, paving the way to fully satellite-driven hydrological applications.

TI  - Tracking and classifying Amazon fire events in near real time
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Exceptional fire activity in 2019 sparked concern about Amazon forest conservation. However, the inability to rapidly separate satellite fire detections by fire type hampered fire suppression and assessment of ecosystem and air quality impacts. Here, we describe the development of a near-real-time approach for tracking contributions from deforestation, forest, agricultural, and savanna fires to burned area and emissions and apply the approach to the 2019 fire season in South America. Across the southern Amazon, 19,700 deforestation fire events accounted for 39% of all satellite active fire detections and the majority of fire carbon emissions (63%; 69 Tg C). Multiday fires accounted for 81% of burned area and 92% of carbon emissions from the Amazon, with many forest fires burning uncontrolled for weeks. Most fire detections from deforestation fires were correctly identified within 2 days (67%), high-lighting the potential to improve situational awareness and management outcomes during fire emergencies.

TI  - Intersubjectivity as an antidote to stress: Using dyadic active inference model of intersubjectivity to predict the efficacy of parenting interventions in reducing stress-through the lens of dependent origination in Buddhist Madhyamaka philosophy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intersubjectivity refers to one person's awareness in relation to another person's awareness. It is key to well-being and human development. From infancy to adulthood, human interactions ceaselessly contribute to the flourishing or impairment of intersubjectivity. In this work, we first describe intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic processes. Then, using parent-child relationship as an example, we propose a dyadic active inference model to elucidate an inverse relation between stress and intersubjectivity. We postulate that impaired intersubjectivity is a manifestation of underlying problems of deficient relational benevolence, misattributing another person's intentions (over-mentalizing), and neglecting the effects of one's own actions on the other person (under-coupling). These problems can exacerbate stress due to excessive variational free energy in a person's active inference engine when that person feels threatened and holds on to his/her invalid (mis)beliefs. In support of this dyadic model, we briefly describe relevant neuroimaging literature to elucidate brain networks underlying the effects of an intersubjectivity-oriented parenting intervention on parenting stress. Using the active inference dyadic model, we identified critical interventional strategies necessary to rectify these problems and hereby developed a coding system in reference to these strategies. In a theory-guided quantitative review, we used this coding system to code 35 clinical trials of parenting interventions published between 2016 and 2020, based on PubMed database, to predict their efficacy for reducing parenting stress. The results of this theory-guided analysis corroborated our hypothesis that parenting intervention can effectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is designed to mitigate the problems of deficient relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-mentalizing. We integrated our work with several dyadic concepts identified in the literature. Finally, inspired by Arya Nagarjuna's Buddhist Madhyamaka Philosophy, we described abstract expressions of Dependent Origination as a relational worldview to reflect on the normality, impairment, and rehabilitation of intersubjectivity.

TI  - Exploring the relative contribution of flood regimes and climatic factors to <i>Carex</i> phenology in a Yangtze River-connected floodplain wetland
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological regimes can combine with climatic factors to affect plant phenology; however, few studies have attempted to quantify their complex influences on plant phenology in floodplain wetlands. We obtained phenological information on Carex vegetation through MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data during 2001-2020, and monthly field investigation during 2011-2020. We then explored how these data were correlated with climatic factors and flood regimes in a Yangtze River-connected floodplain wetland (Dongting Lake, China). Our results showed that warmer temperature tended to advance the start of the pre-flooding growing season (SOS1), with a relative contribution of 76.1 %. Flood rising time strongly contributed to controlling the end of the pre-flooding growing season. Flood recession time and inundation duration were dominant factors determining the start of the post-flooding growing season (SOS2). Earlier flood recession time and shortened inundation duration tended to advance the SOS2. Shortened inundation duration, earlier flood recession time, and lower solar radiation tended to advance the end of the post-flooding growing season. The phenology of Carex distributed at highelevation areas was more affected by hydrology than that of Carex distributed at low-elevation areas. Thus, climatic factors strongly affect the phenology of Carex during the pre-flooding growing season, whereas flood regimes play a dominant role in determining the phenology in the post-flooding growing season. The different responses of Carex phenology to climatic and flooding factors may provide insights for the conservation and management of floodplain wetlands in Yangtze River because Carex are primary food source and habitat for herbivorous waterfowls.

TI  - Quantifying methane emissions from the global scale down to point sources using satellite observations of atmospheric methane
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - We review the capability of current and scheduled satellite observations of atmospheric methane in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) to quantify methane emissions from the global scale down to point sources. We cover retrieval methods, precision and accuracy requirements, inverse and mass balance methods for inferring emissions, source detection thresholds, and observing system completeness. We classify satellite instruments as area flux mappers and point source imagers, with complementary attributes. Area flux mappers are high-precision (< 1 %) instruments with 0.1-10 km pixel size designed to quantify total methane emissions on regional to global scales. Point source imagers are fine-pixel (< 60 m) instruments designed to quantify individual point sources by imaging of the plumes. Current area flux mappers include GOSAT (2009-present), which provides a high-quality record for interpretation of long-term methane trends, and TROPOMI (2018-present), which provides global continuous daily mapping to quantify emissions on regional scales. These instruments already provide a powerful resource to quantify national methane emissions in support of the Paris Agreement. Current point source imagers include the GHGSat constellation and several hyperspectral and multispectral land imaging sensors (PRISMA, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8/9, WorldView-3), with detection thresholds in the 100-10 000 kg h(-1) range that enable monitoring of large point sources. Future area flux mappers, including MethaneSAT, GOSAT-GW, Sentinel-5, GeoCarb, and CO2M, will increase the capability to quantify emissions at high resolution, and the MERLIN lidar will improve observation of the Arctic. The averaging times required by area flux mappers to quantify regional emissions depend on pixel size, retrieval precision, observation density, fraction of successful retrievals, and return times in a way that varies with the spatial resolution desired. A similar interplay applies to point source imagers between detection threshold, spatial coverage, and return time, defining an observing system completeness. Expanding constellations of point source imagers including GHGSat and Carbon Mapper over the coming years will greatly improve observing system completeness for point sources through dense spatial coverage and frequent return times.

TI  - Performance evaluation for retrieving aerosol optical depth from the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) based on the GRASP algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol spatial distribution obtained from satellite sensors is critical for understanding regional aerosol environments, anthropogenic aerosol emissions, and global climate change. The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) is the first generation of multi-angle polarized sensor developed by China. It is on-board the GaoFen-5 satellite, running in 705 km sun-synchronous orbit with a 13:30 LT (local time) ascending node. The sensor has three polarized channels at 490, 670, and 865 nm and similar to 9 viewing angles, mainly used for observing aerosols. The spatial resolution is similar to 3.3 km at nadir, and global coverage is similar to 2 d. In this study, the performance of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from the DPC/GaoFen-5 using the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm were evaluated on a global basis for the first time. The results showed that the DPC GRASP/Model scheme, which used several forms of aerosol-type mixing, achieved good performance. By comparing with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, the correlation coefficient ( R), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and expected error (EE%, +/- (0.05 + 0.15 x AOD)) were 0.9007 %, 0.0662 %, and 82.54 %, respectively. The scattering angle, number of averaged pixels, length of time steps, and radiative and polarized fitting residuals showed impacts on the results of AOD retrieval in the DPC GRASP/Model scheme. From the most AERONET sites, the R and EE% were larger than similar to 0.9% and similar to 80%. Compared with Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, the spatial and temporal variations of aerosol could be caught by the DPC with the GRASP/Model scheme, showing a good performance. However, values of AOD were also underestimated by DPC, probably due to an overly strict cloud mask. The above findings validated the ability of the DPC sensor to monitor aerosols. It should contribute to the development of aerosol parameter retrieval from multi-angle polarized sensors in the future.

TI  - Two-team-approached free flap reconstruction for plantar malignant melanoma: An observational (STROBE-compliant) trial
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructive treatments of heel defects usually involve regional flap techniques such as medial plantar flap procedures due to the limited availability of adjacent soft tissues. Although free flaps have advantages in terms of function and aesthetics, they remain challenging due to the longer operation time required than for regional flaps. Thus, we introduce an appropriate 2-team surgical protocol to reconstruct plantar defects after wide excision of malignant melanoma using free flap coverage. From 2015 to 2020, a retrospective study was performed including 21 patients who underwent free flap surgeries to reconstruct defects due to plantar malignant melanoma. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed to localize sentinel lymph nodes, and the procedure was carried out by 2 teams working together, a tumor-ablative team and a reconstructive team. The present study is adhered to the STROBE guidelines for cohort studies. The average operation time was 241.4 minutes and was not significantly different even in cases with inguinal dissection (P value: 0.641). All flaps survived after 2 cases of venous insufficiency and 1 case of hematoma were resolved by immediate revision surgery. The 2-team approach to surgically reconstruct heel defects after wide excision of malignant melanoma using free flap coverage offers favorable results and lower morbidity than regional flap approaches.

TI  - A case of ALK-positive histiocytosis with multiple lesions in the unilateral breast: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and importance: Primary ALK-positive histiocytosis of the breast is rare. Here, we report a case of ALK-positive histiocytosis with multiple unilateral breast lesions.Case presentation: Our patient was a 38-year-old female with primary ALK-positive histiocytosis of the breast with multiple lesions. There were no lesions in other organs, and the patient was considered surgically resectable and underwent a left total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Histopathologically, there were at least three lesions in the left breast in upper inner quadrant (UIQ), upper quadrant (UQ), and upper outer quadrant (UOQ). All lesions showed spindle-shaped tumor cells that were positive for CD163 and ALK and negative for AE1/AE3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed ALK and KIF5B rearrangements, suggesting the presence of the KIF5B-ALK fusion gene. In conclusion, this case was confirmed to be ALK-positive histiocytosis with multiple lesions in the unilateral breast. The patient underwent surgery and was discharged without complications.Clinical discussion: Reports of ALK-positive histiocytosis are very rare, and reports of primary cases in the breast are even rarer. The basic treatment for ALK-positive histiocytosis is surgical resection; however, ALK inhibitors may be effective in unresectable or disseminated cases. Accurate diagnosis at the time of initial treatment is necessary to expand the treatment options.Conclusion: This is the first case of ALK-positive histiocytosis with multiple lesions in the unilateral breast.

TI  - Multi-dimensional variables and feature parameter selection for aboveground biomass estimation of potato based on UAV multispectral imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential assessment of plant development and guiding agricultural production management in the field. Therefore, efficient and accurate access to crop AGB information can provide a timely and precise yield estimation, which is strong evidence for securing food supply and trade. In this study, the spectral, texture, geometric, and frequency-domain variables were extracted through multispectral imagery of drones, and each variable importance for different dimensional parameter combinations was computed by three feature parameter selection methods. The selected variables from the different combinations were used to perform potato AGB estimation. The results showed that compared with no feature parameter selection, the accuracy and robustness of the AGB prediction models were significantly improved after parameter selection. The random forest based on out-of-bag (RF-OOB) method was proved to be the most effective feature selection method, and in combination with RF regression, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the AGB validation model could reach 0.90, with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and normalized RMSE (nRMSE) of 71.68 g/m(2), 51.27 g/m(2), and 11.56%, respectively. Meanwhile, the regression models of the RF-OOB method provided a good solution to the problem that high AGB values were underestimated with the variables of four dimensions. Moreover, the precision of AGB estimates was improved as the dimensionality of parameters increased. This present work can contribute to a rapid, efficient, and non-destructive means of obtaining AGB information for crops as well as provide technical support for high-throughput plant phenotypes screening.

M3  - Article
AB  - Data on the prevalence and distribution of ticks and tick-borne diseases in Belize are lacking. Ticks (n = 564) collected from dogs, horses, and vegetation in two villages in Stann Creek District in southeastern Belize in 2018, were molecularly identified and screened for tick-borne nonviral human pathogens. The identity of 417 ticks was molecularly confirmed by DNA barcoding as Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) (66.43%), Amblyomma ovale Koch (15.59%), Dermacentor nitens Neumann (11.51%), Amblyomma sp. ADB0528 (3.6%), and the remainder being small records (2.87%) of Amblyomma coelebs Neumann, Amblyomma imitator Kohls, Amblyomma tapirellum Dunn, Amblyomma auricularium Conil, and Amblyomma maculatum Koch. Individual tick extracts were screened for the presence of Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Babesia microti, Borrelia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Anaplasma spp. using available conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Rickettsia parkeri strain Atlantic Rainforest was identified in five specimens of A. ovale, and one other unidentified tick, all collected from dogs. Another unidentified tick-also collected from a dog-tested positive for an undefined but previously detected Ehrlichia sp. With the exception of D. nitens, all eight other tick species identified in this study were collected on dogs, suggesting that dogs could be usefully employed as sentinel animals for tick surveillance in Belize.

TI  - Travel-associated extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever: a case series to inform management in non-endemic regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever is a threat to travelers to Pakistan. We describe a multicontinental case series of travel-acquired XDR typhoid fever to demonstrate the global spread of the problem and encourage preventive interventions as well as appropriate empiric antimicrobial use. Methods Cases were extracted from the GeoSentinel database, microbiologic laboratory records of two large hospitals in Toronto, Canada, and by invitation to TropNet sites. All isolates were confirmed XDR Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella typhi), with resistance to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Results Seventeen cases were identified in Canada (10), USA (2), Spain (2), Italy (1), Australia (1) and Norway (1). Patients under 18 years represented 71% (12/17) of cases, and all patients travelled to Pakistan to visit friends or relatives. Only one patient is known to have been vaccinated. Predominant symptoms were fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. Antimicrobial therapy was started on Day 1 of presentation in 75% (12/16) of patients, and transition to a carbapenem or azithromycin occurred a median of 2 days after blood culture was drawn. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were consistent with the XDR S. typhi phenotype, and whole genome sequencing on three isolates confirmed their belonging to the XDR variant of the H58 clade. Conclusions XDR typhoid fever is a particular risk for travelers to Pakistan, and empiric use of a carbapenem or azithromycin should be considered. Pre-travel typhoid vaccination and counseling are necessary and urgent interventions, especially for visiting friends and relatives travelers. Ongoing sentinel surveillance of XDR typhoid fever is needed to understand changing epidemiology.

TI  - Spatial structure of the surface heat and cold islands in summer based on Landsat 8 imagery in southern Poland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intense development of cities and related replacement of vegetated areas with impervious surfaces contributed to the intensification of the urban heat island effect, which is a hazardous phenomenon for humans. In this study, the spatial structure of the surface heat and cold island (SHI and SCI, respectively) in the Gornoslasko-Zaglebiowska Metropolis (GZM), the most urbanized and populated area in Poland, is investigated using four Landsat 8 satellite images recorded in the summers between 2015 and 2019. The satellite images processed to the land surface temperature (LST) and the Corine Land Cover 2018 (CLC 2018) classification were used to calculate indicators of the spatial extent and intensity of SHI and SCI. Their spatial extents in the GZM ranged from 15.4 to 16.4% and 12.2-19.4%, respectively, depending on the analyzed days with a large percentage of the agricultural areas within the SHI boundaries. Therefore, an original approach to delineate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) is proposed. This approach reduced the extent of the GZM SHI by 2.9 to 2.0%, depending on the day. In the GZM, more than 70% of the SHI consisted of discontinuous urban fabric and industrial or commercial units. Heat island indices recognized the spatial structure of SUHI as an archipelago. Vegetation and crops constituted 90% of the SCI, and these land cover types explained most of the SCI variability over time compared to the SHI. The vegetation expanded, and its characteristics continually changed during the summer season. Moreover, vegetation was more sensitive to changes in meteorological conditions than impervious surfaces. The LST was most strongly correlated with the percentage share of artificial areas in the GZM districts. In turn, the correlations between LST and forest and semi natural areas were much weaker when precipitation occurred before the recording of satellite images. The intensity of SUHI in the GZM ranged from approximately 5 to 9 degrees C depending on the date and the method of identifying urban and nonurban areas.

T2  - FORENSISCHE PSYCHIATRIE PSYCHOLOGIE KRIMINOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is intuitively and scientifically undisputed that the police profession carries an inherent risk of victimization by violence; however, it is scientifically untenable that the risk of violence among police officers in Germany is omnipresent and has increased dramatically in recent years. In this view, common intuition overrides available evidence. In our article, we take a closer look inside the police force and identify exactly the narrative that announces a smoldering danger of violence. As we show, the narrative has a system: the danger narrative shows itself in metaphors such as the "danger radar", individual descriptions, abbreviated representations of statistics or the selective handling of external scientific data. Aggregated to form a coherent worldview, the narrative is presented in police training, in technical papers and textbooks, and in important advocacy groups of the German police force, thus stabilizing itself in a process of reciprocal references.

TI  - Prevalence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in mosquitoes and animals of the Asian continent: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral zoonotic disease that has been found in several countries of Asia and is responsible for high mortality and morbidity of men and animals in rural and sub-urban endemic areas due to the virus re-circulation among diverse hosts and vectors. The present study estimates the prevalence of the JE virus in the vector and animal population of the Asian continent using a systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods: The Cochran collaborators' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis [PRISMA] guidelines were used for systematic review and meta-analysis. The heterogeneity was observed in meta-regression analysis due to several factors including region, species, and different diagnostic assays used in various studies. Thus we did sensitivity and subgroup analysis.Results: The prevalence of the JE virus was calculated using a total sample size of 47,391. Subgroup analysis revealed the JE virus prevalence of 39% in the Southeast Asia region, followed by East Asia with 35% and South Asia with 15% prevalence. Hence, the overall pooled prevalence of the JE virus was 26% in the Asian continent.Conclusions: The highest proportion of infection was found in pigs amongst all animals, reinforcing the fact that they can be used as sentinels to predict outbreaks in humans. The findings of this study will enable researchers and policymakers in better understanding the disease's spatial and temporal distribution, as well as in creating and implementing location-specific JE prevention and control measures.

AB  - We deployed two GPS collars and one innovative harness-mounted GPS backpack with Iridium or Globalstar satellite data transmission on feral pigs in mountain rainforest with deep valleys in New Caledonia during the hot wet season. Both collar and backpack with Iridium transmission achieved high success rates of locations and the rate increased with decreasing interval length between locations. The collar with Globalstar transmission had very low fix rates at 13-h intervals and was insufficient to produce robust results. The backpack harness was still functional after 20 months of use and proved to be a reliable alternative to collars.

TI  - Assessment and feasibility of the potential artificial groundwater recharge in semi-arid crystalline rocks context, Biteira district, Sudan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sudan, up to date, artificial recharge with surface water has been rarely investigated in papers. This paper proposed a method to identify and evaluate a potential site for artificial recharge of groundwater in the Biteira district. The targeted area lies in the southern part of Sudan and is underlain by basement rocks. The population's growth, alongside climate change which caused desertification, has augmented water resources' stress over recent years. Moreover, an alternative water resource of groundwater is essential due to limited aquifers. The research integrates the geology, geomorphology, hydrometeorology, and soil texture of the area coupled with infiltration tests data to overcome this problem. In addition, an analysis of the Landsat image to obtain lineaments and geological structures has been done. The results show the average infiltration rate is 2.35 m3/m2, and ground-water flow is estimated to be WWN direction. The study area is suitable for groundwater recharge in case of the construction of a check dam as infrastructure that can pave, favour promoting the artificial recharge. The surface storage capacity achieved at the site for recharge purposes is 20.73 x 10(6) m(3). (C) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Remote estimates of soil organic carbon using multi-temporal synthetic images and the probability hybrid model
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a key role in soil function, ecosystem services, and the global carbon cycle. Digital SOC mapping is essential for agricultural production management. Digital SOC mapping based on multi -source remote sensing data has been integrated well into prediction models and methodological approaches on different mapping scales. However, the mixed use of synthetic images and the application of the hybrid model considering the soil classification probability are rare. Here, we propose a probability hybrid model to estimate and map SOC content and distribution. Multi-temporal synthetic images were used to build the probability hybrid model. One hundred forty topsoil samples were collected in Suihua, a city in a typical black soil region in China. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the bare soil periods between 2018 and 2021. Minimum, maximum, mean, and median synthetic images were calculated using single images from the same period. The random forest and support vector machine models were used for discriminating soil class and calculating soil classification probability, and then random forest regression model was applied to SOC mapping. Soil class mapping and classification probability were performed for Phaeozems, Chernozems, and Cambisols of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) based on soil texture, climatic factors, and the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Based on soil class mapping results, global models using single temporal images and multi-temporal images, the hybrid model using multi-temporal images for the three soil classes as well as a probability hybrid model using multi-temporal images were built and compared their SOC predictions. Our study showed that (1) Phaeozems, Chernozems and Cambisols could be classified accurately, and the overall validation accuracy of random forest model was 91.67%. (2) The correlations of SOC with bands and band indices improved using multi-temporal images, and the use of mixed synthetic images was better than the use of only one synthetic image. (3) The hybrid model performed far better than the global models, and the probability hybrid model led to the highest prediction accuracy, a validation R2 of 0.77 and an RMSE of 2.30 g kg(- 1). (4) The probability hybrid model was more accurate than the original hybrid model for digital SOC mapping, and the SOC distri-bution in boundary regions was smoother and more continuous. Our results suggest that the probability hybrid model has a large potential for SOC prediction and mapping.

T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the problem that the smart phone GPS positioning technology cannot guarantee the location accuracy in the scenic spot navigation system, a tourist spot matching method based on the improved HMM model was proposed. Firstly, the traditional linear road model is improved in electronic map design. Secondly, the concept of minimum peripheral error rectangle is proposed based on the theory of error ellipse. Then, combined with location data, road data, and scenic spot data, the improved HMM model is used to calculate the matching road. Finally, Matlab simulation experiment and comparison experiment are carried out. The results show that the accuracy of the map matching algorithm based on the improved HMM model can reach 94.5%, and the average accuracy can reach 93.1%, which is 3.6% higher than that of the traditional HMM model. The test results show that the proposed algorithm is correct and practical and has a good application prospect.

TI  - Sugarcane abandonment mapping in Rio de Janeiro state Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of sugarcane plantations and their changes is relevant to the economy and the environment, notably due to sugarcane's interface in the biofuel industry through ethanol. The necessary mapping of sugar-cane crop changes is especially challenging when plantation occurs under smallholders' land ownership struc-tures used for heterogeneous crop management. We evaluated two approaches to address this challenge with the example of sugarcane abandonment in the Norte Fluminense Region, Northeastern Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The region is characterized by a large share of smallholders. We trained a random forest classifier for sugarcane for 2018 based on all available Landsat imagery. Based on the concept of temporal generalization, we applied the classifier trained in 2018 for the period from 1986 until 2020. The resulting annual sugarcane probability maps were used as input for two abandonment mapping methods: LandtrendR and muti-temporal cropland aban-donment mapping. The performance of both approaches was evaluated based on a stratified sampling approach. We detected three distinct trajectories for sugarcane farmland: i) permanently abandoned sugarcane, ii) fallow sugarcane, and iii) and stable sugarcane. The multi-temporal cropland abandonment mapping performed better for the sugarcane abandonment class (F1 = 0.84) than the LandtrendR approach (F1 = 0.21). The LandtrendR results revealed a higher omission (PA = 0.12) in mapping the sugarcane abandonment class. For the multi -temporal cropland abandonment mapping, we found that 66% (67,353 ha) of the stable sugarcane areas were abandoned between 1990 and 2016. The highest abandonment rates occurred between 1990 and 1994 and between 2010 and 2016. The spatial distribution of abandonment was heterogeneous. The earliest abandonment was concentrated in the northern part of the study area. The most recent abandonment was more extensive in the southern part of the study site. Our results highlight the advantages and challenges of using Landsat time series to map sugarcane abandonment in a heterogeneous management system. Our results also highlight the spatially and temporal heterogeneous pattern of sugarcane abandonment in the region and provide the necessary database for subsequent studies to identify underlying and proximate causes for the abandonment.

TI  - Services and evidence of irremediable market failure in rich countries: Australian experience
T2  - ECONOMIC AND LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A large and increasing share of economic activity in modern rich economies can be shown to lie outside what mainstream neoclassical economics itself says it can be applied to: according to neoclassical economics, such activities are unsuited to markets. Since World War II rich economies have de-industrialised, shifted to services. Since the 1970s neoclassical economics has come to dominate policy advice. This worldview justifies state interventions when there is remediable market failure, but it ignores irremediable market failure, where its theory says that markets cannot work efficiently (such as where there is joint production or own consumption). Servicisation, this article argues, has increased and is increasing the extent to which neoclassical economics is, in its own terms, 'knowably ignorant'. This is because, where service provision is subject to irremediable market failure, neoclassical economics, in its own terms, is inapplicable. The GDP [Gross Domestic Product] share of sub-sectors serving diverse human needs, such as aged care and education, is large and rising. Such sub-sectors are dominated by joint production, manifest as diverse outputs (complex and inter-related changes in the welfare of their diverse clients). Setting aside questions of the wider 'scientific' validity of neoclassical theory, the article focuses on its assertion that markets cannot generate economically efficient outcomes in such activities. Arguing that the constrained optimisation of its conceptual world cannot happen in the case of joint production and own consumption of service outputs, neoclassical theory reports itself as unable to determine optimal resource allocation, and so by implication cannot fulfil its role as the foundational basis of state economic policy. Yet the literature shows that the coverage of this theoretical result is not publicised - it is 'knowable' but not widely known. The article concludes that, as neoclassical economics is foundational to contemporary state policy, both GDP data and neoclassical theory show that it, and markets, are knowably and increasingly inapplicable. Therefore, mainstream policy thinking continues to face an increasing 'state of ignorance', and the cognitive foundations of state policy are correspondingly weak. JEL codes: A13, B20

TI  - Quantification of the effect of host patch configuration on the abundance of <i>Bemisia tabaci</i> in central Argentina: a multimodel inference approach
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bemisia tabaci is a complex of species, which is considered the most common and important pest of a wide range of crops belonging to many different botanical families. In Argentina, this species is recognized as a vector of geminiviruses, and Middle East-Asia Minor 1, Mediterranean, New World and New World 2 have been found to coexist in the same area. Landscape elements, like habitat patch area and isolation, define the habitat configuration and have a direct effect on insect populations between and within host patches. In this paper, we analyse the effect of potato patch configuration on the distribution and abundance of B. tabaci. Potato patches were identified using Landsat TM5 and TM7 images, and a supervised classification was performed to quantify the spatial distribution of the patches in the whole study area. Potato patch metrics were estimated using Fragstats 4.4. Generalized linear mixed models were employed to analyse the relationship between whiteflies and landscape configuration, through a multimodel inference approach, finding that B. tabaci abundance and landscape metrics were very variable. After a multimodel selection process, we found that perimeter-to-area ratio and Euclidean distance between patches were the variables that best explained whitefly abundance in potato patches. Implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - Width-Based Discharge Partitioning in Distributary Networks: How Right We Are
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - River deltas are home to large populations and can be composed of complex channel networks which convey flows of matter to the shoreline. Knowledge of flow within individual channels is needed to quantify the distribution of discharge across the delta, and thus its sustainability over time. Due to a lack of field measurements at the local channel scale, researchers leverage remote sensing data to estimate the partitioning of flow. We compare data from 15 river deltas to discharge partitioning estimates based on channel network graphs derived from remote sensing imagery. We quantify errors in the common width-based method and test alternative partitioning techniques to find that width-based discharge partitioning is universally applicable, suggesting that absent any site-specific information, discharge partitioning by average channel width is an appropriate approach. We also provide networks, streamflow measurements, and flux partitioning estimates for 28 delta networks as the Discharge In Distributary NeTworks (DIDNT) dataset.

TI  - Character focalisation and its function in the story of<i> Susanna</i>
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The characters in a story can function as vehicles that carry the message(s) that the implied author intends to convey to the implied readers as they read the story. Characterisation is, as it were, the artistry the implied author uses to shift the intended reader's worldview. Whilst there have been many insightful scholarly contributions on Susanna, the use of character focalisation and its possible function have never been explored. It remains open for investigation. This article examines the way in which characters are focalised in Susanna and how their role contributes to the implied reader's ability to grasp the possible intended message of the story. The article concludes that focalisation offers a useful interpretive angle from which Susanna can be studied. Contribution: The article proves that characterisation and the narrator's role in the story are not a literary decoration to the text but a well-intended process that aims at inviting participation and decision-making from the implied reader.

TI  - Detection of Different Properties of Ionospheric Perturbations in the Vicinity of the Korean Peninsula After the Hunga-Tonga Volcanic Eruption on 15 January 2022
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports different properties of ionospheric perturbations detected to the west and south of the Korean Peninsula after the Hunga-Tonga volcanic eruption on 15 January 2022. Transient wave-like total electron content (TEC) modulations and intense irregular TEC perturbations are detected in the west and south of the Korean Peninsula, respectively, about 8 hr after the eruption. The TEC modulations in the west propagate away from the epicenter with a speed of 302 m/s. Their occurrence time, propagation direction and velocity, and alignment with the surface air pressure perturbations indicate the generation of the TEC modulations by Lamb waves generated by the eruption. The strong TEC perturbations and L band scintillations in the south are interpreted in terms of the poleward extension of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs). We demonstrate the association of the EPBs with the volcanic eruption using the EPB occurrence climatology derived from Swarm satellite data.

TI  - Impact of the revisit frequency on cloud climatology for CALIPSO, EarthCARE, Aeolus, and ICESat-2 satellite lidar missions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Space profiling lidars offer a unique insight into cloud properties in Earth's atmosphere and are considered the most reliable source of total (column-integrated) cloud amount (CA), and true (geometrical) cloud top height (CTH). However, lidar-based cloud climatologies suffer from infrequent sampling: every n days, and only along the ground track. This study therefore evaluated four lidar missions, namely CALIPSO (revisit every n = 16 d), EarthCARE (n = 25), Aeolus (n = 7), and ICESat-2 (n = 91), to test the hypothesis that each mission provides accurate data on CA and CTH. CA/CTH values for a hypothetical daily revisit mission were used as reference (data simulated with Meteosat 15 min cloud observations, assumed to be a proxy for ground truth). Our results demonstrated that this hypothesis is invalid, unless individual lidar transects are averaged over an area 10 x 10 degrees in longitude and latitude (or larger). If this is not the case, the required accuracy of 1 % (for CA) or 150 m (for CTH) cannot be met, either for a single-year annual or monthly mean, or for a > 10 year climatology. A CALIPSOfocused test demonstrated that the annual mean CA estimate is very sensitive to infrequent sampling, and that this factor alone can result in 14 % or 7 % average uncertainty with 1 or 2.5 degrees resolution data, respectively. Consequently, applications that use gridded lidar data should consider calculating confidence intervals, or a similar measure of uncertainty. Our results suggest that CALIPSO, and its follow-on mission EarthCARE, are very likely to produce consistent cloud records despite the difference in sampling frequency.

TI  - Intraoperative sentinel lymph node evaluation in patients with node-positive breast cancer status post neoadjuvant systemic therapy- An institutional experience
T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown the feasibility and utility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with biopsy proven node-positive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We reviewed our experience in intra-operative SLN evaluation in such cases and its effect on axillary management. A retrospective analysis of breast cancer patients (2015-2018) with a biopsy-proven positive axillary lymph node, who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy and underwent intraoperative SLN assessment was performed. Intraoperative SLN assessment results were compared with final pathology. Its accuracy and effect on axillary management is summarized. We identified 106 patients with positive axillary lymph node and neoadjuvant systemic therapy between the ages of 28 and 75 years who had SLN biopsy and lumpectomy (33) or mastectomy (73). Three or more SLNs were identified in 91 cases (86 %). The previously biopsied lymph node was identified as one of the sentinel lymph nodes in 93 cases (88 %). There is a high concordance rate between frozen section diagnosis and final diagnosis on sentinel lymph nodes. No false positive case and seven false negative frozen section diagnosis cases (diagnosed as negative on frozen section and positive on permanent sections) were identified. False-negative frozen section diagnosis correlated with low-volume nodal disease and obscuring tumor bed changes. Almost half of the positive lymph nodes were converted to negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. SLN biopsy with intraoperative frozen section evaluation after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in node-positive patients is an effective way to minimize axillary surgery.

TI  - Deep learning empowers the Google Earth Engine for automated water extraction in the Lake Baikal Basin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatial and temporal water distribution in the Lake Baikal Basin, which hosts the freshwater lake with the most water storage in the world, is essential to understand the water resources and environment of the basin and its impact and influence in terms of climate change and disaster prevention and mitigation. The basin spans two countries, Russia and Mongolia, which, along with its vastness, makes it challenging to accurately automate the acquisition of large-scale and long-term series data. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is capable of processing large amounts of remote sensing imagery but does not support the computation and application of deep learning models. This study uses a combination of local deep learning training and GEE cloud-based big data intelligent computing to empower GEE with deep learning computing power, enabling it to rapidly automate the deployment of deep learning models. Visible light, near infrared (NIR), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), short-wave infrared 1 (SWIR1), linear enhancement band (LEB), and digital elevation model (DEM), which are more sensitive to water bodies, were selected as input features, along with the optimized input features of the existing pixel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This method corrects the initial water labels from the Landsat quality assessment bands to reduce the time cost of manually drawing the labels and improving the classification accuracy of the water bodies. On average, only 1-2 h are required to generate the results for each water body product for each period in Lake Baikal Basin. The extraction of water bodies from the Lake Baikal Basin was achieved for nine yearly periods between 2013 and 2021. The validation accuracy was 92.9 %, 92.7 %, and 92.4 % for the three years 2013, 2017 and 2021, respectively. The results showed that the mean area of water bodies in the basin was 37,500 km2 and that the area of water bodies in the basin fluctuated without significant change from 2013 to 2021. This study provides methodological support for the continuous monitoring and assessment of water body dynamics at more catchment scales and other large scenarios.

TI  - Changes in extreme daily precipitation over Africa: Insights from a non-asymptotic statistical approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme precipitation heavily affects society and economy in Africa because it triggers natural hazards and contributes large amounts of freshwater. Understanding past changes in extreme precipitation could help us improve our projections of extremes, thus reducing the vulnerability of the region to climate change. Here, we combine high-resolution satellite data (1981-2019) with a novel non-asymptotic statistical approach, which explicitly separates intensity and occurrence of the process. We investigate past changes in extreme daily precipitation amounts relevant to engineering and risk management. Significant (alpha = 0.05) positive and negative trends in annual maximum daily precipitation are reported in -20 % of Africa both at the local scales (0.05 degrees) and mesoscales (1 degrees). Our statistical model is able to explain -90% of their variance, and performs well (72% explained variance) even when annual maxima are explicitly censored from the parameter estimation. This suggests possible applications in situations in which the observed extremes are not quantitatively trusted. We present results at the continental scale, as well as for six areas characterized by different climatic characteristics and forcing mechanisms underlying the ongoing changes. In general, we can attribute most of the observed trends to changes in the tail heaviness of the intensity distribution (25% of explained variance, 38% at the mesoscale), while changes in the average number of wet days only explain 4% (12%) of the variance. Lowprobability extremes always exhibit faster trend rates than annual maxima (-44% faster, in median, for the case of 100-year events), implying that changes in infrastructure design values are likely underestimated by approaches based on trend analyses of annual maxima: flexible change-permitting models are needed. No systematic difference between local and mesoscales is reported, with locally-varying impacts on the areal reduction factors used to transform return levels across scales.

TI  - Is Nodal Clipping Beneficial for Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In cN1 patients rendered cN0 with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the false-negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is < 10% when >= 3 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are removed. The added value of nodal clipping in this scenario is unknown. Here we determine how often the clipped node is a sentinel node when >= 3 SLNs are retrieved. Methods We identified cT1-3N1 patients treated between 02/2018 and 10/2021 with a clipped lymph node at presentation. SLNB was performed with a standardized approach of dual-tracer mapping and retrieval of >= 3 SLNs. Clipped nodes were not localized; SLNs were X-rayed intraoperatively to determine clip location. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed for any residual disease or retrieval of Results Of 269 patients, 251 (93%) had >= 3 SLNs. Median age was 51 years; the majority (92%) had ductal histology; 46% were HR+/HER2-. The median number of SLNs removed was 4 (IQR 3,5). The clipped node was an SLN in 88% (220/251) of cases. Of the 31 where the clipped node was not, 13 had a positive SLN mandating ALND, and the clip was identified in the ALND specimen. In the remaining 18, where >= 3 negative SLNs were retrieved and an ALND was not performed, the clip was not retrieved, with no axillary failures in this group (median follow-up: 55 months). Conclusion When the SLNB procedure is optimized with dual tracer and retrieval of >= 3 SLNs, the clipped node is an SLN in the majority of cases, suggesting that failure to retrieve the clipped node should not be an indication for ALND.

TI  - Spanning scales: The airborne spatial and temporal sampling design of the National Ecological Observatory Network
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Each year, the National Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) collects high-resolution hyperspectral imagery, discrete and waveform lidar, and digital photography at a subset of 81 terrestrial and aquatic research sites throughout the United States. These open remote sensing data, together with NEON in situ sensor measurements and field observations, enable researchers to characterize ecological processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales. 2. Here we describe the sampling design for the AOP that aims to meet the diverse research needs of the ecological science community within the operational constraints affecting airborne data collection. Our spatial sampling protocol captures NEON instrumented systems, field plots and environmental gradients around each site while considering the context of airspace restrictions and remote sensing instrument capabilities. We use time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite and PhenoCam near-surface observations to define temporal sampling windows based on vegetation peak foliar greenness. We developed a probabilistic model based on MODIS reflectance imagery and Monte Carlo simulation to estimate sampling durations for cloud-free data collection at each site. 3. Agreement in the estimated phenophase transition dates between MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index and PhenoCam Green Chromatic Coordinate varied by vegetation class. Results from both sensors show that some vegetation classes have relatively consistent interannual peak greenness start- and end-dates, while others experience high year-to-year variability in green-up and senescence. In addition to phenological variability among sites, certain vegetation forms demonstrate distinct, asynchronous responses to climate, resulting in non-overlapping peak greenness periods within a single site. Results from flight campaigns showed that the cloud-likelihood model underestimated actual cloud conditions by 13%-26%, depending on the probability used. 4. Where interannual or intra-site phenology is highly variable or clouds are a persistent problem, it becomes challenging to schedule domain deployments so that all sites are flown in cloud-free conditions while their vegetation communities are in peak greenness. Despite limitations, application of cloud and peak greenness models to airborne sampling results in significant improvements to AOP data quality. Although most applicable to airborne sampling with hyperspectral and lidar instruments in piloted aircraft, these methods may be a valuable resource to deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for ecological research.

TI  - Transcatheter vacuum-assisted left-sided mass extraction with the AngioVac system
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To study the safety and efficacy of AngioVac for left-sided transcatheter vacuum-assisted mass extraction (TVME). Background The AngioVac system is approved for right-sided TVME and has emerged as an effective and safe alternative for open surgical treatment. The use of the AngioVac device for aspiration of left-sided TVME has been limited. Methods Consecutive patients from two Michigan centers who underwent left-sided TVME were included. Data on patient demographics, procedural information, in-hospital and follow-up events were collected through electronic medical records review. Technical success was defined as aspirating of 70%-100% of the material. Results Ten patients (mean age 58.3 [+/- 17.3] years, 50% male) were included. Indications for TMVE were in large for recurrent embolic events. All patients underwent bilateral cerebro-embolic protection using the Sentinel device. The total mean procedure time was 192.5 (+/- 47.5) min of which the meantime for active aspiration (bypass time) was 9.3 (+/- 4.2) min. The circuit configuration was: arteriovenous (AV) in four cases and arterioarterial (AA) in six cases. Successful aspiration was achieved in 80% of cases. No complications were reported (range follow-up 1-16 months). Conclusions Our small case series demonstrates the feasibility and safety of the AngioVac system in left-sided mass extraction. Larger trials are needed to further demonstrate its effectiveness and safety and potentially apply for on-label use.

TI  - Characterizing the calibration domain of remote sensing models using convex hulls
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ever-increasing availability of remote sensing data allows production of forest attributes maps, which are usually made using model-based approaches. These map products are sensitive to various bias sources, including model extrapolation. To identify, over a case study forest, the proportion of extrapolated predictions, we used a convex hull method applied to the auxiliary data space of an airborne laser scanning (ALS) flight. The impact of different sampling efforts was also evaluated. This was done by iteratively thinning a set of 487 systematic plots using nested sub-grids allowing to divide the sample by two at each level. The analysis were conducted for all alternative samples and evaluated against 56 independent validation plots. Residuals of the extrapolated vali-dation plots were computed and examined as a function of their distance to the model calibration domain. Extrapolation was also characterized for the pixels of the area of interest (AOI) to upscale at population level. Results showed that the proportion of extrapolated pixels greatly reduced with an increasing sampling effort. It reached a plateau (ca. 20% extrapolation) with a sampling intensity of ca. 250-calibration plots. This contrasts with results on model's root mean squared error (RMSE), which reached a plateau at a much lower sampling intensity. This result emphasizes the fact that with a low sampling effort, extrapolation risk remains high, even at a relatively low RMSE. For all attributes examined (i.e., stand density, basal area, and quadratic mean diameter) estimations were generally found to be biased for validation plots that were extrapolated. The method allows an easy identification of map pixels that are out of the calibration domain, making it an interesting tool to evaluate model transferability over an area of interest (AOI). It could also serve to compare "competing " models at a variable selection phase. From a model calibration perspective, it could serve a posteriori, to evaluate areas (in the auxiliary space) that merit further sampling efforts to improve model reliability.

TI  - Association of type II diabetes mellitus with characteristics and outcomes for patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can lead to an immunosuppressed state, but whether T2DM is associated with worse outcomes for patients with melanoma has not been well studied. Methods Consecutive patients diagnosed with clinical stage I-II cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at a single institution (2007-2016) were identified. Melanoma characteristics and recurrence/survival outcomes were compared between patients with and without T2DM at the time of melanoma diagnosis. Results Of 1128 patients evaluated, 111 (9.8%) had T2DM (n = 94 [84.7%] non-insulin dependent [NID-T2DM]; n = 17 [15.3%] insulin dependent [ID-T2DM]). T2DM patients were more likely to be older (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, p < 0.001), male (OR 2.15, p = 0.003), have tumors >1.0 mm (OR 1.88, p = 0.023), and have microsatellitosis (OR 2.29, p = 0.030). Five-year cumulative incidence of melanoma recurrence was significantly higher for patients with ID-T2DM (46.7% ID-T2DM vs. 25.7% NID-T2DM vs. 17.1% no T2DM, p < 0.001), and on multivariable analysis, ID-T2DM was independently associated with melanoma recurrence (hazard ratio 2.57, p = 0.015). No difference in 5-year disease-specific survival was observed between groups. Conclusions ID-T2DM appears to be associated with more advanced melanoma and increased risk for melanoma recurrence. Further study as to whether this reflects differences in tumor biology or host factors is warranted.

TI  - Complete Genome Sequences of One Salt-Tolerant and Petroleum Hydrocarbon-Emulsifying <i>Terribacillus saccharophilus</i> Strain ZY-1
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt tolerance is one of the most important problems in the field of environmental governance and restoration. Among the various sources of factors, except temperature, salinity is a key factor that interrupts bacterial growth significantly. In this regard, constant efforts are made for the development of salt-tolerant strains, but few strains with salt tolerance, such as Terribacillus saccharophilus, were found, and there are still few relevant reports about their salt tolerance from complete genomic analysis. Furthermore, with the development of the economy, environmental pollution caused by oil exploitation has attracted much attention, so it is crucial to find the bacteria from T. saccharophilus which could degrade petroleum hydrocarbon even under high-salt conditions. Herein, one T. saccharophilus strain named ZY-1 with salt tolerance was isolated by increasing the salinity on LB medium step by step with reservoir water as the bacterial source. Its complete genome was sequenced, which was the first report of the complete genome for T. saccharophilus species with petroleum hydrocarbon degradation and emulsifying properties. In addition, its genome sequences were compared with the other five strains that are from the same genus level. The results indicated that there really exist some differences among them. In addition, some characteristics were studied. The salt-tolerant strain ZY-1 developed in this study and its emulsification and degradation performance of petroleum hydrocarbons were studied, which is expected to widely broaden the research scope of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the oil field environment even in the extreme environment. The experiments verified that ZY-1 could significantly grow not only in the salt field but also in the oil field environment. It also demonstrated that the developed salt-tolerant strain can be applied in the petroleum hydrocarbon pollution field for bioremediation. In addition, we expect that the identified variants which occurred specifically in the high-salt strain will enhance the molecular biological understanding and be broadly applied to the biological engineering field.

TI  - Genetic parameters for productive traits and skin quality in Nile tilapia
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tilapia skin has been considered an important biomaterial in the treatment of burns and tissue reconstruction in vaginoplasty. Improvements in tilapia skin quality are of great interest to regenerative medicine. This study aimed to (i) estimate variance components and genetic parameters for growth traits, fillet yield, and skin quality; (ii) assess genetic associations between productive traits and skin thickness; and (iii) investigate the effect of groups with high (HGM) and low (LGM) genetic merit for skin thickness on the expression of genes encoding the alpha(2) and alpha(3) chains of type I collagen in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Components of variance, heritability, and genetic correlations were estimated for skin thickness (ST, measured in millimeters), fillet yield (FY, measured in percentage), and weight at harvest (WH, measured in grams). The database contained records of 1221 mean values of three measurements for ST, 1213 measurements for FY, and 3171 measurements for WH. The sample included animals from the tenth generation of selection of the Nile tilapia breeding program of the State University of Maringn, Brazil. For analysis of gene expression, skin samples were collected from fish with LGM and HGM for ST. Heritability estimates were high for WH (0.71), intermediate for ST (0.59), and moderate for FY (0.21). The repeatability coefficient of ST was high (0.66). The genetic correlation between ST and WH was high and strong (0.77), whereas that between ST and FY was not significant (-0.02). There was a significant difference (p = 0.038) in COL1A3 expression between HGM (7.38 AU) and LGM (4.88 AU) groups. The results indicated that it is possible to increase the thickness and amount of type I collagen fibers in tilapia skin through selection. Genetic correlations indicated that selection for WT positively impacts ST without influencing FY. Selection for weight gain proved to be an effective tool for the production of Nile tilapia skins more suitable for use as xenografts.

TI  - Transforming rituals: Creating cultural harmony among the Dou Mbawa of eastern Indonesia
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study revolves around the configurations of Dou Mbawa [People of Mbawa] in Bima, West Nusa Tenggara, eastern Indonesia, mapped onto the three main sociocultural-religious groups of Muslims, Christians and Parafu [followers of local beliefs]. It focuses on the Raju ritual as a 'text', representing social structures and dynamics of religious tension among the Dou Mbawa, which has been understudied in the existing works of literature. The central position of the Raju ritual is highlighted, as it is born from the cosmological worldview and simultaneously practised by all three religious groups annually. Such interwoven ambiguities occurred in the life of the Dou Mbawa, involving ideology, authority and agents or actors (religious elites), generating tension and confrontation that have led to Raju's transformation from religious expression to cultural adaptation. Using ethnographic data generated from 2019 to 2020, this study argues that a Raju ritual is a political act that merely reflects the ideology of its supporters and shapes their capital bases and communicative actions to respond to social segregations. Contribution: This article shows how the Raju ritual promotes cohesiveness and harmony for a religiously diverse community by creating a shared ethnic identity and exercising it as a cultural adaptation.

TI  - Research on Information Extraction of the Dongting Lake Ecological Wetland Based on Genetic Algorithm Optimized Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake is an important lake wetland in China. How to quickly and accurately obtain the basic information of the Dongting Lake ecological wetland is of great + significance for the dynamic monitoring, protection, and sustainable utilization of the wetland. Therefore, this article proposes the information extraction of the Dongting Lake ecological wetland based on genetic algorithm optimized convolutional neural network (GA-CNN), an analysis model combining genetic algorithm (GA) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, we know the environmental information of Dongting Lake, take Gaofen-1 image as the data source, and use normalized vegetation index and normalized water body index as auxiliary data to preprocess the change detection of remote sensing images to obtain high-precision fitting images. GA-CNN is constructed to efficiently extract the information of the Dongting Lake ecological wetland, and the Relu excitation function is used to improve the phenomenon of gradient disappearance and convergence fluctuation so as to reduce the operation time. Logistic regression is used for feature extraction, and finally the automatic identification and information extraction of the Dongting Lake ecological wetland are realized. The research results show that the method proposed in this article can more deeply dig the information of ground objects, express depth features, and has high accuracy and credibility.

TI  - Local and systemic therapy may be safely de-escalated in elderly breast cancer patients in China: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFor elderly patients with breast cancer, the treatment strategy is still controversial. In China, preoperative axillary lymph node needle biopsy is not widely used, resulting in many patients receiving axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) directly. Our study aims to determine whether local and systemic therapy can be safely de-escalated in elderly breast cancer. MethodsPatients aged >= 70 years were retrospectively enrolled from our institution's medical records between May 2013 and July 2021. Groups were assigned according to local and systemic treatment regimens, and stratified analysis was performed by molecular subtypes. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were used to compare the effects of different regimens on relapse-free survival (RFS). ResultsA total of 653 patients were enrolled for preliminary data analysis, and 563 patients were screened for survival analysis. The mean follow-up was 19 months (range, 1-82 months). Axillary lymph node metastases were pathologically confirmed in only 2.1% of cN0 cases and up to 97.1% of cN+ cases. In the aspect of breast surgery, RFS showed no significant difference between mastectomy and BCS group (p = 0.3078). As for axillary surgery, patients in the ALND group showed significantly better RFS than those in the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) group among pN0 patients (p = 0.0128). Among these cases, the proportion of cN+ in ALND was significantly higher than that in SLNB (6.4% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.002), which meant axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) of ALND patients were larger in imaging and more likely to be misdiagnosed as metastatic. With regard to adjuvant therapy, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that RFS in different comprehensive adjuvant regimens were similar especially among hormone receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- subgroup where patients who did not receive any adjuvant therapy accounted for 15.7% (p > 0.05). ConclusionsIt is feasible to reduce some unnecessary local or systemic treatments for elderly breast cancer patients, especially in HR+/HER2- subtype. Multiple patient-related factors should be considered when making treatment plans.

TI  - Evaluating global and regional land warming trends in the past decades with both MODIS and ERA5-Land land surface temperature data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global surface temperature has been setting new record highs in the recent decades, imposing increasing environmental challenges for societies and ecosystems worldwide. Global warming rates of the 20th century have been documented by a number of studies, nevertheless, the warming rates in the most recent decades in the 21st century are of particular interest for understanding the ongoing climate change. Analyzing temperature trends demands data with high spatial resolution and broad geographical coverage to allow for analyzing trends and changes on a regional scale. Land Surface Temperature data from NASA MODIS with global resolution of 0.05 & DEG; and Skin Temperature data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5-Land reanalysis with global resolution of 0.1 fulfill these demands. In this study, we analyze the remote-sensing -based MODIS data to estimate land surface temperature change rates over the period 2001-2020 in global, continental, and pixel-wise scales with statistical significance indicated. The model-based ERA5-Land data are also analyzed in parallel, extending the period of analysis back to 1981. These two independently-sourced datasets, one from satellites above the atmosphere and one from combining surface modeling and observations, are shown to produce highly consistent results. It is revealed that the trends in the shorter period 2001-2020 are spatially conforming to the trends in the longer period 1981-2020 despite the shorter time length. For the period 2001-2020, we show that the global average land surface temperature rate of change was 0.26 -0.34 C per decade, with substantially different warming rates in different regions. The Arctic, Europe, and Russia show statistically significant warming in both datasets. The Arctic, in particular, warmed at a rate 2.5-2.8 times the global average, and data in the 40-year period 1981-2020 suggest that warming is accelerating in almost all the continents or large regions. Most noticeably, the two independent datasets both indicate that Arctic permafrost regions had the world's highest warming rate at the onset of the 21st century, reaching > 2 ? per decade in some areas.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided radar reflector localization of axillary lymph nodes facilitates targeted axillary dissection
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated feasibility and patient outcomes for targeted axillary lymph node (LN) dissection (TAD) with SAVI SCOUT (R) ultrasound-guided radar reflector localization (RRL). Methods: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, 800 consecutive patients who underwent ultrasound-guided RRL between November 2017 and June 2020 were reviewed. Of these patients, those with axillary LN RRL were included in this study. Reports in the electronic medical record were reviewed to determine RRL placement, retrieval, and surgical outcomes. Results: A total of 147 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, axillary RRL was performed for biopsy-proven metastatic disease in 134 and inconclusive or benign biopsy in 13. RRL was successful in 146/151 lymph nodes (97%). Two patients had placement >10 mm from target and 3 had no post-placement signal. In all 5, the targets were successfully retrieved at surgery. Specimen radiographs were performed in 135 cases and confirmed the intended target in all 135 (100%). In 109 patients who underwent TAD + sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the RRL LN and the SLN(s) were different in 18 (17%). In 3 of these, the RRL LN was the only malignant LN (3%). In the 105 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 43% (45/105) achieved nodal pCR and 85% (89/105) had <3 metastatic lymph nodes at surgery. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided RRL of axillary LNs is a feasible approach to facilitate TAD with high placement and retrieval success rates. This enables TAD as an alternative to complete axillary LN dissection (cALND), sparing some patients with low nodal tumor burden from cALND.

TI  - Rates of pathologic nodal disease among cN0 and cN1 patients undergoing routine axillary ultrasound and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Routine axillary ultrasound (AxUS) in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains controversial. Here, we report rates of AxUS-detected nodal disease among patients with normal clinical exams, and rates of pathologic nodal disease after NAC based on method of nodal disease detection. Methods Clinicopathologic findings were prospectively collected for stage I-III breast cancer patients selected for NAC. All patients had pre-treatment AxUS, suspicious nodes were biopsied. The following four patient cohorts were examined: patients with suspicious exam or AxUS but negative biopsy (Suspicious cN0); those with normal exam and normal AxUS (Not Suspicious cN0); those with normal exam but suspicious AxUS and positive biopsy (AxUS-detected cN1); and those with abnormal exam and positive biopsy (exam-detected cN1). Sentinel (SLN) and non-sentinel lymph nodes (non-SLN) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry; nodal metastases of any size were considered positive. Results 500 patients were included. Of 310 patients with normal axillary exams, 160 had suspicious AxUS, 65 were biopsy-negative (Suspicious cN0) and 95/310 (30.6%) were biopsy-positive (AxUS-detected cN1). Of 190 with abnormal axillary exams, 166 were biopsy-proven node-positive (exam-detected cN1) and 24 were AxUS or biopsy-negative (Suspicious cN0). Rates of pathologic nodal disease were 20/150 (13.3%) among Not Suspicious cN0 patients, 12/89 (13.5%) among Suspicious cN0 (p = 0.97). Rates of residual nodal disease were 55/95 (57.9%) among AxUS-detected cN1 patients, 102/166 (61.4%) among exam-detected cN1 (p = 0.57). Conclusion AxUS detected nodal disease in 30.6% of patients with normal clinical exams selected for NAC. Rates of pathologic nodal disease were similar among AxUS-detected and exam-detected cN1 patients.

TI  - Fifty years of Landsat science and impacts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 1972, the Landsat program has been continually monitoring the Earth, to now provide 50 years of digital, multispectral, medium spatial resolution observations. Over this time, Landsat data were crucial for many scientific and technical advances. Prior to the Landsat program, detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth's surface were rare, and the ability to acquire and work with large datasets was limited. The early years of the Landsat program delivered a series of technological breakthroughs, pioneering new methods, and demonstrating the ability and capacity of digital satellite imagery, creating a template for other global Earth observation missions and programs. Innovations driven by the Landsat program have paved the way for subsequent science, application, and policy support activities. The economic and scientific value of the knowledge gained through the Landsat program has been long recognized, and despite periods of funding uncertainty, has resulted in the program's 50 years of continuity, as well as substantive and ongoing improvements to payload and mission performance. Free and open access to Landsat data, enacted in 2008, was unprecedented for medium spatial resolution Earth observation data and substantially increased usage and led to a proliferation of science and application opportunities. Here, we highlight key developments over the past 50 years of the Landsat program that have influenced and changed our scientific understanding of the Earth system. Major scientific and programmatic impacts have been realized in the areas of agricultural crop mapping and water use, climate change drivers and impacts, ecosystems and land cover monitoring, and mapping the changing human footprint. The introduction of Landsat collection processing, coupled with the free and open data policy, facilitated a transition in Landsat data usage away from single images and towards time series analyses over large areas and has fostered the widespread use of science-grade data. The launch of Landsat-9 on September 27, 2021, and the advanced planning of its successor mission, Landsat-Next, underscore the sustained institutional support for the program. Such support and commitment to continuity is recognition of both the historic impact the program, and the future potential to build upon Landsat's remarkable 50-year legacy.

TI  - Infestation patterns of incipient red turpentine beetle populations in fire-affected, logged and undisturbed forest stands of northern China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The red turpentine beetle (RTB) Dendroctonus valens is an alien invasive bark beetle that has become one of the most important pests of pine forests in China. In recent years, RTB has spread to the Heilihe area of northern China, where, within a short period of time, its population density has reached an incipient level. Understanding the attack behavior of RTB in the early stages of an infestation can help contain its population and avoid the transition from incipient to outbreak levels. In addition, numerous wildfires and illegal selective logging events in the Heilihe area give us the opportunity to study the attack behavior of RTB in forest stands with different disturbances. In the present study, we explored the infestation pattern of RTB in 20 wildfire-disturbed forests, 19 selectively logged forests and 42 undisturbed forests at the incipient population level. We measured stand and landscape-level variables, including stand mean diameter at breast height (DBH), canopy cover, aspect, elevation, slope and host connectivity. The landscape-level variable of host connectivity was extracted from a Sentinel2 image through graph theory. In disturbed stands, we also measured bole scorch height and the number of stumps as proxies for fire and logging intensity. Generalized linear models were used to determine the relative importance of these explanatory variables in RTB infestations. Our results showed that wildfire-disturbed and logged stands had higher RTB infestation levels than undisturbed stands and disturbance intensity was the most important predicting variable across all factors. Furthermore, stand mean DBH had a positive relationship with RTB attacks in disturbed stands. In undisturbed stands, stand-level factors such aspect and canopy cover were the main driving factors of RTB attacks rather than host connectivity. However, the role of host connectivity shifted in wildfire-disturbed stands with high fire intensity, where interconnected stands promoted RTB infestations at the 500 m and 700 m scales. Our findings are valuable for identifying stands that are more vulnerable to RTB attacks and prioritizing management interventions aimed at controlling beetle populations.

TI  - Effects of satellite temporal resolutions on the remote derivation of trends in phytoplankton blooms in inland waters
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite temporal resolutions are vital for the timely detection of phytoplankton blooms in inland waters using satellite observations due to rapid phytoplankton migration and reproduction. However, the effects of satellite temporal resolutions on the remote derivation of trends in phytoplankton have not yet been assessed. To address this issue, we first used the daily Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived phyto-plankton blooms in a typical bloom-frequent lake (Lake Taihu, China) between 2001 and 2020 to simulate a series of phytoplankton bloom data sets with temporal resolutions of 2 days to 30 days. We then revealed the differences in the trends of the phytoplankton blooms and their responses to the climatic factors derived from these data sets; we subsequently quantified the relationships between the differences and the temporal resolu-tions at daily, monthly, and yearly scales. We found that there were significant inconsistencies in the trends in the phytoplankton bloom areas derived from the simulated series data sets with different temporal resolutions; the relations of the MODIS-derived phytoplankton bloom areas to those derived from the simulated series data sets became weaker as the temporal resolutions of the simulated series data sets decreased; the responses of the phytoplankton blooms to the climatic factors quantified by the simulated series data sets were also varied with the temporal resolutions at daily, monthly, and yearly scales. These results from simulated data were also validated by satellite data of Lake Taihu, Lake Chaohu, and Lake Dianchi, three eutrophic lakes in China. In brief, our results cautioned against the use of satellite data with low temporal resolutions to reveal long-term phy-toplankton-bloom dynamics.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of H8/AHI geostationary observations for monitoring vegetation phenology over different ecosystem types in northern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensors onboard the new generation of geostationary (GEO) satellites launched over past few years have much improved radiometric and temporal resolutions. As one of the latest GEO sensors, the Japanese Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (hereafter H8/AHI) has temporal resolution of 10 minutes and spectral bands similar to MODIS. Observations from H8/AHI therefore have the potential to improve the precision of vegetation phenology monitoring by significantly shortening the compositing period. In this study, we evaluated methods for compositing daily 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) from 10-minutes H8/AHI observations at six study sites in northern China encompassing forest, cropland, and grassland. After screening the cloudy obser-vations by a physics-based cloud detection algorithm, key phenological metrics were retrieved from the composited AHI EVI2. H8/AHI 10-min raw EVI2 showed significant diurnal variations that are mainly associated with sun angle variations. By calculating the daily average EVI2 values in different time intervals, we concluded that the mean value using a fixed time window (10:30-13:30) centered around local solar noon effectively reduced the anisotropy effect from the diurnal sun-angle variations, leading to stable EVI2 time series suitable for extracting phenological metrics. On average, the amount of the composited H8/AHI EVI2 time-series data was 5.3 times more than the Terra/Aqua combined MODIS EVI2 product per year and the average size (width) of the gaps in H8/AHI EVI2 time series was 75% smaller than that of the MODIS. Our results demonstrated the promising capability of the new generation GEO satellite for generating time series vegetation index with fewer cloud-induced gaps and higher temporal resolution, hence improving the monitoring of global vegetation phenology and ecosystem responses to climate change.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation and sustainability of NDVI in the Yellow River basin
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately determining vegetation coverage and its changes is very important to detect the effectiveness of the Grain for Green Project (GGP) in vegetation construction in the Yellow River basin. Moreover, an understanding of the impact of human activities and the future trends of vegetation cover allows for more effective maintenance of the achievements of ecological construction. Based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of SPOT/VEGETATION satellite remote sensing data from 2000 to 2017, the spatiotemporal patterns of the vegetative cover in the Yellow River basin in the last 18 years were studied using linear regression, residual analysis, and the Hurst index. The vegetation coverage of the Yellow River basin was higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest, with a relatively slow growth trend. The whole basin NDVI was relatively stable, and only approximately one-fifth of the region had a large fluctuation, mainly distributed in Ningxia and northern Shaanxi. The residual trend of the NDVI was positive in 87% of the areas in the basin, and the overall impact of human activities on the increase in NDVI was mainly promoted. The characteristics of vegetation change in the future with the same directionality were stronger than the reverse characteristics, but the area showing continuous degradation in the future still accounted for 7%, mainly distributed in Xining City, Lanzhou City, Ningxia Plain, Hetao Plain, etc., which needs further strengthening of ecological construction and protection. This study is helpful for predicting and evaluating the vegetation dynamics of the Yellow River basin under the background of GGP implementation and provides a theoretical basis for regional environmental protection and the future adjustment of GGP work.

TI  - High-resolution satellite-based cloud detection for the analysis of land surface effects on boundary layer clouds
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The observation of boundary layer clouds with high-resolution satellite data can provide comprehensive insights into spatiotemporal patterns of land-surface-driven modification of cloud occurrence, such as the diurnal variation of the occurrence of fog holes and cloud enhancements attributed to the impact of the urban heat island. High-resolution satellite-based cloud-masking approaches are often based on locally optimised thresholds that can be affected by the local surface reflectance, and they therefore introduce spatial biases in the detected cloud cover. In this study, geostationary satellite observations are used to develop and validate two high-resolution cloud-masking approaches for the region of Paris to show and improve applicability for analyses of urban effects on clouds. Firstly, the Local Empirical Cloud Detection Approach (LECDA) uses an optimised threshold to separate the distribution of visible reflectances into cloudy and clear sky for each individual pixel accounting for its locally specific brightness. Secondly, the Regional Empirical Cloud Detection Approach (RECDA) uses visible reflectance thresholds that are independent of surface reflection at the observed location. Validation against in-situ cloud fractions reveals that both approaches perform similarly, with a probability of detection (POD) of 0.77 and 0.69 for LECDA and RECDA, respectively. Results show that with the application of RECDA a decrease of cloud cover during typical fog or low-stratus conditions over the urban area of Paris for the month of November is likely a result of urban effects on cloud dissipation. While LECDA is representative for the widespread usage of locally optimised approaches, comparison against RECDA reveals that the cloud masks obtained from LECDA result in regional biases of +/- 5 % that are most likely caused by the differences in surface reflectance in and around the urban areas of Paris. This makes the regional approach, RECDA, a more appropriate choice for the high-resolution satellite-based analysis of cloud cover modifications over different surface types and the interpretation of locally induced cloud processes. Further, this approach is potentially transferable to other regions and temporal scales for analysing long-term natural and anthropogenic impacts of land cover changes on clouds.

TI  - An integrated dataset of daily lake surface water temperature over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a critical physical property of the aquatic ecosystem and an evident indicator of climate change. By combining the strengths of satellite-based observation and modeling, we have produced an integrated daily LSWT for 160 lakes across the Tibetan Plateau where in situ observation is limited. The MODIS-based lake-wide mean LSWT in the integrated dataset includes the daytime, nighttime, and daily mean for the period 2000-2017. The MODIS-based daily mean LSWT is used to calibrate a simplified physically based model (i.e., modified air2water model), upon which a complete and consistent daily LSWT dataset is reconstructed for the period 1978-2017. The reconstructed LSWT dataset is validated by comparing it with both the satellite-based and in situ observations. The validation shows that the reconstructed LSWT is in good agreement with the observations. According to the reconstructed LSWT dataset, the annual LSWT of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau has increased significantly in the period 1978-2017 with an increase rate ranging from 0.01 to 0.47 degrees C per 10 years. The warming rate is higher in winter than in summer. The integrated dataset is unique for its relatively large temporospatial span (1978-2017) and high temporal resolution. The dataset together with the methods developed can contribute to research in exploring water and heat balance changes and the consequent ecological effects at the Tibetan Plateau. Data from this study are openly available via the Zenodo portal, with DOI https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6637526 (Guo et al., 2022).

TI  - The use of remotely sensed data to model habitat selections of pileated woodpeckers<i> (Dryocopus</i><i> pileatus)</i> in fragmented landscapes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and four-channel red, green, blue, and near-infrared (RGBI) remote sensed imageries allow an accurate quantification and contiguous measurement of vegetation characteristics and forest structures. This information facilitates the generation of habitat structure variables for forest species distribution modelling. However, applications of remote sensing data, especially the combination of structural and spectral information, to support evidence-based decisions in forest managements and conservation practices at local scale are not widely adopted. In this study, we examined the habitat requirements of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) (PW) in Hamilton County, Ohio, using ecologically relevant forest structural and vegetation charac-teristics derived from LiDAR and RGBI data. We hypothesized that the habitat of PW is shaped by vegetation characteristics that are directly associated with the availability of food, hiding and nesting resources, the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within home range, as well as proximity to water sources. We used 186 PW presence or absence locations to model their presence and absence in generalized additive model (GAM) at two scales, representing foraging and home range size, respectively. The results confirm PW's preference for tall and large mature stands with structural complexity, typical of late-successional or old-growth forests. Besides, the crown size of dead trees shows a positive relationship with PW occurrence, therefore indicating the importance of declining living trees or early-stage dead trees within PW home range. These locations are preferred by PW for nest cavity excavation as it attempts to balance the ease of excavation and tree security. In addition, we found that PW can adjust its travel distance to the nearest water resource, suggesting that habitat fragmentation can have certain impacts on PW. Based on our findings, we recommend that forest managers should use different priorities to manage nesting, roosting, and feeding habitats. Particularly, when devising forest management and hazard tree removal plans, one needs to consider retaining enough cavity trees within high-quality PW habitat. By mapping PW habitat suitability for the study area, we highlight the importance of riparian corridor in facilitating PW to adjust to the fragmented urban landscape. Indeed, habitat improvement for PW in the study area could be achieved by conserving riparian corridors and promoting riparian forest succession along major rivers in Hamilton County.

TI  - Effect of functional anisotropy on the local dynamics of polymer grafted nanoparticles
T2  - SOFT MATTER
M3  - Article
AB  - End-functionalised polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) form bonds when their coronas overlap. The bonded interactions between the overlapping PGNs depend on the energy of the bonds (L1). In the present study, oscillatory deformation imposed on a simple system with interacting PGNs placed on the vertices of a triangle is employed to examine the local dynamics as a function of energy of the bonds and the frequency of oscillation relative to the characteristic rupture frequency, omega(0) = 2(pi)nu exp(-U/k(B)T), of the bonds. In particular, the effect of functional anisotropy is studied by introducing bonds of two different energies between adjacent PGNs. A multicomponent model developed by Kadre and lyer, Macromol. Theory Simul., 2021, 30, 2100005, that combines the features of effective interactions between PGNs, self-consistent field theory and master equation approach to study bond kinetics is employed to obtain the local dynamics. The resulting force-strain curves are found to exhibit a simple broken symmetry where F-x (gamma,(gamma)over dot) not equal -F-x (-gamma,(gamma)over dot) and F-gamma (gamma,(gamma)over dot) not equal F-gamma (-gamma, -(gamma)over dot) in systems with functional anisotropy. Fourier analysis of the dynamic response reveals that functional anisotropy leads to finite even harmonic terms and systematic variation of both the elastic and dissipative response from that of the isotropic systems. Furthermore, the intra-cycle variations in the strain stiffening and shear thickening ratios obtained from the analysis indicate that functional anisotropy leads to anisotropic nonlinear response.

TI  - Reduction in turbidity of Indian lakes through satellite imagery during COVID-19 induced lockdown
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The lakes of India are getting significantly polluted due to the rapid growth of industries, plastics, and anthropogenic waste. Due to the non-functioning of the industries and human activities during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, industrial and other waste going to the lakes was significantly reduced. Moreover, with the reduction of human activities and tourism in the cities and lakes, anthropogenic pollution in the lakes was also reduced. Turbidity is the key indicator of water pollution in the lakes. It has a direct relationship with surface water reflectance and can be estimated through satellite imagery. In this paper, the relative comparison of turbidity values of five Indian lakes in the Rajasthan state was done through Satellite imagery of Sentinel-2 during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period. The relative turbidity is also calculated through reflectance values of Satellite images and then the empirical method is applied to the reflectance values of the red band of Sentinel-2 & Landsat-8 data to estimate the turbidity. Relative comparisons of turbidity values estimated through satellite imagery during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period showed that the turbidity of lakes was reduced in Kaylana Lake (49.6%), Fatehsagar Lake (55.4%), Pichola Lake (54.3%), Rajsamand Lake (58.3%), and Man Sagar Lake (44.8%) during the lockdown period. Spectral curve analysis also showed that there was a decrease in the surface water reflectance in all five lakes and this indicates the reduction in the turbidity of the water during the lockdown period.

TI  - Accurate water extraction using remote sensing imagery based on normalized difference water index and unsupervised deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale monitoring of surface water bodies is of great significance to the sustainable development of regional ecosystems. Remote sensing is currently the main method of global earth observation. On the one hand, the traditional water index is simple and efficient, but it relies on a fixed global threshold, which leads to low accuracy for water extraction. On the other hand, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in classification of spectral data, but it consumes a substantial amount of manpower and time to label sufficient high-quality samples. Furthermore, spectral characteristics of water bodies in different areas vary greatly due to changes in atmospheric conditions and viewing geometry. In this paper, we propose a new accurate water extraction framework based on unsupervised deep learning and NDWI of multispectral images. Binarized NDWI images are used to identify potential water bodies, and deep learning training is performed using these pseudo samples and labels. This process realizes the conversion from unlabeled learning to noisy label learning. First, we proposed a simple and fast binarization algorithm to segment as many real water bodies as possible from NDWI images. Then a set of water confidence assessment rules was constructed from the four aspects of the spectrum, shape, agglomeration, and range. The water segments were scored and sorted to make the model start learning from easy samples and gradually advance to complex samples. Finally, the adjusted co-teaching learning strategy is adopted to filter errors introduced by noisy labels through peer networks with different learning capabilities during training. We tested the accuracy of our method using Gaofen Image Dataset (GID), Sentinel-2 and Landsat images of several water bodies in China. Compared with other methods, our method improved the F1 score by 18.1-40.3% and 6.8-22.2% for GID and Sentinel-2 images, respectively. In addition, our method is more stable in long-term water monitoring. The proposed method has the potential to be used for extracting water bodies with high accuracy on a large scale, especially in areas with complex environments and a lack of deep learning samples. And it provides a new idea for unsupervised learning in the current remote sensing field by fully combining remote sensing expertise and spectral information of ground objects.

TI  - Exploring grassland ecosystem water use efficiency using indicators of precipitation and soil moisture across the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland ecosystem dominates in the Mongolian Plateau, mostly located in its arid and semi-arid regions. Although the ecosystem is an important source for agriculture, it is also a fragile system ecologically. This system is one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change. Precipitation (PPT) and soil moisture (SM) are important water sources in the grassland ecosystem, and their changes would greatly affect vegetation growth. This paper generates the precipitation use efficiency (PUE) and soil water use efficiency (SWUE) of Mongolian Plateau grassland based on multi-source remote sensing data to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution pattern and identify the driving factors. Results showed four main findings. Firstly, two water use efficiency (WUE) indicators show a generally increasing trend from 2000 to 2018, with average PUE and SWUE 1.07 gCmiddotm(-2)middotmm(-1) and 1.03 gC/kgmiddotH(2)O, respectively. They have similar spatial distribution patterns, consistent with the available water resources, decreasing from northeast to southwest. However, grassland vegetation growth is more sensitive to soil moisture than precipitation, and the dynamic change of SWUE is smoother and more significant than PUE. Secondly, due to the higher species richness, better vegetation biological characteristics and less severe growth environment, meadow grassland has the highest PUE and SWUE, followed by typical grassland and desert steppe. Thirdly, PUE and SWUE are relatively low in extremely arid and humid regions. In areas with relatively moderate water conditions (PPT in 148-360?mm, SM in 0.14-0.35?cm(3)/cm(3)), two indicators increase with the abundance of moisture conditions and reach the maximum. Fourthly, there is a positive linear relationship between PUE (SWUE) with precipitation and a unimodal correlation between PUE (SWUE) with temperature across the entire grassland. However, a varying correlation exists in different grassland ecosystems, especially meadow grassland. Together with analyzing past and future trends, this study provides strong evidence to reflect the impact of global climate change and the management and protection of the grassland ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Assessment of soil loss rate using GIS-RUSLE interface in Tashat Watershed, Northwestern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The erosion of soil is one of the most difficult and ongoing problems caused by deforestation, improper cultivation, uncontrolled grazing, and other anthropogenic activities. As a result, assessing the level and quantity of soil erosion is essential for agricultural productivity and natural resource management. Thus, the goal of this study was to quantify soil loss rates and identify hotspot locations in the Tashat watershed, Abay basin, Ethiopia. Thematic factor maps, comprising rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topography factor (LS), cover and management factor (C), and conservation practices factor (P), were integrated using remote sensing data and the GIS 10.3.1 environment to estimate soil loss using RUSLE. The findings indicated that the watershed annual soil loss varies from none in the lower part to 3970.6 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the middle, with a mean annual soil loss of 64.2 t ha(-1) year(-1). The total estimated annual soil loss was 61,885,742.9 tons from the total watershed area of 48,348.4 ha. The majority of these soil erosion-affected places are geographically located in the watershed middle steepest slope portion, where Cambic Arenosols with higher soil erodibility character than other soil types in the research area predominate. Thus, sustainable soil and water conservation techniques should be implemented in the steepest middle section of the study area by respecting and acknowledging watershed logic, people, and watershed potentials.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a key control on water, energy, and carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. Because vegetation canopies are heterogeneous, spatially explicit information related to seasonality in vegetation activity provides valuable information for studies that use eddy covariance measurements to study ecosystem function and land-atmosphere interactions. Here we present a land surface phenology (LSP) dataset derived at 3 m spatial resolution from PlanetScope imagery across a range of plant functional types and climates in North America. The dataset provides spatially explicit information related to the timing of phenophase changes such as the start, peak, and end of vegetation activity, along with vegetation index metrics and associated quality assurance flags for the growing seasons of 2017-2021 for 10 x 10 km windows centred over 104 eddy covariance towers at AmeriFlux and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. These LSP data can be used to analyse processes controlling the seasonality of ecosystem-scale carbon, water, and energy fluxes, to evaluate predictions from land surface models, and to assess satellite-based LSP products.

TI  - Characterization of portuguese sown rainfed grasslands using remote sensing and machine learning
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are crucial ecosystems that support and provide a diverse number of ecosystem services. Sown biodiverse pastures rich in legumes (SBP) were developed with the main goal of increasing grassland production while minimizing fertilizers inputs. In this paper, the main properties of SBP in Portugal were estimated using remote sensing and machine learning in six different farms and two production years (spring 2018 and 2019). Four pasture characteristics were considered: aboveground standing biomass, fraction of legumes, plant nitrogen (N) content and plant phosphorus (P) content. Remote sensing data were obtained from Sentinel-2. The spectral bands combined with 5 vegetation indices and 9 covariates were used. Multiple linear regression, LASSO, Ridge, random forests, XGBoost and LightGBM regression models were used. Two cross-validation approaches were used: (1) a random approach with random selection of the folds (RN-CV), and (2) a structured approach where each fold is a unique combination of farm and year, which is subsequently used to assess the performance of the model obtained with the 8 other folds (LLYO-CV). Results showed that the random forest method had the best estimation accuracy for all pasture characteristics. Regarding cross-validation approaches, the algorithms with RN-CV have higher estimation accuracy for all pasture characteristics (on average about 10% lower RMSE and an R-2 85% higher), as compared to the algorithms with LLYO-CV. However, LLYO-CV should avoid overfitting and improve generalization of the models because in each fold the model is tested in a farm and year that was not used for training. The RMSE for all variables were significantly low, especially in RN-CV. Plant P is the variable where the choice of CV approach has the least influence (RMSE of test set with RN-CV: 0.71 g P kg(- 1); LLYO-CV: 0.72 g P kg(- 1)). Standing biomass is the variable with the highest difference between CV approaches (RN-CV: 722 kg ha(- 1); LLYO-CV: 825 kg ha(- 1)). The RMSE, of legumes and plant N were moderately affected by the CV approach (legume RN-CV: 0.11; LLYO-CV: 0.12 - plant N RN-CV: 3.96 g N kg(- 1); LLYO-CV: 3.99 g N kg(- 1)). The algorithms developed here were applied for entire parcels in the two farms with the most different climate conditions as demonstration of their potential future use for precision farming.

TI  - Climate change risk and terror management theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Being intrinsically associated with death-related themes (e.g. decay, destruction, lack of control, chaos), communicating climate change risks may elicit thoughts in an audience about their own mortality - potentially invoking terror management responses. This study examined individual differences in death-thought accessibility (DTA) amongst Australian university students (N=241) after exposure to information about climate change impacts, to predict climate change risk perceptions. It was posited that information about the impacts of climate change would lead to worldview defence (a terror management strategy) via increasing death-related thoughts. Although climate change salience did not invoke DTA, there was evidence that choosing not to complete word-fragments in a death-related manner reflected a high death-defensive response, rather than low-DTA. Compared with a control condition, climate change salience participants' risk perceptions shifted liberally. The function of death-related thoughts depended on the individual's climate change beliefs. Climate-deniers with high-DTA in the climate change salience condition showed greater risk perceptions compared to those with high-DTA in the control condition. Risk perceptions did not change as a function of DTA amongst climate-acceptors. A general implication was that climate change communications, may not produce counterproductive terror management outcomes as has been previously hypothesized. Rather they may motivate more realistic attitudes, such as perceiving climate change as high-risk, even amongst climate-deniers. From a policy perspective, to maximise acceptance, climate change information may benefit from being presented within frameworks that support individuals important personal worldviews.

TI  - Atopic dermatitis: Is innate or adaptive immunity in control? A clinical perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with barrier defects and immune dysregulations. The pathogenesis of AD involves the physical barrier as well as epithelial cells, which are considered a vital part of the innate immunity of the skin. The importance of filaggrin mutations in the pathogenesis of AD has also been well-established with reproducible results around the world in multiple studies and ethnic groups. This protein plays an important role in skin barrier functions and further reaffirms barrier defects as one of the primary causes of AD. The main epithelial cells, keratinocytes, function as a major sentinel for the skin in detecting danger signals or microbial pathogens, and trigger downstream immune responses. In AD, these cells express TSLP, IL-33 and IL-25, which lead to downstream systemic production of type 2 cytokines. In spite of major advances in our understanding of the innate immunity of AD, recent success in the systemic therapeutics of AD have focused on targeting the products of the adaptive immunity, particularly cytokines produced by T cells. In addition to type 2 cytokines, type 17 cytokines have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The current review examines the implications of these cytokines in AD from clinical perspectives.

AB  - Monitoring the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) pools is critical for sustainable soil and agricultural management. This case study models total and active organic carbon dynamics (2015/2016 to 2019/2020) using digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques. Model predictors include topographic variables generated from light detection and ranging data; soil and vegetation indices derived from Landsat satellite images; and soil and crop inventory information from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada to predict total organic carbon (TOC) and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXc) at the 0-15 cm depth increment for a 37 km2 study area in Truro, Nova Scotia. Quantile Regression Forest and stochastic Gradient Boosting Model were utilized for prediction. Although both models performed equally well for predicting TOC and POXc, the accuracy of TOC predictions (e.g., concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) = 0.67) was better than POXc predictions (e.g., CCC = 0.53). The Landsat variables and crop inventory were dominant predictors, while topographic variables across the relatively homogeneous terrain had relatively little influence. During the study period, changes in POXc were predicted across 98% of the study area, with a mean absolute loss of 5.77 (+/- 11.48) mg/kg/year, and in TOC on 27% of the area, with a mean absolute loss of 0.15 (+/- 0.09) g/kg/year. While the annual crop fields observed the highest loss of TOC and POXc, the decline in pasture-grassland-forage fields was relatively low. The study reinforced the effectiveness of DSM for modeling multiple SOC pools at the farm to landscape scales.

TI  - Reassessment of carbon emissions from fires and a new estimate of net carbon uptake in Russian forests in 2001-2021
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Russia has the largest forest area on earth. Its boreal forests officially store about 97 Pg C, which significantly affect the global carbon cycle. In recent years, forest fires have been intensifying on the planet, leading to increased carbon emissions. Here we review how differences in fire control management of Russian forests affect fire related emissions. Carbon emissions due to fire were estimated using satellite data and compared to official reports for 2001-2021. We found that the relative areas affected by fire did differ between different fire protection zones, and 89 % of the area burnt was in forests controlled by fire-fighting aircraft or areas without protection. As a result, 417.7 Mha of poor or unprotected Russian forests (42 % of total) account about a half of total carbon emissions. According to our estimates, the average area of burnt forests in Russia was about 8.3 Mha per year between 2016 and 2021, resulting in annual carbon emission of 193 million metric tons (Mt) C emissions, and 53 % of them were from unprotected forest. These estimated carbon emissions are significantly higher than official national reports (79 Mt C yr(-1)). We estimated that net carbon uptake for Russia for 2015-2021 was about 333 +/- 37 Mt C, which is roughly double the official estimates. Our results highlight large spatial differences in fire protection and prevention strategies in fire related emissions. The so-called control zone which stretches across large parts of Eastern Russia has no fire control and is the region of major recent fires. Our study shows that to estimate the Russian forest carbon balance it is critical to include this area. Implementation of some forest management in the remote areas (i.e., control zone) would help to decrease forest loss and resulting carbon emissions.

TI  - De-escalating Surgery Among Patients with HER2+and Triple Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review De-escalation of surgery has been central in the evolution of multidisciplinary management of breast cancer. Advances in oncology and increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) have opened opportunities for further surgical de-escalation especially for HER2 + and triple negative (TN) disease. The aim of this review is to discuss the recent data on de-escalation of surgery as well as the future directions. Recent Findings Patients with TN and HER2 + breast cancer with excellent response to NACT would be the ideal candidates for surgical de-escalation. Post-NACT image-guided biopsy, potentially combined with machine learning algorithms, may accurately identify patients achieving pathologic complete response that would be eligible for clinical trials assessing safety of omission of breast and axillary surgery. Multidisciplinary research is required to further support results of preliminary studies. Current data point towards a future when even less or no surgery may be required for exceptional responders.

TI  - IrriMap_CN: Annual irrigation maps across China in 2000-2019 based on satellite observations, environmental variables, and machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural irrigation, as an important practice to protect crops from drought and promote grain yield, has a long history in China. A timely and precise dataset about the extent and dynamics of irrigated areas is necessary for water allocation and agricultural management but is scarce in China. Here we developed annual irrigated cropland maps across China (IrriMap_CN) at 500-m resolution from 2000 to 2019, using MODIS data, machine-learning method, and Google Earth Engine platform. First, we generated annual nationwide training samples by strictly screening the existing irrigation maps downscaled from the statistical data. Second, we implemented locally adaptive random forest classifiers in 511 nominal 1 x 1 grid cells across China with MODIS vegetation indices, climatic factors, and topography variables. Third, we conducted nationwide pixel-wise validation of the IrriMap_CN using independent samples. The validation results based on more than 3000 ground truth points revealed that IrriMap_CN had high accuracies ranging from 77.2% to 85.9%. The time series of IrriMap_CN detected substantial expansion of irrigated areas in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang (more than 50% in total) and pronounced decreases in Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Hebei. The analyses of irrigation frequency, start time, and end time implied that North China Plain was the most intensive irrigated area; but the irrigation area showed a decreasing trend since 2000, consistent with the reduced agricultural water consumption. The annual irrigation datasets allow us to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigated croplands in China and are expected to contribute to the improvement of earth system models and facilitate sustainable agricultural water management.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided transversus thoracic muscle plane-pectoral nerve block for postoperative analgesia after modified radical mastectomy: a comparison with the thoracic paravertebral nerve block
T2  - PERIOPERATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is the most effective and common type of invasive surgery for breast cancer. However, it causes moderate to severe acute pain and even lasts for a long postoperative period. Transversus thoracic muscle plane-pectoral nerve block (TTP-PECS) is a novel and promising interfacial plane block which can provide analgesia for MRM while thoracic paravertebral nerve block (TPVB) is also widely used for this purpose. This study compared the postoperative analgesia between the ultrasound-guided TTP-PECS and TPVB in patients undergoing MRM. Methods In this randomized controlled trial, eighty female breast cancer patients undergoing unilateral MRM with sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and axillary dissection (ALND) were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided TTP-PECS (TTP-PECS group, n = 40) or TPVB (TPVB group, n = 40) with 0.5% ropivacaine 30 ml. Evaluated variables included 24 h postoperative total PCA fentanyl consumption, including PCA background consumption and PCA press consumption (per bolus dosage multiply by the effective pressing times), and intraoperative fentanyl consumption, as well as postoperative flurbiprofen axetil requirement, duration of analgesia, blocking area, pain intensity at rest and during activity, ability to reduce the inflammatory response, and the quality of recovery 40 (QoR-40) score of patients. Results Compared with the TPVB, the main blocking area was T-2-T-6 in the TTP-PECS group, which was more suitable for the MRM. TTP-PECS has a longer analgesia duration than TPVB; 24 h postoperative total PCA fentanyl consumption, especially the PCA press consumption, and the postoperative flurbiprofen axetil requirement were decreased in the TTP-PECS group than those in the TPVB group. Furthermore, the VAS scores at rest and during activity and inflammatory response were lower in the TTP-PECS group compared with the TPVB group at 12 h postoperatively. Finally, the total QoR-40 score, especially for the scores of pain; emotional state; and patient support were better in the TTP-PECS group. Conclusion Compared with the TPVB, TTP-PECS can provide better postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing MRM, simultaneously reduce the inflammatory response, and prompt early recovery. These results suggest that TTP-PECS is an attractive alternative to TPVB for postoperative analgesia of modified radical mastectomy.

TI  - Implementation of the 'PicNic' handover huddle: A quality improvement project to improve the transition of infants between paediatric and neonatal intensive care units
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Thorough handover and effective communication are crucial to the transfer of clinical information between different intensive care units. Following a sentinel patient safety event, an improvement project was initiated to reduce patient safety risks associated with the transfer of complex patients between the neonatal and paediatric intensive care. Methods A handover tool was implemented over a 4-month period, guiding handover through means of a handover huddle. The tool ensured a full ISBAR (Introduction, Situation, Background, Assessment, Response) handover, with a specified attendance register. It acknowledged specific safety points inclusive of outstanding investigations, procedural history and medication transcription. Post implementation, huddle checklist sheets were audited for compliance and a staff satisfaction survey was conducted. Results Thirty-nine handovers took place during this trial period, of which 69% were captured in the huddle process. Senior medical and nursing staff attendance was greater than 95% throughout the process, and 100% of huddles attended to a full ISBAR handover. Sixty staff satisfaction survey responses were received, 90% of which identified the process to improve the safety of patient handover. Responses also identified safety issues such as discontinuity of medication transcription between the units, and inappropriate patient transfers occurring outside of working hours. Qualitative feedback highlighted how the tool improved interdepartmental educational and collaboration opportunities. Conclusions The 'PicNic' huddle effectively facilitated a standardised handover between paediatric and neonatal intensive care. It also recognised the importance of interdepartmental collaboration and education surrounding culturally different clinical practices. Further improvement cycles continue to progress the tool and initiate a digital format for ongoing use.

TI  - Adoption of digital technologies in agriculture-an inventory in a european small-scale farming region
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As digitalization in the agricultural sector has intensified, the number of studies addressing adoption and use of digital technologies in crop production and livestock farming has also increased. However, digitalization trends in the context of small-scale farming have mainly been excluded from such studies. The focus of this paper is on investigating the sequential adoption of precision agriculture (PA) and other digital technologies, and the use of multiple technologies in a small-scale agricultural region in southern Germany. An online survey of farmers yielded a total of 2,390 observations, of which 1,820 operate in field farming, and 1,376 were livestock farmers. A heuristic approach was deployed to identify adoption patterns. Probable multiple uses of 30 digital farming technologies and decision-support applications, as well as potential trends of sequential technology adoption were analyzed for four sequential points of adoption (entry technology, currently used technologies, and planned short-term and mid-term investments). Results show that Bavarian farmers cannot be described as exceedingly digitalized but show potential adoption rates of 15-20% within the next five years for technologies such as barn robotics, section control, variable-rate applications, and maps from satellite data. Established use of entry technologies (e.g., automatic milking systems, digital field records, automatic steering systems) increased the probability of adoption of additional technologies. Among the most used technologies, the current focus is on user-friendly automation solutions that reduce farmers' workload. Identifying current equipment and technology trends in small-scale agriculture is essential to strengthen policy efforts to promote digitalization.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence guided surgery: State of the evidence from a health technology assessment perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Different applications of near-infrared fluorescence-guided surgery are very promising, and techniques that help surgeons in intraoperative guidance have been developed, thereby bridging the gap between preoperative imaging and intraoperative visualization and palpation. Thus, these techniques are advantageous in terms of being faster, safer, less invasive, and cheaper. There are a few fluorescent dyes available, but the most commonly used dye is indocyanine green. It can be used in its natural form, but different nanocapsulated and targeted modifications are possible, making this dye more stable and specific. A new active tumor-targeting strategy is the conjugation of indocyanine green nanoparticles with antibodies, making this dye targeted and highly selective to various tumor proteins. In this mini-review, we discuss the application of near-infrared fluorescence-guided techniques in thoracic surgery. During lung surgery, it can help find small, non-palpable, or additional tumor nodules, it is also useful for finding the sentinel lymph node and identifying the proper intersegmental plane for segmentectomies. Furthermore, it can help visualize the thoracic duct, smaller bullae of the lung, phrenic nerve, or pleural nodules. We summarize current applications and provide a framework for future applications and development.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Methods in Breast Cancer
T2  - SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer diagnosed in women worldwide. Accurate lymph node staging is essential for both prognosis (of early-stage disease) and treatment (for regional control of disease) in patients with breast cancer. The sentinel lymph nodes are the regional nodes that directly drain lymph from the primary tumor. No imaging modality is accurate enough to detect lymph node metastases when a primary breast cancer is at an early stage (I or II), but sentinel lymph node biopsy is a highly reliable method for screening axillary nodes and for identifying metastatic (including micro-metastatic) disease in regional lymph nodes. Despite the widespread use of sentinel lymph node biopsy for early-stage breast cancer, relevant variations have been described regarding practical aspects of the procedure, and some variability has initially been reported regarding the rates of intraoperative sentinel lymph node identification and of false-negative findings, most likely because of differences in the size of the populations being investigated and in lymphatic mapping techniques. Nev-ertheless, using adequate learning curves and once a multidisciplinary team is experienced with the procedure, improved levels of accuracy are achieved.

TI  - Heavy precipitation events in northwestern China induced by northeastward plateau vortex: Two cases comparison
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The plateau vortex is one of the dominant weather systems that modulate summer rainfall in northwestern China, a typical arid/semi-arid area worldwide. Two heavy rainfall cases in the summer of 2012 and 2013, accompanying the northeastward movement of plateau vortexes, are selected here. The role of plateau vortexes in these two cases is explored by diagnosing their moist potential vorticity, helicity, and convective clouds characteristics, using numerous data (ERA-Interim reanalysis, multi-sourced precipitation data, FY-2E satellite images). The plateau vortexes enhanced convective instability in the rainfall area by entraining upper-level dry and cold air, manifested as salient vertical gradients of moist potential vorticity and steep pseudo-equivalent potential temperature isolines. The rainfall occurred eastward relative to the vortex movement track and intensified on the left of cloud black body temperature (TBB) with larger gradients at the middle to late stages of the vortex life span. The generation of moisture helicity is dictated by the water vapor transportation, with the negative value concentrated in the water vapor-rich areas. Notably, the two cases differ in tracks, life spans, water vapor sources, and precipitation amounts, which may be attributed to large-scale circulation background, vertical vortex structure, and moisture condition.

TI  - Development of China's first space-borne aerosol-cloud high-spectral-resolution lidar: retrieval algorithm and airborne demonstration
T2  - PHOTONIX
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols and clouds greatly affect the Earth's radiation budget and global climate. Light detection and ranging (lidar) has been recognized as a promising active remote sensing technique for the vertical observations of aerosols and clouds. China launched its first space-borne aerosol-cloud high-spectral-resolution lidar (ACHSRL) on April 16, 2022, which is capable for high accuracy profiling of aerosols and clouds around the globe. This study presents a retrieval algorithm for aerosol and cloud optical properties from ACHSRL which were compared with the end-to-end Monte-Carlo simulations and validated with the data from an airborne flight with the ACHSRL prototype (A2P) instrument. Using imaging denoising, threshold discrimination, and iterative reconstruction methods, this algorithm was developed for calibration, feature detection, and extinction coefficient (EC) retrievals. The simulation results show that 95.4% of the backscatter coefficient (BSC) have an error less than 12% while 95.4% of EC have an error less than 24%. Cirrus and marine and urban aerosols were identified based on the airborne measurements over different surface types. Then, comparisons were made with U.S. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) profiles, Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the ground-based sun photometers. High correlations (R > 0.79) were found between BSC (EC) profiles of A2P and CALIOP over forest and town cover, while the correlation coefficients are 0.57 for BSC and 0.58 for EC over ocean cover; the aerosol optical depth retrievals have correlation coefficient of 0.71 with MODIS data and show spatial variations consistent with those from the sun photometers. The algorithm developed for ACHSRL in this study can be directly employed for future space-borne high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) and its data products will also supplement CALIOP data coverage for global observations of aerosol and cloud properties.

TI  - Deep learning in multimodal remote sensing data fusion: A comprehensive review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - With the extremely rapid advances in remote sensing (RS) technology, a great quantity of Earth observation (EO) data featuring considerable and complicated heterogeneity are readily available nowadays, which renders researchers an opportunity to tackle current geoscience applications in a fresh way. With the joint utilization of EO data, much research on multimodal RS data fusion has made tremendous progress in recent years, yet these developed traditional algorithms inevitably meet the performance bottleneck due to the lack of the ability to comprehensively analyze and interpret strongly heterogeneous data. Hence, this non-negligible limitation further arouses an intense demand for an alternative tool with powerful processing competence. Deep learning (DL), as a cutting-edge technology, has witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in numerous computer vision tasks owing to its impressive ability in data representation and reconstruction. Naturally, it has been successfully applied to the field of multimodal RS data fusion, yielding great improvement compared with traditional methods. This survey aims to present a systematic overview in DL-based multimodal RS data fusion. More specifically, some essential knowledge about this topic is first given. Subsequently, a literature survey is conducted to analyze the trends of this field. Some prevalent sub-fields in the multimodal RS data fusion are then reviewed in terms of the to-be-fused data modalities, i.e., spatiospectral, spatiotemporal, light detection and ranging-optical, synthetic aperture radar-optical, and RS-Geospatial Big Data fusion. Furthermore, We collect and summarize some valuable resources for the sake of the development in multimodal RS data fusion. Finally, the remaining challenges and potential future directions are highlighted.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, influenza surveillance systems in Spain were transformed into a new syndromic sentinel surveillance system. The Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance System (SiVIRA in Spanish) is based on a sentinel network for acute respiratory infection (ARI) surveillance in primary care and a network of sentinel hospitals for severe ARI (SARI) surveillance in hospitals. Methods Using a test-negative design and data from SARI admissions notified to SiVIRA between January 1 and October 3, 2021, we estimated COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization, by age group, vaccine type, time since vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Results VE was 89% (95% CI: 83-93) against COVID-19 hospitalization overall in persons aged 20 years and older. VE was higher for mRNA vaccines, and lower for those aged 80 years and older, with a decrease in protection beyond 3 months of completing vaccination, and a further decrease after 5 months. We found no differences between periods with circulation of Alpha or Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants, although variant-specific VE was slightly higher against Alpha. Conclusions The SiVIRA sentinel hospital surveillance network in Spain was able to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARI hospitalizations and provide estimates of COVID-19 VE in the population under surveillance. Our estimates add to evidence of high effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against severe COVID-19 and waning of protection with time since vaccination in those aged 80 or older. No substantial differences were observed between SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha vs. Delta).

TI  - A new digital soil mapping method with temporal-spatial-spectral information derived from multi-source satellite images
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed soil maps are essential for effective agricultural practices and environmental protection. Yet, despite the increasing accuracy of digital soil mapping (DSM) in recent years, generating regional-scale, high-accuracy soil maps remains a challenging task. Our study objective was to propose a new DSM method based on temporal -spatial-spectral (TSS) data and to compare the DSM result with a legacy soil map of China. In this study, 13 Landsat multispectral data from 2000 to 2019 were fused by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to obtain tem-poral information, a shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model (SRTM-DEM) was used as spatial information, and Gaofen-5 satellite hyperspectral data was used as spectral information. TSS information was obtained after the DWT and spectral band segmentation methods were used to fuse the temporal and spectral information, combined it with the spatial information. Then, the TSS information and random forest model were used for DSM. The results indicated that 1) The mapping result based on TSS information was highly correlated with the legacy soil map. In different soil classes, there were minute differences in the core area and large dif-ferences in adjacent soil classes between the two maps. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of DSM based on TSS information were 88.11% and 0.82, respectively. 2) With the same values of the soil moisture, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of DSM based on hyperspectral data were 6.80% and 0.02, respectively, higher than those based on multispectral data. 3) With increasing temporal information, the DSM accuracy continuously increased, and the mapping accuracy based on multi-temporal multispectral data was higher than that based on mono-temporal hyperspectral data when the number of multi-temporal multispectral images reached 6. 4) The DSM accuracy was effectively improved when terrain factors were considered, and the terrain factors featuring a strong separability for various soil classes differed. The DSM method proposed in this study based on TSS in-formation from multi-sources remote sensing data greatly improved the DSM accuracy and provided new insight for future DSM research.

TI  - Intraseasonal interactive effects of successive typhoons characterize canopy damage of forests in Taiwan: A remote sensing-based assessment
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind gusts and rainfall from tropical cyclones can heavily damage forest canopies, leading to abrupt changes in forest structure and tree demography. Although many studies have shown that successive tropical cyclones can interact with each other through residual effects, the role of past disturbances is unclear because they may lead to damage amplification of the second cyclone because of weakened forest structure, or damage reduction of the second cyclone because of previous damage to susceptible trees. We investigated the interaction between consecutive cyclones between 2001 and 2017 for five well-conserved forests in Taiwan, which experiences an average of 1.75 typhoons annually. Using MODIS imagery, we computed the typhoon-induced change of a canopy vegetation index, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII). The effects of successive typhoons were assessed separately for typhoons occurring within a single year (annual analysis) and within two consec-utive years (biennial analysis). We used mixed effect models of reductions in NDII, a measurement of canopy damage, in relation to target and past typhoon characteristics and damage magnitude. NDII reduction induced by preceding typhoons was slightly more important and statistically significant in explaining the variation in NDII reduction associated with the target typhoon in the annual than in the biennial analysis, where the effect was non-significant. Canopy damage did not always decrease across typhoons occurring within the same season, however, for most successive typhoons in the biennial analysis, the second cyclone caused equal or less canopy damage (16 out of 21 typhoon pairs). These results support the idea that residual interactive effects of previous typhoons decrease quickly over time and rarely last for several typhoon seasons for Taiwanese forests, contributing to their high resistance to frequent typhoon disturbance.

TI  - Locating a cultural identity in the use of metaphorical proverbs among the Tai Ahoms of Assam: a study through oral literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is an attempt to explore the role of Tai Ahom proverbs as a marker of cultural identity in the realm of postmodern society. Using or choosing culturally driven speech in communication is a linguistic behaviour which reflects the character of the people, their worldview, and thus their uniqueness or difference from the 'other'. In another way, this might be a conscious way of projecting self. This qualitative study on proverbs of Tai Ahom language and culture adopts the methods of ethnography and textual analysis. A cultural hermeneutic model, along with the participant observation method, was used to collect the data. Finally, the Tai Ahom community of Sivasagar district of Assam, India was chosen as the locus for the research. The findings show that the proverbs are deeply woven by the Ahom community's cultural heritage, history, pride, advice, and satire. Hence, this article provides an insight into Tai Ahoms' way of living and their worldview. In locating the Tai Ahom's cultural identity within the homogenised bigger community of 'Assamese' or akhomiya, this study could help in understanding the differences or uniqueness of the Tai Ahom and thereby the Assamese identity in the present context.

TI  - Changes in air quality during and after large-scale social restriction periods in Jakarta city, Indonesia
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 outbreak has constrained human activities in Jakarta, Indonesia during the large-scale social restriction (LSSR) period. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the spatial variation of air pollutants over Jakarta during and after the LSSR periods. This study used satellite retrievals such as OMI, AIRS, and MERRA-2 satellite data to assess spatial variations of NO2, CO, O-3, SO2, and PM2.5 from May to June 2020 (during the LSSR period) and from July to August 2020 (after the LSSR period) over Jakarta. The satellite images were processed using GIS software to increase the clarity of the images. The relationship between air pollutants and meteorological data was analyzed using Pearson correlation. The results showed the levels of NO2, PM2.5, O-3, and CO increased by 59.4%, 21.2%, 16.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, while SO2 decreased by 19.1% after the LSSR period. The temperature value was inversely correlated with PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 concentrations. Furthermore, the backward trajectory analysis revealed that air pollutants from outland areas such as the east and southeast carried more particulate matter and gases pollutants, which contributed to the air pollution during and after the LSSR periods. As a whole, the COVID-19 outbreak had bad impacts on human health, but the increase in air pollutants levels after loosening the LSSR policy could also lead to a higher risk of severe respiratory diseases. This study provides new insight into air pollutant distribution during and after LSSR periods and recommends an effective method of mitigating the air pollution issues in Jakarta.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme Precipitation is a weather hazard that affects the society directly and harmfully. Because of the process involved in the formation of precipitation at several spatial and temporal scales, the forecast of precipitation is still challenging the weather models. The aim of this work is to evaluate the impact of initial condition on the modelling of extreme precipitation by the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) limited area model ALADIN (Aire Limitee Adaptation dynamique Developpement INternational) at 10 km horizontal resolution. The case study corresponds to the extreme flooding event of November 29-30, 2010 across Morocco with daily precipitation reaching 178 mm over Casablanca city. A detailed description of the atmosphere dynamic during this event is given to help the understanding of the precipitation generation. Several experiments were performed to assess the impact of conventional and satellite data. Furthermore, sensitivity studies were carried out for the surface initialisation and the start mode. The assimilation experiment with an optimal setting had produced dynamical fields that were more favourable for the heavy precipitation occurrence. The evaluation of precipitation forecast has been performed by comparison to the surface precipitation observations. The results showed that the combined surface/upper-air assimilation of both conventional and satellite observations produced a clear improvement in term of precipitation location and intensity forecast.

TI  - Stability analysis of Shiwei-Labudalin Highway in Inner Mongolia, Northeastern China using Sentinel-1 InSAR
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost in Northeastern China has significantly degraded due to global warming, deforestation and urbani-zation in the last few decades. The frost heave and thaw subsidence induced by freeze-thaw cycles of deep seasonal frozen ground have caused serious damage to infrastructures. The Shiwei-Labudalin (Shi-La) Highway is an important infrastructure connecting Shiwei town and Labudalin town of Argun city, Inner Mongolia, which passes through the areas covered by deep seasonal frozen ground or isolated patchy permafrost. In this paper, we mapped the long-term linear displacement trend and amplitude of seasonal displacement of the Shi-La Highway and its nearby areas, with an ascending Sentinel-1 dataset acquired from September 2016 to April 2020. Seasonal displacement amplitudes of 5-20 mm are widely detected in low-lying areas (e.g., the basin of the Gen and Derbugan rivers). The time lags between frozen ground displacement and temperature variations generally range from 10 to 80 days while larger values of 100-120 days caused by soil moisture or land cover difference are also observed. Linear creep displacement rates greater than-20 mm/yr are detected on mountainous slopes and sections of the Shi-La Highway in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction. Our results provide a method for evaluating highway stability in cold regions, which is helpful to highway route selection and design in Northeastern China.

TI  - Variation of satellite-derived total suspended matter in large lakes with four types of water storage across the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM), as an indicator of the concentration of fine materials in the water column including particulate nutrients, pollutants, and heavy metals, is widely used to monitor aquatic ecosystems. However, the long-term spatiotemporal variations of TSM in lakes across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and their response to environmental factors are rarely explored. Accordingly, taking advantage of the Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance and in-situ data, an empirical model (R-2= 0.83, RMSE= 1.08 mg/L, and MAPE= 19.49 %) was developed to estimate the average autumnal TSM in large TP lakes (>= 50 km(2)) during the 1990-2020 period. For analyzing the spatiotemporal variability in TP lakes TSM, the examined lakes were classified into four types (Type A-D) based on their water storage changing in different periods. The results showed that the lakes in the southern and some northeastern parts of the TP exhibited lower TSM values than those situated in other regions. The assessment of TSM in each of these four lake types showed that more than half of them had a TSM value of < 20 mg/L. Apart from Type D, the lakes with the TSM showing significantly decreasing trends were dominantly Types A-C. A relative contribution analysis involving five driving factors indicated that they contributed by > 50 % to lake TSM interannual variation in 73 out of 114 watersheds, and the lakes area change demonstrated the greatest contribution (82.2%), followed by wind speed (11.0 %). Further comparison between the entire lake and the non-expansive regions suggested that the expansive region played an indispensable role in determining the TSM value of the whole lake. This study can help to better understand the water quality condition and provide valuable information for policy-makers to maintain sustainable development in the TP region.

TI  - Comparison of phycocyanin concentrations in Chaohu Lake, China, retrieved using MODIS and OLCI images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phycocyanin (PC) concentration is used as an indicator to characterize cyanobacteria biomass while monitoring eutrophication in inland water. Remote sensing provides useful methods for quantifying PC concentration; however, there is a shortage of datasets for the long-term monitoring of PC concentration when only a single remote sensing data is used. Therefore, PC concentrations obtained from multisource remote sensing images should be compared before integrating them for long-term monitoring. In this study, machine learning (ML) regression algorithms are used to develop PC concentration retrieval models suitable for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images, and their accuracies are compared. The two optimal retrieval models are applied to satellite images acquired on the same days to compare the spatial consistency of the two PC concentration retrieval results. The results show that the sensitive spectral range of PC concentration is 560-680 nm. Among the ML regression algorithms, gradient boosted tree (GBT) regression exhibits the highest PC retrieval accuracy for both the MODIS images (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 61.9 mu g/L) and OLCI images (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 45.44 mu g/L). The PC concentrations retrieved from the MODIS and OLCI images acquired in bloom and no-bloom periods have a high spatial consistency in most areas of Chaohu Lake. Their correlation coefficient also exceeds 0.7, and the average relative error reaches 0.293 mu g/L. However, a large difference exists in areas with high PC concentrations, which may cause by the poor applicability of atmospheric correction algorithms and PC retrieval models in these areas. The proposed PC concentration retrieval models developed using GBT regression in this paper can expend the idea for the quantitative retrieval of other inland water quality parameters in inland water, and the conclusions should enable the effective integration of MODIS and OLCI images for the time series monitoring of PC concentrations in reservoirs and lakes.

TI  - A sandstorm extreme event from the Yellow River Basin in March 2021: Accurate identification and driving cause
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandstorm is a natural meteorological disaster that can appear suddenly and is often extremely destructive. In areas with small number of meteorological observation stations, it is difficult to effectively monitor sandstorm. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have the characteristics of high resolution and wide coverage, making it possible to monitor dynamic weather changes in a large area over time, and such data are widely used in sandstorm monitoring. The purpose of our research was to achieve a more accurate identification of sandstorm accord-ing to the differences in reflectance and brightness temperature between sandstorm and other phenomena, and to bet-ter understand the formation, movement track and driving cause of sandstorm extreme event. Taking the intense sandstorm event that occurred in the Yellow River Basin from March 13th to 18th, 2021 as an example, sandstorm pro-cess was analyzed based on MODIS data and meteorological monitoring data. The threshold of Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI) and Normalized Brightness Temperature Dust Index (NBTDI) realized accurate sandstorm monitor-ing and quantification of the sandstorm coverage areas. Sandstorm covered 32.89 % and 37.23 % of the total areas of the Yellow River Basin on March 15th and 16th, 2021, respectively. In addition, observation data from 22 meteorolog-ical stations also provided an important reference for further understanding of sandstorm weather. The intense sand-storm event in China on March 15th, 2021 originated from the dust in Mongolia. This sandstorm event caused great damage to the ecological environment and caused serious losses to people's lives and properties. This study improved the monitoring of sandstorm by remote sensing technology, and the results had importance for the long-term monitor-ing and prevention of sandstorm.

TI  - SNNFD, spiking neural segmentation network in frequency domain using high spatial resolution images for building extraction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date building maps are fundamental to urban development and analysis. However, detecting buildings from images with different spatial resolutions and ground object patterns from various imaging sensors is a challenge. Current models mostly have difficulties in extracting buildings with poor boundaries due to the various building appearances and sizes. Moreover, most published methods are trained and evaluated on subsets from the same dataset whose images are captured from one imaging sensor with similar ground object patterns, making it difficult to evaluate the transferability objectively. To address this issue, a spiking neural network in the frequency domain (SNNFD) is proposed to enhance the model transferability and the feature capability of buildings with different sizes by synthesizing frequency domain and spatial domain learning. Spiking convolution is adopted in the frequency learning module to enhance the model learning ability by mimicking the learning process of human brain. The learned frequency features are concatenated and transformed to the spatial domain, and used to generate building-extraction result images by convolution networks. SNNFD is evaluated on two datasets with different spatial resolutions (0.3-2.5 m) from different imaging sensors (Quickbird, World-view, IKONOS, ZY-3) of different study areas (worldwide). It is compared with five recently proposed semantic segmentation frameworks (Unet, Segnet, DeepLabv3, BiSeNet, F-3-Net), and obtains a minimum of 6.33 % higher accuracy with a strong transferability in detecting different sizes of building instances. Specifically, the proposed model improves the segmentation performance of small building instances by at least 6.5 % compared with the five segmentation frameworks through synthesis of spiking convolution in the frequency learning domain in the model construction. Moreover, details of building boundaries are better maintained by SNNFD, offering the possibility of detecting buildings for practical applications.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of desertification based on integrated remote sensing indices in Duolun County, Inner Mongolia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification causes not only a reduction of vegetation cover and surface moisture but also the expansion of sandy land. Considering that the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) is linearly related to canopy cover, albedo plays a significant role in the surface energy balance, and the sandy feature index (SFI) can identify sandy land. This paper proposed a desertification monitoring index (DMI) based on MSAVI, albedo and SFI to accurately monitor desertification. In addition, three classification methods (quantile grading, the susceptibility index segmentation method, and Jenks Natural Breaks) were used to divide the DMI into non-desertification, mild desertification, moderate desertification, and severe desertification. The relative exponential entropy model was adopted to select the optimal method for desertification classification. Spatiotemporal distributions of desertification in Duolun County were finally observed from 2005 to 2020. The results show that (1) although MSAVI, albedo and SFI have their own advantages in monitoring desertification, a single indicator is not suitable for various land uses. The DMI can combine the advantages of MSAVI, albedo and SFI in desertification moni-toring and is more consistent with the real desertification levels. (2) Compared with quantile grading and sus-ceptibility index segmentation methods, Jenks Natural Breaks has the smallest relative exponential entropy (2.124), with an overall classification accuracy of 88.21%, indicating that Jenks Natural Breaks is an optimal method for desertification monitoring. (3) Although approximately 1708.60 km2 of desertification areas have improved from 2005 to 2020, accounting for 44.23% of the whole area, the remaining areas are still under fluctuating or degraded conditions. This shows that the local government has made some progress in desertifi-cation protection, but the areas under fluctuating or degraded conditions still require protection or management.

TI  - Detecting seasonal and trend components in PS-InSAR displacement time series
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterers synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PS-InSAR) technology has been applied in the context of deformation monitoring of transportation infrastructures such as bridges, highways, and railways. However, extracting and interpreting information from long-time series displacement obtained using PS-InSAR is a complex and demanding task. In this study, time series analysis was used to post-process the displacement time series derived from PS-InSAR using 100 stripmap mode images collected by TerraSAR-X satellite during 13 April 2010 and 13 December 2019. Seasonal and trend decomposition using loess (STL) and variational modal decomposition (VMD) were combined to estimate the different periodic and trend components of the total displacement time series. Temperature correlation was then generated by associating the different period components with the temperature change. The results show that the deformation of Sihui overpass, Sifang overpass and Shibalidian overpass in Beijing Fourth Ring Road highway is obvious. The trend components obtained by STL decomposition of the selected typical points are primarily nonlinear deformation, and the deformation of Sifang overpass, Shibalidian overpass and Liuxiang overpass slows to varying degrees. After decomposing the displacement time series into several intrinsic mode functions (imf) with finite bandwidth using VMD, the thermal expansion phenomenon is pronounced on the main bridge and approach bridge of some overpasses. Seasonal imf1 is an annual periodic that appears to be highly positively correlated with temperature change. Seasonal imf2 is a period term of greater than one year that confirms that the bridges exhibit other periodic seasonal components in addition to the seasonal deformation of annual period. The thermal expansion characteristics of different periodic seasonal components that are explored in this study can provide valuable information for better understanding the thermal expansion evolution process, and these findings are important scientific significance for bridge structure health monitoring.

TI  - Forest tree species distribution for Europe 2000-2020: mapping potential and realized distributions using spatiotemporal machine learning
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes a data-driven framework based on spatiotemporal machine learning to produce distribution maps for 16 tree species (Abies alba Mill., Castanea sativa Mill., Corylus avellana L., Fagus sylvatica L., Olea europaea L., Picea abies L. H. Karst., Pinus halepensis Mill., Pinus nigra J. F. Arnold, Pinus pinea L., Pinus sylvestris L., Prunus avium L., Quercus cerris L., Quercus ilex L., Quercus robur L., Quercus suber L. and Salix caprea L.) at high spatial resolution (30 m). Tree occurrence data for a total of three million of points was used to train different algorithms: random forest, gradient-boosted trees, generalized linear models, k-nearest neighbors, CART and an artificial neural network. A stack of 305 coarse and high resolution covariates representing spectral reflectance, different biophysical conditions and biotic competition was used as predictors for realized distributions, while potential distribution was modelled with environmental predictors only. Logloss and computing time were used to select the three best algorithms to tune and train an ensemble model based on stacking with a logistic regressor as a meta-learner. An ensemble model was trained for each species: probability and model uncertainty maps of realized distribution were produced for each species using a time window of 4 years for a total of six distribution maps per species, while for potential distributions only one map per species was produced. Results of spatial cross validation show that the ensemble model consistently outperformed or performed as good as the best individual model in both potential and realized distribution tasks, with potential distribution models achieving higher predictive performances (TSS = 0.898, R-logloss(2) = 0.857) than realized distribution ones on average (TSS = 0.874, R-logloss(2) = 0.839). Ensemble models for Q. suber achieved the best performances in both potential (TSS = 0.968, R-logloss(2) = 0.952) and realized (TSS = 0.959, R-logloss(2) = 0.949) distribution, while P. sylvestris (TSS = 0.731, 0.785, R-logloss(2) = 0.585, 0.670, respectively, for potential and realized distribution) and P. nigra (TSS = 0.658, 0.686, R-logloss(2) = 0.623, 0.664) achieved the worst. Importance of predictor variables differed across species and models, with the green band for summer and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for fall for realized distribution and the diffuse irradiation and precipitation of the driest quarter (BIO17) being the most frequent and important for potential distribution. On average, fine-resolution models outperformed coarse resolution models (250 m) for realized distribution (TSS = +6.5%, R-logloss(2) = +7.5%). The framework shows how combining continuous and consistent Earth Observation time series data with state of the art machine learning can be used to derive dynamic distribution maps. The produced predictions can be used to quantify temporal trends of potential forest degradation and species composition change.

TI  - The Spatial and Temporal Variations in the Superparasitism of <i>Diachasmimorpha longicaudata</i> Population Lines on Different Hosts After Field Release
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the behavior of the parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in the field allows improving strategies for its release. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate spatial and temporal variations in the superparasitism of two populations of D. longicaudata on two fruit fly hosts after releasing them in a guava (Psidium guajava L.; cultivar 'Paluma') orchard. The two parasitoid populations used were CS and AS, which were reared on Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) and Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), respectively. Four releases were carried out without host choice. Host larvae were offered to the parasitoids in sentinel traps attached at varying heights on the plant, and in plants located at eight different directions and seven distances (7.0, 21.0, 35.0, 49.0, 59.4, 63.0, and 69.3 m) from the center of the parasitoid release point. The traps remained in the orchard for 24, 48, and 168 h after release. After removing the traps, they were taken to the laboratory for scar counting. The percentages of parasitism, superparasitism, mortality, and emergence of parasitoids were determined. Data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLMM). The AS females were more active, as they exerted higher parasitism and superparasitism at the first distance and 48 h after release, leaving a higher number of oviposition scars on the host A. fraterculus. Additionally, higher host mortality was observed in A. fraterculus at the closest points and the first 48 h. The highest percentage of parasitoid emergence was observed in C. capitata parasitized by AS females.

TI  - Multidimensional soil salinity data mining and evaluation from different satellites
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization, a common land degradation mode, restricts the ecological environment and is a global issue due to climate change. Accurately, quickly and effectively monitoring soil salinity is critical for governmental institutions that develop hazard prevention and mitigation strategies. Remote sensing (RS) technology provides a viable alternative to traditional field work due to its large area coverage, abundant spectral information and nearly constant observations. Key issues in RS-based soil salinity monitoring include the lack of both data-mining techniques for obtaining spectral band information and comprehensive considerations of synergies among different spectra. The main objective of this study was to provide in-depth explorations of data mining and integration algorithms from different satellites to multidimensionally evaluate soil salinity models. The Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve (Xinjiang Province, China) was selected as a case study. First, ground-measured visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectral data were combined with the RS band to simulate Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel 2 (S2) and 3 (S3) data. Second, one-dimensional RS bands and 15 soil salinity and vegetation indices were selected, and 15 spectral data transformations (reciprocal, differential, absorbance, etc.) were obtained. Two- and three-dimensional spectral indices were constructed, and the response relationships between different spectral indices and soil electrical conductivity (FE) were comprehensively explored. Finally, an integrated multidimensional algorithm was used to estimate soil salinity in high-performance models for the three satellites. The results showed that all data-mining-based model combinations performed well fora!! satellites (R-2 > 0.80). However, with multidimensional model combinations, S3 presented the highest predictive capability (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 2.57 mS.cm(-1), RPD = 2.05), followed by S2 (R-2 = 0.86, RMSF. = 2.71 mS.cm(-1), RPD = 1.90) and 1.8 (R-2 = 0.85, RMSF. = 2.84 mS.cm(-1), RPD = 1.87). Therefore, data mining with integration algorithms in model combinations performs significantly better than previous models and could be considered a promising method for obtaining improved results from soil salinity susceptibility models in similar cases.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The land is both a cornerstone of socio-economic growth and an integral member of the ecological system since it is a resource essential to human life and development. Based on land use change, land ecological sensitivity, and socio-economic impact elements, we provide a comprehensive urban land ecological security (ULES) assessment system. Land use types, topography, and ecological sensitivity of the study area were analyzed first using remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) technology, followed by the development of a DPSIRM model framework to evaluate indicators using an entropy-variable-weight integrated weighting method for the analysis of land ecological security (LES) in Hefei. Among the study's findings are the following: (1) Between 2000 and 2020, Hefei City's land use changed dramatically, with an increase in the amount of construction land, most of which came from cultivated land, woods, and water bodies. (2) According to the ecological sensitivity study, Hefei's land ecology level is largely moderately sensitive and lowly sensitive. (3) Human activity factors have a greater impact on land ecology than natural variables. In order to increase the ecological safety coefficient of the land, it is necessary to limit human activities that cause anthropogenic disturbances. The study's findings may serve as a guide for the evaluation.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of the Changing Pattern of Land cover along the Southwestern Coast of Nigeria using GIS and Remote Sensing techniques
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The changing pattern of land cover is increasingly becoming of global concern in the sus-tainable management of environmental resources. Different facets of the natural ecosys-tem continue witnessing devastation orchestrated by rapid population growth and urban expansion in the face of climate change. This study examined the contribution of human's to the global environmental change by assessing the dynamics of land cover between 1984 and 2017 while predicting the future extent of land cover pattern for 2047 at the Epe and Igbokoda areas on the coast of southwestern Nigeria. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), En-hanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) imageries of 1984, 2002, and 2017 respectively were acquired from the USGS to analyse the land cover changes. Supervised classification was done using the maximum likelihood classifier of Terrset version 18.31. The Change Demand Modelling of Land Change Modeller (LCM) in Terrset integrates the Markov chain for future predictions for 2047. The Epe area which typifies a rapidly urbanizing coastal environment recorded an 84.6% increase in built-up area extent between 1984 and 2017, while the built-up area of the Igbokoda area in-creased by 103.8% for the same period. This increment corresponds to a decrease in the spatial extent of the forested wetlands with an increase in water bodies. Expansion of wa-ter body extents indicates the interaction between the elements of climate change such as incessant flooding and anthropogenic activities like deforestation, urban expansion through sand mining and dredging. Future prediction into 2047 connotes further worsening of the situation. Therefore, solution-based sustainable coastal management practices are recom-mended to salvage the impoverishing coastal ecosystems from further impairment.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Alternative Counter-News Use and Fake News Recall During the COVID-19 Crisis
T2  - DIGITAL JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a massive flood of "fake news", conspiracy theories, and distorted information more generally. Alternative news media have been accused of contributing to this pollution the information sphere. In this article, we argue that audiences with a counter-hegemonic, ideologically biased worldview are particularly likely to use alternative counter-news, because these outlets validate their worldview - and worldview validation being a relevant psychological need in times of crises. We suggest that by turning to alternative counter-news, audiences increase their exposure to fake news and end up being less well informed about important events. Results of a random-quota survey in Germany (N = 967) confirmed that those with higher levels of conspiracy mentality and lower media trust were more likely to use alternative counter-news. Alternative counter-news users recalled more fake news than non-users and alternative counter-news use partially mediated the relationship between counter-hegemonic attitudes and fake news recall. Thus, although not all content in alternative counter-news is fake news, these outlets do attract a specific counter-hegemonic audience and they do contribute to the "pollution" of the information ecosystem.

TI  - Analysis of the impact of urban summer high temperatures and outdoor activity duration on residents' emotional health: Taking hostility as an example
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined effect of global warming and the heat island effect keeps the temperature of cities rising in the summer, seriously threatening the physical and mental health of urban residents. Taking the area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing as an example, based on Landsat remote sensing images, meteorological stations, and questionnaires, this study established a relational model between temperature and hostility and then analyzed the changes in the emotional health risk (hostility) in the study area and the mechanism of how outdoor activity duration influences hostility. Results show that: (1) the area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing had a higher and higher temperature from 1991 to 2020. Low-temperature areas gradually shrank, and medium- and high-temperature areas extended outwards from the center. (2) The threat of high temperature to residents' hostility gradually intensified-the sphere of influence expanded, low-risk areas quickly turned into medium-high-risk areas, and the level of hostility risk increased. Level 1 risk areas of hostility had the most obvious reduction-a 74.33% reduction in area proportion; meanwhile, Level 3 risk areas had the most significant growth-a 50.41% increase in area proportion. (3) In the first 120 min of outdoor activities under high temperature, residents' hostility was negatively correlated with outdoor activity duration; after more than 120 min, hostility became positively correlated with duration. Therefore, figuring out how temperature changes influence human emotions is of great significance to improving the living environment and health level of residents. This study attempts to (1) explore the impact of temperature changes and outdoor activity duration on hostility, (2) evaluate residents' emotional health risk levels affected by high temperature, and (3) provide a theoretical basis for the early warning mechanism of emotional health risk and the planning of healthy cities.

TI  - Axillary Staging Is Not Justified in Postmenopausal Clinically Node-Negative Women Based on Nodal Disease Burden
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background RxPONDER showed no benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER) positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer and limited nodal burden (pN1) with a recurrence score <= 25, suggesting that axillary staging could be omitted in cN0 patients if significant numbers of such women do not have pN2-3 disease. Here we evaluate the pN2-3 disease rate in a large cohort of postmenopausal women presenting with cN0 breast cancer. Patients and Methods Consecutive postmenopausal patients presenting with T1-2N0 breast cancer who underwent axillary surgery from February 2006 to December 2011 were identified. Clinicopathologic characteristics associated with pN2-3 disease were examined using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Results Of 3363 postmenopausal women with cT1-2N0 breast cancer (median age 58 years, IQR 48-67 years), median tumor size was 1.3 cm (IQR 0.90-1.90cm). Post-axillary staging, 2600 (77.3%) were pN0, 643 (19.1%) were pN1, and 120 (3.6%) were pN2-3. The pN2-3 disease rate did not differ across subtypes (4.4% HER2(+), 3.5% HR-/HER2(-), 3.5% HR+/HER2(-), p = 0.70). In the subset with HR+/HER2(-) tumors, on multivariable analysis, age < 65 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-4.49), lymphovascular invasion (OR 5.29, 95% CI 2.72-11.2), multifocal/centric tumors (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.79-5.32), and tumor size > 2 cm (OR 5.51, 95% CI 3.05-10.4) were significantly associated with pN2-3 nodal burden. Of 506 patients with tumors > 2 cm, 49 (9.7%) had pN2-3 disease; in the subset of 90 patients age < 65 years who had multifocal/centric tumors > 2 cm, 23 (25.6%) had pN2-3 disease. Conclusions In postmenopausal women with cN0 disease, pN2-3 nodal burden is uncommon; omitting axillary staging would not miss a significant number of patients who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Information available preoperatively indicating a higher risk of nodal disease such as younger age and large, multifocal tumors should be considered in the multidisciplinary management of the axilla.

TI  - Decrease in air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes caused by persistent marine heatwaves
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional processes play a key role in the global carbon budget. Major ocean CO2 uptake at mid-latitudes counteracts CO2 release in the tropics, which is modulated by episodes ofmarine heatwaves. Yet, we lack essential knowledge on persistent marine heatwaves, and their effect on the CO2 sensitive areas. Here we show, using a 1985-2017 joint analysis of reconstructions, ocean reanalysis and in situ and satellite data, that persistentmarine heatwaves occur in major CO2 uptake and release areas. Average air-sea CO2 flux density changes from persistent marine heatwaves are strongest in the Pacific Ocean with a 40 +/- 9% reduction in CO2 release in the tropics linked to ENSO, and a reduction in CO2 uptake of 29 +/- 11% in the North Pacific over the study period. These results provide new insights into the interplay of extreme variability and a critical regulating ocean ecosystem service, and pave the way for future investigations on its evolution under climate change.

TI  - Risk Factors for the Development of Clinical and Subclinical Lymphedema Detected by Bioimpedance Spectroscopy
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer-related lymphedema can significantly compromise quality of life. Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) measures extracellular fluid in lymphedema. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of BIS-detected lymphedema using the L-Dex and identify risk factors associated with a positive score. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of our institutional database to identify patients who underwent L-Dex U400 measurements. Patients with a score of > 10 L-Dex units or with an increase of > 10 units from baseline had a positive score. Clinical lymphedema was determined by documentation in the chart at the time of positive measurement. Otherwise, patients were considered to have subclinical lymphedema. Results: Fifty-three patients met study cr iter ia. Thirty patients (56.6%) underwent mastectomy, 22 (41.5%) axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and 33 (62.3%) received radiation (RT). Twelve patients (22.6%) had a positive score. There were no differences in age, race, laterality, breast surgery, T stage, N stage, chemotherapy, or RT fields (none, breast only, breast with LNs) in patients with a positive score. ALND was more common (66.7% vs. 34.2%, P = .04). BMI > 30 approached significance (58.3% vs. 29.3%, P = .06). Seven patients had subclinical lymphedema. No differences were identified comparing patients with subclinical lymphedema to those with negative scores. All 5 patients with clinical lymphedema underwent ALND and received nodal RT. Conclusion: The combination of ALND and regional nodal RT is strongly associated with development of clinical lymphedema. It is difficult to identify patients at risk for subclinical BIS-detected lymphedema.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death among women, and the pathological status of axillary lymph nodes is an important predictor of prognosis. However, the mechanism involved in this early stage of metastasis remains largely unknown. Methods: Microarray analysis was used to carry out differential genomics analyses between matched pairs of metastatic sentinel lymph node tissues and breast primary tumors. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system was used for in vivo screening by transplanting a loss-of-function cell pool into immunocompromised mice. MAGeCK was used to analyze the screening results. Survival analysis was performed via the Kaplan-Meier method. Cell proliferation, wound healing, migration and invasion assays were performed to confirm the phenotype. A tail vein model and subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model were used for the in vivo study. The relationship between coiled-coil domain containing 102B (CCDC102B) and receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) was examined using coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, nuclear protein extraction and immunofluorescence assays. The primary biological functions and pathways related to CCDC102B were enriched by RNA sequencing. Results: We identified CCDC102B through screening and found that it was significantly upregulated in metastatic lesions in lymph nodes compared to matched primary tumors. Increased expression of CCDC102B promoted breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, high expression of CCDC102B was correlated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. We further identified that CCDC102B was stabilized by the loss of RACK1, a protein negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, we found that RACK1 promoted CCDC102B lysosomal degradation by mediating chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The aggressive behavior of CCDC102B in breast cancer cells could be reversed by the expression of RACK1. Moreover, CCDC102B was correlated with the significant enrichment of NF-kappa B pathway components. Overexpressing CCDC102B led to less interaction between RACK1 and IKKa. Thus, CCDC102B positively regulates the NF-kappa B pathway by interacting with RACK1. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings uncover a novel role of CCDC102B in breast cancer metastasis. CCDC102B serves as a potential metastasis promoter by regulating the activation of the NF-kappa B pathway and can be degraded by RACK1 via CMA.

TI  - Monitoring Surface Deformation Associated With Soil Erosion in Loess Plateau With an Improved Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Algorithm
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a geomorphic process persistently occurring over the earth's surface, soil erosion is one of the most serious environmental problems in the world nowadays, seriously threatening agriculture, natural resources, and ecosystem environments. Monitoring surface deformation associated with soil erosion will help to understand the dynamics of erosion process and the erosion mechanism. In this article, an improved small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique is proposed to monitor the surface deformation over the wind-water erosion crisscross region in the Loess Plateau, China. In particular, a new deformation model considering both of the internal factors and external factors of soil erosion is introduced into the SBAS-InASR algorithm. The results show that the cumulative deformation is close to -200 mm during the investigated period. The deformation rate caused by precipitation is between -0.03 and 0.02 mm/mm. When the wind erosion factor changes by 1 unit, the deformation range is approximately -0.3-0.2 mm. Also, researchers found that the surface deformation is highly correlated to precipitation and wind. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the residual deformations estimated from the proposed model are smaller than those estimated from the conventional linear and period models, demonstrating that the proposed method is more suitable to model and analyze the surface deformation in wind-water erosion crisscross region.

TI  - Completion Lymph Node Dissection Is Unnecessary After Positive Sentinel Lymph Node in Melanoma - a Case Series Analysis
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent times, significant trials showed that sentinel lymph node biopsy alone was therapeutic in melanoma and no further surgery was necessary even if sentinel lymph node biopsy was found positive. In this retrospective study, we aimed to determine the prognostic importance of the total number of excised lymph nodes after sentinel lymph node biopsy in pN1 stage III melanoma patients from a single tertiary cancer centre. A total of 194 stage III primary melanoma patients with only one metastatic regional lymph node (pN1) determined by sentinel lymph node biopsy were included in the study. All patients with pathologically positive sentinel lymph node biopsy underwent a completion of lymphadenectomy. The numbers of excised lymph nodes were divided into the groups 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and >= 16. The estimated 5-year relapse-free survival of all patients was 44.3% and there was no significant association between increasing excised lymph node groups and relapse-free survival (p = 0.3). Moreover, the 5-year overall survival for all cases was 48.7% and no significant association between increasing excised lymph node groups and overall survival was observed (p > 0.05). In conclusion, we suggest no prognostic impact for the extended removal of lymph nodes on relapse and outcome in pN1 melanoma patients after sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Citrus orchard mapping in Juybar, Iran: Analysis of NDVI time series and feature fusion of multi-source satellite imageries
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays crop mapping as an interdisciplinary hot topic attracted both agriculture and remote sensing researchers' interests. This study proposed an automatic method to map citrus orchards in Juybar, Iran, where planting citrus trees is booming there. In this regard, 148 Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS Digital Surface Model (DSM) tiles are processed in Google Earth Engine to provide a hybrid feature set including initial satellite images, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textural features, and spectral features such as vegetation, built-up, bare-soil indices, and the proposed Vegetation Dynamic Index (VDI). A semi-automatic sample selection paradigm is also developed based on a time-series analysis of 12 monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs), Otsu thresholding, multi-level thresholding (MLT), and using two proposed indices called Ever-greenness Index (EGI) and Water-covered or No-vegetation (WCNV) index, and finally human post-revision. The output of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using 60,000 samples and the post-classification operation showed that the classified map has an average overall accuracy (OA) and an average kappa coefficient (KC) equal to 99.7% and 0.992, respectively. The results show that multispectral bands lonely extracted orchards with high accuracy (OA: 99.55%, KC: 0.986), and the rest of the features only made a slight improvement to that. For the year 2019, an area of about 4351 ha is estimated as citrus orchards, which is in accordance with the agriculture department's reports (similar to 4700 ha). The results indicate that from 2016 to 2019, despite a "citrus to non-citrus" land-use conversion of about 754 ha, the citrus orchards area was totally expanded by about 17%. Comparing the results with the Google Earth images indicates the precise extraction of orchards with a 10 m spatial resolution. To use the proposed method for extensive cases or areas with other types of evergreen trees, it is recommended to use high-resolution normalized DSMs (nDSMs) and textural features.

TI  - How to consider the effects of time of day, beam strength, and snow cover in ICESat-2 based estimation of boreal forest biomass?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the effects of (1) the presence/absence of snow and snow depth, (2) solar noise, i.e., day/night and sun angle observations, and (3) strong/weak beam differences on ICESat2 data in the context of data utility for forest AGB estimation. The framework of the study is multiphase modeling, where AGB field data and wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) and Sentinel-2 data are used to produce proxy ALS plots on ICESat-2 track positions. Models between the predicted proxy AGB and the ICESat-2 photon data are then formulated and evaluated by subsets, such as only strong beam data captured in snowy conditions.Our results indicate that, if possible, strong beam night data from snowless conditions should be used in AGB estimation, because our models showed clearly smallest RMSE (26.9%) for this data subset. If more data are needed, we recommend using only strong beam data and constructing separate models for the different data subsets. In the order of increasing RMSE%, the next best options were snow/night/strong (30.4%), snow/day/strong (33.5%), and snowless/day/strong (34.1%). Weak beam data from snowy night conditions could also be used if necessary (31.0%).

TI  - The utility of sentinel Lymph node biopsy in the lateral neck in papillary thyroid carcinoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRegional lymph node metastases (LNMs) are very common in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and associate with locoregional recurrence. The appropriate management of cervical lymph nodes is very important. Therefore, this study evaluated the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the lateral neck in PTC patients. MethodsThis prospective study was conducted from 1 November 2015 to 31 December 2017 and recruited 78 PTC patients treated with SLNB in the lateral neck and prophylactic lateral neck dissection (compartments II-IV) followed by thyroidectomy or lobectomy and central neck dissection. ResultsThere were 78 PTC patients enrolled and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected among 77 patients. A total of 30 patients were diagnosed with SLN metastases (SLNMs). The remaining 47 patients were pathologically negative of SLN, whereas 4 patients were found with metastases in the non-SLN samples. The detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rate of SLNB in the lateral neck were 98.7%, 87.1%, 98.7%, and 93.6%, respectively. However, the values varied greatly in each specific compartment of the lateral neck, and all of them were no more than 80%. These 34 PTC patients diagnosed with lateral compartment LNM (LLNM) were more likely to be younger (41.38 vs. 48.95 years old, p = 0.002) and exhibit extrathyroidal extension (56.8% vs. 31.7%, p = 0.026) and central compartment LNM (66.7% vs. 12.1%, p < 0.001). Tumors located in the upper third of the thyroid lobe also had a significantly higher probability of LLNM compared with those in middle or inferior location (66.7% vs. 35.3% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.044). At last, age (OR=0.912, p = 0.026), tumor location (upper vs inferior, OR=17.478, p = 0.011), and central compartment LNM (OR=25.364, p < 0.001) were independently predictive of LLNM. ConclusionsSLNB can help surgeons to identify some PTC patients who may benefit from therapeutic lateral neck dissection and protect some patients from prophylactic lateral neck dissection. However, it cannot accurately indicate specific lateral compartment-oriented neck dissection. Meanwhile, LLNM is more likely to occur in PTC patients with younger age or upper pole tumors or central compartment LNM.

TI  - A machine learning model based on ultrasound image features to assess the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients: Applications of scikit-learn and SHAP
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to determine an optimal machine learning (ML) model for evaluating the preoperative diagnostic value of ultrasound signs of breast cancer lesions for sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. MethodThis study retrospectively analyzed the ultrasound images and postoperative pathological findings of lesions in 952 breast cancer patients. Firstly, the univariate analysis of the relationship between the ultrasonographic features of breast cancer morphological features and SLN metastasis. Then, based on the ultrasound signs of breast cancer lesions, we screened ten ML models: support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), naive bayesian model (NB), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The diagnostic performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), Kappa value, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity. Then we constructed a clinical prediction model which was based on the ML algorithm with the best diagnostic performance. Finally, we used SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to visualize and analyze the diagnostic process of the ML model. ResultsOf 952 patients with breast cancer, 394 (41.4%) had SLN metastasis, and 558 (58.6%) had no metastasis. Univariate analysis found that the shape, orientation, margin, posterior features, calculations, architectural distortion, duct changes and suspicious lymph node of breast cancer lesions in ultrasound signs were associated with SLN metastasis. Among the 10 ML algorithms, XGBoost had the best comprehensive diagnostic performance for SLN metastasis, with Average-AUC of 0.952, Average-Kappa of 0.763, and Average-Accuracy of 0.891. The AUC of the XGBoost model in the validation cohort was 0.916, the accuracy was 0.846, the sensitivity was 0.870, the specificity was 0.862, and the F1-score was 0.826. The diagnostic performance of the XGBoost model was significantly higher than that of experienced radiologists in some cases (P<0.001). Using SHAP to visualize the interpretation of the ML model screen, it was found that the ultrasonic detection of suspicious lymph nodes, microcalcifications in the primary tumor, burrs on the edge of the primary tumor, and distortion of the tissue structure around the lesion contributed greatly to the diagnostic performance of the XGBoost model. ConclusionsThe XGBoost model based on the ultrasound signs of the primary breast tumor and its surrounding tissues and lymph nodes has a high diagnostic performance for predicting SLN metastasis. Visual explanation using SHAP made it an effective tool for guiding clinical courses preoperatively.

TI  - Mapping essential habitat of estuarine fishery species with a mechanistic SDM and Landsat data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and monitoring of essential fishery habitat (EFH) is primary and important for the conservation of estuarine fishery habitat and sustainable fisheries management. However, mapping EFH of estuarine fishery species with generally statistical species distribution model (SDM) remains difficult due to their complex life histories and the extensive spatiotemporal variability of habitat variables. Thus, we proposed a mechanistic SDM by analyzing a more direct and certain relationship at a pre-selected suitable life stage with prior knowledge of species life history, not a rough statistical analysis of overlapping cause-effect relationships operating across multiple life history stages in reverse. Landsat data was used to describe the extensive spatiotemporal variability of estuarine habitat variables. A window filtration was contributed most to select the suitable life stage with a score scheme. As mapping EFH needs to feasibly locate the representative and essential habitats over large estuarine scale, we constructed two indicators to represent "habitat importance " and "descriptor predictability " in the score scheme, which was semi-quantified with three primary factors (habitat function, duration of life history stage, inversion limitation of critical descriptors from Landsat data). Through selecting the suitable life stage for the mechanistic SDM, the usage of Landsat archives could be extended, which is beneficial from a few optically / thermally active determinants. The applicability of the mechanistic SDM was tested by mapping EFH of Eriocheir sinensis in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE), China. The window filtration of E. sinensis' life history stages in the YRE showed that the berry stage was filtered as the suitable stage with the highest scores both in habitat importance and descriptors predictability. Then the distribution of E. sinensis was modelled, predicated, and assessed at berry stage by comparing outward in a generally statistical way and inward with other filter window. The mechanistic model at berry stage showed the best explanatory and predictive power in both occurrence and abundance models, validating that the optimized SDM had much stronger capability in model fit and prediction. The score scheme was also verified to set reasonably and effectively through the model comparisons at different filter window stages. With the predicated distribution of E. sinensis, the core ranges of EFH were mapped at berry stage, which were mostly distributed in sub-tidal areas neighbored to wetlands, showing the habitat requirement of shallow water for hiding. Meantime, the determinants' variance partitioning, in which dissolved oxygen (DO) and total suspended sediment (TSS) exceeded over 65%, complementally illustrated that core EFH may also require high water quality. The identification of EFH locations with our mechanistic SDM would provide spatial-explicit information and guidance to fishery habitat protection and fishery resources maintenance. Additionally, this study also explored a new way to utilize a few predictors from the extensively used Landsat data in an alternative way. This study could extend the limitations of SDM in EFH mapping and bridge gaps between spatiotemporal explicit modelling and remote sensing data accommodations, which is meaningful for fishery habitat conservation.

TI  - An Optimized Deep Belief Network for Land Cover Classification Using Synthetic-Aperture Radar Images and Landsat Images
T2  - COMPUTER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper intends to propose an automated deep learning-based land cover classification model of remote sensing images. The model includes (i) pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction and (iii) classification. The captured synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and Landsat-8 images are initially pre-processed using the Gabor filtering model. Subsequently, from SAR images the gray-level-co-occurrence matrix-based texture characteristics are extracted, and temperature vegetation index-based characteristics, normalized vegetation index-based features, normalized difference index-based features and coloration index features are extracted from Landsat-8 images. Finally, the extracted features are subjected to an optimized deep belief network (DBN), where the weight is fine-tuned by the optimization logic. For this, a new Sunflower adopted Red Deer (SARD) algorithm is introduced in this work that hybrids the concept of Red Deer algorithm and Sunflower optimization. The performance of the proposed classification model is compared over other conventional models concerning different measures. Especially, the accuracy of the presented work (SARD+DBN) for Testcase3 is 5, 7, 6 and 30% better than existing DA + DBN, JA + DBN, SLnO+DBN and LA + DBN methods, respectively.

AB  - The debate articles in CAMH Journal, May 2022, have received some responses from contributors who are well known for their anti-diagnosis views concerning borderline personality disorder (BPD). Within these responses, we had hoped to see these campaigners try to test their worldview against our tragic experiences but we have been sadly disappointed. Our daughters actually lived in the world these campaigners hope to construct: a world where professionals behave as if BPD does not exist, a world where NICE Guidance for BPD is therefore entirely ignored. That world led to our daughters' deterioration and deaths. We address the main arguments against diagnosis as we have come to understand them and end with a plea to channel the passions of this debate into a solution that would have helped Sam and Chris.

TI  - Climatic and edaphic-based predictors of normalized difference vegetation index in tropical dry landscapes: A pantropical analysis
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Spatial patterns in resource supply drive variability in vegetation structure and function, yet quantification of this variability for tropical dry forests (TDFs) remains rudimentary. Several climate-driven indices have been developed to classify and delineate TDFs globally, but there has not been a climo-edaphic synthesis of these indices to assess and delineate the extent of TDFs. A statistical climo-edaphic synthesis of these indices is therefore required. Location Pantropical. Time period Modern. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We assembled most known prior descriptions of TDFs into a single data layer and assessed statistically how the TDF biome, which we call tropical dry landscapes (TDLs) composed of forest and non-forest vegetation, varied with respect to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) sensed by MODIS (250 m pixel resolution). We examined how the NDVI varied with respect to mean annual temperature (MAT) and rainfall (MAR), precipitation regime, evapotranspiration and the physical, chemical and biological properties of TDL soils. Results Overall, the NDVI varied widely across TDLs, and we were able to identify five principal NDVI categories. A regression tree model captured 90% of NDVI variation across TDLs, with 14 climate and soil metrics as predictors. The model was then pruned to use only the three strongest metrics. These included the Lang aridity index, total evapotranspiration (ET) and MAT, which aligned with identified NDVI thresholds and accounted for 70% of the variation in NDVI. We found that across a global TDL distribution, ET was the strongest positive predictor and MAT the strongest negative predictor of the NDVI. Main conclusions The remote sensing-based approach described here provides a comprehensive and quantitative biogeographical characterization of global TDL occurrence and the climatic and edaphic drivers of these landscapes.

TI  - Novel color fluorescence imaging for sentinel lymph node detection in oral and oropharyngeal cancer
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Fluorescence imaging (FI) using indocyanine green (ICG) is a noteworthy alternative technique for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection without radiation exposure in oral cavity and oropharynx cancer. However, conventional FI is monochrome, so the visibility is limited. This study assessed whether color FI using the HyperEye Medical System (HEMS) is feasible as an alternative for SLN detection. Methods Patients with previously untreated cT1-2N0 oral or oropharyngeal cancer who were to undergo primary tumor resection and elective neck dissection (END) in our hospital were enrolled from November 2012 to March 2016. The patients underwent SLN detection for biopsy via the HEMS following the injection of ICG solution around the primary lesion before neck dissection. The visibility and the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging were evaluated. Results SLNs were visualized in all eight cases; however, transcutaneous fluorescence detection was not observed in all cases. Utilizing color mode imaging simplified harvest by clearly discriminating SLNs from surrounding structures, while the monochrome mode proved to be more sensitive for detection. Two cases showed occult metastases on both sentinel and regional nodes. The identification and false negative rates were 100% and 0%, respectively. There were no complications incurred due to this method. Conclusion Our results suggest that color FI with the HEMS allows for the accurate and safe harvest of SLNs with a preparatory skin incision. Although there is room for improvement of sensitivity, this easy-to-handle procedure might provide the potential to expand the role of the ICG method for SLN detection in head and neck cancer.

TI  - Evaluating long-term outcomes of three approaches to retroperitoneal staging in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Sentinel lymph node mapping (SNM) has gained popularity in managing apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC). Here, we evaluated the long-term survival of three different approaches of nodal assessment.Methods. This is a multi-institutional retrospective study evaluating long-term outcomes of EC patients hav-ing nodal assessment between 01/01/2006 and 12/31/2016. In order to reduce possible confounding factors, we applied a propensity-matched algorithm.Results. Overall, 940 patients meeting inclusion criteria were included in the study, of which 174 (18.5%), 187 (19.9%), and 579 (61.6%) underwent SNM, SNM followed by backup lymphadenectomy (LND) and LND alone, respectively. Applying a propensity score matching algorithm (1:1:2) we selected 500 patients, including 125 SNM, 125 SNM/backup LND, and 250 LND. Baseline characteristics of the study population were similar between groups. The prevalence of nodal disease was 14%, 16%, and 12% in patients having SNM, SNM/backup LND and LND, respectively. Overall, 19 (7.6%) patients were diagnosed with low volume nodal disease. The survival analysis comparing the three techniques did not show statistical differences in terms of disease-free (p = 0.750) and overall survival (p = 0.899). Similarly, the type of nodal assessment did not impact survival outcomes after stratification based on uterine risk factors.Conclusion. Our study highlighted that SNM provides similar long-term oncologic outcomes than LND.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The eye in child abuse
T2  - CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
M3  - Review
AB  - Child physical abuse may result in a range of injuries to the globe and surrounding tissues. These injuries have varying degrees of specificity for abuse, and no pattern of injury is unique to abuse. Easily overlooked eye injuries in non-ambulatory infants often portend more severe abuse and require careful evaluation for occult injury when they are unexplained. Retinal hemorrhages are most often a sign of significant trauma and the severity of the hemorrhages generally parallels the severity of neurological trauma. Ophthalmologists contribute important data that more easily distinguish medical disease from trauma, but caution is needed in differentiating accidental from inflicted trauma. This distinction requires careful consideration of the complete clinical data and occasionally on additional law enforcement or child welfare investigation.

TI  - Effects of subsidy and regulation policy on soil and water resources of cotton planted lands in Harran Plain, Turkey
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) provides essential raw material used in the textile, feed, and vegetable oil sectors. Therefore, it is a strategic crop for agricultural, economic, and political strategies around the world. Accurate monitoring of the changes in the cotton production patterns is crucial for decision-makers. Turkey is among the top ten cotton producers and ranks fourth in the world for cotton imports. One third of the total cotton pro-duction in Turkey comes from the southeastern Anatolia region of the country. This study analyzed the impact of subsidy and regulation policies on fluctuations in cotton production areas and soil and water quality in Harran Plains, southeastern Anatolia region Turkey. Time-series (between 2016 and 2021) satellite images were utilized to determine actual crop rotation in the study area. Turkish Government implemented a new rule for crop subsidies in 2020 which stated that a farmer will be eligible for subsidy for two consecutive years; however the subsidy will not be paid if the same crop is planted in the third year. Cotton was cultivated in 83 % of the Harran plains prior to new subsidy regulation, which decreased to 26 % after the new regulation. Sudden decrease in cotton cultivation area clearly indicated that farmers need public support to cover the costs in agricultural production. The Gross Production Value (BPV) for each crop was calculated to determine the impact of subsidy regulation on economic value of crops in the rotation.The GPV in 2020 was 2.903,7 $ ha(-1) that was 33.6 % and 20.5 % lower than 2019 and 2021, respectively. The results indicated that crop subsidies significantly altered the crop selection behavior of farmers. Water requirement of crops in rotation between 2016 and 2021 was calcu-lated to assess the effects of subsidy changes on water consumption. Cotton cultivation over a large part of the plains during the same season caused excessive water consumption, rise in groundwater level over time, soil salinity and severe water erosion. However, cotton cultivation area as well as water consumption in Harran plain new significantly decreased with the new subsidy regulation; therefore, water consumption in 2020 was the lowest among the time frame evaluated. Total sediment losses through surface runoff from the Harran Plain was estimated as 0.83 tons ha(-1) per year. The results revealed that subsidies exert significant impacts on the gross production value in the region, amount of irrigation water consumed, and quality of soil and water resources in addition to the impact on the decision of farmers for crop selection.

TI  - Subcostal lymph nodes: An unusual sentinel lymph node basin in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Lymphatic drainage from subcostal nodes, along the costal groove, have not previously been characterized as sites for melanoma drainage and metastasis. This study reports a series of patients with subcostal nodes draining primary melanomas, with characterization of the sites of primary melanomas that drain to these nodes. Methods Patients who presented to our institution between 2005 and 2020 with documented cutaneous melanoma and sentinel lymph node biopsy of a subcostal node (sentinel = S), or metastases to subcostal nodes later in clinical management (recurrent = R) were included. Patient demographics, melanoma pathology, nodal features, imaging information, surgical approaches, and outcomes data were collected. Results Six patients had subcostal sentinel nodes (SNs). Primary sites included the posterior trunk and lateral chest wall. Subcostal nodes were found under ribs 10-12. Subcostal SNs had at least one dimension measuring 3 mm or less. There were no surgical complications related to removing the subcostal SN. Conclusions Melanoma can metastasize to subcostal lymph nodes and be found at the time of SN biopsy or identified at recurrence. These small nodes are fed by lymphatic channels that run in the neurovascular bundle under the ribs. When lymphatic mapping identifies a subcostal SN, it should be excised.

TI  - Positional accuracy assessment of historical Google Earth imagery in Lagos State, Nigeria
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The horizontal accuracy of historical Google Earth (GE) images at four epochs between the years 2000 and 2018, and the vertical accuracy of its elevation data within Lagos State, in Nigeria, are respectively evaluated by comparison with a very high-resolution digital orthomosaic and comparison with 558 ground control points. Two readily available 30-m digital elevation models (DEMs) - the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) v3.0 and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D (AW3D) DEM v2.1. - were also compared with GE elevations. A novel approach for assessing the space-time variations in the magnitude and direction of errors in GE imagery is presented. For horizontal accuracy, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are as follows - year 2000 (16.9 m), year 2008 (16.4 m), year 2012 (6.1 m) and year 2018 (6.1 m). The most recent GE imagery (year 2018) had the least horizontal error while year 2000 had the largest horizontal error. The horizontal shift was skewed towards the western and north-western directions, indicative of systematic error. In terms of the vertical accuracy, GE elevation data had the lowest accuracy and highest RMSE of 6.21 m followed by AW3D with an RMSE of 4.39 m and SRTM with an RMSE of 3.68 m.

TI  - Think global, cube local: an Earth Observation Data Cube's contribution to the Digital Earth vision
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The technological landscape for managing big Earth observation (EO) data ranges from global solutions on large cloud infrastructures with web-based access to self-hosted implementations. EO data cubes are a leading technology for facilitating big EO data analysis and can be deployed on different spatial scales: local, national, regional, or global. Several EO data cubes with a geographic focus ("local EO data cubes") have been implemented. However, their alignment with the Digital Earth (DE) vision and the benefits and trade-offs in creating and maintaining them ought to be further examined. We investigate local EO data cubes from five perspectives (science, business and industry, government and policy, education, communities and citizens) and illustrate four examples covering three continents at different geographic scales (Swiss Data Cube, semantic EO data cube for Austria, DE Africa, Virginia Data Cube). A local EO data cube can benefit many stakeholders and players but requires several technical developments. These developments include enabling local EO data cubes based on public, global, and cloud-native EO data streaming and interoperability between local EO data cubes. We argue that blurring the dichotomy between global and local aligns with the DE vision to access the world's knowledge and explore information about the planet.

TI  - Isolated tumour cells in a sentinel lymph node of apparent early-stage ovarian cancer: Ultrastaging of all other 27 lymph nodes
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in apparent early-stage ovarian cancer may spare the surgical staging with extensive retroperitoneal dissection and its associated morbidity. However, SLN biopsy in ovarian cancer is still experimental and under investigation. A 46-year-old post-menopausal woman with bilateral apparent stage IC1 endometrioid ovarian cancer underwent surgical staging by SLN biopsy and subsequent comprehensive laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Out of 4 SLNs submitted to ultrastaging, one was positive for isolated tumour cells (ITCs). We submitted to ultra-staging all the other 24 pelvic and para-aortic non-SLNs, which were reported negative for disease. This is the first reported case of comprehensive lymphadenectomy after SLN biopsy with universal ultrastaging of all non-SLNs in ovarian cancer. The presence of ITCs in only one SLN, with all other 27 lymph nodes negative at ultrastaging, is consistent with the SLN concept and the assumption of a reliable lymphatic pathway in ovarian cancer.

TI  - Innovative digital solution supporting sun protection and vitamin D synthesis by using satellite-based monitoring of solar radiation
T2  - PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Public health campaigns advise minimising UV radiation (UVR) exposure to prevent skin cancer and precancer, e.g. actinic keratosis (AK). A 3-day clinical field study, in Brazil, was performed to evaluate the mobile app Sun4Health (R) by siHealth Ltd. The app performs real-time monitoring of both erythemal and vitamin D-effective solar radiation doses using satellite data, enabling personalised recommendations on optimal sun exposure time and sunscreen use. When coupled to a wearable device, the app also provides body-site specific recommendations ("3D" version). 59 healthy volunteers were randomised into 3 groups, each given a different app providing: (1) ultraviolet index only (control app), (2) personalised recommendations and sun overexposure alerts (Sun4Health (R) app), (3) as (2) but connected via Bluetooth to a wearable device to monitor sun exposure in 3D (Sun4Health (R)-3D app). Participants were offered sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50) to use at their discretion. Erythema, quantified by reflectance spectroscopy, was assessed daily in the mornings and evenings on six body sites. Serum vitamin D (25(OH)D-3) was measured before and after the study. Mean increase of erythema (Mexameter (R) units +/- SD) of all exposed body sites combined over 3 days showed 55.76 +/- 47.47 for group 1, 40.27 +/- 37.91 for group 2 and 37.12 +/- 30.69 for group 3 (p < 0.05 for all groups). Mean increase of serum 25(OH)D-3 (nmol/l +/- SD) showed 1.32 +/- 36.49 for group 1, 6.38 +/- 21.19 for group 2 and 18.68 +/- 35.45 for group 3 (p > 0.05 for all groups). The results show that the Sun4Health (R) app is safe to use and can modify behaviour to reduce skin erythema (sunburn) yet not decreasing vitamin D status.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Endometrial stripe thickness: a preoperative marker to identify patients with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia who may benefit from sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The goal of our study was to identify preoperative factors in patients with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia that are associated with concurrent endometrial cancer to select patients who may benefit from sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment at the time of hysterectomy. Methods Retrospective single institution cohort study of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia who underwent hysterectomy with or without staging from January 2010 to July 2020. Modified Poisson regression was used to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of 378 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, 275 (73%) had endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia and 103 (27%) had invasive cancer on final pathology. Age (p=0.003), race (p=0.02), and hypertension (p=0.02) were significantly associated with concurrent endometrial cancer. The median preoperative endometrial stripe was significantly greater in the endometrial cancer group (14 mm (range 10-19)) than in the endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia group (11 mm (range 8-16); p=0.002). A preoperative endometrial stripe >= 20 mm was associated with double the risk of endometrial cancer on final pathology (crude RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.9) and preoperative endometrial stripe >= 15 mm was 2.5 times more likely to be associated with high risk Mayo criteria on final pathology (crude RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.2). Of those with concurrent endometrial cancer, 5% were stage IB, 29% had tumors >2 cm, and 1% had grade 3 histology. Only 3% of all patients underwent lymph node evaluation. Conclusions In a large cohort of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, less than a third had invasive cancer and even fewer had pathologic features considered high risk for nodal metastasis, arguing against the use of routine SLN dissection in these patients. Endometrial stripe >= 15 mm may be a useful preoperative marker to identify patients at higher risk for concurrent endometrial cancer and may be an important criterion for use of selective SLN dissection in carefully selected patients with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia.

TI  - Use of a Novel Electronic Auto-Notification Process to Manage Transitions of Care in Patients With Rheumatic Disease Receiving Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug Therapy
T2  - ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To integrate an auto-notification system into clinical workflow, so timely communication of sentinel events (elective surgery, hospital admission, or emergency room [ER] visit) in immunosuppressed patients with rheumatic disease happened by design. Methods We developed an algorithm that triggered auto-notification within the electronic medical record to rheumatology when a patient experienced a sentinel event. A telephone encounter was created that included event type, baseline therapy, and event date. This was forwarded to the rheumatologist, who recorded guideline-driven recommendations and returned it to nursing. Instructions were included to communicate recommendations to the patient, inpatient rheumatology team, or other clinician. This was studied over 4 months at a multispecialty medical practice in Central Pennsylvania. Primary outcomes were percentage of total notifications, notifications by sentinel event type where a change in care plan was recommended, as well as percentage of time where rheumatologists were notified of sentinel events compared to prior to the intervention. The secondary outcome was staff work effort. Results Two hundred forty notifications were received (57% for elective surgeries, 39% for ER visits, and 4% for admissions). The need for change in care plan was only 17% for ER visits but was 25% for hospital admissions and 44% for elective surgeries. The percentage of time that rheumatologists were notified of events increased from 57.6% to 100%. The average number of messages received per week was 2.2, requiring a weekly average of 13 minutes of work per physician. Conclusion We developed an easy, well-received process that hardwires rheumatologist notification sentinel events to facilitate timely care.

TI  - Summer temperature-but not growing season length-influences radial growth of <i>Salix arctica</i> in coastal Arctic tundra
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic climate change is leading to an advance of plant phenology (the timing of life history events) with uncertain impacts on tundra ecosystems. Although the lengthening of the growing season is thought to lead to increased plant growth, we have few studies of how plant phenology change is altering tundra plant productivity. Here, we test the correspondence between 14 years of Salix arctica phenology data and radial growth on Qikiqtaruk-Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, Canada. We analysed stems from 28 individuals using dendroecology and linear mixed-effect models to test the statistical power of growing season length and climate variables to individually predict radial growth. We found that summer temperature best explained annual variation in radial growth. We found no strong evidence that leaf emergence date, earlier leaf senescence date, or total growing season length had any direct or lagged effects on radial growth. Radial growth was also not explained by interannual variation in precipitation, MODIS surface greenness (NDVI), or sea ice concentration. Our results demonstrate that at this site, for the widely distributed species S. arctica, temperature-but not growing season length-influences radial growth. These findings challenge the assumption that advancing phenology and longer growing seasons will increase the productivity of all plant species in Arctic tundra ecosystems.

TI  - Risk factors of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in 443 breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node-positive
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection is the standard surgical procedure for breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive. In clinical practice, axillary lymph node dissection may be an unnecessary treatment for some breast cancer patients with non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) negative. The aim of this study was to analyze the risk factors of NSLN metastasis in breast cancer patients with SLN positive. Four hundred fifty-six clinical early stage breast cancer patients with SLN positive were collected and analyzed in the oncological surgery department of Fujian Provincial Hospital during 2013 to 2018. All these patients underwent surgical treatment. The average age and tumor size of 443 patients with SLN positive breast cancer were (49.8 +/- 10.8) years and (2.42 +/- 0.94) cm. Univariate analysis showed that the size of primary tumor, the number of positive SLN, the number of negative SLN, the ratio of positive SLNs, and the type of metastases in SLN were the influencing factors of NSLN metastasis. Multivariate regression analysis showed that primary tumor size T > 2 cm (P < .001, OR = 2.609), the positive number of SLNs >= 3 (P = .002, OR = 5.435), the ratio of positive SLNs >= 50% (P = .017, OR = 1.770), and SLN macrometastases (P < 0.001, OR = 16.099) were independent risk factors for NSLN metastasis. Combined with the 4 independent risk factors, the area under the curve to predict NSLN metastasis was 0.747 > 0.7. For clinical early breast cancer with positive SLN, primary tumor size T > 2 cm,the positive number of SLNs >= 3, the ratio of positive SLNs >= 50%, and SLN macrometastases could predict NSLN metastasis well, and guide surgery to avoid overtreatment.

TI  - Long-term trends in aerosol optical properties and their relationship with cloud properties over southern India and Sri Lanka
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Asia is one of the continents where aerosol levels are comparatively higher across the world. India and Sri Lanka are some of the regions in the South Asian continent where pollution is increasing rapidly due to the rise in industrialization. The present study investigated the interactions between atmospheric aerosol and cloud microphysical properties and their spatial, temporal, and seasonal variation at local and regional scales during 2000-2020 using remotely sensed data sets in south India and Sri Lanka. High values (>0.5) of annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) were detected over southern India. On the other hand, lower values (0.2) were detected over Sri Lanka. In terms of seasonality, a high level of AOD was registered in both southern India and Sri Lanka during the premonsoon and monsoon periods. The angstrom exponent (AE(412-470)) revealed the dominance of fine-mode particles during winter and the postmonsoon, generally from biomass burning and industrial activities. The long-term analysis exhibited an increasing trend of atmospheric aerosol concentration over southern India and Sri Lanka. Interestingly, there was a decrease in AOD during the year 2020; the reduction in anthropogenic activities in the region was attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown, hence less accumulation of pollutants in the atmosphere. AOD showed a positive correlation with cloud effective radius over the western areas along with the Indian Ocean, north, southeast, and southern end of India, while negatively correlated with high AOD areas such as northeast of the study domain. The AOD and cloud optical depth were positively correlated over continental areas, while negative correlations were notable over the Indian Ocean around Sri Lanka, implying heterogeneities of aerosol's effect on cloud microphysical properties over the study area. Finally, the results from wind circulation and backward air mass trajectories reveal higher concentrations of fine-mode particles associated with the continent, whereas coarse-mode particles originate from the oceans.

TI  - Island Mass Effect: A Review of Oceanic Physical Processes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Increased Net Primary Productivity (NPP) around small islands have been documented worldwide. Despite having been known for decades, the interactions between physical and biogeochemical processes behind this phenomenon - that takes the name of Island Mass Effect -remain unclear. In this paper we review the physical processes involved while proposing a method to identify the prevailing mechanisms by analyzing their imprint on NPP and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). These mechanisms can be quite different, but all enhance vertical exchanges, increasing the input of nutrients in the euphotic layer and favoring biological productivity. Nutrient-rich deeper waters are brought up to the surface through upwelling and mixing, leaving a cold imprint on the SST as well. Here we analyze satellite data of SST and NPP around small islands and archipelagos to catalog the physical mechanisms that favor the Island Mass Effect, with the aid of oceanic and atmospheric reanalysis. The multiplicity of these processes and the convolution of their interactions highlight the complexity of the physical forcing on the biomass production and the uniqueness of each island. However, analysis from 19 small islands throughout the tropics shows that two kinds of SST patterns emerge, depending on the size and altitude of the island. Around islands with considerable elevation and greatest diameters, cold/warm anomalies, most likely corresponding to upwelling/downwelling zones, emerge. This signal can be mainly ascribed to oceanic and atmospheric forcing. Around small islands, on the other hand, warm anomalies do not appear and only local cooling, associated with current-island interactions, is found. In the vicinity of a single island, more than one process responsible for the increased nutrient input into the euphotic layer might coexist, the prevailing one varying along the year and depending on the strength and direction of the incoming atmospheric and oceanic flow.

TI  - SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT OF TREE SPECIES IN URBAN AND PERI-URBAN FORESTS IN DROUGHT
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study aimed to analyze the impact of extreme drought on the phenological development of Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L. forests in Ufa city (Bashkortostan Republic, Russia) and outside it. The study area is located in the northern part of the forest-steppe subzone of the temperate climate zone. The vegetation indices NDVI, GNDVI, and CVI were calculated from cloudless Landsat images for the growing season in the dry year of 2010 and time series of 2008-2017, and they were used to analyze the phenological development of forest vegetation. To plot phenology, we used the Bayesian LSP script which uses Landsat time series data and a Bayesian hierarchical model. Higher temperatures in the city led to the higher pace at the beginning of seasonal development of pine and oak forests. The tendency for the seasonal development of forests outside the city to delay continued in the dry year. At the same time, in the dry year in pine forests both in the city and outside the city the delay of phenological development began earlier than in oak forests. Pine forests respond to a long period of water scarcity more noticeably than oak forests, which is substantially due to the features of root systems of Quercus robur that allow them to use deeper moisture reserves.

TI  - Evaluation of LAI Estimation of Mangrove Communities Using DLR and ELR Algorithms With UAV, Hyperspectral, and SAR Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-precision estimation of mangrove leaf area index (LAI) using a deep learning regression algorithm (DLR) always requires a large amount of training sample data. However, it is difficult for LAI field measurements to collect a sufficient amount of sample data in mangrove wetlands. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposed an approach for expanding training samples and quantitatively evaluated the performance of estimating LAI for mangrove communities using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Transformer algorithms. This study also explored the effects of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2A multispectral, orbital hyper spectral (OHS), and GF-3 SAR images on LAI estimation of different mangrove communities. Finally, this paper evaluated the LAI estimation ability of mangrove communities using ensemble learning regression (ELR) and DLR algorithms. The results showed that: (1) the UAV images achieved the better LAI estimation of different mangrove communities (R-2 = 0.5974-0.6186), and GF-3 SAR images were better for LAI estimation of Avicennia marina with high coverage (R-2 = 0.567). The optimal spectral range for estimating LAI for mangroves in the optical images was between 650-680 nm. (2) The ELR model outperformed single base model, and produced the high-accuracy LAI estimation (R-2 = 0.5266-0.713) for different mangrove communities. (3) The average accuracy (R-2) of the ELR model was higher by 0.0019-0.149 than the DLR models, which demonstrated that the ELR model had a better capability (R-2 = 0.5865-0.6416) in LAI estimation. The Transformer-based LAI estimation of A. marina (R-2 = 0.6355) was better than the DNN model, while the DNN model produced higher accuracy for Kandelia candel (KC) (R-2 = 0.5577). (4) With the increase in the expansion ratio of the training sample (10-50%), the LAI estimation accuracy (R-2) of DNN and Transformer models for different mangrove communities increased by 0.1166-0.2037 and 0.1037-0.1644, respectively. Under the same estimation accuracy, the sample enhancement method in this paper could reduce the number of filed measurements by 20-40%.

TI  - Impact of Typhoon on Coastal Upwelling Off The Eastern Hainan Island: A Case Study of Typhoon Rammasun (2014)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hainan Island coastal upwelling (HIU hereafter) off the eastern Hainan Island (EHI) is an important phenomenon in the northern South China Sea. Though this phenomenon has been extensively studied, the fast responses of its inner oceanic processes to typhoon passage remain unclear. Based on satellite data and a validated three-dimensional numerical model, the HIU response to the passage of Typhoon Rammasun (2014) are explored in this study. Impacted by Rammasun, the climbing of deep water off the EHI was depressed and the bottom cold water moved seaward for at least 10 km. Though the HIU was weakened, a cooling event and Chl-a bloom in the HIU were formed after the passage of Rammasun. Diagnostic analyses revealed that both advection and diffusion terms contributed to controlling the local rate of temperate change during the typhoon passage and the advection terms showed significant internal wave signals along the shelf break off southeastern Hainan Island. At the same time, strong near-inertial waves (NIWs) with 0.705 cpd were triggered in the HIU. The NIWs lasted for about two weeks and caused strong vertical mixing in the HIU after Rammasun. Overall, typhoon wind and NIWs combined to dominate temperature variation in the HIU during the typhoon period.

TI  - The Impact of Economic Development of the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area on Air Pollution: Investigation Based on Remote Sensing Data of Nighttime Lights and Air Pollution
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) can achieve the goal of environmental protection at the same time as its rapid economic development is an important issue that deserves attention. In this paper, we obtained remote sensing data on air pollution including CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and nighttime light data. We combined the remote sensing data with county-level economic statistics to study economic development and air pollution in the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao GBA. Our research showed that the economic development in the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao GBA significantly increased the emissions of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 and did not have significant effects on CO and SO2. We constructed an emission intensity indicator of pollutants per unit of luminance. We found that the unit emission intensity of four categories of pollutants, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, and CO, showed a significant decreasing trend in line with economic development. The emission intensity of NO2 showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. The conclusion of this research illustrates that the emission intensity of pollutants per unit of luminosity in the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao GBA is continuously reducing. The emission of pollutants will gradually change from slow growth to zero growth. However, the emission of NO2 pollution should be an area of focus in achieving the dual goals of economic development and environmental protection.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Trends in Inundation Frequency Reveal the Fate of Saltmarshes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Some of the world's coastal saltmarshes experience loss in area due to environmental changes, such as relative sea level rise and limited sediment supply. We use satellite remote sensing to assess changes in inundation (flooding) frequency in tidal basins and investigate the bio-physical interactions with saltmarshes. We apply a simple automated method to retrieve time series of inundation frequency change and seaward habitat change of saltmarshes and tidal flats from Landsat-5 TM satellite imagery between 1985 and 2011, for a number of contrasting tidal basins (estuaries, deltas) globally. We evaluated the satellite-derived information on inundation frequency with such information obtained from elevation and tide gauge data for the Western Scheldt estuary, showing good agreement. Application of the method on all study sites reveal which tidal basins are stable or net emerging and which tidal basins are net drowning, but also show large spatial variation in the changes in inundation frequency within each basin. Tidal basins experiencing an overall significant increase in inundation frequency (Mississippi Delta and Venice Lagoon) were associated with an overall loss of saltmarsh area. Satellite-derived temporal and spatial information on inundation frequency helps to assess the fate of saltmarshes in light of sea level change, changes in sediment supply and subsidence.

TI  - Shallow magma dynamics at open-vent volcanoes tracked by coupled thermal and SO<sub>2</sub> observations
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-vent volcanic activity is typically sustained by ascent and degassing of shallow magma, in which the rate of magma supply to the upper feeding system largely exceeds the rate of magma eruption. Such unbalance between supplied (input) and erupted (output) magma rates is thought to result from steady, degassing-driven, convective magma overturning in a shallow conduit/feeding dyke. Here, we characterize shallow magma circulation at Stromboli volcano by combining independent observations of heat (Volcanic Radiative Power; via satellite images) and gas (SO2, via UV camera) output in a temporal interval (from August 1, 2018 to April 30, 2020) encompassing the summer 2019 effusive eruption and two paroxysmal explosions (on July 3 and August 28, 2019). We show that, during the phase of ordinary strombolian explosive activity that preceded the 2019 effusive eruption, the average magma input rate (0.1-0.2 m3/s) exceeds the magma eruption rate (0.001-0.01 m3/s) by similar to 2 orders of magnitude. Conversely, magma input and output rates converge to an average of similar to 0.4 m3/s during the summer 2019 summit effusion, implying an overall suppression of magma recycling back into the feeding system, and hence of excess degassing. We find that, during the effusive eruption, the peak in SO2 emissions lags behind the thermal emission peak by similar to 27 days, suggesting that magma output, feeding the lava flow field, initially dominates over magma input in the conduit. We propose that this conduit mass unloading, produced by this initial phase of the effusive eruption, leads to an overall decompression (of up to 30 Pa/s) of the shallow plumbing system, ultimately causing ascent of less-dense, volatile-rich magma batch(es) from depth, enhanced explosive activity, and elevated SO2 fluxes culminating into a paroxysmal explosion on August 28. Our results demonstrate that combined analysis of thermal and SO2 flux time-series paves the way to improved understanding of shallow magmatic system dynamics at open-vent volcanoes, and of the transition from explosive to effusive activity regimes.

TI  - Sentimental wildfire: a social-physics machine learning model for wildfire nowcasting
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of wildfires and wildfire season length is increasing due to climate change, causing a greater threat to the local population. Much of this population are increasingly adopting social media, and sites like Twitter are increasingly being used as a real-time human-sensor network during natural disasters; detecting, tracking and documenting events. The human-sensor concept is currently largely omitted by wildfire models, representing a potential loss of information. By including Twitter data as a source in our models, we aim to help disaster managers make more informed, socially driven decisions, by detecting and monitoring online social media sentiment over the course of a wildfire event. This paper implements machine learning in a wildfire prediction model, using social media and geophysical data sources with Sentiment Analysis to predict wildfire characteristics with high accuracy. We also use wildfire-specific attributes to predict online social dynamics, as this has been shown to be indicative of localised disaster severity. This may be useful for disaster management teams in identifying areas of immediate danger. We combine geophysical satellite data from the Global Fire Atlas with social data provided by Twitter. We perform data collection and subsequent analysis & visualisation, and compare regional differences in online social sentiment expression. Following this, we compare and contrast different machine learning models for predicting wildfire attributes. We demonstrate social media is a predictor of wildfire activity, and present models which accurately model wildfire attributes. This work develops the concept of the human sensor in the context of wildfires, using users' Tweets as noisy subjective sentimental accounts of current localised conditions. This work contributes to the development of more socially conscious wildfire models, by incorporating social media data into wildfire prediction and modelling.

TI  - Evaluation of important phenotypic parameters of tea plantations using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea height, leaf area index, canopy water content, leaf chlorophyll, and nitrogen concentrations are important phenotypic parameters to reflect the status of tea growth and guide the management of tea plantation. UAV multi-source remote sensing is an emerging technology, which can obtain more abundant multi-source information and enhance dynamic monitoring ability of crops. To monitor the phenotypic parameters of tea canopy more efficiently, we first deploy UAVs equipped with multispectral, thermal infrared, RGB, LiDAR, and tilt photography sensors to acquire phenotypic remote sensing data of tea canopy, and then, we utilize four machine learning algorithms to model the single-source and multi-source data, respectively. The results show that, on the one hand, using multi-source data sets to evaluate H, LAI, W, and LCC can greatly improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. LiDAR + TC data sets are suggested for assessing H, and the SVM model delivers the best estimation (Rp(2) = 0.82 and RMSEP = 0.078). LiDAR + TC + MS data sets are suggested for LAI assessment, and the SVM model delivers the best estimation (Rp(2) = 0.90 and RMSEP = 0.40). RGB + TM data sets are recommended for evaluating W, and the SVM model delivers the best estimation (Rp(2) = 0.62 and RMSEP = 1.80). The MS +RGB data set is suggested for studying LCC, and the RF model offers the best estimation (Rp(2) = 0.87 and RMSEP = 1.80). On the other hand, using single-source data sets to evaluate LNC can greatly improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. MS data set is suggested for assessing LNC, and the RF model delivers the best estimation (Rp(2) = 0.65 and RMSEP = 0.85). The work revealed an effective technique for obtaining high-throughput tea crown phenotypic information and the best model for the joint analysis of diverse phenotypes, and it has significant importance as a guiding principle for the future use of artificial intelligence in the management of tea plantations.

TI  - Evaluation of nine major satellite soil moisture products in a typical subtropical monsoon region with complex land surface characteristics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing accuracies of satellite soil moisture (SM) products in areas with strong anthropogenic activ-ities, abundant precipitation, and dense vegetation is important but limited. In this study, performances of nine satellite SM products, including the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), and the ascending and descending products of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Chinese Fengyun-3B (FY3B), Chinese Fengyun-3C (FY3C), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), were evaluated against in-situ SM in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from 2015 to 2018. Results showed that the ESA CCI outperformed other products, with averaged correlation coefficient (R) of 0.522, correlation coefficient for SM anomalies (R-ano) of 0.419, and unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.040 m(3) m(-3), followed by the SMAP_A and SMAP_D. Overestimation was observed in the AMSR2 products (Bias > 0.081 m(3) m(-3)), while underestimation was found in the FY3B and FY3C products (Bias < -0.104 m(3) m(-3)). Moreover, R values decreased with the increase in water area percentage (WAP), land cover heterogeneity (GSI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and precipitation (PRE). Threshold values were observed at 3% for the WAP, 0.05 for the FVC, and 900 mm yr(-1) for the PRE, below which sharp declines of accuracy were observed. The WAP, GSI, and FVC were divided into five sub-classes with their values increasing with the sub-class level (I to V). Correlations coefficients between these per-turbing factors and R (correlation between satellite and in-situ SM) increased as sub-class levels increased. Under sub-classes I, II, and III, these three factors had limited influences on accuracies of satellite SM products. However, under sub-classes IV and V, significant impacts of these three perturbing factors were observed. Moreover, when sub-classes of the PRE increased from I to V, correlations be-tween Bias and PRE decreased first and then increased. These findings can help to determine suitable satellite SM products in the YRD and similar areas.

TI  - A deep reinforced learning spatiotemporal energy demand estimation system using deep learning and electricity demand monitoring data
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking decarbonization effects requires a model for the identification of spatial energy demands on city facilities. However, most developing countries lack detailed discrete time and device-specific energy demand data. In this study, we installed multiple energy demand monitoring systems that could observe electricity demands at the device level in some residences in Bogor, Indonesia. The study aimed to estimate the time-series and equipment ratio of electricity consumption by households in the entire city based on the monitoring data. However, the number of households monitored was small, and therefore unlikely to be regarded as having a representative system. Therefore, we used questionnaire data to create monitored mimic data and increased the number of samples to estimate the energy demand characteristics of the entire city via spatial interpolation. In addition, we developed a reinforcement learning system for discrete time-electricity demand estimation systems for unmonitored households using a 5-step procedure; 1) Analyzing energy demand and its patterns from monitoring data, 2) Questionnaire-based surveying of households, 3) Estimation of energy demand and its patterns based on questionnaire responses in monitored households, 4) Development of a deep learning model that extends the results from (3) to unmonitored households using data fusion, and 5) Spatial interpolation of energy demand characteristics for all households in Bogor using a spatial statistics method. The spatial electricity demand of households was interpolated from GIS and high-resolution satellite data matching procedures. Based on this analysis, we developed an hourly energy demand prediction system that could be automatically improved by adding new data from the reinforced learning framework.

TI  - Locoregional Management of Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review The treatment of breast cancer is evolving at accelerated rates. As systemic therapy continues to improve, the roles of surgery and radiation are being re-considered. The intent of this review is to discuss recent studies and potential future directions for the locoregional management of breast cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Recent Findings For patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, treatment decisions hinge on the tumor's biomarkers and patient's response to systemic therapy. For patients who sustain a pCR, clinical trials are investigating the role of de-escalated surgery and radiation. For patients with residual disease, escalated systemic therapies have been found to be of benefit. Surgery and radiation remain a mainstay of treatment. As the indications for neoadjuvant chemotherapy expand, locoregional management continues to develop and therapy is being increasingly tailored to an individual's particular response. Practitioners must know when therapy can be safely de-escalated and indications for escalation.

TI  - An update on global mining land use
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The growing demand for minerals has pushed mining activities into new areas increasingly affecting biodiversity-rich natural biomes. Mapping the land use of the global mining sector is, therefore, a prerequisite for quantifying, understanding and mitigating adverse impacts caused by mineral extraction. This paper updates our previous work mapping mining sites worldwide. Using visual interpretation of Sentinel-2 images for 2019, we inspected more than 34,000 mining locations across the globe. The result is a global-scale dataset containing 44,929 polygon features covering 101,583 km(2) of large-scale as well as artisanal and small-scale mining. The increase in coverage is substantial compared to the first version of the dataset, which included 21,060 polygons extending over 57,277 km(2). The polygons cover open cuts, tailings dams, waste rock dumps, water ponds, processing plants, and other ground features related to the mining activities. The dataset is available for download from https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.942325 and visualisation at www.fineprint.global/viewer.

TI  - Distribution, habitat use and human disturbance of gorillas (<i>Gorilla gorilla</i>) in the Ebo forest, Littoral Region, Cameroon
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Great apes are threatened by many factors including habitat loss, forest degradation and disease. Despite the improved understanding of the distribution of gorillas in Cameroon, there is a lack of fine-scale knowledge about their habitat use. We used the Kernel Density Estimate method combined with grid cell counting to assess gorilla distribution, habitat use and human disturbance on one of the least studied gorilla populations in Cameroon. Proportions of different habitat types in the landscape were quantified using classification and regression tree approach applied to Landsat-8 and digital elevation model data. We found that the distribution of gorillas was restricted to the central band of the site (similar to 22 km(2)). Although the area was dominated by mature forest, the goodness-of-fit test showed that gorillas used grassland areas more frequently. Intensive human activities were noted across the gorilla range, with used cartridge shells being the most evidence hunting sign. Our results can be used to guide conservation and sustainable development stakeholder decisions in the area. With increasing anthropogenic threats throughout the landscape, we recommend the implementation of noninvasive research activities focusing on threat monitoring, nesting and dietary ecology, and the promotion of community-led conservation initiatives to reduce pressure on the gorilla habitat.

TI  - Impact of coal mining on land use dynamics and soil quality: Assessment of land degradation vulnerability through conjunctive use of analytical hierarchy process and geospatial techniques
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal is the major source of energy in India, where 66% of the thermal power is generated from different grades of coal. The surging energy demand for domestic and industrial sectors has accelerated coal production through intensive coal mining from existing mines and there is exploration for potential areas across the Country. More than 80% of the coal excavated from open cast mining, which is a damaging form of mining that is often associated with undesirable land use changes, soil degradation, and deforestation and is responsible for other environmental degradation. The present study has been conducted in Manendragarh coal mining area located in northern Chhattisgarh, Central India using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geospatial tools. LANDSAT-TM and OLI satellite data from 1990 and 2020 were digitally analyzed applying a maximum likelihood supervised classification technique in ERDAS IMAGINE and Arc-GIS platforms. Spatial analysis of satellite data revealed that the area under forest, agriculture-fallow, and waterbodies fell by 14.5%, 12.9%, and 2.52%, respectively, due mainly to conversion into degraded land, while the mining area and built-up areas were proportionally enhanced by 3.2% and 0.59% between 1990 and 2020. The intense mining resulted in deterioration of soil health, where the organic C, pH, and soil depth were considerably decreased in mined sites and degraded lands, compared to agricultural and forest areas. The major determinant biophysical, topographic, and soil factors were integrated in a GIS platform to derive a land degradation vulnerability index (LDVI), which identified five vulnerability classes. The salient findings of study provides the critical inputs for the policy makers/environmentalists in prioritization and decision-making for implementing remedial measures for the eco-restoration of mining degraded landscapes and also the improvement of ecology and environment along with sustainable coal mining.

TI  - Comparisons between cross-section and long-axis-section in the quantification of aneurysmal wall enhancement of fusiform intracranial aneurysms in identifying aneurysmal symptoms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTo investigate the quantification of aneurysmal wall enhancement (AWE) in fusiform intracranial aneurysms (FIAs) and to compare AWE parameters based on different sections of FIAs in identifying aneurysm symptoms. MethodsConsecutive patients were prospectively recruited from February 2017 to November 2019. Aneurysm-related symptoms were defined as sentinel headache and oculomotor nerve palsy. All patients underwent high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) protocol, including both pre and post-contrast imaging. CRstalk (signal intensity of FIAs' wall divided by pituitary infundibulum) was evaluated both in the cross-section (CRstalk-cross) and the long-axis section (CRstalk-long) of FIAs. Aneurysm characteristics include the maximal diameter of the cross-section (D-max), the maximal length of the long-axis section (L-max), location, type, and mural thrombus. The performance of parameters for differentiating symptomatic and asymptomatic FIAs was obtained and compared by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. ResultsForty-three FIAs were found in 43 patients. Eighteen (41.9%) patients who presented with aneurysmal symptoms were classified in the symptomatic group. In univariate analysis, male sex (P = 0.133), age (P = 0.013), FIAs type (P = 0.167), mural thrombus (P = 0.130), L-max (P = 0.066), CRstalk-cross (P = 0.027), and CRstalk-long (P = 0.055) tended to be associated with aneurysmal symptoms. In the cross-section model of multivariate analysis, male (P = 0.038), age (P = 0.018), and CRstalk-cross (P = 0.048) were independently associated with aneurysmal symptoms. In the long-axis section model of multivariate analysis, male (P = 0.040), age (P = 0.010), CRstalk-long (P = 0.046), and L-max (P = 0.019) were independently associated with aneurysmal symptoms. In the combination model of multivariate analysis, male (P = 0.027), age (P = 0.011), CRstalk-cross (P = 0.030), and L-max (P = 0.020) were independently associated with aneurysmal symptoms. CRstalk-cross has the highest accuracy in predicting aneurysmal symptoms (AUC = 0.701). The combination of CRstalk-cross and L-max exhibited the highest performance in discriminating symptomatic from asymptomatic FIAs (AUC = 0.780). ConclusionAneurysmal wall enhancement is associated with symptomatic FIAs. CRstalk-cross and L-max were independent risk factors for aneurysmal symptoms. The combination of these two factors may improve the predictive performance of aneurysmal symptoms and may also help to stratify the instability of FIAs in future studies.

TI  - Water balance for gaged watersheds in the Central Sierra Nevada, California and Nevada, United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed managers require accurate, high-spatial-resolution evapotranspiration (ET) data to evaluate forest susceptibility to drought or catastrophic wildfire, and to determine opportunities for enhancing streamflow or forest resilience under climate warming. We evaluate an easily calculated product by using annual gridded precipitation (P) and measured discharge (Q), together with a gridded ET product developed from ET and P measured at flux towers plus Landsat NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) to evaluate uncertainties in water balances across 52 watersheds with stream-gauge measurements in the Central Sierra Nevada. Watershed areas ranged from 5 to 4823 km(2), and the study-area elevation range was 52-3302 m. Study-area P, ET, and Q averaged 1263, 634, and 573 mm yr(-1) respectively, with precipitation at higher elevations up to five times that at lower elevations. We assessed uncertainty in water-balance components by applying a multiplier to P or Q values across the period of record for each watershed to align annual P-ET and Q values, resulting in average P-ET-Q = 0. Most year-to-year values of annual change in storage (Delta S), calculated as P-ET-Q for watersheds with well-constrained water balances, were within about + 300 mm. Across the study area we found that for each of 37 watersheds, applying a constant multiplier to either annual P or Q resulted in well-constrained water balances (average annual P-ET-Q = 0). Multiplicative adjustment of ET values for each watershed did not improve average water balances over the period of record, and would result in inconsistent values across adjacent and nested watersheds. For a given watershed, ET was relatively constant from year to year, with precipitation variability driving both interannual and spatial variability in runoff. These findings highlight the importance of evapotranspiration as a central metric of water-balance change and variability, and the strength of using high-confidence spatial- evapotranspiration estimates to diagnose uncertainties in annual water balances, and the components contributing to those uncertainties.

TI  - On Negotiation Building Blocks and Bridging the Worlds We Build
T2  - NEGOTIATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Each of the predominate approaches to negotiation and conflict resolution-interest-based bargaining, basic human needs approaches, and narrative approaches-is grounded in a particular worldview with embedded assumptions about why and how parties experience conflict, the building blocks available to construct a solution to their conflict, and the proper design goals and methods for assembling those building blocks. When an approach to negotiation and conflict resolution is misaligned with the worldview(s) inhabited by one or more of the conflict parties, this mismatch may partially explain why a conflict resists resolution. Scholars and practitioners in our field should develop greater fluency in and capacity to work within and across disparate worldviews, so we and those we seek to assist are able to negotiate across worldviews more effectively.

TI  - An Internally Validated Prognostic Risk-Score Model for Disease-Specific Survival in Clinical Stage I and II Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous malignancy for which factors predictive of disease-specific survival (DSS) are poorly defined. Methods Patients from six centers (2005-2020) with clinical stage I-II MCC who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were included. Factors associated with DSS were identified using competing-risks regression analysis. Risk-score modeling was established using competing-risks regression on a training dataset and internally validated by point assignment to variables. Results Of 604 patients, 474 (78.5%) and 128 (21.2%) patients had clinical stage I and II disease, respectively, and 189 (31.3%) had SLN metastases. The 5-year DSS rate was 81.8% with a median follow-up of 31 months. Prognostic factors associated with worse DSS included increasing age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, p = 0.046), male sex (HR 3.21, p = 0.021), immune compromise (HR 2.46, p = 0.013), presence of microsatellites (HR 2.65, p = 0.041), and regional nodal involvement (1 node: HR 2.48, p = 0.039; >= 2 nodes: HR 2.95, p = 0.026). An internally validated, risk-score model incorporating all of these factors was developed with good performance (AUC 0.738). Patients with <= 4.00 and > 4.00 points had 5-year DSS rates of 89.4% and 67.2%, respectively. Five-year DSS for pathologic stage I/II patients with > 4.00 points (n = 49) was 79.8% and for pathologic stage III patients with <= 4.00 points (n = 62) was 90.3%. Conclusions A risk-score model, including patient and tumor factors, based on DSS improves prognostic assessment of patients with clinically localized MCC. This may inform surveillance strategies and patient selection for adjuvant therapy trials.

TI  - Mapping of cropland, cropping patterns and crop types by combining optical remote sensing images with decision tree classifier and random forest
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mapping and monitoring the distribution of croplands and crop types support policymakers and international organizations by reducing the risks to food security, notably from climate change and, for that purpose, remote sensing is routinely used. However, identifying specific crop types, cropland, and cropping patterns using space-based observations is challenging because different crop types and cropping patterns have similarity spectral signatures. This study applied a methodology to identify cropland and specific crop types, including tobacco, wheat, barley, and gram, as well as the following cropping patterns: wheat-tobacco, wheat-gram, wheat-barley, and wheat-maize, which are common in Gujranwala District, Pakistan, the study region. The methodology consists of combining optical remote sensing images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 with Machine Learning (ML) methods, namely a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) and a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The best time-periods for differentiating cropland from other land cover types were identified, and then Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 NDVI-based time-series were linked to phenological parameters to determine the different crop types and cropping patterns over the study region using their temporal indices and ML algorithms. The methodology was subsequently evaluated using Landsat images, crop statistical data for 2020 and 2021, and field data on cropping patterns. The results highlight the high level of accuracy of the methodological approach presented using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, together with ML techniques, for mapping not only the distribution of cropland, but also crop types and cropping patterns when validated at the county level. These results reveal that this methodology has benefits for monitoring and evaluating food security in Pakistan, adding to the evidence base of other studies on the use of remote sensing to identify crop types and cropping patterns in other countries.

TI  - Spatially Explicit Seagrass Extent Mapping Across the Entire Mediterranean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is the main habitat-forming species of the coastal Mediterranean, providing millennial-scale ecosystem services including habitat provisioning, biodiversity maintenance, food security, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration. Meadows of this endemic seagrass species represent the largest carbon storage among seagrasses around the world, largely contributing to global blue carbon stocks. Yet, the slow growth of this temperate species and the extreme projected temperature and sea-level rise due to climate change increase the risk of reduction and loss of these services. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in its basin-wide spatially explicit extent and relevant accounting, therefore accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change is needed. Here, we leveraged contemporary advances in Earth Observation-cloud computing, open satellite data, and machine learning-with field observations through a cloud-native geoprocessing framework to account the spatially explicit ecosystem extent of P. oceanica seagrass across its full bioregional scale. Employing 279,186 Sentinel-2 satellite images between 2015 and 2019, and a human-labeled training dataset of 62,928 pixels, we mapped 19,020 km(2) of P. oceanica meadows up to 25 m of depth in 22 Mediterranean countries, across a total seabed area of 56,783 km(2). Using 2,480 independent, field-based points, we observe an overall accuracy of 72%. We include and discuss global and region-specific seagrass blue carbon stocks using our bioregional seagrass extent estimate. As reference data collections, remote sensing technology and biophysical modelling improve and coalesce, such spatial ecosystem extent accounts could further support physical and monetary accounting of seagrass condition and ecosystem services, like blue carbon and coastal biodiversity. We envisage that effective policy uptake of these holistic seagrass accounts in national climate strategies and financing could accelerate transparent natural climate solutions and coastal resilience, far beyond the physical location of seagrass beds.

TI  - Fire foci and their spatiotemporal relations to weather variables and land uses in the state of Mato Grosso
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We analyzed the occurrences of fire foci between years 2001 and 2015 in Mato Grosso state, Brazil. For this, we used remote sensing data and we correlated fire with surface temperature, rainfall, wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, and vegetation index. The data were analyzed within the state according to use and cover classes. We also spatialize the fire occurrence using Kernel density and analyze trends with the Mann-Kendall test. The year 2015 was the year with the highest average annual air temperature and lowest annual cumulative rainfall, and wet season with the lowest relative humidity and highest surface temperature. Therefore, it was the year with less difference in the number of fire foci between wet (40.53%) and dry (59.47%) seasons. The period 2002-2005 and the years 2007 and 2010 had the highest fire foci, representing about 66.5% of the total from 2001 to 2015. In these years, 80 to 83% of fire foci occurred in the dry season. The classes with the highest density of fire were Mining Area, Urban Area, Temporary Crops, and Pasture. The fire foci in Urbanized Area, Temporary Crops, Pasture and Forestry classes tended to decrease throughout the 15 years evaluated. Fire foci were negatively correlated with rainfall, relative humidity and soil water and positively correlated with wind and surface temperature. This demonstrates that public policies related to combating fires in Brazil must be intensified especially in years with prediction of extreme drought.

TI  - A refined parallel stacking InSAR workflow for large-scale deformation fast extraction-a case study of Tibet
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibet Autonomous Region has a complex topography, and there are many difficulties in extracting its large-scale surface deformation. Traditional time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) approaches are time-consuming and difficult to handle the massive growth of data in a timely manner. In this paper, a refined parallel stacking InSAR workflow for large-scale deformation fast extraction is proposed. The burst images of Sentinel-1 data were first extracted, and a series of procedures were introduced to improve accuracy, including using a short spatial baseline to mitigate topographic error, using a polynomial to fit and remove the small-scale atmospheric error, and using the joint polarization stacking method to reduce random noise. The workflow was deployed to a supercomputing system for parallel processing to improve efficiency. Using 1638 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, the surface deformation rate of the entire Tibet Autonomous Region was obtained and in good agreement with the Global Positioning System (GPS) data, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.27 mm/year, indicating high accuracy.

TI  - Co- and Post-seismic Deformation Mechanisms of the 2020 Mw6.0 Jiashi Earthquake in Xinjiang (China), Revealed by Sentinel-1 InSAR Observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On 19 January 2020, an Mw6.0 earthquake occurred in Jiashi County, Xinjiang, China. This earthquake is a strong earthquake that occurred in the Kepingtage Belt. The monitoring and inversion of the co-seismic and post-earthquake will help further understand the geometry and movement properties of this tectonic belt. In this study, Sentinel-1A images were used to analyze the deformation of co-seismic and post-seismic events. The Okada elastic dislocation model was used to invert the geometric parameters of the fault and co-seismic slip distribution. The results showed that the maximum uplift and maximum subsidence deformations from the ascending images were 55 and 45 mm, respectively. The maximum uplift and subsidence deformations from the descending images were 62 and 28 mm, respectively. The inversion results show that the earthquake was induced by a fault with a length of 23.5 km, width of 4.7 km, and depth of 7.2 km. This earthquake was a typical dip-slip event. The distributed inversion results of post-earthquake deformation show that the maximum co-seismic slip and maximum post-seismic slip are located on the same fault plane, mainly distributed on the edge of the co-seismic fault, between the two faults.

TI  - Global reduction in ship-tracks from sulfur regulations for shipping fuel
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship-tracks are produced by ship-emitted aerosols interacting with low clouds. Here, we apply deep learning models on satellite data to produce the first global climatology map of ship-tracks. We show that ship-tracks are at the nexus of cloud physics, maritime shipping, and fuel regulation. Our map captures major shipping lanes while missing others because of background conditions. Ship-track frequency is more than 10 times higher than a previous survey, and its interannual fluctuations reflect variations in cross-ocean trade, shipping activity, and fuel regulations. Fuel regulation can alter both detected frequency and shipping routes due to cost. The 2020 fuel regulation, together with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, reduced ship-track frequency to its lowest level in recent decades across the globe and may have ushered in an era of low frequency. The regulation reduces the aerosol indirect forcing from ship emissions by 46% or between 0.02 and 0.27 W m(-2) given its current estimates.

TI  - Spatial distribution patterns of coral reefs in the Abrolhos region (Brazil, South Atlantic ocean)
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Managers and scientists benefit from satellite-derived bottom type maps of coral reefs and other highly bio-diverse coastal ecosystems. Here, we generated a map of the coral reefs within the Abrolhos National Marine Park (ANMP), one of Brazil's most iconic marine protected areas, using a very-high-spatial-resolution World -View-2 (WV02) image and field observations. A particular geomorphology characterizes this region, where reefs grow in columnar pinnacles with different top height and dimensions (1-25 m height and 1-50 m diameter). The WV02 image went through three different processing steps (corrections for atmosphere, sun-glint and water column effects) to retrieve the bottom signal at 478 nm, which was used to produce a bottom map from an object -based image analysis (OBIA) and to evaluate reef distribution through landscape metrics. A bottom map with 64% of overall accuracy was obtained. Reef distribution showed a heterogeneous aggregation pattern of pin-nacles to the East of the Abrolhos archipelago as well as the vegetated bottom around the archipelago. The novel map presented herein may guide management strategies of the AMNP, provide a background for connectivity studies, and help address the evolution (i.e., biogeomorphology processes) of the unique shallow Abrolhos reef structures.

TI  - Teaching ill-defined problems in engineering
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM
M3  - Article
AB  - Ill-defined problems are found in many real-world situations and involve both technical and societal issues. Thus, engineering education must prepare students to address such problems. This paper presents a methodology that combines a metacognitive model with question-prompts to guide students in defining and solving ill-defined engineering problems. The proposed methodology is based on the concept of Weltanschauung, a term that pertains to the view through which the world is perceived, i.e., the "worldview." Three case studies illustrate the methodology. The first case study focuses on an engineering economics problem; the second focuses on a business reengineering problem, and the third focuses on product design. In all three cases, the participating students were able to define the problem with little or no instructor help. The findings suggested that the students could more easily connect the problem domain with other learning. Also, results showed that the approach led to an increased engagement level, ignited student curiosity, and enabled them to acquire new skills or knowledge, expanding their creativity and innovation.

TI  - Management of Massive Upper Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage Secondary to Gastrosplenic Fistula
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Gastrosplenic fistula (GSF) is seen secondary to the development of a fistulous track between the stomach and spleen and/or splenic vessels. It is most commonly seen in patients with diffuse B-cell lymphoma, who usually present with symptoms of abdominal pain and weight loss. GSF has also been seen in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, peptic ulcer disease, splenic abscesses, and post gastric sleeve resection. Less than 25% of the patients with GSF may present with upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). This presentation of GSF is common with benign causes including peptic ulcer disease. UGIB secondary to GSF, while rare, requires prompt identification and intervention, to avoid catastrophic outcomes. We discuss the case of a 64-year-old female with GSF, who presented with sentinel bleed followed by hemorrhagic shock, secondary to a B-cell lymphoma, who was managed with a partial gastrectomy, splenectomy, and distal pancreatectomy, with favorable outcomes.

TI  - Multispectral panoptic segmentation: Exploring the beach setting with worldview-3 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Panoptic segmentation is a recent and powerful task that tackles individual object recognition ( "things ") and multiple backgrounds ( "stuff ") simultaneously. Remote sensing studies with panoptic segmentation are still restricted and recent, with great application perspectives. In this sense, we propose the first multispectral panoptic segmentation study, considering the "thing "and "stuff'' classes in the beach scenario and evaluating different sets of spectral bands. Our methodology included developing a dataset with 3800 (3200 for training, 300 for validation, and 300 for testing) with 128 x 128 spatial dimensions and eight spectral bands considering fourteen classes (6 "thing "and 8 "stuff'' classes). We used WorldView-3 images from Praia do Futuro, Fortaleza, and pan-sharpening to improve spatial resolution. Five different spectral band configurations were considered: (1) all eight bands, (2) RGB + NIR1 + NIR2, (3) RGB + NIR1, (4) RGB + NIR2, and (5) only RGB. The model training used the Panoptic-FPN architecture with the same hyperparameter settings considering three backbones (ResNeXt-101, ResNet-101, and ResNet-50). The best result considered the ResNeXt-101 with all spectral bands. However, the results from the first four configurations were very similar, and the RGB alone was the only configuration with significantly lower results. We also evaluated 15 semantic segmentation models for a benchmark comparison for the Beach Dataset. We show in visual results that even though the semantic models may be precise, they fail at identifying unique targets, especially in crowded locations such as the beach. The panoptic segmentation allowed a necessary detailing and counting of tourist infrastructures and mapping of other background features, establishing an essential tool for inspecting beach areas.

TI  - Mapping the soil types combining multi-temporal remote sensing data with texture features
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing (RS) technology, remote sensing images provide an important data basis for soil type mapping. In remote sensing images, temporal factor is difficult to obtain directly, and the rich geometric features are not used adequately. Multi-temporal remote sensing data could effectively reflect the temporal variation of ground objects, while how to extract multi-temporal image features more effectively for soil type interpretation needs to be studied. Moreover, it is not clear whether multi-temporal features and texture features can be effectively integrated to improve mapping accuracies. Therefore, taking five soil types of Laoshan County, Shandong Peninsula, China as the subject investigated and six remote sensing images as data sources, this paper explored and compared two extraction methods of multi-temporal features from remote sensing images. The effects of the eight different texture features fused the multi-temporal features on digital soil mapping were also analyzed. The results showed that the principal component extraction result based on the tasseled cap transformation was better than based on the spectral band synthesis, increasing the overall accuracy by 3.83-11.41% and the kappa index by 0.03-0.13. The fusion of multi-temporal features and texture features can effectively improve accuracies of soil type mapping. After the addition of correlation texture feature parameter, the overall accuracy (86.81%) and Kappa index (0.81) were increased by 11.92% and 0.16, respectively. The research results showed that multi-temporal features in remote sensing images had great advantages in digital soil mapping, and the effective fusion with texture features provided a new idea for improving the accuracy of digital soil mapping.

TI  - Producing WorldView-2 fused images of superior quality by the novel ELSHORA fusion technique
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the novel ELSHORA fusion technique was developed for the fusion of the WorldView-2 satellite panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images. This fusion technique has the advantage of overcoming the weaknesses of the other existing fusion techniques and producing fused images of superior spectral and spatial quality for all land cover types. This technique uses a modification coefficient for each MS band according to its intersecting area with the PAN band to ensure that only the wavelengths of the MS bands within the PAN band range participate in the definition of the I image, and the I image will be a weighted average of the eight modified MS bands. These modification coefficients will help in the preservation of the original colors as well as achieve spatial and temporal transferability for the ELSHORA fusion technique. This technique also uses an additional coefficient for the NIR band in the agricultural areas to indicate the correct effect of the vegetation, as its reflectance is high in the NIR band. This vegetation coefficient will achieve the performance stability for the ELSHORA fusion technique across the different types of land cover. To evaluate the performance of the ELSHORA fusion technique, it was compared to six standard image fusion techniques: modified IHS, Ehlers fusion, hyper-spherical color space, principal component analysis, Brovey transform, and multiplicative resolution merge. These fusion techniques were utilized to merge the spatial and spectral information of four datasets of WorldView-2 satellite PAN and MS images covering different land cover types: agricultural, urban, and mixed areas. The four datasets were chosen in two different places and acquired at two different times to evaluate the spatiotemporal transferability of the ELSHORA fusion technique. The fused images were compared to the PAN and MS images, as well as to each other, statistically and visually. The results demonstrated the superiority of the ELSHORA fusion technique for all types of land cover. It can effectively generate sharper fused images without color distortion at different times and places.

T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The potential of citizens as a source of geographical information has been recognized for many years. Such activity has grown recently due to the proliferation of inexpensive location aware devices and an ability to share data over the internet. Recently, a series of major projects, often cast as citizen observatories, have helped explore and develop this potential for a wide range of applications. Here, some of the experiences and learnings gained from part of one such project, which aimed to further the role of citizen science within Earth observation and help address environmental challenges, LandSense, are shared. The key focus is on quality assurance of citizen generated data on land use and land cover especially to support analyses of remotely sensed data and products. Particular focus is directed to quality assurance checks on photographic image quality, privacy, polygon overlap, positional accuracy and offset, contributor agreement, and categorical accuracy. The discussion aims to provide good practice advice to aid future studies and help fulfil the full potential of citizens as a source of volunteered geographical information (VGI).

TI  - Prognostic value of molecular cytology by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay of peritoneal washings in advanced gastric cancer patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peritoneal dissemination is a common form of gastric cancer (GC) recurrence, despite surgery with curative intent. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of intraperitoneal lavage One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) assay in advanced GC patients. OSNA assay targeting CK-19 mRNA was applied to detect free cancer cells (FCC) in intraperitoneal lavage samples obtained during gastrectomy. A total of 82 GC patients were enrolled to investigate the correlation between OSNA assay and patient's prognosis. Of the 82 patients, OSNA assay was positive in 25 (30.5%) patients. The median OS in OSNA positive patients was significantly lower than in OSNA negative patients (19 vs 45 months). Positive OSNA assay result was a significant unfavourable prognostic factor in both, univariable (HR 3.45, 95% CI 0.95-12.48; p = 0.0030) and multivariable analysis (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.22-8.54; p = 0.0298). Positive OSNA assay in intraperitoneal lavage is a valuable indicator of poor survival in advanced GC patients after multimodal treatment. After further confirmation on larger sample size, OSNA assay of peritoneal washings could be considered an adjunct tool to conventional cytology, the current gold standard, to provide precise intraoperative staging and additional prognostic information.

TI  - A novel feature space monitoring index of salinisation in the Yellow River Delta based on SENTINEL-2B MSI images
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of previous studies utilized the surface parameters from LANDSAT images to construct the feature space monitoring index model of salinisation (salinization), and a few studies that have combined the feature space model with SENTINEL-2B MSI images have been reported. In addition, the red edge index derived from SENTINEL-2B MSI images can provide more detailed information to indicate the vegetation condition when monitoring salinized land ecosystems. Based on SENTINEL-2B MSI images, this paper introduces seven typical parameters, namely NDVI, MSAVI, SI, Albedo, NDre1, NDre2, and NDre3 (red edge index) to construct two category features space models (point-to-line type and point-to-point type), and then, a novel salinisation monitoring index for use in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Our main conclusions showed that: (1) the monitoring index model based on SENTINEL-2B MSI images and a feature space model has high applicability for the salinisation monitoring in the YRD, with an average precision of R-2 = 0.8499; (2) the point-to-point monitoring index of soil salinisation based on the NDre1-SI feature space model has the best inversion accuracy of R-2 = 0.9305 and RMSE = 0.9926; (3) the red edge index can better indicate the state and evolution process of soil salinisation. The salinisation monitoring models that included the red edge indexes have higher inversion accuracy with an average value of R-2 = 0.8650; (4) the soil salinisation in the YRD was more serious in its eastern and northeastern regions than other parts. The results provide a new technical and methodological approach for the prevention and treatment of regional salinisation.

TI  - FluTracking: Weekly online community based surveillance of influenza-like illness in Australia, 2018 Annual Report
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - FluTracking experienced major growth in 2018, with participation numbers increasing 34.1% from 2017. The addition of 16,881 new participants brought the total number of participants for 2018 to 45,532. A majority of participants continued to complete their survey within 24 hours of the email being sent (mean 74.3% responses received in 24 hours). The rate of influenza-like illness (ILI) in 2018 was the lowest since FluTracking commenced in 2007 and was consistently low across all ages. The peak weekly ILI rate was consistent with previous years, occurring during the week ending 19 August. This preceded the peak in laboratory-confirmed influenza notifications by three weeks. During the peak week of FluTracking, 2.1% of unvaccinated, and 1.9% of vaccinated participants reported fever and cough. By the final survey of 2018, 65.6% of participants had received the annual influenza vaccine, compared with 60.2% in 2017. Vaccination rates in participants under five years of age doubled from 23.7% in 2017, to 55.6% in 2018. During the peak four weeks of reported ILI, a lower percentage of participants sought medical care in 2018 compared to 2017 (36.7% and 42.3% respectively), and fewer participants reported a positive laboratory test for influenza (0.8% and 4.8%). Overall the severity of the 2018 season was one of the lowest FluTracking has recorded. Rates of both influenza laboratory notifications and general practitioner (GP) ILI consultations were lower in 2018 than most prior years. We found a reduction in the percentage of FluTracking partici-pants with ILI who were tested for influenza (3.2% compared with 5.0% in 2017), and who visited a medical practitioner (36.7% compared with 42.3% in 2017). The drop in laboratory-confirmed cases and Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network (ASPREN) reported GP consultations concurs with our survey results that 2018 was a milder influenza season than many previous.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) has emphasized on the incidence-prevalence ratio (IPR) and incidence-mortality ratio (IMR) to measure the progress in HIV epidemic control. In this paper, we describe the status of epidemic control in India and in various states in terms of UNAIDS's recommended metrices.Method The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) of India spearheads work on mathematical modelling to estimate HIV burden based on periodically conducted sentinel surveillance for providing guidance to program implementation and policymaking. Using the results of the latest round of HIV Estimations in 2019, IPR and IMR were calculated.Results National level IPR was 0.029 [0.022-0.037] in 2019 and ranged from 0.01 to 0.15 in various States and Union Territories (UTs). Corresponding Incidence-Mortality Ratio was at 0.881 [0.754-1.014] nationally and ranged between 0.20 and 12.90 across the States/UTs.Conclusions Based on UNAIDS recommended indicators for HIV epidemic control, namely IPR and IMR; national AIDS response in India appears on track. However, the program success is not uniform and significant heterogeneity as well as expanding epidemic was observed at the level of States or UTs. Reinforcing States/UTs specific and focused HIV prevention, testing and treatment initiatives may help in the attainment of 2030 Sustainable Development Goals of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

TI  - Estimation of biomass burning emissions by integrating ICESat-2, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic carbon emissions directly contribute to global warming, which has induced severe environmental concerns like extreme droughts and devastating fires. To evaluate the effects of fires on carbon cycling and climate change, it is crucial to accurately estimate the amount of carbon released during fires. The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission offers spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of global forests, providing excellent opportunities for monitoring forest dynamics and carbon emissions. The ICESat-2 Land and vegetation height product (ATL08), Landsat 8 data, and Sentinel-1 data were integrated to estimate biomass burning emissions with a three-phase hierarchy model. In Phase 1, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to establish the relationship between ATL08 LiDAR metrics and reference aboveground biomass (AGB), R2 0.77 and RMSE 56.67 Mg ha-1. In Phase 2, the LASSO regression predicted AGB for all ATL08 segments. A Random Forest Regression model was trained with Landsat 8 reflectance data and derived vegetation indices, Sentinel-1 data, and terrain variables as predictors and with the LASSO predicted AGB as the response variable, R2 0.71 and RMSE 45.91 Mg ha-1. Wall-to-wall maps of pre-fire and post-fire AGB were produced with the Random Forest model. In Phase 3, the difference between the pre-fire and the post-fire AGB was converted to carbon emissions. The estimated biomass burning emissions of the 2018 Carr fire group, the 2018 Camp fire, and the 2019 Walker fire in California are 3.54 (+/- 0.067) Tg C, 1.66 (+/- 0.041) Tg C, and 0.45 (+/- 0.022) Tg C, respectively. Forests have the highest biomass burning emissions with an average emission of 30.09 Mg ha-1, approximately twice and four times the average emissions from shrubs and grasses. This study highlights the merit of integrating spaceborne remote sensing data, including LiDAR data, optical data, and radar data, for estimating biomass burning emissions, opening an avenue for accurate forest biomass and carbon dynamics monitoring, as well as climate change mitigation.

TI  - On the Nile Fan's wave power potential and controlling factors integrating spectral and geostatistical techniques
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave energy is foreseen to contribute largely to the renewable energy projected to supply 20% of Egypt's electricity budget to meet burgeoning energy demand. Therefore, this research analyses the Nile Fan wave energy forecasted from numerical modeling for 2020 of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) database, hourly spatially sampled at 0.042(o) as the finest scale remotelysensed data available. Wave energy spatial distribution is analyzed using data from 259 points proposed asWave Energy Converters (WECs). Spectral analyses techniques were appraised for disclosing the frequency and energy return periods of the significant wave height and peak periods and to understand the similarity among selected WECs of varied conditions. Factor analysis is conducted to investigate the magnitude of factors controlling the wave dynamic and energy potential. K-means clustering was used to distinguish energy classes with large inter-class variances. The obtained resources (average wave energy density, around 5.32 KWh/m; maximum recorded value of 112.9 KWh/m; annual wave energy density sum of about 46.96 MWh/m) are among the largest found in the Mediterranean Sea. Spectral analysis clarified a strong periodicity at 21 days, intermittent periods of 2.66 days, and 7.5 days dominate over the year while a 22.6 hourly period dominates in summer. January attained the strongest peak frequency of 8.4 in the west, 6.6 between the NW and SE sites, 5.20 for the near shore sites. Directional analysis indicated a bimodal wave system (325(o) and 285(o)-295(o)) in the west and unimodal (285(o) 295(o)) in the east, while the central area showed combined distribution; bimodal in the deep water and unimodal near the shore. The 285(o)-295(o) wave direction showed largest contribution to the wave energy density. The northwest is the most energetic and most productive area. Monthly and seasonal wave energy clarified maximum of 9.98 MWh/m in January and 22.6 MWh/m in winter that contributes to 21% and 53% of the yearly mean, respectively. The wave energy resource is more than 3.5 times greater in winter than in summer. Exploitable energy density level exceeding 2 KWh/m are recorded for 250 sites out of the 259 site. Factor and detrended correspondence analyses confirmed that more than 98% of the Nile Fan's wave energy variance is controlled, in decreasing order of influence, by the depth, distance to shore, significant wave height, wave peak period, and wave principal direction. Four classes of varied statistics and hence different wave behavior were distinguished affected by the depth, morphology of the shoreline, and the dominating wave direction. Deepest water and near shore classes attained the largest wave energy. Further details on the effect of the environmental factors on the wave shape and corresponding energy are concluded.

TI  - Veterinary syndromic surveillance using swine production data for farm health management and early disease detection
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of syndmmic surveillance (SyS) has grown in animal health since the 2010s, but the use of production data has been underexplored due to methodological and practical challenges. This paper aimed to tackle some of those challenges by developing a SyS system using production data routinely collected in pig breeding farms. Health-related indicators were created from the recorded data, and two different time-series types emerged: the weekly counts of events traditionally used in SyS; and continuous time-series, where every new event is a new observation, and grouping by time-unit is not applied. Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Shewhart control charts were used for temporal aberration detection, using three detection limits to create a "severity" score. The system performance was evaluated using simulated outbreaks of porcine respiratory and reproduction syndrome (PRRS) as a disease introduction scenario. The system proved capable of providing early detection of unexpected trends, serving as a useful health and management decision support tool for farmers. Further research is needed to combine results of monitoring multiple parallel time-series into an overall assessment of the risk of reproduction failure.

TI  - Observational evidence of elevated smoke layers during crop residue burning season over Delhi: Potential implications on associated heterogeneous PM<sub>2.5</sub> enhancements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Post monsoonal agricultural Crop Residue Burning (CRB) over northwestern India is believed to severely affect the air quality of the megacity of Delhi. However, the mechanistic understanding remains elusive. Long-term satellite observations (2007-2020) of aerosol properties during CRB season (Oct 20th to Nov 20th) indicate a distinct airshed of CRB plume transport from Northwestern India (source region) to greater Delhi (downwind region). Theoretically, the smoke concentration should disperse downwind, and the CRB-associated PM2.5 enhancement over Northern India should be inversely proportional to the distance from the CRB source region. However, the in-situ PM2.5 observations illustrate that smoke-associated enhancement in PM2.5 over greater Delhi (downwind region) is disproportionately large compared to the source region. In this study, we examine satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based observations along with reanalysis data to provide robust evidence that aerosol-boundary layer - PM2.5 associations via semi-direct effect can explain the above heterogeneity. Vertically resolved satellite observations indicate that as the emitted CRB-smoke plumes travel downwind, a portion of the transported smoke plume injected relatively at a higher altitude leads to the formation of an elevated smoke layer over greater Delhi. These elevated smoke layers tend to suppress the mixing height via inducing strong temperature inversion, thereby severely constraining the daytime dilution effect of shallow boundary layers. Along with direct advection of smoke particles, enhanced accumulation of local urban emissions due to these semi-direct impacts can lead to the observed disproportionate PM2.5 enhancements over Delhi during CRB haze periods. Thus, control of the local anthropogenic emissions could bring relief during the extreme haze episodes over Delhi.

TI  - Transformation and risk assessment of the East Kolkata Wetlands (India) using fuzzy MCDM method and geospatial technology
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) is located on the eastern periphery of the city of Kolkata and extends up to the Bidyadhari-Matla River confluence. It is a Ramsar Site and acts as an absorber basin for a large number of con-taminants drained from Kolkata. Agricultural lands, sewage-fed fisheries, garbage dumping fields, horticulture, and built-up areas are included in this protected area, that covers approximately 125 km(2). It reveals that climate change reduces the variety of wetland ecosystem services and increases socio-economic vulnerability and economic stress. The human encroachment, reclamation of land for agriculture, aquaculture, and urban expansion in and around Kolkata has recently adversely threatened the EKW. The remotely sensed data, socio-economic data, and responses of inhabitants have been used to analyse the EKW's risk and vulnerability. We employed geospatial analysis by using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method using nine risk factors. An in-depth analysis of the EKW using geospatial techniques and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) helped to understand the EKW transformations through vulnerability and risk analysis. The results show that the transformation of the wetland to aquaculture, eutrophication and pollution, road proximity, waste dumping, population density, and growth are the main factors for the deteriorating health, quality, and environment of the EKW. It also reveals that quantitative and qualitative evaluations of ecosystem services, wetland degradation, transformation, and cause -effect rapport should be periodically assessed using scientific methods like FAHP, RS, GIS to formulate resilient, integrated plans and strategy for the sustainable management of the EKW.

TI  - Non-invasive predictors of axillary lymph node burden in breast cancer: a single-institution retrospective analysis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Axillary staging is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) is currently used to stage patients who are clinically and radiologically node-negative. Since the establishment that axillary node clearance (ANC) does not improve overall survival in breast-conserving surgery for patients with low-risk biological cancers, axillary management has become increasingly conservative. This study aims to identify and assess the clinical predictive value of variables that could play a role in the quantification of axillary burden, including the accuracy of quantifying abnormal axillary nodes on ultrasound. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of hospital data for female breast cancer patients receiving an ANC at our centre between January 2018 and January 2020. The reference standard for axillary burden was surgical histology following SNB and ANC, allowing categorisation of the patients under 'low axillary burden' (2 or fewer pathological macrometastases) or 'high axillary burden' (> 2). After exploratory univariate analysis, multivariate logistic regression was conducted to determine relationships between the outcome category and candidate predictor variables: patient age at diagnosis, tumour focality, tumour size on ultrasound and number of abnormal lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound. Results One hundred and thirty-five patients were included in the analysis. Logistic regression showed that the number of abnormal lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound was the strongest predictor of axillary burden and statistically significant (P = 0.044), with a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 86.8% (P = 0.011). Conclusion Identifying the number of abnormal lymph nodes on preoperative ultrasound can help to quantify axillary nodal burden and identify patients with high axillary burden, and should be documented as standard in axillary ultrasound reports of patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Toll-like receptor triggering in systemic sclerosis: time to target
T2  - RHEUMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - SSc is an autoimmune disease that has features of vascular abnormalities, inflammation and skin and lung fibrosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sentinel receptors that serve to recognize pathogens or internal danger signals leading to downstream signalling pathways that ultimately lead to inflammation and modification of adaptive immunity. Inflammation and fibrosis appear intricately connected in this disease and TLR ligation on fibroblasts can directly activate these cells to produce copious amounts of collagen, a hallmark of disease. The presence of damage-associated molecular patterns in association with fibrosis has been highlighted. Given their prominent role in disease, this review discusses the evidence of their expression and role in disease pathogenesis and possible therapeutic intervention to mitigate fibrosis.

TI  - Decreasing surface albedo signifies a growing importance of clouds for Greenland Ice Sheet meltwater production
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here the authors use remote sensing observations and machine learning to show that clouds will become increasingly important for determining the Greenland Ice Sheet's contribution to global sea levels due to decreasing albedo in the ablation zone.Clouds regulate the Greenland Ice Sheet's surface energy balance through the competing effects of shortwave radiation shading and longwave radiation trapping. However, the relative importance of these effects within Greenland's narrow ablation zone, where nearly all meltwater runoff is produced, remains poorly quantified. Here we use machine learning to merge MODIS, CloudSat, and CALIPSO satellite observations to produce a high-resolution cloud radiative effect product. For the period 2003-2020, we find that a 1% change in cloudiness has little effect (+/- 0.16 W m(-2)) on summer net radiative fluxes in the ablation zone because the warming and cooling effects of clouds compensate. However, by 2100 (SSP5-8.5 scenario), radiative fluxes in the ablation zone will become more than twice as sensitive (+/- 0.39 W m(-2)) to changes in cloudiness due to reduced surface albedo. Accurate representation of clouds will therefore become increasingly important for forecasting the Greenland Ice Sheet's contribution to global sea-level rise.

TI  - Detecting dust loads in the atmosphere over Thar desert by using MODIS and INSAT-3D data
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended dust particles in atmosphere have adverse impacts on environment, ecosystem as well as on human health. To avoid negative impacts of dust storm events, early warning system to predict it well in advance may be a suitable option. However, for this purpose, assessment on magnitude of dust load and its dynamics in atmosphere is a primary requirement. The present study aims to develop remote sensing based assessment of dust load in atmosphere specifically over the Indian Thar Desert region. The severe dust storm event occurred on 5(th) June 2017 over the Indian Thar Desert has been used in this study to develop integrated dust detection algorithm using split window technique, mid-infrared technique and different dust indices derived from MODIS and INSAT-3D data. Evaluation of the developed algorithm revealed that the area classified under dust load depends on threshold value of dust indices used in the algorithm, type of dust detection techniques followed and the specifications of remote sensing sensors used to retrieve the dust image. The integrated dust detection algorithm developed in this study has the capability to eliminate the problem in variations of predicted dust loadings in atmosphere. Validation of the developed algorithm to detect dust pixels showed good agreement with independent observations on aerosol optical depth (AOD), wind speed profile data and ground visibility data. The method adopted can be helpful to implement an operational system for detection and monitoring of dust storms over the Thar Desert region.

TI  - Rhinovirus persistence during the COVID-19 pandemic-Impact on pediatric acute wheezing presentations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rhinoviruses have persisted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite other seasonal respiratory viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus) being mostly suppressed by pandemic restrictions, such as masking and other forms of social distancing, especially during the national lockdown periods. Rhinoviruses, as nonenveloped viruses, are known to transmit effectively via the airborne and fomite route, which has allowed infection among children and adults to continue despite pandemic restrictions. Rhinoviruses are also known to cause and exacerbate acute wheezing episodes in children predisposed to this condition. Noninfectious causes such as air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10) can also play a role. In this retrospective ecological study, we demonstrate the correlation between UK national sentinel rhinovirus surveillance, the level of airborne particulates, and the changing patterns of pediatric emergency department presentations for acute wheezing, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2018-2021) in a large UK teaching hospital.

TI  - Detection of thermal features from space at Indonesian volcanoes from 2000 to 2020 using ASTER
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Routine analysis and detection of volcanic thermal features (VTFs) are available globally for low spatial reso-lution (>1 km/pixel) thermal infrared (TIR) sensors. However, medium resolution (90 m/pixel) ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) TIR data, which is sensitive to smaller and cooler VTFs, have yet to be systematically examined at all active Indonesian volcanoes. We manually examined cloud-free nighttime images at 136 potentially active volcanoes from 2000 to 2020 CE and found at least 71 volcanoes with VTFs, despite the low proportion (26.5%) of cloud-free images. Of these, 34 volcanoes have VTF detections from space published for the first time (to our knowledge) and at least 44 volcanoes have non-eruptive VTFs (fumaroles, heated volcanic lakes and open vent systems). The inclusion of hotspots detected by ASTER in this study increases the percentage of Indonesian volcanoes with recorded satellite-detectable thermal features from 27% to 52%, larger than in Latin America (27%) and the US (33%) which were surveyed in the same way and is possibly due to a higher frequency of eruptions in Indonesia. The distribution of VTFs across sub-regions in Indonesia is not uniform but may be correlated with the number of volcanoes with eruptions. This multi-decadal country-wide survey highlights the potential of TIR monitoring and detection of low-temperature volcanic fea-tures that may be eruption precursors, but also the limits of the available datasets since many volcanoes only have a few cloud-free nighttime images per year.

TI  - A spatiotemporal ensemble machine learning framework for generating land use/land cover time-series maps for Europe (2000-2019) based on LUCAS CORINE and GLAD Landsat
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatiotemporal machine learning framework for automated prediction and analysis of long-term Land Use/Land Cover dynamics is presented. The framework includes: (1) harmonization and preprocessing of spatial and spatiotemporal input datasets (GLAD Landsat, NPP/VIIRS) including five million harmonized LUCAS and CORINE Land Cover-derived training samples, (2) model building based on spatial k-fold crossvalidation and hyper-parameter optimization, (3) prediction of the most probable class, class probabilities and model variance of predicted probabilities per pixel, (4) LULC change analysis on time-series of produced maps. The spatiotemporal ensemble model consists of a random forest, gradient boosted tree classifier, and an artificial neural network, with a logistic regressor as meta-learner. The results show that the most important variables for mapping LULC in Europe are: seasonal aggregates of Landsat green and near-infrared bands, multiple Landsat-derived spectral indices, long-term surface water probability, and elevation. Spatial cross-validation of the model indicates consistent performance across multiple years with overall accuracy (a weighted F1-score) of 0.49, 0.63, and 0.83 when predicting 43 (level-3), 14 (level-2), and five classes (level-1). Additional experiments show that spatiotemporal models generalize better to unknown years, outperforming single-year models on known-year classification by 2.7% and unknown-year classification by 3.5%. Results of the accuracy assessment using 48,365 independent test samples shows 87% match with the validation points. Results of time-series analysis (time-series of LULC probabilities and NDVI images) suggest forest loss in large parts of Sweden, the Alps, and Scotland. Positive and negative trends in NDVI in general match the land degradation and land restoration classes, with "urbanization'' showing the most negative NDVI trend. An advantage of using spatiotemporal ML is that the fitted model can be used to predict LULC in years that were not included in its training dataset, allowing generalization to past and future periods, e.g. to predict LULC for years prior to 2000 and beyond 2020. The generated LULC time-series data stack (ODSE-LULC), including the training points, is publicly available via the ODSE Viewer. Functions used to prepare data and run modeling are available via the eumap library for Python.

TI  - Progress towards the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets among pregnant women in South Africa: Results from the 2017 and 2019 national Antenatal HIV Sentinel Surveys
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The UNAIDS 95-95-95 global targets for epidemic control aim to ensure by 2030 that 95% of HIV-positive people know their HIV status, 95% of people diagnosed with HIV receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95% of people on ART have viral suppression. While data on the first and second 95 targets are routinely reported nationally, data on the third 95 target are not available for pregnant women in South Africa. The lack of data on the third 95 target limits the inclusion of low viral suppression as one of the contributing factors in MTCT root cause analyses. This study assessed progress towards the 95-95-95 targets among pregnant women between the ages of 15-49 years attending public health facilities in South Africa.Method Data were obtained from two consecutive national cross-sectional antenatal HIV sentinel surveys conducted between 1 October and 15 November in both 2017 and 2019. In each survey, data on age, knowledge of HIV status, ART initiation, and geographical location (province) were extracted from medical records. A blood specimen was collected from each woman and tested for HIV. Viral load tests were performed on HIV-positive specimens. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine association between province and viral suppression (defined as viral load <50 copies/mL) using the combined dataset (i.e., both 2017 and 2019 data combined). All analyses considered the survey design.Results Of 10 065 and 11 321 HIV-positive women included in the 2017 and 2019 surveys, respectively, 96.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 95.6-96.4%) and 97.6% (95% CI: 97.3-97.8%) knew their HIV-positive status; 86.6% (95% CI: 85.9-87.3%) and 96.0% (95% CI: 95.6-96.4%) of those who knew their HIV status were receiving ART; while 64.2% (95% CI: 63.2-65.2%) and 66.0% (95% CI: 65.1-66.8%) of those receiving ART were virally suppressed. Achievement of the third 95 target significantly varied by province ranging from 33.9-72.6% in 2017 and 43.4-77.3% in 2019. Knowledge of HIV-positive status, ART initiation, and viral suppression increased in both 15-24 and 25-49 year age groups between 2017 and 2019. In a multivariable analysis adjusting for survey year, gravidity, and education, the odds of viral suppression significantly varied by province (except KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape, other provinces were less likely to attain viral suppression compared to Gauteng), age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for 15-24 years vs 25-49 years: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8), and timing of ART initiation (AOR for ART initiation during pregnancy vs before pregnancy: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.5-0.6).Conclusion Although in 2019 the first and second 95 targets were achieved among pregnant women, meeting the third 95 target remains a challenge. This study highlighted the importance of promoting early ART initiation and the need to target young women in efforts to improve progress towards the third 95 target. Additionally, the provincial variation in viral suppression could be further investigated in future studies to identify and address the root causes underlying these differences.

TI  - Uncertainty quantification in land surface temperature retrieved from Himawari-8/AHI data by operational algorithms
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8, a new-generation geostationary satellite, can retrieve sub-hourly land surface temperatures (LSTs) with moderate spatial resolution, providing a new scale for monitoring the thermal environment in Asia and Oceania. This study evaluated uncertainties of LSTs retrieved by three operational algorithms from Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data. We compared two nonlinear split-window algorithms (SOB and WAN algorithms) and one nonlinear three-band algorithm (YAM algorithm). First, the error characteristics of the retrieved LSTs caused by the input parameter errors were simulated under various land-atmospheric conditions using an atmospheric radiative transfer model. Thereafter, retrieved LSTs from actual AHI data were evaluated using in-situ observations from AsiaFlux and OzFlux networks and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LSTs. The simulated results showed that the YAM algorithm maintained the highest accuracy, whereas the WAN algorithm had the highest robustness to input errors. The YAM algorithm had the smallest total error including input errors over a wide range of retrieval conditions. Validation of the three algorithms via in-situ LSTs from 12 sites revealed nighttime mean RMSEs for all sites of similar to 1.7 degrees C, and daytime mean RMSEs for semi-arid and humid sites of approximately 3.0 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C, respectively. These are comparable to the accuracies reported for LST products with higher spatial resolutions, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat. Within the Himawari-8 disk, the estimation error of the YAM algorithm was similar to 1.0 degrees C lower than those of the SOB and WAN algorithms in regions with extremely high viewing angle, temperature, and humidity (e.g., northern China, Australia, and Southeast Asia). Furthermore, AHI LSTs showed closer agreement with ECOSTRESS compared to in-situ LSTs, suggesting the usefulness of ECOSTRESS for assessing the diurnal LSTs derived from geostationary satellites. The resulting LST products and the knowledge of their error characteristics have the potential to improve the collective understanding of terrestrial energy and water cycles based on improved accuracy and robustness.

TI  - Extraction of multiple cropping information at the Sub-pixel scale based on phenology and MODIS NDVI time-series: a case study in Henan Province, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and mapping multiple cropping patterns(MCP) is important to meet global food demand. Due to the random crops in smallholder farming, it is challenging to obtain phenology and location of MCP. Phenology exhibits stable rhythmic variation, and vegetation index(VI) forms time-series profiles reflecting rhythmic variations. Since most crops have different growth cycles, time-series are used as a fingerprint to distinguish multiple crops in a specific area. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) normalized-VI(NDVI) data were used to construct time-series, but different land cover types were often mixed in a 250 m MODIS pixel. Time-series were explored as input of spectral unmixing algorithms that could capture the spatial distribution of MCP and subpixels at large areas. Time-series profiles of MCP were extracted based on N-finder algorithm(N-FINDR). Considering the mixed-pixel, fully constrained least-squares(FCLS) was used to extract the spatial distribution of MCP. The accuracy of the algorithm was verified using high spatial resolution images with an overall accuracy of 85.65%. The results show that the algorithm simultaneously extracts MCP and spatial distributions at large scales.

TI  - Vegetation Coverage Monitoring Model Design Based on Deep Learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the medium-resolution Landsat TM and OLI satellite images in the study area, the deep learning ENVINet-5 model is adopted for vegetation coverage monitoring. By referring to the fusion image and Google Earth high-resolution satellite image, the training samples and veriScation samples are manually labeled, and the labels of four types of ground objects (desert, water body, cultivated land, and construction land) are made. Through the ENVI deep learning binary classiScation model, the labeled training samples are trained, and a large number of samples of desert, water, and cultivated land are extracted and transformed into corresponding label images. Then, a large number of training sample labels extracted from the model are combined with the manually made construction land sample labels and both of them are used as the training samples of the ENVI deep learning multiclassiScation model. According to the classiScation process of the deep learning model (creating label image, initializing training model, and training model and model classiScation), through the adjustment of various parameters, the four types of ground objects in the study area are Snally classiSed. Finally, the classiScation results that meet the accuracy requirements are statistically analyzed. It is proved that the model classiScation results can meet the use requirements.

TI  - Coherent pixel selection using a dual-channel 1-D CNN for time series InSAR analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coherent pixel (CP) selection is an important step in the processing chain of time series InSAR analysis. In this research, we propose a light deep learning framework, i.e., a dual-channel one-Dimensional Convolution Neural Network (1-D CNN) to select CPs. The 1-D CNN has simple input: SAR amplitude and interferogram coherence, and can be trained with CP samples generated by traditional thresholding method. In an experiment based on Sentinel-1 temporal images in Tianjin, China, the 1-D CNN substantially outperforms the thresholding method and the StaMPS method in terms of the amount and the quality of selected CPs. Additionally, a new measure is proposed to quantify CP quality, which is very useful when other reference data is unavailable. The proposed 1-D CNN framework on CP selection is reliable and fast, and of great significance in developing automatic time-series InSAR processing system.

TI  - A machine-learning approach for identifying dense-fires and assessing atmospheric emissions on the Indochina Peninsula, 2010-2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent and intensive wildland dense-fires (DFs) release substantial amounts of airborne pollutants, resulting in a sharp increase in emissions and leading to serious impacts on the environment and human health over extensive geographical areas. It is challenging to thoroughly investigate patterns of fire occurrence and fire distribution for predicting wildfire behaviour, and it is especially difficult to distinguish the characteristics of human-caused and climate-driven fires. Here, we identify and assess dense-fire (DF) from the perspective of spatiotemporally integrated processes using a machine-learning method based on a density-based clustering algorithm with noise constraint ratio. DFs represent collections of fires with homogenous behaviour and therefore allow the study of their internal features, which can reveal fixed patterns of fire occurrence and dis-tribution as well as the evolution of fires over time. We estimated and labelled thousands of fire clusters on the Indochina Peninsula between 2010 and 2020, most of which occurred between December and May. For large-scale DFs, the number of fires contained and amount of atmospheric pollutants emitted were accounted for throughout most of the region, and the time, location and scale of their occurrence each year were relatively stable and predictable. Furthermore, the results of a secondary cluster analysis of fire interactions over the past decade showed two extreme fire events, labelled "north " and "south " groups, whose activities significantly impacted the atmospheric environment of the Indochina Peninsula. Additionally, we predicted their start/end dates and daily emissions. The study also found that the recurrence of high-density fires and the correlation between the DF edge and administrative border suggested a positive anthropogenic influence. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to analyze fires in a spatiotemporal Euclidean space by using density-based clustering, with high-density fires as independent subjects to study fire behaviour. The method proposed in this study can provide a reference for wildfire prediction and emission forecasting and fire control work.

TI  - Post-mission de-orbiting of Cartosat-2
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - India has been voluntarily following the guidelines on space debris mitigation recommended by UN-COPUOS (United Nations Com-mittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) and IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris coordination Committee) to the maximum possible extent towards safe and sustainable operations in outer space. As a part of the ongoing efforts for better compliance with these guidelines, post-mission disposal of Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) objects has been carried out in the recent past. Cartosat-2, which was operational at 630 km altitude, is the first satellite to be de-orbited at its end-of-life through a series of perigee reduction orbit maneuvers to minimize its presence in the LEO region. Consequently, the post-mission orbital lifetime was reduced from more than 30 years to less than 5 years in compliance with the 25-year rule recommended in IADC space debris mitigation guidelines. The de-orbiting exercise utilizing left-over propellant also achieved the objective of minimising any accidental break-up risk. This paper outlines the relevant analyses and planning aspects of post-mission de-orbiting for Cartosat-2. The lessons learnt and recommendations on post-mission disposal for future LEO missions are also presented.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identification of hydrogeological features using remote sensing and electromagnetic methods in the hard- rock formations of the Cameroon coastal plain (Central Africa): implications for water borehole location
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable access to groundwater in rural areas such as the coastal plain of Cameroon (Sub-Saharan Africa) is an ongoing challenge due to the lack of knowledge on hydrogeological features favorable to the identification of potential groundwater targets. In this study, remote sensing imagery and electromagnetic surveys were used to assess the hydrogeo-logical potential of the Ngwei locality hard-rock. Automatic extraction of lineaments from Landsat-8 images indicated 200 lineaments with a total length of 293 km corresponding to 0.6 km of lineament per square km, suggesting a median groundwater potential. The main directions are NNW-SSE, N-S and NNE-SSW while the secondary directions are NW -SE; NE-SW and E-W. Surface geophysical investigations showed an electromagnetic field of 0 to 0.57 mV. These surface and borehole investigations confirmed basement fractur-ing and spatial variations in weathering profiles whose aquifer structure and yields (4.4 m(3)/h on average) are similar to what is commonly observed in the hard rock aquifer. The correlation between borehole productivity and the nearest lineament suggests that these lineaments are not (at least not all) surface traces of regional discontinuities that may act as major groundwater flow paths. This implies that the productivity of the Ngwei aquifers appears to be dependent on the fissured/fractured horizon, so exploration should be based on a contextual rather than general approach. Analysis of the consistency of the results with the field data allowed to propose a pre-liminary electromagnetic log model and also shows the value of using this approach to assess the availability of potential groundwater zones in hard rock areas. However, the methods used should be supported by further investigations to allow a better understanding of the hydrogeological characteristics of this part of the Central African basement so that no one is left behind in the achievement of the SDGs.

TI  - Clearance and persistence of <i>Escherichia coli</i> in the freshwater mussel <i>Unio mancus</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The excessive use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of resistant bacteria, mainly from the Enterobacterales group, with high pathogenic/zoonotic potentials that can lead to problems in public health. The increasing presence in freshwater ecosystems highlights the need to evaluate potential sentinel species as risk indicators for both ecosystem and human health. The freshwater mussels provide several ecosystem services, may represent potential sentinel species due to their ability to filter water and retain both organic and inorganic particles. We tested the capability of U. mancus to retain Escherichia coli as a model bacterial organism. Under experimental conditions, the mussels could clear suspended E. coli, facilitating its rapid elimination from water within the first 24 h after exposure. The species also presented a maximum retention time of 4 days. We also provide allometric equations correlating the filtering capacity with the length and the weight of mussel body parts often used in biometric studies. We provide a first assessment of the potential of the bivalve Unio mancus to act as a sentinel species for the detection of Enterobacterales and demonstrate the ability to act as a water cleaner.

TI  - A long-term reconstructed TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence dataset using machine learning algorithms
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Photosynthesis is a key process linking carbon and water cycles, and satellite-retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can be a valuable proxy for photosynthesis. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission enables significant improvements in providing high spatial and temporal resolution SIF observations, but the short temporal coverage of the data records has limited its applications in long-term studies. This study uses machine learning to reconstruct TROPOMI SIF (RTSIF) over the 2001-2020 period in clear-sky conditions with high spatio-temporal resolutions (0.05 degrees 8-day). Our machine learning model achieves high accuracies on the training and testing datasets (R-2 = 0.907, regression slope = 1.001). The RTSIF dataset is validated against TROPOMI SIF and tower-based SIF, and compared with other satellite-derived SIF (GOME-2 SIF and OCO-2 SIF). Comparing RTSIF with Gross Primary Production (GPP) illustrates the potential of RTSIF for estimating gross carbon fluxes. We anticipate that this new dataset will be valuable in assessing long-term terrestrial photosynthesis and constraining the global carbon budget and associated water fluxes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE ARTS AND DIGITAL MEDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we detail a project that seeks to expand the ways in which the concepts of gesture and spectromorphology can be understood and applied in audiovisual projects. We argue that understanding spectromorphology in visual domains requires consideration of the wavelengths of light that give us an image. In this project, the complex interaction between clouds and solar radiation becomes the medium for understanding this concept of visual spectra. Invalid Data W.E.S.T. is a collaboration between media artist Grayson Cooke, audio engineer Ian Stevenson, and the experimental improvising group Wilcox, Encarnacao, Swanton Trio (W.E.S.T.), comprising three Australian composer-performers: Felicity Wilcox (piano), John Encarnacao (guitar), and Lloyd Swanton (bass). In this project, a multi-camera recording of W.E.S.T. in studio performance is combined with Cooke's exploration of creative uses of satellite data. Satellite images of clouds rendered using infrared light are intercut with in-depth, multi-camera footage of W.E.S.T. captured during improvisation. The resulting audiovisual meditation draws parallels between spontaneous artistic processes, collaborative creation, and environmental phenomena. In this article, we explore how concepts of gesture and spectromorphology shaped the conception, production and post-production phases of the project, and how these concepts can be used to enhance the production of audiovisual work.

TI  - Detection of the third innermost radiation belt on LEO CORONAS-Photon satellite around 2009 solar minimum
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze variations of high energy charged particle populations filling various magnetospheric regions under, inside and outside of the Van Allen inner and outer electron radiation belts in May 2009. The study is based on the experimental data obtained from the STEP-F and the SphinX instruments placed close to each other aboard the low-Earth circular orbit CORONAS-Photon satellite. Data analysis of particle fluencies collected from the highly sensitive STEP-F device indicates the presence of a persistent electron belt at L approximate to 1.6, i.e., beneath the well-known Van Allen electron inner radiation belt of the Earth's magnetosphere. The electron energy spectrum in this "new" belt is much steeper than that of the inner belt, so that the electrons with energies E-e >= 400 keV were almost not recorded on L approximate to 1.6 outside the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). We introduce the concept of effective lowest threshold energies for X-ray detectors used in the solar soft X-ray spectrophotometer SphinX and define their values for two regions: the SAA and in the Van Allen outer belt. Different values of lowest threshold energies are directly associated with different slopes of particle energy spectra. Cross-analyses of data obtained from the STEP-F and SphinX instruments initially built for various purposes made it possible to detect the highly anisotropic character of the spatial electron distribution in radiation belts in both Southern and Northern hemispheres. We detected also the presence of low-energy electrons at all latitudes during the main phase of a weak geomagnetic storm. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article reveals the relationship between individual self-awareness, an aesthetic attitude to reality, and art. The basis of the study of their relationship is the analysis of empirical self-consciousness or everyday consciousness, which differs from the pure self-consciousness presented in the classical philosophical tradition. Consideration of features of worldview construction in everyday life and aesthetic orientation of everyday consciousness allows, on the one hand, the reconsideration of the role of art in the formation of personality, and on the other hand, the revelation of the illusory nature of the classical view of the "I" as a monolithic, substantial unity. Contemporary art in particular stimulates us to play with images of the "I," but at the same time it teaches us to keep distance between game situations and what is constitutive in relation to the "I," allowing us to consolidate an integral image of ourselves in personality. Art goes beyond museums, actively invades the world of everyday life, and elicits the question of how much we have mastered the "art of being ourselves."

TI  - Microinvasive breast cancer and the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be performed in patients with microinvasive breast cancer (MIBC) has been a matter of debate over the last decade. MIBC has a favorable prognosis and while metastasis to the axilla is rare, it can impact treatment recommendations. In this study we evaluated clinical and histological features in both MIBC and background DCIS including ER, PR, and HER-2, number of foci of MIBC, the extent of the DCIS, nuclear grade, presence of comedo necrosis, as well as surgical procedures, adjuvant treatment and follow up to identify variables which predict disease free survival (DFS), as well as the factors which influence clinical decision making. Our study included 72 MIBC patients with a mean patient follow-up time of 55 months. Three patients with MIBC had recurrence, and two deceased, leaving five patients in total with poor long-term outcomes and a DFS rate of 93.1%. Performing mastectomy, high nuclear grade, and negativity for ER and HER-2 were found to be associated with the use of SLNB, although none of these variables were found to be associated with DFS. One positive lymph node case was discovered following SLNB in our study. This suggests the use of SLNB may provide diagnostic information to some patients, although these are the anomalies. When comparing patients who had undergone SLNB to those which had not there was no difference in DFS. Certainly, the use of SLNB in MIBC is quite the conundrum. It is important to acknowledge that surgical complications have been reported, and traditional metrics used for risk assessment in invasive breast cancer may not hold true in the setting of microinvasion.

TI  - Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Navigation Surgery for Stomach Preservation in Patients With Early Gastric Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE To compare postoperative complications, long-term survival, and quality of life (QOL) after laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery (LSNNS) and laparoscopic standard gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS Five hundred eighty patients with preoperatively diagnosed stage IA gastric adenocarcinoma (<= 3 cm) were assigned to undergo either LSG or LSNNS. Observers were not blinded to patient grouping. The primary outcome was 3-year disease-free survival (3y-DFS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, QOL, 3-year disease-specific survival (3y-DSS), and 3-year overall survival (3y-OS). RESULTS In total, 527 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis population for the primary outcome (LSG, 269; LSNNS, 258). Stomach-preserving surgery was performed in 210 patients (81%) in the LSNNS group. During the median follow-up duration, the 3y-DFS rates in the LSG and LSNNS groups were 95.5% and 91.8%, respectively (difference: 3.7%; 95% CI, -0.6 to 8.1). Three patients with recurrence and five with metachronous gastric cancer in the LSNNS group underwent standard surgery. Two patients with distant metastasis in both groups were treated with palliative chemotherapy. The 3y-DSS and 3y-OS rates in the LSG and LSNNS groups were 99.5% and 99.1% (P = .59) and 99.2% and 97.6% (P = .17), respectively. Postoperative complications occurred in 19.0% of the LSG group and 15.5% of the LSNNS group (P = .294). The LSNNS group showed better physical function (P = .015), less symptoms (P < .001), and improved nutrition than the LSG group. CONCLUSION LSNNS did not show noninferiority to LSG for 3y-DFS, with a 5% margin. However, the 3y-DSS and 3y-OS were not different after rescue surgery in cases of recurrence/metachronous gastric cancer, and LSNNS had better long-term QOL and nutrition than LSG.

TI  - Discrimination, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of metric-based assessment of an unstable pertrochanteric 31A2 intramedullary nailing procedure performed by experienced and novice surgeons
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Identifying objective performance metrics for surgical training in orthopedic surgery is im-perative for effective training and patient safety. The objective of this study was to determine if an inter-nationally agreed, metric-based objective assessment of video recordings of an unstable pertrochanteric 31A2 intramedullary nailing procedure distinguished between the performance of experienced and novice orthopedic surgeons.Materials and methods: Previously agreed procedure metrics (i.e., 15 phases of the procedure, 75 steps, errors, and 28 sentinel errors) for a closed reduction and standard cephalomedullary nail fixation with single cephalic element of an unstable pertrochanteric 31A2 fracture. Experienced surgeons trained to as-sess the performance metrics with an interrater reliability (IRR) > 0.8 assessed 14 videos from 10 novice surgeons (orthopaedic residents/trainees) and 20 videos from 14 experienced surgeons (orthopaedic sur-geons) blinded to group and procedure order.Results: The mean IRR of procedure assessments was 0.97. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups for Procedure Steps, Errors, Sentinel Errors, and Total Errors. A small number of Experienced surgeons made a similar number of Total Errors as the weakest performing Novices. When the scores of each group were divided at the median Total Error score, large differences were observed between the Experienced surgeons who made the fewest errors and the Novices making the most errors (p < 0.001). Experienced surgeons who made the most errors made significantly more than their Experienced peers (p < 0.003) and the best performing Novices (p < 0.001). Error metrics assessed with Area Under the Curve demonstrated good to excellent Sensitivity and Specificity (0.807- 0.907).Discussion: Binary performance metrics previously agreed by an international Delphi meeting discrimi-nated between the objectively assessed video-recorded performance of Experienced and Novice orthope-dic surgeons when group scores were sub-divided at the median for Total Errors. Error metrics discrim-inated best and also demonstrated good to excellent Sensitivity and Specificity. Some very experienced surgeons performed similar to the Novice group surgeons that made most errors.Conclusions: The procedure metrics used in this study reliably distinguish Novice and Experienced or-thopaedic surgeons' performance and will underpin quality-assured novice training.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Can we supplement in situ data with satellite data?
T2  - LHB-HYDROSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources management requires the use of hydrometric data mainly from in situ stations. Despite the efforts made to set up and maintain a network of stations (hydrometric or meteorological), water resource managers face various issues (degradation of equipment during floods, vandalism, inaccessibility, lack of financial means for maintenance, etc.). Satellite data can enrich water resources monitoring, whatever the objectives of this monitoring (strategic management of water resources, management of structures, flood and low-water forecasting, etc.). These data have the advantage of covering the whole world, including territories that are difficult to access, in regular time steps. Through several projects, different scientific and industrial partners (IRD, CNES, CLS, CNRS, CENEAU horizontal ellipsis ) have contributed to assess and enhance the use of satellite data for water resources management at the scale of a catchment (e.g. the Amazon) or a territory (Uganda). The objective is to deliver hydrological indicators from the combination of hydrological models, in-situ data and satellite data. This article presents the current possibilities and limitations of using satellite data to optimise the monitoring of water resources.

TI  - A high-resolution fuel type mapping procedure based on satellite imagery and neural networks: Updating fuel maps for wildfire simulators
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A major limitation in the simulation of forest fires involves the proper characterization of the surface vegetation over the study area, based on land cover maps. Unfortunately, these maps may be outdated, with areas where vegetation is either not documented or inaccurately portrayed. These limitations may impair the predictions of wildfire simulators or the design of risk maps and prevention plans. This study proposes a complete procedure for fuel type classification using satellite imagery and fully-connected neural networks. Specifically, our work is based on pixel-based processing cells, generating high-resolution maps. The field study is located in the Northeast of Castilla y Leon, a central Spanish region, and the Rothermel criteria was followed for the fuel classification. The results record an accuracy of close to 78% on the test sets for the two studied settings, improving on the results reported in previous studies and ratifying the robustness of our approach. Additionally, the confusion matrix analysis and the per-class statistics computed confirm good reliability for all fuel types in a cross-validation framework. The predicted maps can be used on wildfire simulators through GIS tools.

TI  - Validation of ocean color remote sensing reflectance data: Analysis of results at European coastal sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - From its initial measurements 20 years ago, the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) has produced large validation data sets to assess the ocean color satellite data records. This study, applied to the standard atmospheric correction algorithm l2gen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, analyses the populations of residuals (differences between matching satellite and field data) of remote sensing reflectance R-RS and, secondarily, aerosol optical thickness za, and their validation statistics associated with data collected at seven AERONET-OC sites located in European coastal regions for six satellite missions. Validation statistics do not appear particularly sensitive to observation conditions, represented by viewing and solar geometry, aerosol optical thickness tau(a), angstrom ngstrom exponent or water properties indexed by R-RS, the most obvious exceptions being a systematic increase of the residuals for high solar zenith angles for all missions and sites. Residuals of R-RS and tau(a) tend to be inversely correlated as deviations in aerosol radiance and water-leaving radiance compensate each other. The spectra of a R-RS uncertainty estimate sigma decrease in a monotonous manner from 0.7 to 1.5 10(-3) sr(-1) for wavelengths around 412 nm to 0.1-0.35 10(-3) sr(-1) around 667 nm, with sigma usually relatively high for waters associated with high amplitudes of R-RS. At 412 nm, sigma for tau(a) is mostly in the interval 0.03-0.04. For R-RS, variations across missions of a or of the relative differences between satellite and field data are overall smaller than variations across sites, which suggests that the products derived from various missions are rather consistent at a given location when processed with the considered algorithm. For a given mission, R-RS residuals are well correlated between bands (inter-band correlation coefficient mostly larger than 0.5), which has implications on the propagation of uncertainties through bio-optical algorithms. For a given wavelength, residuals are correlated between missions to various degrees (most often with inter-mission correlation coefficients larger than 0.5). Besides implications as far as uncertainties of multi-mission merged products are concerned, this inter-mission correlation among residuals suggest that the residuals are not random and could be reduced.

TI  - An advanced soil organic carbon content prediction model via fused temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) information based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the soil organic carbon (SOC) content is critical for environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality. With the development of remote sensing data and prediction models, the comprehensive utilization of multisource remote sensing data based on a fusion approach and testing its effectiveness in SOC content prediction is an interesting and challenging topic. However, there is no evidence showing the role of different data sources in the SOC content prediction process. In this study, a total of 796 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) were collected at Site 1, and 111 samples were collected at Site 2. The samples from Site 2 were used to verify the transferability of the prediction model established at Site 1. The discrete wavelet transform based on the regional energy weight (RW-DWT) and spectral band segmentation methods were used to fuse the temporal information of 10 scenes of Landsat multispectral image data from 2009 to 2019, the spatial information of topography data and the spectral information of GaoFen-5 hyperspectral images. Then, the SOC content prediction models were established by temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) information using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. The results indicated that the optimal SOC content prediction model consisted of TSS information as input and the CNN as the prediction model, where the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.49 g kg(-1), the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.86 and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) was 1.91. Next, the order of the effect was spectral > temporal > spatial information in terms of SOC content prediction, and their roles in improving the accuracy of the model were 26.79%, 19.64% and 14.29%, respectively, with the CNN model. In addition, the CNN yielded a higher prediction accuracy than PLSR and RF regardless of which group of input variables was used. The average RMSE of the CNN was 0.42 g kg (-1) lower than that of the RF, and the average R-2 and RPIQ were 9.25% and 0.14 higher, respectively, than those of the RF. The above conclusions were confirmed in the verification area, namely, the optimal SOC content prediction model at Site 2 consisted of TSS information as input and the CNN as the prediction model (RMSE = 1.01 g kg (-1), R-2 = 0.76 and RPIQ = 1.41). Therefore, the novel method proposed in this study is robust. This work provides a new idea for predicting soil properties by the comprehensive use of multisource remote sensing images and deep learning algorithms in the future.

TI  - Mangroves Cover Change Trajectories 1984-2020: The Gradual Decrease of Mangroves in Colombia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Awareness of the significant benefits of mangroves to human lives and their role in regulating environmental processes has increased during the recent decades. Yet there remains significant uncertainty about the mangrove change trajectories and the drivers of change at national scales. In Colombia, the absence of historical satellite imagery and persistent cloud cover have impeded the accurate mapping of mangrove extent and change over time. We create a temporally consistent Landsat-derived dataset using the LandTrendr algorithm to track the historical land cover and mangrove conversion from 1984-2020 across Colombia. Over this period, mangrove extent decreased by similar to 48.000ha (14% of total mangrove area). We find a gradual reduction of mangrove extent along the Pacific coast since 2004, whereas, in the Caribbean, mangrove cover declined around during 1984-1988 and also after 2012. Our time-series analysis matches with drivers of mangrove change at three local sites. For instance, hydroclimatic events, dredging activities, and high sediment loads transported by the rivers have collectively improved mangrove recovery in some sites. In contrast, human activities pressure linked to agricultural expansion and road construction have degraded mangroves. The transition from dense mangrove to other vegetation types is the most significant conversion affecting mangrove cover in Colombia, impacting an area of 38,469 +/- 2,829 ha. We anticipate increased mangrove loss, especially along the Pacific coast, resulting from intensified human activity. Prioritization of conservation areas is needed to support local institutions, maintain currently protected areas, and develop strategies (e.g. payment for ecosystem services) to preserve one of the most pristine mangrove regions in the Western Hemisphere.
