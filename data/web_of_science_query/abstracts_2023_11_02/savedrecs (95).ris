TI  - SupReME: Super-Resolution of Multispectral Multiresolution Images from a Single Sensor
T2  - Code Ocean
M3  - Software
AB  - Some remote sensing sensors, acquire multispectral images of different spatial resolutions in variable spectral ranges (e.g. Sentinel-2, MODIS). The aim of this research is to infer all the spectral bands, of multiresolution sensors, in the highest available resolution of the sensor. We formulate this problem as a minimisation of a convex objective function with an adaptive (edge-reserving) regulariser. The data-fitting term accounts for individual blur and downsampling per band, while the regulariser "learns" the discontinuities from the higher resolution bands and transfers them to other bands. We also observed that the data can be represented in a lower-dimensional subspace, reducing the dimensionality of the problem and significantly improving its conditioning. In a series of experiments with simulated data, we obtain results that outperform state-of-the-art, while showing competitive qualitative results on real Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Calibration of urban canopies albedo and 3D shortwave radiative budget using remote-sensing data and the DART model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The derivation of the radiative budget of urban environments has gained a high interest in the recent years as an essential part of the global energy budget of big cities. Urban 3D (three-dimensional) heterogeneity hampers its assessment with in-sftu measurements, which stresses the interest of Earth Observation (EO) satellites. Improvements in remote-sensing technology and 3D urban databases open the way to new deterministic approaches. This paper presents a new method that derives maps of urban shortwave exitance, albedo and radiative budget Q(sw)* from EO satellite images (e.g. Sentinel 2, Landsat-8), using the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model. In a preliminary step, it derives maps of urban material optical properties from an EO satellite image, at the spatial resolution of this EO image. The method is applied to the city of Basel, Switzerland, in the frame of the European Community H2020 URBANFLUXES (www.urbanfluxes.eu) project which aims at improving our knowledge on anthropogenic heat fluxes in European cities. Results are very encouraging. Indeed, urban Q(sw)* derived from 234 EO satellite images, ranging from 200 to 800 W/m(2) through the year, is very close to in-situ measured Q(Sw)*:approximate to 15W/m(2) temporal root mean square error (i.e. 2.7% mean relative difference) relative to measurements.

TI  - Identifying Worldviews on Corporate Sustainability: A Content Analysis of Corporate Sustainability Reports
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Companies commonly issue sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. This study seeks to understand worldviews of corporate sustainability, or the corporate message conveyed regarding what sustainability or CSR is and how to enact it. Content analysis of corporate sustainability reports is used to position each company report within stages of corporate sustainability. Results reveal that there are multiple coexisting worldviews of corporate sustainability, but the most dominant worldview is focused on the business case for sustainability, a position anchored in the weak sustainability paradigm. We contend that the business case and weak sustainability advanced in corporate sustainability reports and by the Global Reporting Initiative are poor representations of sustainability. Ecological embeddedness, or a locally responsive strategy that is sensitive to local ecosystems, may hold the key to improved ecological sensemaking, which in turn could lead to more mature levels of corporate sustainability worldviews that support strong sustainability and are rooted in environmental science. This must be supported by government regulation. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

TI  - Canopy Cover Estimation from Landsat Images: Understory Impact onTop-of-canopy Reflectance in a Northern Hardwood Forest
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern hardwood forests, light availability is considered to be the main factor limiting seedling and sapling growth. However, field measurement of this variable is time-consuming. To address this issue, we developed random forest regression models to estimate canopy cover from a Landsat 8 OLI image of a northern hardwood forest in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. We then assessed the accuracy of model predictions with a canopy height model (CHM) derived from LiDAR data. We selected 2 threshold heights (1.3 and 5 m) to distinguish the understory from the overstory and to determine the impact of the understory on top-of-canopy reflectance. Our results show that the understory influenced top-of-canopy reflectance and that a 1.3 m height threshold provided the most accurate estimation of canopy cover. In contrast with studies conducted in softwood stands, we found no evidence that the shortwave infrared (SWIR1) band decreased the influence of the understory on top-of-canopy reflectance. In northern hardwood forests, the estimation of canopy characteristics, such as canopy cover and leaf area index, should be focused on the green band, as it was least influenced by understory vegetation.

AB  - Geostationary satellites like MSG allows to detect and monitor thermal anomalies (wild fires, volcanic eruption) with - refresh frequency ranging from 5 to 15 min. Such a frequency meets the requirements of the institutions involved in contrasting the fire events and could provide information on the temporal behavior of the fire (through Fire Radiative Power, FRP) and the spatial distribution of the events with the related hazard for the population and infrastructure when more occurrences are simultaneously present. -limitation to the operational applicability of this tool is represented by the present low spatial resolution of the MSG/SEVIRI sensor ranging from 3 km at the equator to 4.5 km at Mediterranean latitudes. Whereas the limitations related to the sensitivity of the geostationary sensor to fire sizes has been, at least in part, overcome by introducing specific algorithms, the reduced accuracy in the geographic localization of the fire, which can, in principle, occupy any position in an are-of about 16 km(2) (at Mediterranean latitude) makes this information not very much interesting for the institutions involved in fire fighting. This paper is focused on the analysis of the feasibility of improving the localization of the thermal anomalies (hot spots) based on geostationary sensors by combining images acquired simultaneously from different MSG satellites located at different longitudes. In particular, we combine the images acquired by MSG-9 (RSS) located at long. 9.0 degrees and MSG-8 (IODC) located at long. 40.5 degrees. The results seem to confirm the possibility to improve the accuracy of the detection by exploiting the observation of the events from different position in the space.

TI  - Urban green valuation integrating biophysical and qualitative aspects
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green mapping has become an operational task in city planning, urban land management, and quality of life assessments. As a multi-dimensional, integrative concept, urban green comprising several ecological, socio-economic, and policy-related aspects. In this paper, the author advances the representation of urban green by deriving scale-adapted, policy-relevant units. These so-called geons represent areas of uniform green valuation under certain size and homogeneity constraints in a spatially explicit representation. The study accompanies a regular monitoring scheme carried out by the urban municipality of the city of Salzburg, Austria, using optical satellite data. It was conducted in two stages, namely SBG_QB (10.2 km(2), QuickBird data from 2005) and SBG_WV (140 km(2), WorldView-2 data from 2010), within the functional urban area of Salzburg. The geon delineation was validated by several quantitative measures and spatial analysis techniques, as well as ground documentation, including panorama photographs and visual interpretation. The spatial association pattern was assessed by calculating Global Moran's I with incremental search distances. The final geonscape, consisting of 1083 units with an average size of 13.5 ha, was analyzed by spatial metrics. Finally, categories were derived for different types of functional geons. Future research paths and improvements to the described strategy are outlined.

TI  - IDIOMATICITY AND FORMULAICITY IN WRITTEN DISCOURSE IN PORTUGUESE PRODUCED BY MOZAMBIQUE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
T2  - LINHA D AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - The observation of texts written in Portuguese by Mozambican university students reveals writing difficulties that goes beyond the realm of knowledge of grammatical rules. The mother tongues of most of these students are of Bantu origin and used mainly in restricted or familiar contexts. Unlike Bantu languages, Portuguese, the second language to most of these students, enjoys the status of official language, of teaching, of public administration, of contact with the world, being the language, which confers social prestige in Mozambique. This framework fosters linguistic, discursive, rhetorical, cultural and idiomatic transfers that manifest themselves in a variety of forms of expression peculiar to the languages and cultures in contact, in oral or written communication, and for the present study, emphatically in writing. In this article, we explore the extent to which these students develop fluency and proficiency in the target language through the way they organize linguistic and discursive units to express their world view in the interlingual and intercultural context in which they live. Thus, we selected pieces of discourse from 4 compositions written by them and focus the analysis on how they accommodate aspects of idiomaticity and formulaicity in texts of the opinion genre and within argumentative typology.

AB  - Wildfires are the dominant disturbance impacting many regions in Alaska and are expected to intensify due to climate change. Accurate tracking and quantification of wildfires are important for climate modeling and ecological studies in this region. Remote sensing platforms (e.g., MODIS, Landsat) are valuable tools for mapping wildfire events (burned or burning areas) in Alaska. Deep neural networks (DNN) have exhibited superior performance in many classification problems, such as high-dimensional remote sensing data. Detection of wildfires is an imbalanced classification problem where one class contains a much smaller or larger sample size, and performance of DNNs can decline. We take a known weight-selection strategy during DNN training and apply those weights to MODIS variables (e.g., NDVI, surface reflectance) for binary classification (i.e., wildfire or no-wildfire) across Alaska during the 2004 wildfire year, when Alaska experienced a record number of large wildfires. The method splits the input training data into subsets, one for training the DNN to update weights and the other for performance validation to select the weights based on the best validation-loss score. This approach was applied to two sampled datasets, such as where the no-wildfire class can significantly outweigh the wildfire class. The normal DNN training strategy was unable to map wildfires for the highly imbalanced dataset; however, the weight-selection strategy was able to map wildfires very accurately (0.96 recall score for 78,702 wildfire pixels (500x500 m)).

TI  - Fostering connectedness to nature in higher education
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental thinkers and educators have argued for the importance of celebrating our connectedness to nature, or the perception of being part of, rather than separate from, the natural world. Using pre-and post-test measurements of Nature Relatedness and supplemental interviews, this study addresses the question of whether a particular introductory collegelevel ecology course can increase learners' connectedness to nature, both independently and in comparison to a similar course. The results show that the course significantly increased participants' connectedness, particularly their identification with nature and nature-focused worldview. Other environmental courses studied demonstrated no such changes, suggesting that environmental education does not automatically lead to connectedness. However, if woven into the goals and approach of teaching, connectedness to nature can indeed be fostered in higher education. This is a promising result for educators and others working towards a sustainable future.

AB  - This research aims to estimate above-ground carbon sequestration of orchards by using the data collected from Landsat 8 OLI. Regression equations are applied to study the relationship between the amount of above-ground carbon sequestration and vegetation indices from Landsat 8 OLI, in which the data was collected in 2015 in 3 methods: 1) Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), 2) Green Vegetation Index (GVI), and 3) Simple Ratio (SR). The results are as follows: 1) By DVI method, it results in the equation y = 0.3184e(0.0482x) and the coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.8457. The amount of the above-ground sequestration calculation's result is 213.176 tons per rai. 2) Using the GVI method, it results in the equation y = 0.2619e(0.0489x) and the coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.8763. The amount of the above-ground sequestration calculation's result is 220.510 tons per rai. 3) Using the SR method, it results in the equation y = 0.8900e(0.0469x) and the coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.7748. The amount of the above-ground sequestration calculation's result is 234.229 tons per rai.

T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The author analyses the Hebrew translation of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment by Jewish writer Y. H. Brenner published in the early 20th century, the time when Modern Hebrew was forming. The article considers the linguistic peculiarities of the Hebrew text compared to the original. The author reveals considerable differences in the linguistic and stylistic methods. In his translation, Brenner uses excerpts from Jewish prayers as parallels to the original Orthodox prayers, phrases from traditional Jewish books, and elements of the Jewish way of life. For example, to translate Raskolnikov's adamant decision to carry out his plan and kill the pawnbroker, Brenner uses a Talmudic expression with easily recognisable Jewish religious associations. By doing so, Brenner makes his translation sound more elevated than the original. Despite the stylistic and semantic deviations from the original, Brenner's translation is very accurate in rendering the spirit of Dostoyevsky's book: this is not a coincidence, since Brenner's worldview was close to that of the Russian writer. The introduction of idioms and associations characteristic of the Hebrew world and borrowings from the Jewish Bible and Talmud adds Jewish colour to the dialogues and musings of the characters, which changes the style of the novel considerably and introduces a noticeable shift in its spiritual tonality. Despite all the differences between the translation and the original, the Hebrew text does transmit the special ambience of Dostoyevsky's novel.

TI  - Regional patterns of ecosystem functional diversity in the Argentina Pampas using MODIS time-series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of ecosystem functioning is significant for different purposes such as biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. A key aspect of ecosystem functioning is carbon gains, since it represents the energy available for upper trophic levels. In this sense, remote-sensing methods have allowed the study of ecosystem dynamics and spatial distribution at different spatial and temporal scales. The objectives were to describe the regional patterns of ecosystem functional diversity and to establish the importance of interannual variability in the definition of Ecosystem Functional Types (EFTs) in the Argentina Pampas. EFTs were obtained from carbon gains using a set of seven functional attributes and their interannual variations, which were retrieved from 14-year NDVI time-series. An ISODATA technique was applied to all the analyzed variables, and the clusters that best separate in the n-dimensional space were selected using discriminant analysis. The Argentina Pampas shows a high heterogeneity in the spatial patterns of ecosystem functional attributes. The annual integral of NDVI (i-NDVI, a linear estimator of net primary productivity), a complex of ecosystem functional attributes that describe the interannual variability, and the annual relative range of NDVI (RREL, ecosystem seasonality) had the highest relevance to distinguish nine EFTs in the study area. This study shows a novel approach for mapping ecosystem functioning, which reveals the importance of interannual variations. This methodology includes the effects of climate variability on ecosystem dynamics, thus enhancing our understanding of ecosystem functional diversity. The results obtained represent a baseline scenario to evaluate the effects of both land use change and climate variability on ecosystem functioning from a temporal perspective.

T2  - GEOGRAFIA FISICA E DINAMICA QUATERNARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A geomorphologic and morphometric analysis was performed in order to determine the characteristics of the de La Cienaga river basin, an arid mountain river basin located in the southwest of San Juan Province (31 degrees 45'S, 68 degrees 50'W), Central Pre-Andes, Argentina. The drainage networks were derived from shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) data, satellite imageries (Landsat TM and Spot image) and field works. The paper also addresses a preliminary evaluation of the flood hazard responsible for severe damage to farming and infrastructure in the downstream region. The study basin area covers almost 700 km(2), comprising five sub-basins, ranging from 111.96 to 159.30 km(2). The asymmetrical morphology of the basin, neotectonic features and the diversity of alluvial deposits found along the de La Cienaga river basin show that it is in an active tectonic environment with strong lithological and structural controls and a marked tilting. One common feature to all analyzed sub-basins is their elongated shape, which allows a rapid concentration of water that intensifies the power of the flash floods. The drainage network in the different sub-basins has, in general, two predominant patterns; one is parallel to sub-parallel to the headers and foothill areas; and the other, in the piedmont zone, is divergent. Zonda valley, located downstream of the basin, is affected by flash floods coming from the mountainous area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghana introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) into its national paediatric vaccination programme in May2012. Vaccine introduction was initiated nationwide and achieved >85% coverage within a few months. Rotavirus strain distribution pre- and post-RV vaccine introduction is reported.METHODS: Stool samples were collected from diarrhoeic children <5 years of age hospitalized between 2009 and 2016 at sentinel sites across Ghana and analyzed for the presence of group A rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay. Rotavirus strains were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing.RESULTS: A total of 1363 rotavirus EIA-positive samples were subjected to molecular characterization. These were made up of 823 (60.4%) and 540 (39.6%) samples from the pre- and post-vaccine periods respectively. Rotavirus VP7 genotypes G1, G2 and G3, and VP4 genotypes P[6] and P[8] constituted more than 65% of circulating G and P types in the pre-vaccine period. The common strains detected were G1P[8] (20%), G3P[6] (9.2%) and G2P[6] (4.9%). During the post-vaccine period, G12, G1 and G10 genotypes, constituted more than 65% of the VP7 genotypes whilst P[6] and P[8] made up more than 75% of the VP4 genotypes. The predominant circulating strains were G12P[8] (26%), G10P[6] (10%) G3P[6] (8.1%) and G1P[8] (8.0%). We also observed the emergence of the unusual rotavirus strain G9P[4] during this period.CONCLUSION: Rotavirus G1P[8], the major strain in circulation during the pre-vaccination era, was replaced by G12P[8] as the most predominant strain after vaccine introduction. This strain replacement could be temporary and unrelated to vaccine introduction since an increase in G12 was observed in countries yet to introduce the rotavirus vaccine in West Africa. A continuous surveillance programme in the post-vaccine era is necessary for the monitoring of circulating rotavirus strains and the detection of unusual/emerging genotypes.

TI  - Effectiveness and impact of a single-dose vaccine against chickenpox in the community of Madrid between 2001 and 2015
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chickenpox is a contagious airborne disease. Immunization by varicella vaccine is an effective preventive measure. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of a single-dose vaccination against chickenpox at 15 months of age.Methods: Observational study based on data from the Epidemiological Surveillance System of the Autonomous Community of Madrid from 2001 to 2015. The years were grouped into 4 periods according to epidemic cycles and vaccination schedule: 2001-06, 2007-10, 2011-13 and 2014-15. The impact was calculated as Relative Risk (RR) between the incidence of chickenpox in children between 15 months and 13 years of age between 2011-13 and 2001-06 through Poisson regression using notifications made to the Diseases of Compulsory Declaration (DCD) system, the Sentinel Physicians Network (SPN) and hospital discharge records noted as Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS). The vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated using the screening method and a 1:2 case-control study paired by age and paediatrician in population from 15 months to 13 years and between 2007 and 2015 using SPN source data.Results: The RR2011-13/2001-06 using data from the DCD was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.15), 0.07 (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.08) from SPN and 0.17 (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.20) from MBDS. A total of 338 cases were included in the VE screening obtaining an overall of 76.7% (IC 95%: 71.9 to 80.7%). For a case-control study, 120 cases and 247 controls were recruited obtaining a VE of 92.4% (IC 95%: 80.8 to 97.0%).Conclusions: The single-dose vaccination against chickenpox at 15 months of age has high impact and effectiveness.

TI  - Synthetic RapidEye data used for the detection of area-based spruce tree mortality induced by bark beetles
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree mortality caused by outbreaks of the bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) plays an important role in the natural dynamics of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands, which could cause far-reaching changes in the occurrence and duration of vegetation phenology. Field-based early detection of tree disturbances is hampered by logistic, terrain, and technical shortcomings, and by the inability to continuously monitor disturbances over large areas. Despite achievements in remote mapping of bark-beetle-induced tree mortalities, early warning has been mostly unsuccessful mainly because of the lack of spectral sensitivity and discrepancies in definitions of field- and image-based disturbance classes. Here we applied a method based on inter-annual phenology of Norway spruce stands derived from synthetic multispectral data to part of the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany. We fused temporally continuous Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and discrete RapidEye data using a flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method to achieve validated 8-day RapidEye-like composites of normalized difference vegetation index for 2011. We assumed that the dead trees delineated on 2012 aerial photographs were those in which bark beetle infestations were initiated in 2011. Samples were drawn with variable-sized buffering to represent the areas prone to infestations and their surroundings. We applied a conditional inference random forest to select the best image date among the entire 46 synthetic datasets to best discriminate between the core infestation patches and their surroundings from the subsequent year. Of the discrete time points identified, day 281 of the year represented the highest discrepancy between aerial image-based dead trees and their surroundings. Classification results were significantly correlated with beetle count data obtained using pheromone traps. Our method provided valuable information for management purposes and enabled wall-to-wall mapping of stands prone to infestation and its uncertainty. The results offer potential implications for rapid and cost-effective monitoring of bark beetle outbreaks using satellite data, which would be of great benefit for both management and research tasks.

AB  - Ground reflectance was acquired at the Railroad Valley Playa calibration site in Nevada USA using different methods of collection. The data was collected near the time and date of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 satellite overpasses so an inter-comparison could be made with the reflectance products to determine which method was more suitable for vicarious calibration. The field spectrometers and reference panels were characterized before the field campaign. A continuous acquisition method was compared to stop and measure collections. Both acquisition methods were collected along an 80 m east-west transect as well as for a series of north-south transects over an 80 x 320 m area, with the stop and measure method being performed at random sampling locations. The measurements were performed using two field spectrometers by three teams of two people to compare the repeatability. The aim of the field campaign was to determine the variability due to the operator and the method of collection.

AB  - Mapping footprints of mineral deposits is often hindered by substantial weathering profiles developed atop buried mineralization. Understanding the mineralogical and geochemical trends in the weathering profile can be crucial for enabling successful exploration, especially when using remote sensing data.Drill core hyperspectral and geochemical data were analyzed in detail to develop a 3D mineralogical/geochemical model that allowed an evaluation of which footprints, associated with gold mineralization in the Bulong area of the Eastern Goldfields (Western Australia), could be discovered at the surface. The combined analysis of hyperspectral and geochemical drill core data also helped to map out clusters of mineral assemblages that are 1) associated with gold, 2) are inversely correlated with gold and/or 3) form a halo in proximity to gold mineralization. White mica was found to be of phengitic composition proximal to gold mineralization, whereas talc-carbonate alteration forms a shell around the mineralized intervals. Phengitic white micas were successfully traced at the surface, indicating potentially new prospective areas. However, due to issues with vegetation and related overlapping absorptions with talc and carbonate, talc-carbonate alteration could not be found in the airborne hyperspectral data.The Bulong case study highlights the need for advancing vegetation un-mixing of remotely sensed hyper- and multispectral imagery. Recent efforts of un-mixing green and dry vegetation on a per pixel basis considerably improved the mapping of single mineralogical components of alteration and background mineral assemblages.

AB  - Forest degradation affects biodiversity and human society and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. However, since there is no consensus about the definition of forest degradation, it is difficult to operate its characterization, evaluation and monitoring. Unlike deforestation, forest degradation does not imply a change in land cover and it happens in fine scales and is difficult to detect by means of remote sensors. Images from MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2, and UAVs form the main source of data for the national forest cover monitoring. The assumption here is that satellite images of different spatial and temporal resolutions as input may affect the measurement of forest degradation. The main objective is to study the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing images on forest degradation patterns detected. Data of multi-temporal MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 for an area of Michoacan, Mexico were collected. Forests were classified into primary and secondary status based on the existing land cover maps and visual interpretation of the images. The obtained land cover maps with forests at different stage of degradation were compared to derive information of forest degradation and regeneration.

AB  - To provide reliable crop maps for the same territory each year, it is necessary to collect in-situ data for each year independently. Collecting ground truth data is a very time consuming and challenging task. At present, unfortunately, there is no an adopted approach, how to utilize in-situ and satellite data from previous years for crop mapping in the subsequent years. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning approach using sparse autoencoder based on only satellite data, and a further procedure of neural network fine-tuning based on in-situ data. The possibility of utilizing this deep learning architecture based on translating all available satellite data into the unified hyperspace. The study is carried out for the central part of Ukraine. Obtained results show that this technique is feasible and provides reliable crop classification maps with overall accuracy (OA) of 91.0% and 85.9% for two different experiments. The use of the proposed approach makes it possible to avoid, or decrease, the necessity for collecting in-situ data for each year and for each part of large territory.

AB  - Crop classification maps based on high resolution remote sensing data are essential for supporting sustainable land management. The most challenging problems for their producing are collecting of ground based training and validation datasets, non-regular satellite data acquisition and cloudiness. To increase the efficiency of ground data utilization it is important to develop classifiers able to be trained on the data collected in the previous year. In this study, we propose new deep learning method for providing crop classification maps using in-situ data that has been collected in the previous year. Main idea of the study is to utilize deep learning approach based on sparse autoencoder. At the first stage it is trained on satellite data only and then neural network fine-tuning is conducted based on in-situ data form the previous year. Taking into account that collecting ground truth data is very time consuming and challenging task, the proposed approach allows us to avoid necessity for annual collecting in-situ data for the same territory. Experimental results for the territory of Ukraine show that this technique is rather efficient and provides reliable crop classification maps with overall accuracy higher than 85.9%.

Due to the high spatial resolution of these satellite data, submesoscale IWs having wavelengths less than 50 m and generated by unstable sharp front of a river plume, were revealed and their parameters were assessed. The plumes of the following rivers were studied: the Rhone, flowing into the Gulf of Lyon of the Mediterranean Sea, the Danube, flowing into the northwestern part of the Black Sea and the Coruh flowing into the southeastern part of the Black Sea. We discuss spatio-temporal variability of the manifestations of internal waves of a given type mechanisms of their generation.

AB  - Vortex structures of different types are common in the Southeastern Baltic Sea. Intensive western winds, a complex coastline and an absence of steady currents make this region very appealing for studying the nature of vortex processes. These processes are clearly identified from Space. We present results of a multi-year satellite monitoring of mesoscale and submesoscale vortex structures in the Southeastern part of the Baltic Sea and of supporting field studies. An important part of our work was accumulation of remote sensing data as the first step in evaluation of circulation patterns and vortex structures presented on the sea surface. An analyzed remote sensing data include color composite images from MSI Sentinel-2, OLI Landsat-8 and ETM+ Landsat-7 as well as radar images from Sentinel-1 and Radardsat-2 that also provide a powerful tool for an identification of circulation processes on the sea surface. Continuous monitoring of the Southeastern Baltic Sea with an analysis of satellite visual and radar images show that the Gulf of Gdansk is the most frequent area with mesoscale and submesoscale eddies. They appear in this area mostly in summer and mainly under the atmospheric influence. Some eddies remain stable for at least of 8 days and could be easily tracked on color composite images. The other area of the vortex structure was determined to the north of the Cape Taran. In summer months from 2014 to 2018, we performed oceanographic concurrent experiments in the southeastern part of the Baltic Sea. Field studies of spatial and temporal characteristics of vortex structures proved results found by an analysis of satellite images.

AB  - Our automatized interferometric monitoring system, IT4S1, contains a database of Sentinel-1 satellite image bursts that have been preprocessed to the state of a consistent well-coregistered dataset. The coregistration solution introduces a new type of data, an SLC-C (corrected single look complex data). These are SLC images ready for interferometric analyses with maximally reduced phase signature of topography and flat-Earth phase. The further processing time for multitemporal interferometry techniques is significantly reduced for achieving velocity maps based on e.g. Persistent Scatterers or Small Baseline techniques. In this paper, authors focus on quality of estimated topographic phase, finding out that computation of perpendicular baseline between satellite positions based on precise orbit ephemerides can differ and thus the approach may suffer from a residual topographic signature or a flat-Earth phase. The paper presents conclusions taken by an investigation of one such pre-prepared dataset over a mountainous area in southern Spain. Though some orbital inparallelity occurs during Sentinel-1 acquisitions (causing inaccuracies of perpendicular baselines within first meters), the flat-Earth is removed properly using this approach. The paper further demonstrates results using SLC-C approach using available and custom processing techniques and notifies about the possibility that in terms of overall accuracy and precision of multitemporal interferometry this approach contains inaccuracies that can be either estimated as part of error phase screens or even neglected.

AB  - The topic of this work covers current implementation of satellite radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) techniques for routine identification of dynamic land processes such as downhill creep and landslide activity, subsidence or displacements of various objects of infrastructure. With the emerge of European Copernicus programme, the need of effectivity in satellite Big Data processing increased. There are two Sentinel-1 satellites observing the Earth with 6 days revisit time, sending daily 100 TB of data to be archived. In case of the relatively small area of Czechia, the amount of data to be archived in a Czech national mirror is around 24 GB per day. Czech CESNET e-infrastructure has accepted the role of assessing Copernicus Ground Segment programme. A database mirroring Sentinel data over Czechia is established, however still in its early stage. A potential service based on an interferometric processing of Sentinel-1 data from this database has been prepared in Czech national supercomputing center IT4Innovations. As a basis of the system, several open-source projects were deployed, including MySQL-based burst metadatabase (TU Leeds), ISCE TOPS Processor (NASA/JPL), Doris coregistration algorithm (TU Delft) and StaMPS Small Baselines processor (Stanford University). Though more functionality can be rapidly developed, incorporating some of the own post-processing algorithms, even current early version of the system can yield interesting results by a fully automatic processing chain.

TI  - Octonion Sparse Representation for Color and Multispectral Image Processing
T2  - 2018 26TH EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE (EUSIPCO)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 26th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
CL  - Rome, ITALY
AB  - A recent trend in color image processing combines the quaternion algebra with dictionary learning methods. This paper aims to present a generalization of the quaternion dictionary learning method by using the octonion algebra. The octonion algebra combined with dictionary learning methods is well suited for representation of multispectral images with up to 7 color channels. Opposed to the classical dictionary learning techniques that treat multispectral images by concatenating spectral bands into a large monochrome image, we treat all the spectral bands simultaneously. Our approach leads to better preservation of color fidelity in true and false color images of the reconstructed multispectral image. To show the potential of the octonion based model, experiments are conducted for image reconstruction and denoising of color images as well as of extensively used Landsat 7 images.

TI  - Mapping ecosystem services at the regional scale: the validity of an upscaling approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping ecosystem services (ES) over large scales is important for environmental monitoring but is often prohibitively expensive and difficult. We test a hybrid, low-cost method of mapping ES indicators over large scales in Para State, Brazil. Four ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, biodiversity index, soil chemical quality index and rates of water infiltration into soil) were measured in the field and then summarized spatially for regional land-cover classes derived from satellite imagery. The regionally mapped ES values correlated strongly with independent and local measures of ES. For example, regional estimates of the vegetation carbon stocks are strongly correlated with actual measures derived from field samples and validation data (significant anova test - p-value=4.51(e-9)) and differed on average by only 20Mg/ha from the field data. Our spatially-nested approach provides reliable and accurate maps of ES at both local and regional scales. Local maps account for the specificities of an area while regional maps provide an accurate generalization of an ES' state. Such up-scaling methods infuse large-scale ES maps with localized data and enable the estimation of uncertainty of at regional scales. Our approach is first step towards the spatial characterization of ES at large and potentially global scales.

AB  - This paper deals with classification of remote sensing data to extract objects for industrial mapping. While land-cover or urban mapping have been extensively studied, industrial cartography remains a field yet to explore, in spite of tremendous needs. We present and compare here four approaches for railway detection in very high resolution images. They use various kind of filtering approaches, including the trained filters of fully convolutional networks. Moreover, they benefit from different a-priori and post-processing techniques to make them more robust. We evaluate all approaches on a challenging dataset captured on an operating station site with complex objects.

AB  - On the days that surface is covered by thick clouds, the acquired images from optical satellites usually suffer missing information, caused to not able to use because we can't see anything under cloudy cover. Many methods have been proposed in order to recover the missing data, but those only recover the image from one or more images that seem to be referenced images, and those approaches mostly select the similar part or corresponding pixels to recover the original damaged. This research proposes a new approach for recovering damaged image, which aims to use this periodical weather pattern. The main idea is combining prediction and reconstruction techniques. For prediction, A time-series data of consecutive images will be used to predict the next image. This image will be used as referenced image for reconstruction process.

AB  - This research wit provide the feasible, predictive values in metastasis of SW biopsy among Vietnamese patients with thyroid carcinoma. 122 patients were recruited in this study with 18 men (14.8%) and 104 women (85.2%). Tumors were in T1 stage in 59 patients (48.4%), in T2 stage in 14 patients (11.5%), in T3 stage in 45 patients (36.9%), and in T4 stage in 4 patients (3.2%). The SW was identified by intraoperative injection of methylene blue in all cases (100%). Metastasis in SLN was reported in 53 cases (43.4%). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of SW biopsy were 79.1%, 100%, 87.7%, 100% and 79.7%, respectively. SLN biopsy is technically feasible and safe procedure, which can reveal occult metastasis among PTC patients with cNO stage, who may get benefit from selective neck dissection. However, blue method of SW detection makes SLN biopsy of limited use in the control of clinically node-negative papillary thyroid carcinoma because of low sensitivity and a high false-negative rate.

AB  - The Andes mountains play a fundamental role in the configuration of the weather and hydrology of all the west of South America. Currently there is a large number of satellites collecting several kinds of environmental information in this region, and often the volume of information available is huge. This massive availability of satellite information, combined with the processing capabilities of modern computers, makes it possible to analyze large volumes of data, but strongly restricted by an advanced knowledge in spatial information management and development tools. In many opportunities this determine the type and level of detail of the analyzes that could be carried out both at a scientific-academic level and for natural resources management institutions, in different sectors of the Andes. Due to technical and operational restrictions related to processing big volumes of satellite information. A web platform for automatic processing this information was developed, and an implementation of MODIS satellite images of daily resolution was carried out. The platform will allow obtaining, in a simple and accessible way, maps and time series of different variables (snow and cloud cover, soil temperature, etc.). Thats for the entire of argentinian and chilean cordillera. The generated information has a large number of potential users and many applications, as Hidrology and Climate studies, but also for decision makers in the dump water distribution management.

CL  - Klaipeda, LITHUANIA
AB  - The article presents the results of ice cover identification of the Baltic and White Seas based on the satellite altimetry and radiometry data. For this purpose, the study analyzed the joint distribution of the radio brightness temperature of the underlying surface, measured by two channels (18.7 and 34.0 GHz) with an on-board microwave radiometer, and the backscattering coefficient at the Ku frequency calculated by the altimeter. The analysis of the joint distribution of these parameters identified two areas of the cluster that corresponded to pure water and ice accumulation. The study was carried out using the topological filtering algorithm DPS (Discrete Perfect Sets) and subsequent isolation of the most massive 3-D condensations. Verification of these areas was carried out according to a series of images in the visible range of the MODIS multi-channel spectroradiometers, installed on the Terra and Aqua satellites. The study also relies on ENVISAT satellite MERIS spectrometer data and the spectrometer data of Landsat series of satellites.

T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: More than 1000 new patients present to the London Sarcoma Unit each year and between 5% and 10% require plastic surgery intervention. Advancements in radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocols combined with higher expectations for limb preservation has led to increased reconstructive challenges. Frequently, primary closure is achievable; however, larger tumors often require specialist reconstruction.Study Design: Aretrospective chart reviewof all referred patients fromthe London Sarcoma Unit requiring reconstruction between February 2006 and January 2015 was performed. Patients who underwent primary amputation were excluded.Results: The total number of operations performed was 298 and the mean follow-up was 16 months (12-46 months). 51% of patients had major comorbidities. Patients could be separated into early (0-1 week postoperatively, n = 167) and late reconstructions (> 1 week postoperatively, n = 131). 32 patients were reconstructed with skin grafts, 137 patients were managed with regional flaps and 129 patients were treated with free flaps.Conclusions: A patient with 3 or more major comorbidities resulted in a significantly increased risk of reconstructive failure (P < 0.05). Our experience has lead us to adhere to the following guidelines: (1) All patients should be reviewed in a multidisciplinary team meeting. (2) After primary excision, patients should be managed with a vacuum dressing until margins are clear. (3) Definitive reconstruction should be performed by a specialist reconstructive surgeon.

TI  - DETECTING VEGETATION PHENOLOGY IN VARIOUS FOREST TYPES USING LONG-TERM MODIS VEGETATION INDICES

AB  - Vegetation phenology is the timing of seasonal events, such as the onset and offset of green-up, that can be used to monitor the response of climate variations on short-and long-term periods. In particular, accurate detection of seasonal phenological events is an important variable in ecosystem simulation models and general circulation models based on the regional and global climate conditions. However, phenological filed observation is collected in limited areas and time periods. An alternative approach has been developed using satellite remote sensing data, it allows for the most efficient spatial-temporal observation. A remote sensing-based vegetation index (VI) has been used to monitor phenological and seasonal changes in vegetation development. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are most widely used. Forest ecosystems account for 63.7% of land area in South Korea, covered by deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forest types. Seasonal change in coniferous forest is not easily observed compared to deciduous trees, the start of the growing season is different. Homogeneity of the target area is essential to accurate phenology based on the remote sensing vegetation index. However, the pixel size between the remote sensing pixel and filed survey point is often unmatched in many regions. An adapted method required to extract phenology from one pixel including various ecosystem types. Our objectives were: 1) Test three different methods for extracting phenology events, particularly at the start of growing season (SOS); 2) determine whether NDVI or EVI represent the phenology of forest ecosystems; 3) match a resized digital forest type map to remote sensing pixel size; and 4) find the represented pixel among the pixels of the field observation location and eight neighbors. Three extract methods were applied to the data fitted by a double logistic curve. In order to establish a method to extract SOS that can be generally derivative function rather than " trs" with EVI. Field SOS data were collected from each site, how Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany y Korea National Arboretum, Pocheon-si, Rep. of Korea ever, it cannot be represented the pixel to which observation points belong. Therefore we extracted nine pixels, including the exact observation point pixel (center pixel). The center pixels from deciduous trees sites were 45.2% of deciduous forest, 22.3% of coniferous forest, and 7.2% of mixed forest, with 67% of deciduous forest, 14.3% of coniferous forest, and 7.7% of mixed forest for the best pixels on average, and the mean coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.64. The best pixels of the field observed from the coniferous tree species were with 56.2% of deciduous forest, 25.4% of coniferous forest, and 4.9% of mixed forest (averaged R2 = 0.29). The study demonstrates that use of long-term satellite vegetation indices for detecting phenology are related to the specific forest types in terms of investigative matching between high resolution digital maps and low spatial resolution remote sensing images.

M3  - Article
AB  - AimsThis study attempted to investigate the association between lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and CVD risk scores and to overcome the limitations of previous relevant studies.MethodsA total of 2994 ostensibly healthy males, who participated in a voluntary health check in a health promotion center from January 2010 to December 2014, were reviewed. CVD risk scores were calculated using Framingham risk score and American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) score. Correlation and multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict the CVD risk severity were performed.ResultsCorrelation between total IPSS with CVD risk scores demonstrated significant positive associations, which showed higher correlation with ACC/AHA score than the Framingham score (r=0.18 vs 0.09, respectively). For ACC/AHA score, the partial correlation after adjustment of body mass index (BMI) showed significant positive correlations between all LUTS parameters and PSA. For the Framingham score, all variables, except IPSS Q2 and IPSS Q6, showed significant positive correlations. After adjustment of BMI, prostate volume and PSA, only the severe LUTS group showed significant relationship with intermediate-high CVD risk severity, as compared with normal LUTS group (OR=2.97, 95%CI (1.35-6.99)).ConclusionUsing two validated CVD risk calculators, we observed that LUTS is closely associated with future CVD risk. To predict the intermediate-high CVD risk severity, severe LUTS was a sentinel sign, the presence of which warrants the importance of an earlier screening for CVD.

AB  - Цель данной статьи – изучить споры о социалистическом реализме в тридцатых годах с точки зрения со отношения мировоззрения и творческого метода. В рамках этой работы автор статьи покажет специфику этого спора и попытается переосмыслить его актуальность. Данная дискуссия велась на страницах журнала Литературный критик, главными фигурами были Розенталь и Нусинов. Каждый из них указывал на возможность противоречия и единства между мировоззрением и творческим методом. Розенталь в большей степени утверждал первое, Нусинов второе. Эта полемика в значительной степени способствовала критике теории РАПП и углублению теории социалистического реализма. Однако дискуссия выявила ограничения, которые не могли отчетливо отразить особенности советской литературы того времени. Другими словами, дискуссия не была тесно связана с художественной практикой советских писателей. В этой связи очень важна историческая оценка роли Лукача в Советском Союзе в тридцатые годы. Так как литературную теорию Лукача нельзя отделить от советской литературы, его теория оказалась в центре полемики. Советский социалистический реализм и дискуссии о мировоззрении и методе 30-х годов тесно связаны с пролетарским литературным движением Кореи. Литературное движение Кореи 30-х годов приняло советские споры в одностороннем порядке, но критик Лим Хва сумел создать независимую теорию и историю литературы, что стало уникальным научным развитием. a

TI  - Surface albedo from the geostationary Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS)/Meteorological Imager (MI) observation system
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface albedo is an essential climate variable that is considered in many applications used for predicting climate and understanding the mechanisms of climate change. In this study, surface albedo was estimated using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function model based on Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite/Meteorological Imager data. Geostationary orbiting satellite data are suitable for a level 2 product like albedo, which requires a synthetic process to estimate. The authors modified established methods to consider the geometry of the solar-surface-sensor of COMS/MI. Of note, the viewing zenith angle term was removed from the kernel integration used for estimating spectral albedo. Finally, the spectral (narrow) albedo was converted into the broadband albedo with shortwave length (approximately 0.3-2.5 m). This study determined conversion coefficients using only one spectral albedo of visible channel. The estimated albedo had a relatively high correlation with Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre/Vegetation and low unweighted error values specific for land types or times. The validation results show that estimated albedo has a root mean square error of 0.0134 at Jeju flux site that indicates accuracy similar to that of other satellite-based products.

TI  - Mapping Pyroclastic Flow Inundation Using Radar and Optical Satellite Images and Lahar Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinabung volcano, located above the Sumatra subduction of the Indo-Australian plate under the Eurasian plate, became active in 2010 after about 400 years of quiescence. We use ALOS/PALSAR interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images to measure surface deformation from February 2007 to January 2011. We model the observed preeruption inflation and coeruption deflation using Mogi and prolate spheroid sources to infer volume changes of the magma chamber. We interpret that the inflation was due to magma accumulation in a shallow reservoir beneath Mount Sinabung and attribute the deflation due to magma withdrawal from the shallow reservoir during the eruption as well as thermoelastic compaction of erupted material. The pyroclastic flow extent during the eruption is then derived from the LAHARZ model based on the coeruption volume from InSAR modeling and compared to that derived from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image. The pyroclastic flow inundation extents between the two different methods agree at about 86%, suggesting the capability of mapping pyroclastic flow inundation by combing radar and optical imagery as well as flow modeling.

TI  - Regional landslide susceptibility assessment using multi-stage remote sensing data along the coastal range highway in northeastern Taiwan
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons Megi (2010) and Saola (2012) brought torrential rainfall which triggered regional landslides and flooding hazards along Provincial Highway No. 9 in northeastern Taiwan. To reduce property loss and saving lives, this study combines multi-hazard susceptibility assessment with environmental geology map a rock mass rating system (RMR), remote sensing analysis, and micro-topography interpretation to develop an integrated landslide hazard assessment approach and reflect the intrinsic state of slopeland from the past toward the future. First, the degree of hazard as indicated by historical landslides was used to determine many landslide regions in the past. Secondly, geo-mechanical classification of rock outcroppings was performed by in-situ investigation along the vulnerable road sections. Finally, a high-resolution digital elevation model was extracted from airborne LiDAR and multi-temporal remote sensing images which was analyzed to discover possible catastrophic landslide hotspot shortly. The results of the analysis showed that 37% of the road sections in the study area were highly susceptible to landslide hazards. The spatial distribution of the road sections revealed that those characterized by high susceptibility were located near the boundaries of fault zones and in areas of lithologic dissimilarity. Headward erosion of gullies and concave-shaped topographic features had an adverse effect and was the dominant factor triggering landslides. Regional landslide reactivation on this coastal highway are almost related to the past landslide region based on hazard statistics. The final results of field validation demonstrated that an accuracy of 91% could be achieved for forecasting geohazard followed by intense rainfall events and typhoons. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In contrast with the other natural disasters, drought is required of continuous and regular monitoring since its damage is very gradual. Satellite images can be utilized for comprehensively monitoring changes in water resources in dam reservoirs, watersheds, and rivers. It is very difficult to obtain continuous and regular images from optical sensors since they are susceptible to weather conditions, although they can provide fine images at high spatial resolution for land surface. This study used a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) regardless of weather or daylight conditions to monitor water surface change in a dam reservoir. The 18 dam basins of Korea peninsula were monitored and the changing patterns were analyzed. The results indicated that the change in water surface area was in good agreement with the depth of drought.

AB  - The real-time monitoring of surface vegetation is essential for the management of droughts, vegetation growth, and water resources. The availability of land cover maps based on remotely collected data makes the monitoring of surface vegetation easier. The vegetation index in an area is likely to be proportional to meteorological elements there such as air temperature and precipitation. This study investigated relationship between vegetation index based on Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ground-measured meteorological elements at the Yongdam catchment station. To do this, 16-day averaged data were used. It was found that the vegetation index is well correlated to air temperature but poorly correlated to precipitation. The study provides some intuition and guidelines for the study of the droughts and ecologies in the future.

TI  - Exploring Land Cover Classification Accuracy of Landsat 8 Image Using Spectral Index Layer Stacking in Hilly Region of South Korea
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been providing solutions in a variety of sectors as a result of the recent growth in technology and available data. Land cover mapping is the most widely used application of remote sensing, yet it has always been a challenging task owing to various complexities. Consequently, constant studies have been conducted for the improvement of land cover classification accuracy using new datasets or algorithms in various cases. Because of free availability and high temporal coverage, Landsat data series are frequently chosen in studies of land cover mapping. In addition, various spectral indices (SIs) have been developed to separate a single feature very efficiently. Some of the derived SIs were stacked with an original multispectral image in some studies, in expectation of better classification results. In this study, we investigate whether the stacking of layers with different SIs derived from reflectance data could improve the land cover classification of Landsat OLI image in a hilly region of South Korea. A decision tree was used for the selection of SIs that aid classification. For that, five supervised classifiers, namely, Mahalanobis distance (Mand), maximum likelihood (ML), minimum distance to means (MinD), parallelepiped (PP), and support vector machine (SVM), in three cases of a study area were applied with the same training and validation data to compare the accuracy of the results for original and two derived composites. Out of 45 land cover cases, 28 cases showed improvements by layer stacking indices. PP showed improvement in all cases but at the cost of unclassified pixels. MahD and SVM showed improvement in most cases with higher classification accuracy. ML was unable to classify the composite with all derived bands. In conclusion, layer stacking of the derived bands, even two normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index, was able to improve the overall accuracy. Improving the accuracy of land cover maps would provide accurate information and is beneficial to authorities for a better understanding and analysis of the environment.

M3  - Article
AB  - While the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8 and the slave-girl Rhoda in Acts 12 are not commonly compared or connected, they both present a distinctive expression of joy in the face of great opposition and oppression. It is argued that their overwhelming expressions of joy that drove them to distraction are not best understood as simple responses to recent events or experiences in their narratives, i.e. non-cognitive emotion, but rather as willful and decisive proclamations demonstrative of their character, values, and worldview, i.e. cognitive emotion. In this way, their joyful behavior was a means of asserting their inclusion into the communities and culture that marginalized them. Despite their sudden disappearance from the text, their last words and actions were of joy and vindication, which continue to stand as their legacy and challenge.

AB  - Image data collected by an airborne hyperspectral camera system have a great usability in coastal line mapping, detection of facilities composed of specific materials, detailed land use analysis, change monitoring and so forh in a complex coastal area because the system provides almost complete spectral and spatial information for each image pixel of tens to hundreds of spectral bands. A few approaches after classifying by a few approaches based on SAM(Spectral Angle Mapper) supervised classification were applied for extracting optimal land cover information from hyperspectral images acquired by CASI-1500 airborne hyperspectral camera on the object of a coastal area which includes both land and sea water areas. We applied three different approaches, that is to say firstly the classification approach of combined land and sea areas, secondly the reclassification approach after decompostion of land and sea areas from classification result of combined land and sea areas, and thirdly the land area-only classification approach using atmospheric correction images and compared classification results and accuracies. Land cover classification was conducted respectively by selecting not only four band images with the same wavelength range as IKONOS, QuickBird, KOMPSAT and GeoEye satelllite images but also eight band images with the same wavelength range as WorldView-2 from 48 band hyperspectral images and then compared with the classification result conducted with all of 48 band images. As a result, the reclassification approach after decompostion of land and sea areas from classification result of combined land and sea areas is more effective than classification approach of combined land and sea areas. It is showed the bigger the number of bands, the higher accuracy and reliability in the reclassification approach referred above. The results of higher spectral resolution showed asphalt or concrete roads was able to be classified more accurately.

AB  - Nepal has been traditionally a Hindu nation. By the mid 20th century, although she had not receive the Gospel at all, since the late 1990s the Nepalese churches began to grow at an alarming rate. Nowadays they are increasing with a rate of almost 11 percent each year. This shows the fastest growth rate in the world. Nevertheless, even though Nepal experienced modernization and enlightenment, both Hinduism and Buddhism have been too deeply rooted to be separated from their real life. These kinds of the Hindu thought and its culture are stumbling blocks against communicating the Gospel for Nepalese. Because Nepalese Hindus make up 81 percent of Nepalese population, far-right Hinduism alliance has tried to control and persecute the Nepalese churches by means of legitimate political power. Moreover, although some of them became Christians, because their religious worldview was not changed, it takes a long time to overcome the teachings and traditions derived from their old religions, which Hinduism and Buddhism are inseparably combined each other. We evaluate hidden thoughts concerning the goddesses who have been widely known to both Hindu and Buddhistic Nepalese. We also examine Tantrism, Kumari worship, daily custom, and the meaning of life latent in worshipping the goddesses. Thus we intend to show what and how the Scripture says about life by analyzing Kumari(a three to five-year old living girl) worship from a viewpoint of the Reformed Life Theology. As research methods, we used various literature studies and the interviewed materials of local missionaries.

AB  - Numerous concerns have been raised in China over the issues of limited arable land resources and food security in China. Especially, the record levels of soil pollution and the conversion of the arable land become the serious threat to the nation’s capacity to produce adequate levels of staple cereal crops for Chinese people. Most of arable land, only 15% of the country, mainly concentrated on the central eastern coast and along the Yangtze and Yellow river valleys which had the highest sediment deposit among the lands in China. An agricultural land in China was classified into four categories including arable land. The survey of spatial distribution and types of land use by in China established by remote sensing data and conventional aerial photography showed main land use features and the spatial pattern and processes of land use change for 15 regions covering China. The agricultural land area in 2015 was increased by 64.9% from that in 1960 while the changes of the arable land area ranged from decrease of 6.6% in 1980 to increase of 20.2% in 1990. Conclusively, we assume that Chinese government may have to figure out the practically adequate arable land area to produce safe food for people in China, bearing in mind of 135 million ha that is a minimum threshold to ensure adequate food production.

AB  - Air temperature is one of the most important variables in a wide range of application such as weather forecasts, climate, crop yield forecasting, agriculture and environment. In particular, continuous observations of daily maximum air temperature can identify the phenomenon and trend of the heat wave and prevent the heat related disaster. In this study, we have developed the daily maximum air temperature estimation algorithm using multiple linear regression equations. The input data is MODIS and ASOS data from 2013 to 2016 (June to September). The developed MODIS-based daily maximum air temperature estimation algorithm was applied to the MODIS images acquired from June to September in 2017. Then, we verified our result to the Seoul, Daejeon, and Ulsan areas in South Korea.

AB  - In the 1980s when ‘people poems’ and ‘misty poems’ as a form of engagement prevailed, death-related poems by Gi Hyeong-do and Hai Zi were written based on their extremely personal experiences and perception of “death” and were an exception differentiated from the mainstream literary trend at that time. On the contrary, however, their unique perception of death and subject formation played an important role in inspiring various literary trends of the 1990s.The two poets were common in not only playing the role of a bridge linking the 1980s and the 1990s in the history of literature but also searching, from nature, for an answer to the problem of deliverance. While Gi Hyeong-do contributed to formation of his own unique subject through perception on “death” in Korea in the transition period between the 1980s and the 1990s, Hai Zi, among the poets having left ‘misty poems,’ popular in the 1980s, for the ‘3rd Cenozoic Era’ , also revealed, through the theme of ‘death,’ a transcendent subject desiring to be united with God. Gi Hyeong-do, raised in the city, did not have experiences with nature but believed in its possibilities. Meanwhile, it seems that Hai Zi, raised in the countryside, seems certain of deliverance by the land. Gi Hyeong-do perceived the shadow of death through others, and Hai Zi identified himself with genius artists and engineered his own death in his own religious worldview. Their perception of ‘death’ started from personal experiences and senses, but in that the foregoing revealed signs of the coming 1990s, their inquiry into ‘death’ will be the key to comprehending an era.

AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between geographical cognition and Lee Hyosuk’s discourse in Gangwon province. The colonial experience gave the meaning of ‘Chosun’. The colonial Joseon dynasty was drawn on the edge. Rural areas and cities were related to each other. Especially, Gangwon – do was a typical space with urban civilization. The Gangwon-do region is described by various symbolic representations such as beauty, innocence, awe, fear, and national identity. All of these formulas are various aspects of Gangwon Province.The recognition of geography in Gangwon-do by Lee Hyoseok is also interpreted through the dichotomy between the center and the periphery. In his essay, he aimed for Western beauty as a subject of desire. He described the beauty of artificial, harmonious nature. Lee Hyoseok ‘s hometown is a space expressed by the beauty of nature and a medium of romantic world view. The space of Gangwon-do that Lee Hyoseok draws is the same as the rural discourse of that era. Lee thought of his hometown as an object to be denied, and changed it to fit his own worldview.

AB  - Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) is one of the important commercial species of the longline fishery in the South Indian Ocean (SIO). The satellite-based oceanographic data of sea-surface temperature (SST), sea surface chlorolyll-a (SSC), sea surface salinity (SSS), mixed layer depth (MLD), sea-surface height (SSH) and eddy kinetic energy (EKE), were used to evaluate the effects of oceanographic conditions on the potential fishing zones of Albacore tuna and to explore the spatial variability of these features in the SIO using the maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). The results revealed its potential for predicting the spatial distribution of Albacore tuna and highlight the use of multispectral satellite images for describing habitats. The winter higher nominal catch per unit effort (CPUE) (> 3.9 inds./1000Hooks) of Albacore tuna was mainly distributed in the waters of 25 to 40 degrees S, South Indian Ocean. The spatial habitat patterns were explained predominantly by SST (18-22 degrees C) and indicated that SST is the most influential factor in the geographic distribution of Albacore tuna. Hotspot habitat formation were also possibly related to the Chl-a (0.09-0.12mg m(-3)) in wintertime.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the sudden shift in the direction of consciousness and the change in worldview after the Japan’s annexation of Korea in the 1910s through an analysis of editorials related to clothing culture in the 1910s. This time period experienced a restructuring of the industrial structure, economic modernization, changes in customs, demanding of the self-discipline, and the promotion of hygiene, which was upheld as an aspect of modernization. Collectively, these measures were a device to transform Korea into a Japanese colonial society favoring Japan’s economic dominance. This study newly recognizes two fundamental aspects of colonial modernism and the imperialist exploitation of the 1910s. During this time period, out of 4275 editorials, 138 editorials (3.2%) were found to be related with clothing culture, and the most editorials on clothing culture were found in 1911 and 1913, 27 and 26 editorials respectively. The number of editorials on clothing culture dropped sharply in 1915 and 1917. As a result of the classification of editorials by subject, 94 out of 138 (68.1%) editorials were related to industrial development, 14.5% of these focused on the changing customs, 13.5% focused on warnings to refrain from purchasing luxury goods, and 5.7% focused on hygiene promotion. Further research must analyze the editorials belonging to each subject in detail to reveal a nuanced picture of the 1910s.

AB  - This study evaluates integrative lotic ecosystem health using neural network modeling and principal component analysis of physical, chemical, and biological parameters in 33 streams and rivers of a large watershed. Water chemistry parameters were measured to detect chemical health, and physical habitat health was determined by a model of qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI). Also, biological health was determined by the multi-metric community fish model of index of biological integrity (IBI) and then analyzed trophic compositions and tolerance guilds. In addition, we analyzed fish tissues of liver, kidney, gill, vertebra, and muscle using a sentinel species of Zacco platypus. Chemical pollutions were closely associated with land-use patterns within the watershed and the locations of major point-sources. Model value of QHEI as a measure of physical habitat health averaged 144, indicating good health, and varied from 96 to 190 depending on the sampling sites. The proportion of sensitive fish species in the tolerance guilds had negative correlation with organic matter pollution (r = -0.716, p<0.001) and had positive a relationship with IBI (r = 0.683, p<0.001) and QHEI (r = 0.573, p = 0.001). The proportion of insectivore species, as a trophic composition indicator, was inversely correlated with BOD (r = -0.463, p = 0.007) and positive with IBI (r = 0.679, p<0.001). The analysis of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) 14-5-1 model, based on the predicted IBI values in the training sites (R-2 = 0.999, MSE = 0.015) and testing sites (R-2 = 0.894, MSE = 27.4) showed high efficiency in the MLP model.

TI  - MODIS solar diffuser degradation determination and its spectral dependency
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - This study presents a modeling approach to improve solar diffuser (SD) degradation determination from SD stability monitor (SDSM) measurements. The MODIS instrument uses a SD to calibrate its reflective solar bands (RSBs) on-orbit. Due to the imperfectly designed SDSM sun view screen, the SD reflectance tracked by SDSM has large noise. The SDSM measurements noise is spectrally coherent and can be minimized by normalizing measurements to the least degraded detector 9 (936 nm). In this study, a SD degradation model is used to determine the SD degradation's wavelength dependency and the detector 9 degradation is estimated by the model solution.The results show the SD degradations measured at 6 SDSM detectors (554 - 936 nm) have stable relationships, where the degradation is inversely proportion to 1/wavelength<^>4. The model estimated SD degradation at SDSM detector 9 wavelength (936 nm) is similar to 0.9% from 2002 to 2018. Based on the SD degradation model solution, the SD degradation at short/mid wave bands are estimated to improve short/mid wave bands calibration. The model can also be used to improve interpolating SD degradation at SDSM detectors to RSB wavelengths. Compared to linear interpolation, bands 9 and 10 show the largest differences of up to 0.3 and 0.4% respectively. These differences directly impact the calibration coefficients of these bands.

AB  - Evapotranspiration is an important factor for Earth energy balance which transports vapor into atmosphere in the form of latent heat using net radiation energy. Measuring the evapotranspiration is actually limited to a point, so the modeling on a spatially continuous grid has been conducted for a long time using meteorological and satellite data. In addition to the PM (Penman-Monteith) equation-based METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration) model and the PT (Priestley-Taylor) equation-based MS-PT (Modified Satellite-based Priestley-Taylor) model, the DNN (deep neural network) as an emerging technique can be a viable option. We conducted a DNN modeling of evapotranspiration through optimization for hidden layer structure, loss function, optimizer, active function, L1/L2 regularization, and dropout ratio. The result showed a quite favorable accuracy with the RMSE of 0.326 mm/day and the correlation coefficient of 0.975. This is because we used optimal input variables associated with the mechanism of evapotranspiration from numerical weather prediction model and satellite data, in addition to the DNN optimization. However, a more delicate modeling by increasing the volume and kind of training dataset will be necessary for future work.

TI  - The Challenge of Mechanistic Biology and Reactions of Theology: Sociobiology, Evolutionary Psychology, and Critical Responses of Theistic Evolution
T2  - 한국기독교신학논총
M3  - research-article
AB  - Many biologists have held a mechanistic view in which the world and its parts, such as living organisms and human beings, can be understood as machine–like entities. Its typical examples are sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. The concept and theories of evolution with metaphysical and anthropological implications have been considered a powerful challenge to the Christian doctrines. Theistic evolutionists have attempted to converse seriously with evolutionary science and to respond to this challenge with philosophical and theological reflections. They also accept the natural processes described by the evolutionary sciences, and in various ways both defend and modify their theological doctrines in light of the implications of evolutionary theory, while they reject a mechanistic view of the life and the human being. In this article I attempt to show that both sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are based upon a mechanistic understanding of evolution and of living organisms, including humans. After this critical review, I explore the criticisms theistic evolutionists have made of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. I also show how these theologians present an alternative view of evolution, one which makes discussion of God possible and which maintains the notion of the dignity of the human. In conclusion, this article discusses the philosophical and theological role of theistic evolution in an age of science. I argue that theistic evolutionism could be a useful and effective position for exploring a constructive relationship between theology and science. Theistic evolution can prevent an uncritical reception of transversal themes, such as life, human, culture, religion, and so on, by maintaining a critical view of a mechanistic worldview which both sociobiology and evolutionary psychology assume. Furthermore, theistic evolution can seek harmony between theological anthropology and biological anthropology, by exploring and researching various theories of biology.

Oshio Chusai’s rebellion should be understood in the perspective of Yangming-study and the unique Worldview of Japanese Yangming-Study. So, as Japanese intellectuals' insistence in the Meiji period , the philosophy of Oshio Chusai cannot be interpreted as a nationalistic position that blindly obeys and devotes to imperialism.Firstly, I discussed the unique characteristics of Japanese pre-modern Yangming- study. Next, I looked at Oshio Chusai’s theory of Returning the Great Void. Thus, I reaffirmed that ‘Oshio Chusai’s rebellion’ can not be interpreted as the blind obedience and devotion to imperialism.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The native people, or ‘the First Nations’ in Canada had lost their territory with the residing of Europeans in the 16th century. They hence lost their language and culture and became Americanized for centuries. They began a cultural renaissance movement to regain their identity from the 1970s. The most distinguishing result of the movement is the Pow-Wow festivals. The festival is a pan-tribal one in the North America and is a cultural festival with music and dance. In this paper, I will explore the natives’ activities to regain their identity through the Pow-Wow festivals held in September 2018 in Ontario, Canada.Canada natives usually live in reserved areas consisting ‘First Nations’ with their own system of political and administrative unit. The most important aspect for the natives to regain their identities is the education. The natives try to teach their history and language to the next generation to inherit their identity. The most effective way to teach history and language is the song. They teach songs, especially sung in Pow-Wow festivals, in schools and cultural institutions to the next generation.Pow-Wow is a space where the worldview of the natives is present. The series of circles of the festival space represents the series of worldview of cosmos, world, tribe, family, and individual. The circle also represents the position of the male and female, centering on the drum. The circle also exhibits the birth and death on the nature in a clockwise movement which is shown in the direction of dances. The drum is the most important instrument and is a symbol of the life of the universe. The song accompanied by the drum is usually the repetition of short melodic cells. The repetition of melodies means that the text rather than melody of the song is important in the song. The text is the history of the tribe and the praise of the deities and nature. Thus, the natives teach the songs to the next generation and sing the songs during a Pow-Wow festival in order to reestablish and transmit their cultural identity.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The national anthem of Korea began with Sing National Anthem Campaign by Seo Jae-pil. Since "the National Anthem of the Korean Empire" (1902) was created at the behest of Emperor Kojong, it has transformed into its current form, going through the national anthem with the lyrics by Yun Chi-ho(1907) that took the melody of “Auld Lang Syne” and the national anthem composed by Ahn Ea-tai(1935).As a song sung to overcome the crisis caused by the aggressions from the world powers and inspire nationalism, the national anthem of Korea served as the mechanism of the national independence movement. Issues with it are the emerging argument for revising the national anthem, citing the pro-Japanese actions by the lyricist and the composer, and its insufficient legitimacy and symbolism for the nation. In its philosophy and culture, the national anthem implies the idea of the celestial divinity in the Korean tradition that has hailed from the time immemorial and is further tinctured with the Confucianism that carries the loyal patriotism from the Joseon period. And the Christianism came to be embedded in the national anthem in the late years of the Joseon period, when the lyricist’s religious orientation was reflected in the national anthem as the spreading independence movement was centered on the Christian church. In a nutshell, the national anthem of Korea represented the change in the country’s philosophical and cultural character that followed the religious and philosophical paradigm shift, which is understood as being based on the fatherhood in the monotheism.In Japan, "the first version of Kimigayo" (1870) was created as suggested by John William Fenton, a visiting British military band leader. It was revised into "the second version of Kimigayo" composed by Hiromori Hayashi with some rearrangement by Franz Eckert. The passage of a related law in 1999 recognized it as the official national anthem of Japan.The national anthem of Japan, which was the tool for integrating the Emperor with people, also served as a device for enlightenment through modern civilization which advocated the ideology of Leave Asia, Enter Europe with a view to establishing the modern state of Meiji. It faces the criticism that it is a praise of the emperor and that it is an aggressionist national anthem which was used as a frame for colonialist rule during the wars of aggression. Furthermore, it is harassed by the issues with the composition and rearrangement of the music itself. Culturally and philosophically, the worldview presented in the national anthem of Japan is antipoetic to that revealed in the Korean counterpart, in that it peculiarly bases itself on the waka culture, animism as the philosophical origin of Shintoism, and the motherhood which governs the birth of life in nature and the existence and the continuity of spirits and souls.

AB  - The Atacama Desert is well known for the high occurrence of large-scale fog (spatial extents: hundreds of kilometers) emerging as low stratus (LST) decks over the Pacific Ocean. By contrast, the small-scale and heterogeneous occurrence of small-scale fog (hundreds of meters) particularly during summers is widely unconsidered. However, these events are important for the local vegetation and particularly for the biological soil crusts (BSC) that are widely distributed in this extreme ecosystem. Consequently, a case study in a typical fog oasis in the Pan de Azucar National Park was conducted to test the feasibility combining field measurements, drone profiling, remote sensing and numerical modeling (i) to investigate fog-type specific differences regarding dynamics, physical properties and formation, (ii) to test the applicability of remote sensing technology for fog monitoring based on existing low-resolution and a proposed new high-resolution product and (iii) to estimate the related fog water input to BSCs. Two types of fog were observed. The well-known fog/LST deck emerging from the Pacific Ocean with high water path and large spatial extent was the first type. Fog of the second type was patchier, small-scale and not necessarily connected to the LST over the ocean. Instead, fog formation of the second type was related to thermal breeze systems, which produced shallow clouds containing less water than those of type 1. In general, such small-scale fog events were not captured well by existing remote sensing products but could be detected with the proposed new high-resolution product which provided promising results. Both fog types were important water resources for the BSCs, with approximately 8% to 24% of the fog water flux available to the BSCs at the surface. The results indicated the feasibility of the proposed methods' pool to estimate the water budget of BSCs with a high spatial resolution in the future.

AB  - With the rapid development of various types of remote sensing platforms and sensors, the type, resolution and data volume of remote sensing data are also growing rapidly. Besides, users' demand for remote sensing data is also increasingly diversified, shifting from traditional industries to common users or even individual users. Under these external demands, the traditional way, distributing data organized by striping from single-satellite, can no longer meet the new demands for the management of massive remote sensing data in the world. To handle this problem, a new kind of organizing and indexing method for multiple remote sensing data, consisting of the multi-scale grid integer coding (MGIC) in 2D-space and the multi-scale time segment integer coding (MTISIC), was proposed to index temporal and spatial information of multiple remote sensing data, which would be much conducive to manage multi source, multi-scale and multi-temporal massive geo-spatial data and to develop a global, standardized, hierarchical, and shared organization model.

TI  - Acceptability and HIV Prevention Benefits of a Peer-Based Model of Rapid Point of Care HIV Testing for Australian Gay, Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men
T2  - AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent HIV testing among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM) is a strategic priority for HIV prevention in Australia. To overcome barriers to testing in conventional clinical services, Australia recently introduced peer HIV rapid point of care (RPOC) testing services for GBM. This mixed methods evaluation describes client acceptability and HIV prevention benefits of a peer HIV testing model. Most aspects of the service model were overwhelmingly acceptable to clients. Two-thirds of survey participants reported preferring testing with peers rather than doctors or nurses and over half reported learning something new about reducing HIV risk. Focus group findings suggested peer-delivered HIV RPOC testing reduced stigma-related barriers to frequent testing and provided novel opportunities for GBM to openly discuss HIV prevention and sexual practices, enhancing their HIV risk-reduction knowledge. Analysis of survey data suggested knowledge transfer occurred particularly among younger and less gay community-attached GBM.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Central Andean region of Argentina, we found gravimetric and geomorphological evidence of an uplifting of the crystalline basement of Pie de Palo range. Within this zone, we observed a positive gravimetric anomaly in the extreme South of Pie de Palo, extending towards the South of Pampean ranges. By means of the geophysical technics, it was possible to determine the magnitude and geometrical form of the anomalous body. The evidence of a tectonic uplifting is also clearly manifested in the LandSat images, by observing the displacement of the course of the San Juan River towards the South. The study region is one of the major cortical and lithospheric regions with seismic activity in the country, where three of the most devastating earthquakes occurred over the last 73years. The results would indicate that this region will continue to be one of the major seismically generating potential, significantly implying seismic dangers. The seismic risk studies indicate that the greatest hazard zone is found between the Pre-Cordillera and the Pie de Palo Range. The highest maximum acceleration values (PGA) are 242, 393, and 543 gal for return periods of 72, 475, and 2475years, respectively.

AB  - These data are associated with the article "Spatially explicit modelling and prediction of shrub cover increase near Umiujaq, Nunavik", published in Ecological Monographs. They include field data, GPS locations, as well as land cover maps. A README file has been provided to explain the contents of each file.Abstract of the article :A circumpolar increase in shrub growth and cover has been underway in Arctic and subarctic ecosystems for the last few decades, but there is considerable spatial heterogeneity in this shrubification process. Although topography, hydrology and edaphic factors are known to influence shrubification patterns, a better understanding of the landscape-scale factors driving this phenomenon is needed to accurately predict its impacts on ecosystem function. In this study, we generated land cover change models in order to identify variables driving shrub cover increase near Umiujaq (Quebec, Canada). Using land cover maps from 1990/1994 and 2010, we modelled observed changes using two contrasting conceptual approaches: binomial modelling of transitions to shrub dominance and multinomial modelling of all land cover transitions. Models were used to generate spatially explicit predictions of transition to shrub dominance in the near future as well as long-term predictions of the abundance of different land cover types. Model predictions were validated using both field data and current Landsat-derived trends of NDVI increase in the region in order to assess their consistency with observed patterns of change. We found that both variables related to topography and to vegetation were useful in modelling land cover changes occurring near Umiujaq. Shrubs tended to preferentially colonize low-elevation areas and moderate slopes, while their cover was more likely to increase in the vicinity of existing shrub patches. Deterministic realizations of the spatially explicit models of land cover change had a good predictive capability, although they performed better at predicting the proportion of different cover types than at predicting the precise location of the changes. Binomial models performed as well as multinomial models, indicating that neglecting land cover changes other than shrubification does not result in decreased prediction accuracy. The predicted probabilities of shrub increase in the region were consistent with patterns of change inferred from field data, but only partly supported by recent local increases in NDVI. Our findings increase the current understanding of the factors driving shrubification, while warranting further research on its impacts on ecosystem function and on the link between land cover changes and shifts in remotely sensed vegetation indices.

AB  - The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) operates a suite of ground-based active and passive microwave instruments at a test site representative of the Northern boreal forest zone. The instruments provide hourly to daily multifrequency observations of microwave signatures from the natural landscape throughout the year. Supported by comprehensive in situ observations of soil, vegetation, snow and atmospheric conditions, the data enable testing and formulation of new methods to retrieve geophysical parameters from remote sensing data. Complementing ground-based observations, airborne campaigns have been used to extend the spatial scale of observations to cover different types of terrain. In this paper an overview of the site and instrumentation is given, giving examples of recent campaigns and use of the collected data in the development of new Earth Observation methods. All data, including the raw data observations, are available for research purposes from FMI.

CP  - 10th IAPR Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing (PRRS)

AB  - Traditional ship segmentation methods in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are mainly based on the intensity/amplitude information. They cannot take fully advantage of the complex information in SAR imagery. This paper proposes a novel ship segmentation method based on kurtosis test in the complex-valued SAR imagery. It can take benefit of the complex information of the SAR imagery. The segmentation rationale is that sea clutter usually obey a Gaussian distribution while ship targets usually obey a sup-Gaussian distribution. Thus, their kurtosis can be different. Kurtosis is invariant with respect to location shift and positive scale changes. It follows that kurtosis of sea clutter remains approximately constant while the amplitude decreases with the incidence angle increasing. Preliminary experimental results based on Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1 data show that the proposed method can achieve good performance.

TI  - POLYMORPHISMS OF THE CALPAIN AND CALPASTATIN GENES IN THE COLOMBIAN CREOLE HARTON DEL VALLE CATTLE
T2  - REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES VETERINARIAS DEL PERU
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present work was to characterize the simple nucleotide polymorphism 316 and 4751 of the CAPN and 2959 gene and CAST1 of the CAST gene in the Colombian creole breed Harton del Valle. A total of 126 individuals were genotyped by PCR-RFLP for the four loci. All markers were polymorphic. The CC genotype of the CAPN-316 locus and the heterozygote in the other three loci were more frequent. The frequencies of the alleles positively associated with meat quality were C = 21.8 +/- 17.5% in CAPN-316, C = 48.4 +/- 10.1% in CAPN-4751, T = 52.5 +/- 11.4% in CAST-1 and A= 65.1 +/- 15.5%in CAST-2959. In all the loci the Ho (0.599 +/- 0.248) was higher than the He (0.410 +/- 0.081) with negative values of F-IS and F-IT and with deviations of EHW only in CAPN4751. The F-ST value was 0.048 (p<0.05) and the AMOVA showed that the variation in these loci was mostly due to individuals (97%). This may be indicative that this breed has a genetic predisposition for meat production of better quality.

TI  - Domestic horses within the Maya biosphere reserve: A possible threat to the Central American tapir (<i>Tapirus bairdii</i>)
T2  - CALDASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central American tapir (Tapirus bairdii) is the largest herbivore in the Neotropics classified as "endangered." It has been proposed that Equine Infectious Anemia virus (EIA) is a disease of horses with potential to lead to further decline of T. bairdii populations. In this study, we used domestic horses as sentinels for EIA in the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. In total, 40 % (13) horses tested were seropositive to EIA. This study may inform wildlife management strategies inside protected areas by considering the threat from incursions of domestic animals inside core areas of natural reserves.

T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY, VOL 63
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys (Stal), is an invasive pentatomid introduced from Asia into the United States, Canada, multiple European countries, and Chile. In 2010, BMSB populations in the mid-Atlantic United States reached outbreak levels and subsequent feeding severely damaged tree fruit as well as other crops. Significant nuisance issues from adults overwintering inside homes were common. BMSB is a highly polyphagous species with a strong dispersal capacity and high reproductive output, potentially enabling its spread and success in invaded regions. A greater understanding of BMSB biology and ecology and its natural enemies, the identification of the male-produced aggregation pheromone, and the recognition that BMSB disperses into crops from adjacent wooded habitats have led to the development of behavior-based integrated pest management (IPM) tactics. Much is still unknown about BMSB, and continued long-term collaborative studies are necessary to refine crop-specific IPM programs and enhance biological control across invaded landscapes.

AB  - Object identification using remote sensing data has a problem when the spatial resolution is not in accordance with the object. The fusion approach is one of methods to solve the problem, to improve the object recognition and to increase the objects information by combining data from multiple sensors. The application of fusion image can be used to estimate the environmental component that is needed to monitor in multiple views, such as evapotranspiration estimation, 3D ground-based characterisation, smart city application, urban environments, terrestrial mapping, and water vegetation. Based on fusion application method, the visible object in land area has been easily recognized using the method. The variety of object information in land area has increased the variation of environmental component estimation. The difficulties in recognizing the invisible object like Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD), especially in tropical area, might be decreased by the fusion method. The less variation of the object in the sea surface temperature is a challenge to be solved.

TI  - Herpes Zoster Burden in Canadian Provinces: A Narrative Review and Comparison with Quebec Provincial Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES & MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. The main aim of this review was to assess incidence rates and trends of medically attended and death cases of herpes zoster in Canada. Methods. The search was conducted in five databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, PsycNET, and Web of Science). Data on herpes zoster-related consultations and hospitalisations and deaths were also extracted from three Quebec provincial administrative databases (RAMQ, MED-ECHO, and ISQ). Results. The electronic search yielded 587 publications. Seventeen publications satisfied inclusion criteria. These publications reported data from eleven studies. Ten studies used provincial databases, and one study used the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network electronic database. Seven studies evaluated overall rates of medically attended cases (consultations and hospitalisations). Four of these studies reported an increase in rates of medically attended cases during the study period; one study reported stable rates, and two studies reported only an average rate. The rates varied from 316 to 450/100,000 p.y. The Quebec analysis shows similar rates with a slight decreasing trend (from 369 to 350/100,000 p.y.). Incidence rates of consultations were reported separately in three studies. Two studies reported an increase in rates (from 258 to 348/100,000 p.y. and from 324 to 366/100,000 p.y.), and the third study reported a decrease (from 525 to 479/100,000 p.y.). Hospitalization rates were reported separately in two studies, both reporting a decrease (from 12 to 8 cases/100,000 p.y. and from 9 to 4 cases/100,000 p.y.). Quebec data also showed a decrease, from 9 to 6 cases/100,000 p.y. One study reported herpes zoster-related deaths. In this study, the reported death rate was 0.7/1,000,000 p.y. in the overall population and 5.5/1,000,000 p.y. in those aged >= 65 years. Quebec analysis showed a death rate of 1.2/1,000,000 p.y. in the overall population and 8.6/1,000,000 p.y. in those aged >= 65 years. Conclusions. The results of the reviewed studies and our analysis of Quebec provincial data indicate important variations in the reported overall incidence rates of medically attended herpes zoster cases in Canada. The trends in time are heterogeneous in studies in which hospitalisations and medical consultations were pooled together. We observed a decrease in hospitalization rates and a slight increase in consultation rates in studies reporting hospitalisations and consultations separately. These results consolidate the understanding of the herpes zoster burden in Canada and might be used as a tool in decision-making regarding future preventive interventions.

TI  - A Resident Alien in Transit Exile, Adaptation and Geomythology in the Jeremiah Narratives
T2  - HEBREW BIBLE AND ANCIENT ISRAEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary research into the social location of resident aliens sheds important light on the language, rhetoric and sociological features of many passages in the book of Jeremiah. The particular, the narrative materials within the book point to the worldview of authors whose sense of identity breaks with that of Judahites long-characterized by attachment to space and place. This reinforces the likelihood that these materials stem in substantial form from an authorial circle with heritage beyond Judah, i.e., writers whose ancestry can be traced to the former northern kingdom and whose experience in late-monarchic Judah is that of resident aliens. This carries implications for both the book of Jeremiah and the larger Deuteronomistic tradition to which it belongs in terms of the introduction of new standards of social and religious identity in the development of Israelite religion and ancient Judaism.

TI  - The structure of teacher-specific intercultural competence: Empirical evidence on the 'Beliefs, Values, and Goals' dimension
T2  - PSIHOLOGIJA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this contribution is to identify the elements that are integral parts of a teacher-specific intercultural competence construct. In this paper, we focus on those facets of the construct that are considered to be rather value-laden and affectively tinged. Following the widely used theoretical model of teachers' professional competencies developed by Baumert and Kunter (2013), we conceptually place these facets within the Beliefs, Values, & Goals dimension, and propose four core elements: (1) appreciation of cultural diversity; (2) ethnorelative worldview; (3) attitudes toward integration; and (4) identification with goals of intercultural education. In order to test the hypothesis that these four aspects represent one single overarching latent construct, we operationalized each with an appropriate scale and then scrutinized the instruments' internal consistency, and convergent and factorial validity. The results suggest that our four scales have good internal consistencies (Cronbach's alphas between .82 and .89), adhere to a one-factor structure (as demonstrated by Confirmatory Factor Analysis), and indicate one latent construct (RMSEA = 0.000; TLI = 1.004; CFI = 1.000; SRMR = .007). With these results, this paper presents a valid, contextually relevant new instrument to assess (pre-service) teachers' beliefs, values and goals regarding intercultural education and contributes to resolving theoretical, methodological, and practical issues of research on intercultural competencies.

T2  - PSYCHOANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article offers an original and comprehensive review of the history of psychoanalytic attitudes toward faith and a religious worldview. It begins with a systematic examination of Freud's approach to religion and faith, demonstrating that contrary to the common understanding of his attitude as one of radical atheism, Freud displayed ambivalence on this issue. After Freud's death, psychoanalysis as a discipline seems to have effected a split: Whereas the psychoanalytic establishment adopted and reinforced the antireligious stance, a small number of prominent analytic thinkers nurtured the possibility of integrating faith into their practice. Since the beginning of the 21st century, changes in social and cultural trends, encouraging spiritual attitudes, will be shown to have permeated into the psychoanalytic mainstream.

T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: at the present stage, Mordovian poetry has accumulated considerable experience and is represented a fairly extensive research material that requires further study, new literary approaches. The artistic and aesthetic directions of the national poetic system as a whole, as well as the "drawing" of individual creative portraits of separate authors, a thorough study of the peculiarities of their style and writer's manner, genre modifications, the identification of dominant poetic models, structural and problem-thematic levels, the richness of artistic means of poetic texts deserve close attention.The relevance of the article is caused by the urgent need for scientific understanding of forms and means of representation of the author's thought in modern poetry. The object of research is specificity of expression of the author's individual consciousness in the poetry of V. Nesterov, manifested in the artistic declaration of the various topical and thematic levels, motive-story blocks, the variety of lyrical situations (based on the collection "Peftoma paksyat moronza" ("The Songs of the Endless Field").Objective: to reveal the means and ways of expression of the individual author's worldview: genre and style specifics, ideological and thematic space of V. Nesterov's creativity.Research materials: V. Nesterov's poetry, included in the collection "The Songs of the Endless Field".Results and novelty of research: the scientific novelty of the research is dictated by the fact that the artistic creativity of V. Nesterov, a significant part of which is presented in the collection "The Songs of the Endless Field", is unexplored. During the productive analysis of poetry of the writer, the author comes to the conclusion that despite all the traditional images of the artistic picture of the world, the V. Nesterov's works are distinguished by original author's interpretations, poetic ideas and associations, national saturation of lyrical images, synthesis of various forms of expression of internal author's intentions.

T2  - MEDIAOBRAZOVANIE-MEDIA EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks to contribute to the analysis of the German-language media texts on school and university theme that came out in Germany during the period of the sound film birth till the end of the World War II using the comparative hermeneutic analysis. Analysis of the data demonstrates that the film authors in the period of Weimar Republic denounced the Prussian system of education. In the films of the national-socialist period, the main goal of national political education was not to help students accumulate academic knowledge, but to shape a national-socialist worldview. Weimar Republic films accentuated rebellious mood of the youth, encouraged mutinous acts against rules set by the insensitive world of adults. The films of Hitler's Germany formed the comradeship image as a moral value, some important outlook elements also included collectivism, honesty, service, and obedience.In teacher-student relationship in German films of the considered period from 1929 to 1945, relations between the state and the citizen are clearly outlined. The teacher acts in the interests of the state, on behalf of the political leadership. School is not a space out of politics, on the contrary, it is a place where the socio-political views of the corresponding epoch are projected and crystallized. National-socialist cinema widely used the technique of transcoding elements, borrowed in the films of the Weimar Republic and were often based on historical falsifications. The films did not reflect the actual realities of the school life of the Third Reich, but rather the desired, most appropriate from the point of view of the national-socialist doctrine of education and training.

TI  - The 'Alice in Wonderland' mechanics of the rejection of (climate) science: simulating coherence by conspiracism
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Science strives for coherence. For example, the findings from climate science form a highly coherent body of knowledge that is supported by many independent lines of evidence: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human economic activities are causing the global climate to warm and unless GHG emissions are drastically reduced in the near future, the risks from climate change will continue to grow and major adverse consequences will become unavoidable. People who oppose this scientific body of knowledge because the implications of cutting GHG emissions-such as regulation or increased taxation-threaten their worldview or livelihood cannot provide an alternative view that is coherent by the standards of conventional scientific thinking. Instead, we suggest that people who reject the fact that the Earth's climate is changing due to greenhouse gas emissions (or any other body of well-established scientific knowledge) oppose whatever inconvenient finding they are confronting in piece-meal fashion, rather than systematically, and without considering the implications of this rejection to the rest of the relevant scientific theory and findings. Hence, claims that the globe "is cooling" can coexist with claims that the "observed warming is natural" and that "the human influence does not matter because warming is good for us." Coherence between these mutually contradictory opinions can only be achieved at a highly abstract level, namely that "something must be wrong" with the scientific evidence in order to justify a political position against climate change mitigation. This high-level coherence accompanied by contradictory subordinate propositions is a known attribute of conspiracist ideation, and conspiracism may be implicated when people reject well-established scientific propositions.

AB  - For many land monitoring applications using remote sensing, lack of data is no longer an issue, as it may have been in the past. Programs, such as Copernicus by the European Commission and the Landsat Missions by the United States Geological Survey, have adopted systematic acquisition strategies, and distribute vast amounts of satellite data under open licenses. In parallel, storage and computing capability have evolved to make it cost-effective and practical to process and analyze these data at various scales. Data architecture solutions, such as the Open Data Cube (ODC) and the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS), are providing frameworks that make [scientific] analysis much simpler and straightforward. However, enabling non-expert users without the expertise and/or computation resources to pre-process and store lowlevel data products in order to exploit these capabilities, has proven more challenging. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS1) is working to address this challenge through the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) initiative [1]. CARD4L is foreseen to enable users to access satellite data products that are 'ready to use' for a wide range of land applications. Moreover, CARD4L aims to enable non-expert users access to products that have been processed 'far enough' to be suitable for immediate analysis for a range of applications, while ensuring they are not too specific to only be used for particular topics or areas. CARD4L will be an important enabler of the Open Data Cube (ODC) initiative [2]. Through CARD4L, users will be able to easily locate products that are suitable for ingestion into Data Cubes [3], and will have confidence that these different CARD4L products will limit as far as possible barriers to interoperability.

TI  - Why does the runoff in Hotan River show a slight decreased trend in northwestern China?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the recent 50years, in response to global warming, nearly all of the rivers in the arid region of northwest China have shown significant increasing trends in runoff. However, runoff in the Hotan River has shown a slight decreasing trend that corresponded to a rate of -0.18x10(8)m(3)/decade for the same period. Here, based on an analysis of runoff from mountain pass hydrologic stations and precipitation during 1960-2009, as well as measurements of upper-air temperature (UAT) from the Hotan sounding station (1960-2011) and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) of the mountainous area (2001-2011), we found that the annual runoff in the Hotan River was mainly determined (75%) by summer runoff. We also determined that the summer runoff was strongly associated (correlation coefficient: R=0.78, p<0.001) with summer UAT at 500hPa and mountain LST (R=0.69, p<0.001) during 1960-2009. Because the largest proportion of runoff in the Hotan River stems from glacial meltwater, we suggest that the decreasing trends exhibited by the UAT in the mid-lower troposphere and the LST within the mountainous area in summer are the main reasons why runoff shows a slight decreasing trend over the past half century.

AB  - The influence of the ionosphere on spaceborne SAR signals can be significant, predominantly at the L-band and lower frequencies. In particular, low band polarimetric SAR's applications are mainly limited by Faraday rotation (FR) effects. In this paper a new FR estimator is proposed from linearly polarized coherency matrix data and validated by ALOS PALSAR full-pol data processing. FR angles computed by the new estimator are in good consistent with FR angles computed by physical model. The estimator is also used to assess the impact on sea ice. The results show that a FR value exceeding 2 degrees could reduce the accuracy of geophysical parameter recovery of sea ice in the cross-polarized channels.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE SPATIOTEMPORALLY VARYING EFFECTS OF URBAN SPATIAL PATTERNS ON LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURES
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are a worldwide phenomenon that have many ecological and social consequences. It has become increasingly important to examine the relationships between land surface temperatures (LSTs) and all related factors. This study analyses Landsat data, spatial metrics, and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model for a case study of Hangzhou, China, to explore the correlation between LST and urban spatial patterns. The LST data were retrieved from Landsat images. Spatial metrics were used to quantify the urban spatial patterns. The effects of the urban spatial patterns on LSTs were further investigated using Pearson correlation analysis and a GWR model, both at three spatial scales. The results show that the LST patterns have changed significantly, which can be explained by the concurrent changes in urban spatial patterns. The correlation coefficients between the spatial metrics and LSTs decrease as the spatial scale increases. The GWR model performs better than an ordinary least squares analysis in exploring the relationship of LSTs and urban spatial patterns, which is indicated by the higher adjusted R-2 values, lower corrected Akaike information criterion and reduced spatial autocorrelations. The GWR model results indicate that the effects of urban spatial patterns on LSTs are spatiotemporally variable. Moreover, their effects vary spatially with the use of different spatial scales. The findings of this study can aid in sustainable urban planning and the mitigation the UHI effect.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node status is a critical prognostic factor in breast cancer treatment and is essential to guide future adjuvant treatment. The estimation that 20-60% of micrometastases are missed by conventional pathology has created a demand for the development of more accurate approaches. Here, a paired-agent imaging approach is presented that employs a control imaging agent to allow rapid, quantitative mapping of microscopic populations of tumor cells in lymph nodes to guide pathology sectioning. To test the feasibility of this approach to identify micrometastases, healthy pig lymph nodes were stained with targeted and control imaging agent solution to evaluate the potential for the agents to diffuse into and out of intact nodes. Aby-029, an anti-EGFR affibody was labeled with IRDye 800CW (LICOR) as targeted agent and IRDye 700DX was hydrolyzed as a control agent. Lymph nodes were stained and rinsed by directly injecting the agents into the lymph nodes after immobilization in agarose gel. Subsequently, lymph nodes were frozen-sectioned and imaged under an 80-um resolution fluorescence imaging system (Pearl, LICOR) to confirm equivalence of spatial distribution of both agents in the entire node. The binding potentials were acquired by a pixel-by-pixel calculation and was found to be 0.02. +/- 0.06 along the lymph node in the absence of binding. The results demonstrate this approach's potential to enhance the sensitivity of lymph node pathology by detecting fewer than 1000 cell in a whole human lymph node.

TI  - Macrophage polarization and meta-inflammation
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Chronic overnutrition and obesity induces low-grade inflammation throughout the body. Termed "meta-inflammation," this chronic state of inflammation is mediated by macrophages located within the colon, liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. A sentinel orchestrator of immune activity and homeostasis, macrophages adopt variable states of activation as a function of time and environmental cues. Meta-inflammation phenotypically skews these polarization states and has been linked to numerous metabolic disorders. The past decade has revealed several key regulators of macrophage polarization, including the signal transducer and activator of transcription family, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, the CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) family, and the interferon regulatory factors. Recent studies have also suggested that microRNAs and long noncoding RNA influence macrophage polarization. The pathogenic alteration of macrophage polarization in meta inflammation is regulated by both extracellular and intracellular cues, resulting in distinct secretome profiles. Meta-inflammation-altered macrophage polarization has been linked to insulin insensitivity, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and autoimmunity. Thus, further mechanistic exploration into the skewing of macrophage polarization promises to have profound impacts on improving global health.

TI  - Examining Land Cover and Greenness Dynamics in Hangzhou Bay in 1985-2016 Using Landsat Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover changes significantly influence vegetation greenness in different regions. Dense Landsat time series stacks provide unique opportunity to analyze land cover change and vegetation greenness trends at finer spatial scale. In the past three decades, large reclamation activities have greatly changed land cover and vegetation growth of coastal areas. However, rarely has research investigated these frequently changed coastal areas. In this study, Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series (1984-2016) data and the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend algorithm were used to detect the intensity and dates of abrupt changes in a typical coastal areaHangzhou Bay, China. The prior and posterior land cover categories of each change were classified using phenology information through a Random Forest model. The impacts of land cover change on vegetation greenness trends of the inland and reclaimed areas were analyzed through distinguishing gradual and abrupt changes. The results showed that the intensity and date of land cover change were detected successfully with overall accuracies of 88.7% and 86.1%, respectively. The continuous land cover dynamics were retrieved accurately with an overall accuracy of 91.0% for ten land cover classifications. Coastal reclamation did not alleviate local cropland occupation, but prompted the vegetation greenness of the reclaimed area. Most of the inland area showed a browning trend. The main contributors to the greenness and browning trends were also quantified. These findings will help the natural resource management community generate better understanding of coastal reclamation and make better management decisions.

AB  - The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect due to the surface reflectance anisotropy and variations in the solar and viewing geometry has been studied in the remote sensing community for several decades, and most attention was paid to the satellite sensors with large field of view (FOV), such as MODIS with a 110 degrees FOV. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technique, the imagery acquired at UAV platform provides important information about crop growth status, which is a promising and efficient approach for precise agriculture. However, few studies explored the BRDF effect in UAV images, especially for the sensors with small FOVs. This study investigated the BRDF effect on the estimation of canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) with the UHD 185 hyperspectral imagery (27 degrees FOV) acquired at a UAV platform. Our results from a rice field-plot experiment demonstrated that the CCC was highly correlated to the red-edge chlorophyll index derived at five different view angles. However, the regression models were significantly different among these view angles. This implied that no single CCC estimation model can be applied to the whole image for CCC mapping. The findings suggest the BRDF effect should be considered for providing reliable and consistent CCC estimation.

AB  - This article presents an experiment of water depth inversion using the band ratio method in Dongsha Island shallow water. The remote sensing data is from QuickBird satellite on April 19, 2004. The bathymetry result shows an extensive agreement with the charted depths. 129 points from the chart depth data were chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the inversion depth. The results show that when the water depth is less than 20m, the inversion depth is accord with the chart, while the water depth is more than 20m, the inversion depth is still among 1525m. Therefore, the remote sensing methods can only be effective with the inversion of 20m in Dongsha Island shallow water, rather than in deep water area. The total of 109 depth points less than 20m were used to evaluate the accuracy, the root mean square error is 2.2m.

TI  - Renewed Estimates of Grassland Aboveground Biomass Showing Drought Impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in ecosystem composition and structure within a cover type of the same biome can be responsible for the large amounts of uncertainty in remote sensing modeling of aboveground biomass (AGB). Based on 820 ground measurements of AGB and the pure vegetation index models, we proposed a spatially variable remote sensing scalar (i.e., M scalar) in estimating AGB by addressing within-type variations of vegetation. We tested this new modeling approach in Inner Mongolia grasslands and achieved a higher R-2 (>0.88) and lower RMSE value (<28.17g/m(2)) than those in the conventional remote sensing models. The annual average (STD) of the grassland AGB for 2001-2016 was 87 (9) Tg, with an AGB density of 10474g/m(2). The interannual variation of AGB appeared insignificant over the study period, except in the western region where it increased significantly. The dynamics of AGB were highly correlated with drought severity during the growing season (R-2=0.691, P<0.001). AGB under normal climate (i.e., without drought) was 90.88 Tg, but it increased by 19% (17.11 Tg) in a wet year (2012) and decreased by 20% (18.16 Tg) in a dry year (2001). More importantly, the high grazing intensity played a less significant role in directing grassland AGB dynamics (R-2=0.024, P=0.599). Future efforts are needed to explore how within-type variation of vegetation may change temporally and spatially in accurate estimate of AGB across heterogeneous landscapes, as well as the potential underlying mechanisms from biological, physical, and human perspectives.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the Earth's surface, climate change has been occurring at a non-uniform rate, affecting biomes and directly or indirectly imposing impacts on societies. The productivity of the grassland biome has also been inevitably influenced, which in turn might affect the livestock production. Here, a meaningful indicator - growth rate index (GRI) - is proposed based on plant phenology and quantified from long-term remote sensing data to understand responses of the grassland biome to climate change at a global scale. We found a steady increase in GRI for the global grassland biome from 1982 through 2013, with around 35% of global grasslands exhibiting a significant increase (p<0.1), and 3.8% of global grasslands experiencing a decrease. Climate warming over the past three decades did not aggravate water stress on worldwide grassland biomes, especially for the typical steppes in the Northern Hemisphere where GRI appeared more sensitive to the variations in precipitation compared to the savanna biome in the Southern Hemisphere. This study suggests that the increases in grassland GRI may have the potential to elevate global livestock production.

TI  - Super-Resolution for GaoFen-4 Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, the application of super-resolution (SR) techniques to GaoFen(GF)-4, which is the most advanced geostationary-orbit earth observing satellite in China, remote sensing images is investigated and tested. One of the shortcomings of the geostationary-orbit-based earth observing satellite is the limitation of spatial resolution. However, human beings never stop pursuing higher resolution in images. This is the first experiment of applying SR to a sequence of low-resolution (LR) images captured by GF-4 within a short time period. One of the barriers for applying SR to remote sensing images is the large time gaps between those LR image acquisition, because the reflection characteristic of the ground may change within the time period when those LR images were captured. However, GF-4 has the unique advantage of capturing a sequence of LR images of the same region in minutes, i.e., working as a staring camera from the point view of SR. The reconstructed high-resolution images of some regions in Beijing and Hainan are shown and evaluated in this letter. This letter demonstrates that the application of SR to geostationary-orbit-based earth observation data is feasible and valuable, and it has the potential to be applied to the images acquired by all other geostationary-orbit-based earth observing systems.

AB  - Gaofen-4 is the first optical geostationary satellite in China and it is in operation since 2016. Unfortunately, the mid-infrared band has a Ground Spatial Distance (GSD) of 400 m, which is low and limits its application in temperature retrieval. The calibration of this band is challenging as well. In this paper, a new data fusion method is proposed to improve both image quality and spatial resolution, by making use the advantage of high temporal resolution. Experimental results show that the reconstructed high resolution mid-infrared images not only provide more details visually but also gives more accurate and reliable temperature mapping than the original images. The proposed solution holds potential application for Gaofen-4 in the near future.

AB  - This article analyzes three children’s plays of the Man Son Daily, which presumably appeared after the Sino-Japanese War. Toward the end of Japanese rule, children’s plays of Manchukuo Korean people shared several features, one of which was a storyline in which the main characters had often lost one or both parents. In this backdrop, families were often depicted as destitute, which often magnified images of poverty. In colonial cultures, the loss of one’s parents often symbolizes the loss of sovereignty. The protagonist’s poor and pitiable image mirrors the miserable lives Korean children suffered during the colonial period. On the other hand, protagonists with cheerful and courageous personalities ultimately overcome their misfortunes to rise heroes-possible evidence of an optimistic worldview. Children’s plays during this period also depicted several class-based problems, such as those between bourgeoisie and proletariats in capitalist societies, in patriarchal system, and with exploitation under colonial rule. Classism thus characterized Korean Children’s plays in Manchuria. In the later years of Japan’s colonial period, the most obvious feature of Korean children’s play was the growing tendency to metaphorically interpret their plots and themes through Christian consciousness. The Manchuria Korean children’s plays present new worlds founded on national liberation and freedom from colonial rule.

TI  - Onboard Spectral and Spatial Cloud Detection for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate onboard detection of clouds in hyperspectral images before lossless compression is beneficial. However, conventional onboard cloud detection methods are not applicable all the time, especially for shadowed clouds or darkened snow-covered surfaces that are not identified in normalized difference snow index (NDSI) tests. In this paper, we propose a new spectral-spatial classification strategy to enhance the performance of an orbiting cloud screen obtained on hyperspectral images by integrating a threshold exponential spectral angle map (TESAM), adaptive Markov random field (aMRF) and dynamic stochastic resonance (DSR). TESAM is applied to roughly classify cloud pixels based on spectral information. Then aMRF is used to do optimal process by using spatial information, which improved the classification performance significantly. Nevertheless, misclassifications occur due to noisy data in the onboard environments, and DSR is employed to eliminate noise data produced by aMRF in binary labeled images. We used level 0.5 data from Hyperion as a dataset, and the average tested accuracy of the proposed algorithm was 96.28% by test. This method can provide cloud mask for the on-going EO-1 and related satellites with the same spectral settings without manual intervention. Experiments indicate that the proposed method has better performance than the conventional onboard cloud detection methods or current state-of-the-art hyperspectral classification methods.

AB  - Liupanshui city is an important karst area where the situation of rocky desertification is very serious in Guizhou Province, southern china. Vegetation coverage is an important ecological parameter for evaluating rocky desertification degree. This study investigates different characteristics of the spatial-temporal changes of vegetation cover and associated driving forces of vegetation coverage change were also analyzed in Liupanshui city of western Guizhou Province using the data set of Landsat (2002-2015) at spatial resolution of 30m and temporal resolution of 16-day. The results show that: 1) the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation cover in Liupanshui city is high in the east whereas low in the west. The average annual vegetation coverage in the south of Liupanshui city is higher than in the north. The average annual vegetation coverage in Panxian County, Shuicheng County, Zhongshan District, and Liuzhi District are 0.6047, 0.5949, 0.4432, and 0.6140 respectively. 2) Average annual vegetation coverage improved obviously in the past 13 years. The growth rate of average annual vegetation coverage is 0.028/10yr and the average vegetation coverage is 0.5957. 3) The proportion of vegetation cover with extremely significant increase and significantly increase is far higher than that of vegetation cover with extremely significant reduced and significantly reduced in the city. In other words, the improvement in vegetation cover may expand to most parts of the study area.

AB  - Information of crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop productivity and crop management. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with the advantage of all-weather, day-night imaging and clouds penetrability, is an effective way for rice growth monitoring. In this study, we developed a method for remotely determining phenological stages of paddy rice with sixteen polarimetric SAR images. The method consists of three procedures: (I) Classified the transplanted rice (T-R) and the direct-sown rice (D-R) field; (II) Sensitivity analysis of polarimetric parameters versus rice phenology; (III) Reconstructing the time-series polarimetric parameters profiles of rice by time-frequency analysis; (IV) Specifying the phenological stages by detecting the maximum point, minimal point and inflection point from the smoothed polarimetric parameters time profile. Three keys phenological periods of rice were detected with the the accuracy of about 84%.

AB  - In this study, two latest Collection 6 (C6) MODIS level-2 LST products (MxD11_L2 and MxD21_L2) from both the Terra and Aqua satellites were evaluated against ground measurements collected in an arid area of northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) experiment. Ground measurements of four and a half years at four barren surface sites were used to carry out the evaluation, which took place from June 2012 to December 2016. The results show that the C6 MxD21 LST products demonstrate a better accuracy than C6 MxD11 LSTproducts both at daytime and nighttime for the four sites. For the daytime result, C6 MxD11 products underestimate the LST at the four barren surface sites, with an average bias of -1.77 K for Terra and -2.63 K for Aqua, while the average biases of MxD21 LST products are much smaller, with an average bias of 0.34 K for Terra and -0.67 K for Aqua, respectively. For the nighttime result, C6 MxD11 products also underestimate the LST at the four sites, with an average bias of -1.41 K for Terra and -1.01 K for Aqua, while the average biases of MxD21 LST products are 0.14 K for Terra and 0.54 K for Aqua, respectively.

AB  - There is great value to extract artificial surface from remote sensing images to understand urban expansion dynamics. With crowdsourcing data like Open Street Map (OSM), a great amount of labeled training data can be used as input of many supervised classification methods like Neural Network. This study explores the potential application of combining crowdsourcing data and remote sensing images in artificial surface extraction. A 1000 km(2) area of a Landsat 8 image in Beijing, the capital city of China, is chosen as the case study. Comparing with a spectral method Normalized Differential Building Index (NDBI) and an unsupervised method ISODATA, the freely available labeled building foot scripts by OSM are used as training datasets for several supervised classification methods including Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Supporting Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN). The estimation by OSM point features with building-like attributes shows that the accuracies of the five classification methods NDBI, ISODATA, MLC, SVM, and NN are 8.51%, 45.39%, 75.18%, 85.11%, and 93.62% respectively. This means that the combination of crowdsourcing and remote sensing has a very potential value for satellites applications like artificial surface extraction.

AB  - In view of the difficulty in monitoring the concentration and distribution of large-scale regional indicators, firstly, this paper uses the deep blue algorithm to invert the aerosol optical thickness of Shanxi province in 2016. Secondly, this paper uses the results of the inversion to establish the correlation regression analysis with the PM10 mass concentration data obtained from the monitoring station obtained by the China National Environmental Monitoring Center. Then, by analyzing this model, this paper inverts the concentration and distribution characteristics of PM10 in a wide range of regions, and finally obtains the distribution characteristics of PM10 concentration in the survey area. The results show that the correlation coefficient of the regression analysis model established in this paper reaches 0.804, and the data shows a good consistency in the trend of change. This model is used to inverse large area PM10 concentration. It helps to quickly and efficiently obtain the distribution characteristics of PM10 mass concentration in this area. This will provide effective help for related research such as environmental pollution control.

AB  - Fusion of high-spatial-resolution (HSR) multispectral (MS) and Panchromatic (PAN) images has become a research focus with the development of HSR remote sensing technology. Previous research demonstrated that improving the fused versions of mixed pixels (MPs) is effective for improving the quality of fused products generated by some fusion methods based on component substitution. In this work, two pansharpening methods based on multiresolution analysis were improved through considering the fusion of MPs based on image segmentation. The improved methods were compared with several other state-of-the-art fusion methods using a fusion experiment using two datasets recorded by WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1, respectively. Experimental results showed that the proposed method offers the lowest spectral distortions and more sharpened boundaries between different images objects than other methods, especially for boundaries between vegetation and other non-vegetation objects.

AB  - The ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to observe two-dimensional ocean wave spectra is restrained by both nonlinear imaging and spatial resolution. The improvement of SAR spatial resolution allows us to investigate the properties of intermediate ocean waves. In this study, a new complex parameter focusing on intermediate ocean waves is defined based on SAR image cross-spectra to describe their statistical characteristics. It includes both the magnitude and directional information of intermediate ocean waves. At first order, they are found to be associated to wind speed and wind direction, respectively. The preliminary results show that imaginary part of this parameter exhibits approximately a linear relationship with radial wind speed. The global map of this parameter further confirms its correlation with surface winds, which is potential to better restrain the wind retrieval over one SAR imagette.

TI  - Coastal Zone Classification Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Imagery Fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this paper was to assess the capability of multisource remote sensing imagery fusion for coastal zone classification. Five scenes of Gaofen- (GF-) 1 optic imagery and four scenes of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-2) imagery were collected and matched. Note that GF-1 is the first satellite of the China high-resolution earth observation system, which acquires multispectral data with decametric spatial resolution, high temporal resolution, and wide coverage. The results showed that based on the comparison of C- and L-band SAR for coastal coverage, it is verified that C band is superior to L band and parameter subsets of sigma(0)(vv), sigma(0)(vh) and D-cross can be effectively used for coastal classification. A new fusion method based on the wavelet transform (WT) was also proposed and used for imagery fusion. Statistical values for the mean, entropy, gradient, and correlation coefficient of the proposed method were 67.526, 7.321, 6.440, and 0.955, respectively. We therefore conclude that the result of our proposed method is superior to GF-1 imagery and traditional HIS fusion results. Finally, the classification output was determined along with an assessment of classification accuracy and kappa coefficient. The kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of the classification were 0.8236 and 85.9774%, respectively, so the proposed fusion method had a satisfying performance for coastal coverage mapping.

CP  - 5th International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)
CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - To characterize the Asian dust storms, an integrated algorithm has been developed to detect dust based on spectral thresholds and uniformity texture tests with Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) observations. The thermal radiation transfer and Look-up Tables (LUT) with the assumption of single dust layer was estimated and modeled using SBDART radiative transfer model. The LUTs consisted of six parameters, including aerosol optical thickness (AOT), dust particle effective radius (R-eff), land surface temperature (LST), dust layer height (Hgt), water vapor (WV) and satellite zenith angle (Uzen). When the other four parameters were controlled, AOT and Reff were able to be retrieved simultaneously by comparing the brightness temperature (BT) and brightness temperature difference (BTD) in the LUTs with satellite observed BT and BTD. Dust events occurred in 2009 observed by the MTSAT were selected to test the retrieval algorithm. The GEOS-Chem dust model was also used and assisted in identifying the dust transport pathways. Finally, the results were validated with AERONET (AOT and Reff) and MODIS AOT data. The retrieved results showed promising agreements with the validation products. This newly developed algorithm provided continuous (both daytime and nighttime) and detailed observations of the dust storms, as well as AOT and particle size information of the dust plumes.

AB  - This study presents the difference of normalized remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) between SeaWiFS, MERIS and MODIS with in situ data in the SCS. The results show that all the satellite-derived Rrs are less than the in situ data, and the APD(Absolute Percentage Difference) of the Rrs from the three satellite sensors are mostly less than 20%, except band 412 and 660 nm in global ocean and band 555and 660nm in SCS. The blue band of the three missions have the good performances, whose APD are less than 15%. The performances of MODIS Rrs is better than MERIS (or SeaWiFS). And, compared with each other in the SCS, the results show that the Rrs of the three missions are generally agree well with each other, but they still have big differences in the coastal area. The MODIS Rrs is bigger than MERIS's and SeaWiFS's in the 412, 443 and 488 nm band. The differences between MERIS (or SeaWiFS) and MODIS change with band (488 nm is the best one). And the differences among three missions for blue band has seasonal variation in the SCS from 2008 to 2010.

TI  - A new method for generating a clear-sky Landsat composite for cropland from cloud-contaminated Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method was developed in this study for producing a clear-sky Landsat composite for cropland from cloud-contaminated Landsat images acquired in a short time period. It used Thiel-Sen regression to normalize all Landsat scenes to a MODIS image to make all Landsat images radiometrically consistent and comparable. Pixel selection criteria combining the modified maximum vegetation index and the modified minimum visible reflectance selection methods were designed to enhance the pixel selection of land/water over cloud/shadow in the image compositing. The advantages of the method include (1) avoiding complicated atmospheric corrections but with reliable surface reflectance results, (2) being insensitive to errors induced by image co-registration uncertainties between Landsat and MODIS images, (3) avoiding the lack of samples for the regression analysis using the full Landsat scenes (rather than overlay regions), and (4) enhancing cloud/shadow detection. The composite image has MODIS-like surface reflectance, thus making MODIS algorithms applicable for retrieving biophysical parameters. The method was automatically implemented on a set of 13 cloud-contaminated (>39%) Landsat-7 (Scan-Line Corrector-Off) and Landsat-8 scenes acquired during peak growing season in a crop region of Manitoba, Canada. The result was a 95.8% cloud-free image. The method can also substantially increase the usage of cloud-contaminated Landsat data.

M3  - Data study
AB  - This research estimated the surface water fraction from MODIS 16-day 500 m Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrected surface reflectance image composites. The spatial extent of two Landsat tiles over Spain were selected as test areas. We obtained a 500 m reference dataset on surface water fraction by spatially aggregating 30 m binary water masks derived from the C-version of Function of Mask (CFmask), which themselves were evaluated against high-resolution Google Earth imagery. Twelve regression tree models were developed with two approaches, Random Forest and Cubist, using spectral metrics derived from MODIS data and topographic parameters generated from a 30 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Results showed that accuracies were higher when we included annual summary statistics of the spectral metrics as predictor variables. Models trained on a single Landsat tile were ineffective in mapping surface water in the other tile, but global models trained with environmental conditions from both tiles can provide accurate results for both study areas. We achieved the highest accuracy with Cubist global model (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 11.05%, MAE = 7.67%). Our approach is promising for monitoring surface water fraction at high frequency time intervals over much larger regions provided that training data are collected across the spatial domain for which the model will be applied.

TI  - A Spectral-Mixing Model for Estimating Sub-Pixel Coverage of Sea-Surface Floating Macroalgae
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, floating macroalgae blooms have been increasing on a global scale. Sub-pixel coverage of floating macroalgae in a remote-sensing image is a crucial parameter for the estimation of biomass. In this study, in situ spectra of green macroalgae (Ulva prolifera), brown macroalgae (Sargassum horneri), and sea water were collected, and they were used to simulate the spectra of macroalgae-seawater mixtures in a linear mixing way. Three algae indices, normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI), difference of vegetation index (DVI), and virtual-baseline reflectance height for floating algae (VB-FAH) derived from the spectra, were examined with the coverage of macroalgae. The results show that all three indices increase monotonically with increasing sub-pixel coverage of macroalgae: VB-FAH and DVI increase linearly, while NDVI shows a logarithmic increase. Based on this characteristic, two sub-pixel coverage models were proposed (i.e., a linear model based on VB-FAH (or DVI) and an exponential model based on NDVI). These models were then applied to the multiple-spectral GaoFen-1 (GF-1, 16m resolution) satellite image to examine the sub-pixel coverage of green tide in the Yellow Sea caused by the bloom of floating green macroalgae (U. prolifera). The results show that the relative differences between the two models are no more than 5%, indicating good consistency between the two models. Taking into account the sensitivity of these models (or indices) to the coverage of macroalgae, as well as atmospheric and sea surface conditions and their simplicity, we suggest using the linear model based on VB-FAH, DVI, or a similar band-difference index to estimate sub-pixel coverage of floating macroalgae.

AB  - As part of the G4AW SMARTSeeds project, this study aims to investigate the potential of dense time series of Sentinel1A dual polarization data for the classification of vegetables that are common in East Java, Indonesia. We first analyzed the temporal behavior of three main types of vegetables (i. e. chili, tomato and cucumber) in terms of backscatter (VH and VV) intensity, and of polarimetric features (i. e. entropy, alpha and anisotropy) derived from polarization decomposition. We then applied a support vector machine with an intersection kernel to the time series data of vegetable samples collected in field. Our results showed that dense time series Sentinel-1A images are of high potential for vegetable classification. Besides using backscatter intensity, the polarimetric information can further improve the discrimination between three specific vegetable types.

AB  - Here we present a new index, observed snow probability (OSP), to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of snow cover. We determine the distribution of OSP values across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) by analyzing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the 2002-2016 time period to investigate the relationship between OSP and two terrain factors, elevation and aspect. Our results suggest that the distribution of OSP across the TP exhibits a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity with high OSPs mainly concentrated along the southern and western edges of the TP, which is strongly linked to the supply of moist air. The distribution of snow cover is also heavily dependent on elevation, with higher OSPs at higher elevations. Aspect is another key factor that significantly influences OSP, with higher OSPs corresponding to the shady aspects and windward slopes.

TI  - Combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning based on object association for land cover classification
T2  - 2018 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL IMAGE COMPUTING: TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS (DICTA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Digital Image Computing - Techniques and Applications (DICTA)
CL  - Canberra, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Conventional supervised classification approaches have significant limitations in the land cover classification from remote sensing data because a large amount of high quality labeled samples are difficult to guarantee. To overcome this limitation, combination with unsupervised approach is considered as one promising candidate. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve the combination through object association based on Dempster-Shafer theory. Inspired by object association, the framework can label the unsupervised clusters according to the supervised classes even though they have different numbers. The proposed framework has been tested on the different combinations of commonly used supervised and unsupervised methods. Compared with the supervise methods, our proposed framework can furthest enhance the overall accuracy approximately by 8.2%. The experiment results proved that our proposed framework has achieved twofold performance gain: better performance on the insufficient training data case and the possibility to apply on a large area.

AB  - This paper focuses on precipitation detection using microwave humidity temperature sounder (MWHS-II) onboard FY-3C satellite. Some of its channels are sensitive to moisture at different atmospheric altitudes and provide vertical precipitation information. In this paper, precipitation detection algorithm over ocean using scatter index (SI) and over land using direct classification are proposed, then rain rate retrieval algorithm is completed on the basis of the precipitation detection algorithm. For ocean, compared with the Level 2 precipitation detection data product of FY3C MWHS-II, the correctness of the ocean precipitation detection algorithm is close to 100% (vertical bar latitude vertical bar < 50 degrees) and 95.6% (vertical bar latitude vertical bar > 50 degrees), and compared with TMPA 3B42 data product, it can reach 96.5%. For land, compared with the TMPA 3B42 data product, its accuracy is higher than 93%. It can be seen that the proposed algorithm for detecting precipitation for ocean and land is effective.

AB  - In this paper, an automatic unsupervised change detection approach specifically for the analysis of single-channel single-polarization high-resolution SAR images is proposed. The temporal change feature images, namely positive change and negative change, are derived from the fuzzy labeled co-occurrence matrix. Then, the multi-level Otsu method is applied on the temporal change feature images to classify the changed and unchanged class, and the change detection map is obtained finally. Experiments were carried on the multitemporal TerraSAR-X images. Quantitative classification results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Acquisition probability differences in cloud coverage of the available Landsat observations over mainland Southeast Asia from 1986 to 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat data are the longest available records that consistently document global change. However, the extent and degree of cloud coverage typically determine its usability, especially in the tropics. In this study, scene-based metadata from the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat inventories, ten-day, monthly, seasonal, and annual acquisition probabilities (AP) of targeted images at various cloud coverage thresholds (10% to 100%) were statistically analyzed using available Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI observations over mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) from 1986 to 2015. Four significant results were found. First, the cumulative average acquisition probability of available Landsat observations over MSEA at the 30% cloud cover (CC) threshold was approximately 41.05%. Second, monthly and ten-day level probability statistics for the 30% CC threshold coincide with the temporal distribution of the dry and rainy seasons. This demonstrates that Landsat images acquired during the dry season satisfy the requirements needed for land cover monitoring. Third, differences in acquisition probabilities at the 30% CC threshold are different between the western and eastern regions of MSEA. Finally, the ability of TM, ETM+, and OLI to acquire high-quality imagery has gradually enhanced over time, especially during the dry season, along with consequently larger probabilities at lower CC thresholds.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel Faster R-CNN based method to detect multiscale objects in very high resolution optical remote sensing images. Firstly, a pre-trained CNN is used to extract features from an input image; and then a set of object candidates are generated. To efficiently detect objects with various scales, we design a hierarchical selective filtering (HSF) layer to map features in different scales to the same scale space. The HSF layer can be applied on both region proposal and the subsequent detection network. More importantly, it can be plugged into Faster RCNN network without modifying its architecture, meanwhile boosting the performance on detecting objects with varying scales. The proposed model can be trained in an end-to-end manner. We test our network on three datasets containing different multiscale objects, including airplanes, ships and buildings, which are collected from Google Earth images and GaoFen-2 images. Experiments demonstrate high precision and robustness of our method.

AB  - We propose a new framework of systematic fracture mapping and major calving event prediction for Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS), Antarctica using multisource satellite data, including optical imagery, SAR imagery, altimetric data, and stereo mapping imagery. 2D mapping of fractures in FRIS is conducted using optical and SAR images and 3D information of two large rifts, Rift 1 and 2, are extracted from ZY-3 and WorldView-2 stereo images as well as ICESat data. Based on the results of the 2D and 3D fracture mapping, the spatial and temporal pattern of the overall fracture changes and large rift evolution are estimated and analyzed. The overall fracture observations do not seem to suggest immediate significant impacts on the stability of the shelf. However, the most active regional fracturing activities occurred at the front of Filchner Ice Shelf. The fracture mapping results can be used to improve the reliability of ice shelf modeling and as support for further analyses of ice shelf stability.

TI  - Automatic near real-time flood detection using Suomi-NPP/VIIRS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real-time satellite-derived flood maps are invaluable to river forecasters and decision-makers for disaster monitoring and relief efforts. With support from the JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, flood detection software has been developed using Suomi-NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) imagery to automatically generate near real-time flood maps for National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFC) in the USA. The software, which is called VIIRS NOAA GMU Flood Version 1.0 (hereafter referred to as VNG Flood V1.0), consists of a series of algorithms that include water detection, cloud shadow removal, terrain shadow removal, minor flood detection, water fraction retrieval, and floodwater determination. The software is designed for flood detection in any land region between 80 degrees S and 80 degrees N, and it has been running routinely with direct broadcast SNPP/VIIRS data at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW/SSEC) and the Geographic Information Network of Alaska at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks (UAF/GINA) since 2014. Near real-time flood maps are distributed via the Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM), reviewed by river forecasters in AWIPS-II (the second generation of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) and applied in flood operations. Initial feedback from operational forecasters on the product accuracy and performance has been largely positive. The software capability has also been extended to areas outside of the USA via a case-driven mode to detect major floods all over the world. Offline evaluation efforts include the visual inspection of over 10,000 VIIRS false-color composite images, an inter-comparison with MODIS automatic flood products and a quantitative validation using Landsat imagery. The steady performance from the 3-year routine process and the promising evaluation results indicate that VNG Flood V1.0 has a high feasibility for flood detection at the product level.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From Landsat-8 Data With the Generalized Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from Landsat-8 data using the generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm. First, radiative transfer modeling experiment is conducted using the moderate spectral resolution atmospheric transmittance algorithm and computer model fed with SeeBor V5.0 atmospheric profile database to build a data set of LST related to brightness temperatures in Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) bands 10 and 11, land surface emissivities (LSEs), and total precipitable water (TPW). Then, the GSW algorithm's coefficients are obtained through linear regression, in which the simulated data are grouped into several sub-ranges to improve the accuracy. The impacts of noise equivalent temperature difference and uncertainty of LSEs and TPW on derived LST are evaluated. Next, the TIRS channels 10 and 11 are inter-calibrated against the channels of infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer on board Metop-B. After that, LST is retrieved from the re-calibrated and clear sky Landsat-8 data using the GSW algorithm, where LSEs are estimated from the measurements of operational land imager on Landsat-8 by the modified normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based emissivity method, and TPW is extracted from the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts reanalysis data. Finally, the retrieved LST is cross-validated with the MOD11_L2 V6 product. The results show that the GSW algorithm can accurately retrieve LST from Landsat-8 data, and errors mainly come from the uncertainty of LSEs and TPW. Against the MOD11_L2 V6 product, the LST errors are -1.45 +/- 0.80 K and -0.49 +/- 0.78 K before and after the correction of LSEs and TPW, respectively.

AB  - Crop phenology information is an important agricultural information which can offer key references for agricultural production, field management, and planning decisions. Generally, it is also considered as an important parameter for crop models. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to understand the features of phenological changes in estimating and forecasting crop production, monitoring and protecting the ecological environment. In the past three decades, the development of remote sensing technology has provided a new means for phenological monitoring and research. The vegetation index (VI) produced by remote sensing data can accurately reflect the vegetation coverage information, which provides conditions for the use of remote sensing to monitor plant phenology. For regional scale, dynamic threshold is the most commonly used method. However, the value of dynamic threshold is usually determined by empirical value, which is lack of quantitative determination method. An improved method based on dynamic threshold method to extract the spatial and temporal pattern evolution of winter wheat SGS and EGS in the North China Plain by using MODIS EVI 8-day time series data and ground-observed phenology calendar data was provided. The regression model of threshold and phenological parameters was constructed based on the relationship between threshold value and corresponding date. The accuracy of the simulated phenological parameters, including the start time of growing season (SGS) and the end time of growing season (EGS), was verified by the ground observation phenological data. The results show that both SGS and EGS had a significant correlation with threshold value for winter wheat. The result of the accuracy verification shows that the phenological parameters for remote sensing inversion using this method have appropriate reliability and can replace the ground observation data. Finally, according to the threshold values determined by this method, spatial maps of the phenological parameter in the study area were generated.

TI  - Change detection: how has urban expansion in Buenos Aires metropolitan region affected croplands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland is one of the essential elements of our ecological systems for producing agricultural products. In developing countries, urban expansion is a frequently appearing phenomena, which is a type of land cover land use (LCLU) change. This change can drastically alter the features on the land surface including croplands. It can lead to detrimental consequences which has considerable effects on the social-ecological systems when croplands are lost. Argentina is an extremely agricultural intense developing country, and Buenos Aires province is a top agricultural production site and has been urbanizing during the last 30 years. Thus studying and analyzing the metropolitan area of this province will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between urban expansion and its effect on croplands. So far, no research has used measurable quantitative methodologies on the Buenos Aires metropolitan region (BAMR) to reveal the relationship between urbanization and cropland. By using 30-meter resolution Landsat images of June 1985 and July 2015, this study finds urban land has expanded from 937.16 km(2) to 1835.47 km(2), and 30.28% of the new urban lands comes from existing croplands.

AB  - In this study, we use sunphotometer (AERONET) data as reference to evaluate MODIS, Himawari-08, and MERRA-2 aerosol products over China. AERONET data from Beijing, Xianghe, Xuzhou, Taihu and Hong Kong are used. The results indicate that aerosol optical depths (AODs) obtained from MODIS, Himawari-08, and MERRA-2 from 2015-2017 over China are consistent with the AERONET observations. The accuracy of these AOD products shows a spatial and temporal variation. MODIS aerosol products tend to overestimate the AODs at Beijing, Xianghe and Xuzhou, with stronger overestimation in winter. For Taihu and Hong Kong, MODIS only overestimates the AODs in winter. Himawari-08 and MERRA-2 underestimate the AODs in autumn over almost all stations except Taihu.

TI  - An Improved Superpixel-Level CFAR Detection Method for Ship Targets in High-Resolution SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve efficient ship detection in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar images, an improved superpixel-level constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection method is proposed with three modifications. First, the weighted information entropy (WIE) describes the statistical characteristics of superpixels, yielding a better distinction between target and clutter superpixels. Second, a two-stage CFAR detection scheme is proposed to detect target superpixels, including global detection and local detection. Specifically, the WIE-based global detector is utilized to prescreen candidate target superpixels (CTSs) and then the local CFAR detector is adaptively conducted over the selected CTSs to refine target superpixels. Third, the superpixels selected by the global detection can be excluded as outliers for clutter estimation, thus the disturbance from adjacent targets in multitarget situations can be reduced and more accurate detection results can be obtained. Compared with CFAR methods implemented with the sliding window technique, the computational burden of the proposed method is significantly reduced without loss of detection performance. Experiments of ship detection on three TerraSAR-X datasets are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the only in-orbit civilian SAR satellite of China. The satellite is specially designed for ocean observation. The coherence is not exclusively considered during satellite designing phase. In this paper, we conduct the preliminary coherence assessment of GF-3 SAR data. Decoherence sources of GF-3 consists of seven components. Baseline decoherence, signal-to-noise decoherence as well as the volume decoherence affects the coherence severely. While the last four components, i.e., volume decoherence, ambiguity decoherence, Doppler spectral decoherence and processing decoherence contributes to the coherence values slightly. We select 13 pairs of GF-3 SAR data and analyze the coherence. Results of the selected data show that the coherence values after multi-looking, flattening, elevation phase removal and filtering exceed 0.4 even at the dessert regions, making it potential in InSAR related applications such as DEM generation and deformation monitoring.

AB  - High-resolution remote sensing satellites produce many images with different angles during the shooting process. Some of the angular images are labeled, but more are not labeled. How to use these labeled images to classify images of other different angles is a problem that needs to be solved. In view of this, we proposes an unsupervised DA approach by aligning tensor subspace and combining multi-angular images. The source subspace is aligned to the target subspace so that the source domain sample probability distribution is close to the target domain sample. Using images from different angles as source domains can make full use of their similarities and differences to achieve better classification results. To verify the effectiveness of this method, this paper conducts a set of five angular images taken by WorldView-2 satellites. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively distribute the source image group close to the target image distribution and achieve better classification.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a promising approach for the estimation of ground-level PM2.5. In this paper, a deep learning framework for satellite-based PM2.5 estimation is presented. Taking advantage of multi-layer learning and layer-by-layer pre-training, deep learning has the great potential to mine nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and satellite observations. Firstly, the presented deep learning framework can be employed to estimate ground PM2.5 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD). Secondly, the AOD products are retrieved from satellite top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. The deep learning framework can further be adopted to estimate ground PM2.5 directly from satellite TOA reflectance. The presented framework was tested for AOD-based PM2.5 estimation in China and reflectance-based PM2.5 estimation across Wuhan Metropolitan Area, respectively. The results show that the deep learning framework achieves an outstanding performance for both AOD-based and reflectance-based PM2.5 estimation. This study provides an effective way for the satellite-based estimation of PM2.5.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial Variability of Land Surface Variables for ET Estimation: Case Study in HiWATER Campaign
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterogeneity, including the inhomogeneity of landscapes and surface variables, significantly affects the accuracy of evapotranspiration (ET) (or latent heat flux, LE) estimated from remote sensing satellite data. However, most of the current research uses statistical methods in the mixed pixel to correct the ET or LE estimation error, and there is a lack of research from the perspective of the remote sensing model. The method of using frequency distributions or generalized probability density functions (PDFs), which is called the statistical-dynamical approach to describe the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics, is a good way to solve the problem. However, in attempting to produce an efficient PDF-based parameterization of remotely sensed ET or LE, first and foremost, it is necessary to systematically understand the variables that are most consistent with the heterogeneity (i.e., variability for a fixed target area or landscape, where the variation in the surface parameter value is primarily concerned with the PDF-based model) of surface turbulence flux. However, the use of PDF alone does not facilitate direct comparisons of the spatial variability of surface variables. To address this issue, the objective of this study is to find an indicator based on PDF to express variability of surface variables. We select the dimensionless or dimensional consistent coefficient of variation (CV), Gini coefficient and entropy to express variability. Based on the analysis of simulated data and field experimental data, we find that entropy is more stable and accurate than the CV and Gini coefficient for expressing the variability of surface variables. In addition, the results of the three methods show that the variability of the leaf area index (LAI) is greater than that of the land surface temperature (LST). Our results provide a suitable method for comparing the variability of different variables.

TI  - The influence of image sensor irradiation damage on the tracking and pointing accuracy of optical communication system
T2  - YOUNG SCIENTISTS FORUM 2017
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Young Scientists Forum
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The image sensor in satellite optical communication system may generate noise due to space irradiation damage, leading to deviation for the determination of the light spot centroid. Based on the irradiation test data of CMOS devices, simulated defect spots in different sizes have been used for calculating the centroid deviation value by grey-level centroid algorithm. The impact on tracking & pointing accuracy of the system has been analyzed. The results show that both the amount and the position of irradiation-induced defect pixels contribute to spot centroid deviation. And the larger spot has less deviation. At last, considering the space radiation damage, suggestions are made for the constraints of spot size selection.

AB  - Data assimilation of satellite microwave sounders are very important for numerical weather prediction. Fengyun-3 (FY-3) polar satellites carry two such sounders: MicroWave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) and MicroWave Humidity Sounder (MWHS). The microwave observations should be quality-controlled before assimilation and rain check is one of the crucial steps. Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI), on board FY-3 too, can provide useful rain information due to more sensitive to precipitation than sounders. A remapping methodology is described in this paper to make full use of data from sounders and imager simultaneously. Observations and products from MWRI can thus be remapped to field of view of sounders. Comprehensive information obtained in this way can be used to not only assimilation in numerical weather prediction models but also satellite observations quality monitoring.

M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation growth has been profoundly affected by global climate change. It is important to investigate vegetation responses to climatic factors and vegetation trends with remote sensing data. In this study, we explored the responses of global vegetation to 3 climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) and global vegetation trends based on the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) dataset from 1982 to 2010. The main findings are: (i) the vegetation responses to temperature and precipitation have no apparent time-lag and the vegetation response to the solar radiation has a time-lag of 1 month in most places in the northern hemisphere; (ii) the driving factor of the growth of vegetation was air temperature, followed by precipitation and solar radiation; (iii) the closest relationships between vegetation and climatic factors were observed in mixed forest, deciduous needleleaf forest, and shrublands at northern mid- and high-latitude; (iv) a map of global vegetation trends from 1982 to 2010 was derived, and showed that the proportion of vegetated pixels with significant increasing and decreasing trends was 34.73% and 6.59% (p<0.05), respectively; (v) more reasonable vegetation trends can be obtained from the GLASS LAI dataset in the perennial cloud-covered regions.

TI  - Chlorophyll fluorescence observed by OCO-2 is strongly related to gross primary productivity estimated from flux towers in temperate forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) opens a new perspective on the monitoring of vegetation photosynthesis from space, and has been recently used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). However, previous studies on SIF were mainly based on satellite observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and the evaluation of these coarse-resolution SIF measurements using GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers has been hindered by the scale mismatch between satellite and tower footprints. We use new far-red SIF observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) with much finer spatial resolution and GPP data from EC flux towers from 2014 to 2016 to examine the relationship between GPP and SIF for temperate forests. The OCO-2 SIF tracked tower GPP well, and had strong correlation with tower GPP at both retrieval bands (757 nm and 771 nm) and both instantaneous (mid-day) and daily timescales, with the strongest relationship for the 757 nm band (SIF757) at the daily timescale. Daily SIF757 exhibited much stronger correlation with tower GPP compared to the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the surface reflectance product derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard either Terra or Aqua satellite and had a similarly strong relationship as EVI based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrected reflectance product (MCD43A4) based on data from both Terra and Aqua. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) explained 85% of the variance in SIF757, while the product of APAR and two environmental scalars - fT(min) and fVPD (representing minimum temperature stress and water stress) explained higher variance (92%) in SIF757. This suggests that SIF mainly depends on APAR and is also affected by environmental stresses that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency. The BRDF-corrected EVI also has advantages over SIF in that EVI has spatially and temporally continuous coverage and has a much longer record (2000-present). The OCO-2 SIF757 estimated GPP well (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.0001; RMSE = 1.11 gC m(-2) d(-1)), and its performance was comparable to or slightly better than that of the MODIS GPP algorithm, a GPP model based on the light use efficiency logic. With intensive OCO-2 observations acquired in the Target mode around Park Falls, a calibration/validation site for OCO-2, we also generated gridded SIF and then estimated GPP on a per-pixel basis at the landscape scale. Our findings demonstrate the strong ability of chlorophyll fluorescence observed by OCO-2 in estimating GPP for temperate forests and reveal its potential and limitations in future ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling studies.

TI  - Comparison of the Spatial Characteristics of Four Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index Products over China: Direct Validation and Relative Uncertainties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key input for many land surface models, ecological models, and yield prediction models. In order to make the model simulation and/or prediction more reliable and applicable, it is crucial to know the characteristics and uncertainties of remotely sensed LAI products before they are input into models. In this study, we conducted a comparison of four global remotely sensed LAI productsGlobal Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), Global LAI Product of Beijing Normal University (GLOBALBNU), Global LAI Map of Chinese Academy of Sciences (GLOBMAP), and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) LAI, while the former three products are newly developed by three Chinese research groups on the basis of the MODIS land reflectance product over China between 2001 and 2011. Direct validation by comparing the four products to ground LAI observations both globally and over China demonstrates that GLASS LAI shows the best performance, with R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 0.96 globally and R-2 = 0.94 and RMSE = 0.61 over China; MODIS performs worst (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 1.23 globally and R-2 = 0.03, RMSE = 2.12 over China), and GLOBALBNU and GLOBMAP performs moderately. Comparison of the four products shows that they are generally consistent with each other, giving the smallest spatial correlation coefficient of 0.7 and the relative standard deviation around the order of 0.3. Compared with MODIS LAI, GLOBALBNU LAI is the most similar, followed by GLASS LAI and GLOBMAP. Large differences mainly occur in southern regions of China. LAI difference analysis indicates that evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), woody savannas (SAV) biome types and temperate dry hot summer, temperate warm summer dry winter and temperate hot summer no dry season climate types correspond to high standard deviation, while ENF and grassland (GRA) biome types and temperate warm summer dry winter and cold dry winter warm summer climate types are responsible for the large relative standard deviation of the four products. Our results indicate that although the three newly developed products have improved the accuracy of LAI estimates, much work remains to improve the LAI products especially in ENF, SAV, and GRA regions and temperate climate zones. Findings from our study can provide guidance to communities regarding the performance of different LAI products over mainland China.

The results show that : (1) The coupling simulation precision was inferior to the pre-coupled simulation precision at field scale simulation.(2) When the grid was used for regional scale simulation, the simulation accuracy of 1 km resolution grid point is higher than 5km resolution.(3) At two kinds of grid resolutions, EnKF assimilation simulation has the highest accuracy, followed by the driving method, and the simulation precision before coupling is the lowest. The RMSE of the total output of the EnKF assimilation simulation area and the actual total output at the 1 km resolution grid is 15.1. Assimilation of remote sensing information at fine grid resolution can improve the precision of regionalization application of the WheatSM model.

The trends of AOD and trop O-3 over Pearl River Delta, -0.0076/year and 0.2454 DU/year, respectively, are significant at 0.05 level. There is a high and significant negative correlation between trop NO2 and trop O-3, and a significant positive correlation between trop O-3 and AOD. More study is still ongoing.

AB  - Aqua MODIS is the second MODIS instrument of NASA's Earth Observation System and has operated for over sixteen years since its launch in 2002. MODIS has sixteen thermal emissive bands (TEBs) located on two separate cold focal plane assemblies (CFPA). The TEBs are calibrated every scan using observations of an onboard blackbody (BB) and a space view port. Low saturation temperatures (Tsat) of Aqua MODIS bands 33, 35, and 36 cause these bands to saturate when the BB temperature is higher than their Tsat values during a BB warm-up cool-down (WUCD) cycle, therefore impacting the ability to perform nominal calibration. In addition, starting from around 2006, the CFPA temperature showed gradual variation from its nominally-controlled operating temperature due to a loss of its radiative cooler margin and the magnitude of its fluctuation reaching a maximum in 2013. The MODIS Characterization Support Team currently uses a correction that is dependent on the CFPA temperature to provide a gain estimate for the saturated scans during the BB WUCD. This gain estimation has been implemented in the Aqua MODIS Collection 6 (C6) and C6.1 L1B products. This paper evaluates the quality of the calibrated radiance of Aqua MODIS bands 33, 35, and 36 using simultaneous nadir observations from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), which is also onboard the Aqua satellite. Our analysis results show that the differences between AIRS and Aqua MODIS can be controlled well within the fluctuation range compared to the periods when the BB signals for these bands are not saturated.

AB  - In this paper, a unified framework was applied to derive compact polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) features under general transmit and linear receive polarization conditions. Following the rationale of polarization signature, the characteristics of features derived by transmission of variant roll angles and ellipticity are analyzed. Statistical distance was proposed to quantitatively measure the performance of these compact polarimetric SAR features on marine oil spill classification. Experiment was conducted on a Radarsat-2 quad-pol SAR scene acquired during a controlled oil-on-water exercise.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in a large reservoir as derived from Landsat 8 OLI data: understanding its driving and restrictive factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chla) is an important indicator of water quality and eutrophication status. Monitoring Chla concentration (C-Chla ) and understanding the interactions between C-Chla and related environmental factors (hydrological and meteorological conditions, nutrients enrichment, etc.) are necessary for assessing and managing water quality and eutrophication. An acceptable Landsat 8 OLI-based empirical algorithm for C-Chla has been developed and validated, with a mean absolute percentage error of 14.05% and a root mean square error of 1.10 mu g L-1. A time series of remotely estimated C-Chla was developed from 2013 to 2015 and examined the relationship of C (Chla) to inflow rate, rainfall, temperature, and sunshine duration. Spatially, C (Chla) values in the riverine zone were higher than in the transition and lacustrine zones. Temporally, mean C-Chla value were ranked as spring > summer > autumn > winter. A significant positive correlation [Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = 0.88, p < 0.001] was observed between the inflow rate and mean C-Chla in the northwest segment of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir. However, no significant relation was observed between mean C-Chla and meteorological conditions. Mean (+/- standard deviation) value for the ratio of total nitrogen concentration to total phosphorus concentration in our in situ dataset is 75.75 +/- 55.72. This result supports that phosphorus is the restrictive factor to algal growth in Xin'anjiang Reservoir. In addition, the response of nutrients to Chla has spatial variabilities. Current results show the potential of Landsat 8 OLI data for estimating Chla in slight turbid reservoir and indicate that external pollution loading is an important driving force for the Chla spatiotemporal variability.

TI  - Performance and Requirements of GEO SAR Systems in the Presence of Radio Frequency Interferences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geosynchronous Synthetic Aperture Radar (GEO SAR) is a possible next generation SAR system, which has the excellent performance of less than one-day revisit and hundreds of kilometres coverage. However, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a serious problem, because the specified primary allocation frequencies are shared by the increasing number of microwave devices. More seriously, as the high orbit of GEO SAR makes the system have a very large imaging swath, the RFI signals all over the illuminated continent will interfere and deteriorate the GEO SAR signal. Aimed at the RFI impact in GEO SAR case, this paper focuses on the performance evaluation and the system design requirement of GEO SAR in the presence of RFI impact. Under the RFI impact, Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and the required power are theoretically deduced both for the ground RFI and the bistatic scattering RFI cases. Based on the theoretical analysis, performance evaluations of the GEO SAR design examples in the presence of RFI are conducted. The results show that higher RFI intensity and lower working frequency will make the GEO SAR have a higher power requirement for compensating the RFI impact. Moreover, specular RFI bistatic scattering will give rise to the extremely serious impact on GEO SAR, which needs incredible power requirements for compensations. At last, real RFI signal behaviours and statistical analyses based on the SMOS satellite, Beidou-2 navigation satellite and Sentinel-1 A data have been given in the appendix.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to use a short time series image data extract the paddy field spatial information effectively. For this purpose, this paper put forward a method of extracting paddy field by combining multi-temporal remote sensing images. In this paper, the Multi-temporal GF-1 of Jiang Ning District in Nanjing where planting a large number of rice was used as the study data. Then the datasets for the rice extraction were constructed with two parts covering the growth cycle of rice, one is the multiband reflectance(MBR) with their derivative features (WDRVI and NDWI) of GF-1 images. Besides, the Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Machine classification approach (PSO-SVM) was introduced to extract paddy field by comparing with the mainstream classifier such as maximum likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF). and Neural Net (NN). The results show that the combination of MBR, NDWI, WDRVI is the best performance in which the rice extraction accuracy reach 93.44 and the average accuracy, overall accuracy and Kappa's coefficient reach 94.42, 94.66 and 92.92 percent respectively. As the results indicated, the method proposed by this paper has a good performance which not only extract the distribution information of rice but also provide the reference value for the classification of other crops of urban agriculture.

Since the launch of FY-3B, MWRI has provided large amount of data and successfully supported applications on land surface parameters estimation. These achievements indicate that FY-3B/MWRI has the potential in vegetation monitoring. In this study, we extended our algorithm for deriving MVIs from AMSR-E to that under FY-3B/MWRI sensor configuration. We hope that this will also contribute to long-term vegetation monitoring combining AMSR-E and AMSR2 data.

TI  - Coherence of Radarsat-2, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-1 PALSAR for monitoring spatiotemporal variations of river ice covers
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring spatiotemporal variations of river ice covers is critical for selecting safe ice transportation routes. The coherence of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) conveys important information on variations of river ice characteristics. However, limited research has been conducted to determine the coherence of multi-frequency L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR, C-band Sentinel-1, and Radarsat-2 images, for such applications. This study was piloted using imagery acquired from the Slave River Delta, Canada, to fill this knowledge gap. The findings were validated using ice core data extracted near Fort Smith. The results indicate that the revisit interval of the satellite is a governing factor of InSAR coherence loss. The ALOS-1 PALSAR images have the smallest coherence mainly due to the 46-day revisit interval and are the least promising for monitoring spatiotemporal variations of river ice covers. Coherence of both Sentinel-1A with a 12-day revisit interval and Radarsat-2 images with a 24-day revisit interval is an important aid for determining safe ice crossings.

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform dedicated to satellite imagery and other Earth observation data. Taking the Landsat TM data as true data, this paper evaluated and analyzed MODIS snow cover products by GEE in snow seasons. Using GEE JavaScript program, we obtain that error rate of MODIS snow cover product, the missing rate during the snow season with finally 88.94% of overall average accuracy in the test sites. The results showed that the GEE platform can be used to assess accurately the snow products with high efficiency.

TI  - A novel approach to leveraging social media for rapid flood mapping: a case study of the 2015 South Carolina floods
T2  - CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid flood mapping is critical for local authorities and emergency responders to identify areas in need of immediate attention. However, traditional data collection practices such as remote sensing and field surveying often fail to offer timely information during or right after a flooding event. Social media such as Twitter have emerged as a new data source for disaster management and flood mapping. Using the 2015 South Carolina floods as the study case, this paper introduces a novel approach to mapping the flood in near real time by leveraging Twitter data in geospatial processes. Specifically, in this study, we first analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of flood-related tweets using quantitative methods to better understand how Twitter activity is related to flood phenomena. Then, a kernel-based flood mapping model was developed to map the flooding possibility for the study area based on the water height points derived from tweets and stream gauges. The identified patterns of Twitter activity were used to assign the weights of flood model parameters. The feasibility and accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing the model output with official inundation maps. Results show that the proposed approach could provide a consistent and comparable estimation of the flood situation in near real time, which is essential for improving the situational awareness during a flooding event to support decision-making.

AB  - A considerable number of environmental pollution problems has emerged due to the extensive and unreasonable GDP growth, especially in the atmosphere, which has become a universal environmental issue. Data released by China's Ministry of Environmental Protection in 2016 showed that almost all emissions in China related to atmospheric pollutants were ranked first in the world. As one of the components of the atmosphere, aerosol is an important factor in assessing the degree of atmospheric pollution. The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a key parameter to characterize the aerosol effect. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of GDP growth on aerosol distribution quantificationally from 2006 to 2016 that integrated MODIS aerosol products and nighttime light data through barycentre theory and Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) model. The results of this study showed that: (1) that the degree of spatial coupling between the barycenter of AOD and GDP was high. Both barycenters were located in the province of Henan, and the longitude shows a consistent pattern of movement; (2) There were two clearly symmetrical "U" distributions in the region where R-2>0.6, and the northeast -southwestern distributions (0.4<R-2<0.5) were distributed between the two "U" types. (3) the GWR model explained the local correlation in the region of 91.36%-92.63% This paper first plotted the spatial distribution of the correlation between GDP and AOD, and proved that the spatial distribution of AOD was closely related with GDP. Our findings do not only provide the deeply understanding the impact of economic development on the atmospheric environment but would also has significant implications for coordinating regional economic development, air pollution control and the formulation of national economic plans.

The vegetation height of a forest environment affects the elevation data of AW3D30 and EU-DEM, with that in mind, we choose to compare the elevation data in forest fire break lines. The two DSMs, AW3D30 and EU-DEM v1.1 published in 2016 and the spatial resolution is 30m for AW3D30 and 25m for EUDEM. For the DEM we created from the topographic maps we used 20m-pixel size. The statistical parameters of the three DEMs have examined in 149 forest fire break lines of total length 187,955.8 km. The study area is located in Chalkidiki a part of the Region of Central Macedonia in Northern Greece.

AB  - Stratified tropospheric delays (TDs) in differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) result from the temporal variation of vertical stratification in the lower part of the troposphere. Although an approximately model can be made by assuming a linear relationship between topography and delayed phase in the interferogram, the estimation is weakened by the spatial variability of troposphere and the interference from other confounding signals (e.g., deformation, topographic error and orbit error, etc.). In this contribution, a jointly tropospheric correction scheme is proposed to simultaneously estimate stratified tropospheric delays with deformation and topographic errors. Spatial variability of tropospheric properties is addressed through a localized estimation which is derived by quadtree segmentation according to height gradient. The performance of the proposed method is validated and compared with the conventional linear and weather-model-based methods using Sentinel-1 dataset.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) estimates scene reflectivity along elevation coordinates, based on multi-baseline measurements. Common TomoSAR approaches are based on every single range-azimuth cell or the cell's neighborhood. By using an additional synthetic aperture for elevation, these techniques have higher resolution power for elevation, to discriminate scatterers with differences in location in the same range-azimuth cell. However, they cannot provide sufficient range resolution power to discriminate these scatterers by joining different spectra to a wider range spectrum, which limits the resolution power of TomoSAR. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed using a compressive sensing (CS) technique to reconstruct range and elevation signals from multi-baseline SAR images. This TomoSAR method not only retrieves the vertical signals but also improves the resolution in the range, which helps improve the resolution power of the TomoSAR technique. We present the theory of the CS-based two-dimensional TomoSAR technique and compare it to the CS-based one-dimensional TomoSAR technique. The excellent resolution power and scatterer localization accuracy of this novel technique are demonstrated using simulations and real data obtained by RADARSAT-2 in Lanzhou, China.

M3  - Article
AB  - Focused on the issue that conventional remote sensing image classification methods have run into the bottlenecks in accuracy, a new remote sensing image classification method inspired by deep learning is proposed, which is based on Stacked Denoising Autoencoder. First, the deep network model is built through the stacked layers of Denoising Autoencoder. Then, with noised input, the unsupervised Greedy layer-wise training algorithm is used to train each layer in turn for more robust expressing, characteristics are obtained in supervised learning by Back Propagation (BP) neural network, and the whole network is optimized by error back propagation. Finally, Gaofen-1 satellite (GF-1) remote sensing data are used for evaluation, and the total accuracy and kappa accuracy reach 95.7% and 0.955, respectively, which are higher than that of the Support Vector Machine and Back Propagation neural network. The experiment results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of remote sensing image classification.

This study, for the first time, investigated the effects of the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data on the performance of cropland classification through the discussing of the performance of different polarimetric SAR parameter sets, and the impact of the timing of RADARSAT-2 datasets in southwestern Ontario. The random forest classifier was adopted due to its excellent ability in crop classification. The results illustrated that the elements of coherency matrix performed the best in agricultural land cover classification. The multi-temporal polarimetric SAR data acquired from the end of June to November gave the best classification accuracy, and an overall accuracy of 90% can be achieved using two images acquired in the middle of September and October. The MNF transformation can further improve the classification accuracy, and this accuracy was competitive with the accuracy produced using the integration of optical and polarimetric SAR data.

TI  - Sensitivity study of Radarsat-2 polarimetric SAR to crop height and fractional vegetation cover of corn and wheat
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing studies have been conducted to investigate the potential of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in crop growth monitoring due to the capability of penetrating the clouds, haze, light rain, and vegetation canopy. This study investigated the sensitivity of 16 parameters derived from C-band Radarsat-2 polarimetric SAR data to crop height and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of corn and wheat. The insitu measured crop height and FVC were collected from 29 April to 30 September 2013, at the study site in southwest Ontario, Canada. A total of 10 Radarsat-2 polarimetric SAR images were acquired throughout the same growing season. It was observed that at the early growing stage, the corn height was strongly correlated with the SAR parameters including HV (R-2 = 0.88), HH-VV (R-2 = 0.84), and HV/VV (R-2 = 0.80), and the corn FVC was significantly correlated with HV (R-2 = 0.79) and HV/VV (R-2 = 0.92), but the correlation became weaker at the later growing stage. The sensitivity of the SAR parameters to wheat variables was very low and only HV and Yamaguchi helix scattering showed relatively good but negative correlations with wheat height (R-2 = 0.57 and R-2 = 0.39) at the middle growing stage. These findings indicated that Radarsat-2 polarimetric SAR (C-band) has a great potential in crop height and FVC estimation for broad-leaf crops, as well as identifying the changes in crop canopy structures and phenology.

TI  - Deep Learning for Fusion of APEX Hyperspectral and Full-Waveform LiDAR Remote Sensing Data for Tree Species Mapping
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has been widely used to fuse multi-sensor data for classification. However, current deep learning architecture for multi-sensor data fusion might not always perform better than single data source, especially for the fusion of hyperspectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data for tree species mapping in complex, closed forest canopies. In this paper, we propose a new deep fusion framework to integrate the complementary information from hyperspectral and LiDAR data for tree species mapping. We also investigate the fusion of either "single-band" or multi-band (i.e., full-waveform) LiDAR with hyperspectral data for tree species mapping. Additionally, we provide a solution to estimate the crown size of tree species by the fusion of multi-sensor data. Experimental results on fusing real APEX hyperspectral and LiDAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep fusion framework. Compared to using only single data source or current deep fusion architecture, our proposed method yields improvements in overall and average classification accuracies ranging from 82.21% to 87.10% and 76.71% to 83.45%, respectively.

AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technology have led to an increased availability of a multitude of satellite and airborne data sources, with increasing resolution. The term resolution here includes spatial and spectral resolutions. Additionally, at lower altitudes, airplanes and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can deliver very high-resolution data from targeted locations. Remote sensing acquisitions employ both passive (optical and thermal range, multispectral, and hyperspectral) and active devices such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Diverse information of the Earth's surface can be obtained from these multiple imaging sources. Optical and SAR characterize the surface of the ground, LiDAR provides the elevation, while multispectral and hyperspectral sensors reveal the material composition. These multisource remote sensing images, once combined/fused together, provide a more comprehensive interpretation of land cover/use (urban and climatic changes), natural disasters (floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes), and potential exploitation (oil fields and minerals). However, automatic interpretation of remote sensing data remains challenging. Two fundamental problems in data fusion of multisource remote sensing images are (1) differences in resolution hamper the ability to fastly interpret multisource remote sensing images and (2) there is no clear methodology yet on combining the diverse information of different data sources. In this chapter, we will introduce our recent solutions for these two problems, with an introduction on signal-level fusion (hyperspectral image pansharpening) first, followed by feature-level fusion (graph-based fusion model for multisource data classification).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many users are now showing strong interest in UAV RS (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing) due to its easy accessibility. UAVs have become popular platforms for remote sensing data acquisition. In a number of practical and time constrained circumstances, UAV RS data have been widely used as a substitute for traditional satellite remote sensing data. However, airspace-related regulations are far behind the rapid growth in the number of UAVs and their wide applications. Much effort of the network-based UAV RS have been made by the UAV RS group of the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGSNRR, CAS), which proposed the concept of UAV RS data carrier. UAV RS data carrier refers to UAV RS data platform with task planning, data storage, image processing, product generation and output products for various UAVs. An ongoing effort to create a nationwide UAV RS network in addition to an existing ground observational network is being carried out in China.

AB  - New approaches in surgical methods and systematic therapy have led to a better prognosis for women including a better quality of life. Modified radical mastectomy, the treatment of choice in breast cancer, tends to be replaced by breast-conservation surgical procedures. Furthermore, the value of axillary lymph node dissection has been questioned. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has contributed in staging of the axilla in order to avoid extensive operations.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Background: Prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (SLN) status after primary systemic therapy (PST) may allow tailored axillary staging. The aim of this analysis was to compare established nomograms from i) the primary operative (n = 6) and ii) the neoadjuvant (n = 1) setting with an optimized nomogram to predict non-SLN status in patients after PST. Methods: 181 patients converting from cN1 prior to PST to ycN0 but found to have a histologically positive SLN in the SENTINA trial were analyzed. Established models were applied. An optimized model was compiled using univariate and subsequent multivariable logistic regression (backward selection, likelihood ratio test). Results: Area-under-the-curve (AUC) values from the primary operative models showed sufficient performance (0.82-0.71). For the neoadjuvant model, the AUC was found to be inferior to prior analyses (0.66) but within published confidence intervals. The SENTINA nomogram comprised the diameter of the largest lymph node (p = 0.006, odds ratio (OR) = 1.19), tumor size prior to PST (p = 0.085, OR = 1.31), and number of all positive SLN (p = 0.083, OR = 2.04). This model was validated using a separate cohort of arm C (n = 168, AUC 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.74-0.85). Conclusion: We validated 7 models of prediction of non-SLN among patients showing axillary conversion through PST. Our own SENTINA nomogram' yielded AUC values comparable to previous nomograms.

AB  - The MetOp-SG satellite program is an EUMETSAT/-ESA cooperation with the objective to obtain long-term collection of remotely sensed data of uniform quality for meteorology and climate monitoring state analysis and forecast. A series of three satellite pairs (MetOp-SG-A1, -A2 and -A3) are to be launched, ensuring continuity of data to beyond 2045.The Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer Next Generation (IASI-NG), being developed by CNES, is one of the instruments on the MetOp-SG-A's. The IASI-NG is a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer scanning the atmosphere to provide data for atmospheric gas characterisation.Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace (KDA) has developed the LAser Source Electronics (LASE) for the IASI-NG instrument. The LASE provides a wavelength-stabilized optical source to be injected into the IASI-NG with a wavelength stability within +/- 0.00015 nm throughout the instrument lifetime. The wavelength is locked and controlled using a feedback-loop containing a gas cell filled with (C2H2)-C-13. The LASE shall in addition perform the conversion of the optical signal from the interferometer into analogue electrical signal which can be further processed. The lifetime includes 15.75 years of storage and 7.75 years in space.The challenge of meeting the required Polarisation Extinction Ratio (PER) for a fiber optical system, as the one in LASE, is discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of tropical coastal land cover and land use changes and their impacts on ecosystem service values
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding about land cover and land use (LCLU) changes, as well as the associated impacts on ecosystem service values (ESV) is extremely important in the management of coastal ecosystems globally. Thus, this study assessed temporal LCLU changes, the underlying socioeconomic drivers and dynamics of ESV in the coastal zone of Tanzania. The LCLU data for 2000 and 2010 were from the Globe Land 30 mapping products at 30-meter spatial resolution developed by National Geomatics Center of China, while 2016 images were produced from Landsat 8. Classification of images was done from Landsat TM/ETM+ for 2000, 2010, and 2016 years complemented with MODIS and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series, and Chinese HJ imagery. LCLU categories and ecosystem service coefficients were used to compute ESV on each LCLU categories. Between 2000 and 2016, farmland, shrub land, waterbody, and artificial surface expanded while forest, grazing land, and wetlands declined. The ESV increased on farmland, shrub land, and waterbody, while the decline was found on forest, grazing land, and wetlands. The ESV and the total population ratios declined from $80.4, 63.8, and $46.0 million in 2000, 2010, and 2016, respectively. Perfect positive correlation was on LCLU change and ESV, population and households in crop farming, livestock keeping, and bioenergy use. Population pressure and socioeconomic activities have amplified the degradation of the coastal ecosystems. If not abetted, there is a danger of further impairments on these ecosystems. We advise to regulate population and socioeconomic activities to avoid more negative impacts of coastal LCLU change.

T2  - Virus (Nagoya)
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is one of the members of the Spondweni serocomplex within the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. The virus was first isolated from a serum specimen from a sentinel non-human primate in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. ZIKV is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus in an urban cycle and maintained in a sylvatic cycle between Aedes mosquitoes and monkeys in Africa and Asia. Initially, the virus was thought to cause only mild and nonspecific clinical symptoms in humans. However, ZIKV became a serious public health concern in recent years due to an association with congenital malformation known as microcephaly in newborns as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurologic disorders in adults. The severe nature of complications of ZIKV infection have led to an urgent need for a safe and effective vaccine worldwide including Japan. The first large outbreak of disease caused by ZIKV infection was reported from the island of Yap, Micronesia in 2007. It was followed by outbreaks in French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Ester Island, and New Caledonia in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, ZIKV outbreak was reported in Brazil and has spread across the Latin America, and the Caribbean. The exact prevalence of ZIKV infection has not been reported because of the absence of a standardized protocol for differential diagnosis and its clinical resemblance to dengue virus and other flavivirus infections. In Japan, the first human case of ZIK fever, who developed illness soon after returning from French Polynesia, was reported in 2013, and until 2017, 20 imported cases were documented. Currently, research on ZIKV has progressed remarkably thus this article aims to review recent progress in virology, epidemiology, and pathology of ZIKV infection.

AB  - In this article, we analyze Haruki Murakami’s latest novel Killing Commendatore  from the perspective of music. “Killing Commendatore” is a picture portrayed by Tomohiko Ameda based on Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni. Mozart’s worldview, which is described through Don Giovanni, is reflected in not only pictures but also the world of the novel. The main character “I” sees the picture “Killing Commendatore,” sharing the space where the great painter stayed and inheriting Ameda’s violent memory. At the same time, while depicting a portray of Wataru Menshiki, “I” is aware of his lurking violence.Killing Commendatore can be regarded as a work which expresses Haruki Murakami’s sense of conflict which he has felt as a post-war writer, such as historical violence like wars and individual violence. As in the cases of characters that have been described in his previous works, the main character of the present novel is described as an individual who possesses violence and a conflict about it as well as otherworldly trips. In Killing Commendatore, however, a child of the main character is introduced, unlike Murakami’s previous works. In this article, we analyse the way in which the concept of music, a distinctive feature of Murakami’s works, is connected to the aforementioned change and it affects the main character

TI  - Western striped squirrel Tamiops mcclellandii: A non-avian sentinel species of bird waves.
T2  - Raffles Bulletin of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of "avian sentinels" in bird waves (mixed-species foraging flocks), which mob or alarm-call in response to predators, is widely recognised. Yet in the highly threatened lowland deciduous forests of South-east Asia, a mammal, the western striped squirrel Tamiops mcclellandii, which usually accompanied bird-waves, was a more obtrusive sentinel than any bird. It called most often in response to predators (40 out of 70 observations) and was the first species to emit alarm calls on 24 occasions (60%) where studied in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, western Thailand. The squirrels fed in close proximity to drongos (Dicrurus spp.), suggesting they may benefit from the drongos' tendency to mob predators. Additionally, the drongos actively followed the bark-foraging squirrels in order to capture flushed arthropods. The presence of the western striped squirrel both helped reduce the need for vigilance among avian flock members and contributed to flock cohesion.

AB  - This paper explores the feasibility of deriving multispectral-based effective chlorophyll indicators (MECIs) for foliage chlorophyll concentration (CHLS) estimation. An average fusion method was applied to simulate the multispectral reflectance of the WorldView-3 sensor using hyperspectral data. With the experimental data of CHLS and predictors derived from multispectral reflectance, a series of linear regression analyses were carried out to derive appropriate models for CHLS estimation. Accuracy measures of RMSE and PRMSE were used to evaluate the model performance. Results showed that the coastal-band based MECI (MECIc) and the blue-band based MECI (MECIb) were able to achieve an RMSE of 0.5657 mg/g and 0.5943 mg/g as well as a PRMSE of 36% and 38% respectively. Using the Red edge and Yellow reflectance based NDVI (NDVIREY) as a predictor, the model can reduce uncertainty and achieve an estimation of 0.4089 mg/g and 26% for RMSE and PRMSE respectively. The prediction error made by the CHLS-NDVIREY model and the CHLS-MECI model were 11% and 60% larger than 0.38 mg/g the RMSE of hyperspectral-based CHLS-ECI model. In summary, NDVIREY was able to achieve a better prediction at around a level of 75% accuracy (1-PRMSE) and therefore is able to be an effective indicator of CHLS for forest monitoring.

TI  - Consumption of fruit and vegetables might mitigate the adverse effects of ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> on lung function among adults
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence on the effects of ambient PM2.5 on lung function is limited among adults and the effect modification by dietary fruit and vegetables remains largely unknown.Methods: We interviewed 29,032 participants aged 50 years and older from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health. Annual average PM2.5 levels were estimated for each community using satellite data. We applied multi-level linear regressions to examine the association between ambient PM2.5 and lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1-sec (FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and forced expiratory flow between 25th and 75th percentiles of FVC (FEF25-75)).Results: We found that ambient PM2.5 was associated with lower lung functions. Each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 corresponded to reductions of 123.58 ml in FVC (95% CI: -185.21, -61.95), 126.64 ml in FEV1 (95% CI: -186.04, -67.23) and 178.93 ml/s FEV25-75 (95% CI: -249.20, -108.66). Lower effect estimates were observed among those with higher consumption of fruit and vegetables.Conclusion: Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM2.5 might be one risk factor of reduced lung function in adults and that higher consumption of fruit and vegetables may mitigate this effect.

AB  - Superpixel segmentation has been commonly used in various image processing tasks such as object detection and image classification. In this paper, we propose a novel superpixel segmentation method based on a new distance function and superpixel seed updating strategy for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. We initialize superpixel seeds with an expected number of superpixels. Then, we iteratively cluster the pixels based on the distance function and update the superpixel seeds based on the updating strategy. When the termination condition is reaches, we stop the iteration and obtain the superpixels. The experimental results based on RADARSAT-2 data demonstrate that our method is effective and achieves a better tradeoff between boundary adherence and compactness.

TI  - Evolution pattern of ecosystem and its driving mechanism in Urban Agglomerat ion in Fujian Delta Region
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological security is one of the fundamental guarantees for the social and economic sustainable development of urban agglomeration. However, nowadays the ecological security of urban agglomeration is greatly threatened. According to land cover/ecosystem types extracted from Landsat TM/ETM+OLI in 2000, 2005 and 2010, combined with analysis of social and economic factors, the evolution pattern and driving mechanism of ecosystems in Urban Agglomeration in Fujian Delta Region were analyzed from the dimensions of area change, type shift and spatial pat. tern of ecosystems in this study. The results showed that the area of urban ecosystem presented positive growth from 2000 to 2015, while the forest and farmland ecosystem were in negative growth, and the shrub, wetland, grassland and other ecosystems remained relatively stable. The area proportion of ecosystems was in the order of forest > farmland > urban > shrub > wetland > grassland > other ecosystems. The intensity of mutual transfer of ecosystem was weak from 2000 to 2005, but strong from 2005 to 2010 with the input of urban ecosystem and the output of other ecosystems being the largest during this period. The intensity was still strong from 2010 to 2015 with both the largest output of other ecosystem and the largest input of forest ecosystem. From 2000 to 2015, the forest ecosystem was distributed unevenly in different regions, while the farm. land and urban ecosystems were mainly distributed in the central and eastern Urban Agglomeration in Fujian Delta Region, and the distribution of wetlands was consistent with that of rivers; the grassland, shrub and other ecosystems were in scatted distribution. At the same time, the landscape pattern was basically stable without significant changes in patch number, patch density and clustering characteristics, but there were significant differences among different ecosystems. The spatial pattern of ecosystems in the Urban Agglomeration in Fujian Delta Region was basically stable from 2000 to 2015, while the different ecosystems were in unbalanced changes, and the transfer intensity of various ecosystems in different periods was significantly distinct from each other. The economic and industrial development, urbanization, and urban pattern change significantly affected the pattern evolution of the ecosystems, especially forest, farmland and urban eco-systems.

TI  - Shared Decision Making among Children with Medical Complexity: Results from a Population-Based Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To compare the rates of shared decision making (SDM) reported by parents of children with medical complexity (CMC) with the rates of SDM reported by parents of noncomplex children with special health care needs (CSHCN).Study design We examined the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a representative survey of 40 242 parents of CSHCN. CMC was defined as needing or using more medical care than usual, seeing 2 or more subspecialists, and positive response on at least 3 other items on the CSHCN screener. We identified 3 subgroups each of CMC and noncomplex CSHCN by sentinel diagnoses: asthma, seizures, and other diagnoses. SDM was defined as a binary composite variable, derived from 4 discrete items. We constructed 4 stepwise multivariable models to assess the relative odds of SDM, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics (age, income, language, race, ethnicity, and marital status), behavioral comorbidity, family-centered care, and patient-centered medical home.Results The study population included 39 876 respondents. Compared with noncomplex CSHCN, CMC had a lower likelihood of SDM (aOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91), which persisted in diagnostic subgroups: CMC with asthma (aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.92) and CMC with other diagnoses (aOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.94), but not CMC with seizures (aOR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59-1.51).Conclusions SDM is less common for CSHCN with complex needs than those without complex needs. Health system interventions targeting future-oriented care planning may improve SDM for CMC.

AB  - Pollution is one of the main negative outcomes for rapid economic growth without sustainable development in China. Different types of pollutions are harming people's health and the impacts of pollution on environment and people's health could last for decades. Fine particulate matter(PM2.5), which is one of most common types of air pollutions in China, could penetrate and sediment in human's respiratory system and cause different kind of respiratory diseases. Research has shown the strong association between Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and PM2.5. For this reason, remote sensing imagery could be used to estimate the level of PM2.5 concentration near ground. With utilizing PM2.5 dataset estimated by Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and machine learning approach, this paper is aimed to provide spatiotemporal comparison of PM2.5 concentrations in China. Result from this analysis could help people to better understand the recent history and current status of PM2.5 pollution in China.

TI  - Land use and landscape pattern changes of Weihai, China based on object-oriented SVM classification from Landsat MSS/TM/OLI images
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Weihai's urban development model is representative of coastal cities in China. Landsat MSS/TM/OLI images were used to extract the land use types of Weihai from 1985-2015 using the object-oriented support vector machine (SVM) classification method. The landscape pattern indexes were calculated based on the classification results of land use. The temporal and spatial characteristics of land use and landscape pattern were analyzed by considering Weihai's economic development. The overall kappa (OK) coefficients were greater than 83% and the overall accuracy (OA) values were greater than 85%. Over 80% of both producer's accuracy (PA) and user's accuracy (UA) values of different land use types were greater than 85%. Changes in land use and landscape patterns were closely related to the local economic development. The areas of cultivated land and woodland continued to decrease. The expansion of construction land came mainly from the cultivated land and woodland as with as very little from waters. Under the combined effect of economic development and human activities, the landscape pattern of Weihai as a whole has been decentralized. The internal structure is relatively complex and the fragmentation of land use is increasing. The development model of Weihai is the expansion-aggregation-expansion.

AB  - Melanoma and breast cancer (BC) patients face a high risk of recurrence and disease progression after curative surgery and/or therapeutic treatment. Monitoring for minimal residual disease (MRD) during a disease-free follow-up period would greatly improve patient outcomes through earlier detection of relapse or treatment resistance. However, MRD monitoring in solid tumors such as melanoma and BC are not well established. Here, we discuss the clinical applications of MRD monitoring in melanoma and BC patients and highlight the current approaches for detecting MRD in these solid tumors.

TI  - Effects of sediments and coloured dissolved organic matter on remote sensing of chlorophyll-a using Landsat TM/ETM plus over turbid waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of chlorophyll-a is challenging in water containing inorganic suspended sediments (i.e. non-volatile suspended solids, NVSS) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The effects of NVSS and CDOM on empirical remote-sensing estimates of chlorophyll-a in inland waters have not been determined on a broad spatial and temporal scale. This study evaluated these effects using a long-term (1989-2012) data set that included chlorophyll-a, NVSS, and CDOM from 39 reservoirs across Missouri (USA). Model comparisons indicated that the machine-learning algorithm BRT (boosted regression trees, validation Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient = 0.350) was better than linear regression (validation Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient = 0.214) for chlorophyll-a estimate using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Only a small proportion of BRT model residuals could be explained by sediments or CDOM, and the observed trends in BRT residuals were different from the theoretical effects expected from NVSS and CDOM. Our results also indicated a small systematic bias by the BRT model, but it was not likely caused by NVSS or CDOM.

TI  - A web-based land surface remote sensing products validation system (LAPVAS): application to albedo product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Quantitative remote sensing product (QRSP) validation is a complex process to assess the accuracy and uncertainty independently using reference data with multiple land cover types and long-time series. A web-based system named as LAnd surface remote sensing Product VAlidation system (LAPVAS) is described in this paper, which is used to implement the QRSPs validation process automatically. The LAPAVS has two subsystems, the Validation Databases Subsystem and the Accuracy Evaluation Subsystem. Three functions have been implemented by the two subsystems for a comprehensive QRSP validation: (1) a standardized processing of reference data and storage of these data in validation databases; (2) a consistent and comprehensive validation procedure to assess the QRSPs' accuracy and uncertainty; and (3) a visual process customization tool with which the users can register new validation data, host new reference data, and readjust the validation workflows for the QRSP accuracy assessment. In LAPVAS, more than 100 GB of reference data warehoused in validation databases for 13 types of QRSPs' validation. One of the key QRSPs, land surface albedo, is selected as an example to illustrate the application of LAPVAS. It is demonstrated that the LAPVAS has a good performance in the land surface remote sensing product validation.

AB  - Not only the urbanization development but also its ecological process lays emphasis on the Impervious Surface Area (ISA) extraction, whereas, the ISA extraction from high-resolution images is challenging for both the phenomenon of the mixed pixels and shadow effects. To solve the problem, a Multi-Source Dictionary Sparse Representation Classification (MSD-SRC) method using WorldView-2 and TerraSAR-X dataset is proposed. First, it uses multi-source data and fuzzy samples by Low Pass Filtering (LPF) to solve the problem of road and building misclassification; second, learning Multi-Source Dictionary for non-shadow and shadow classes, then using discriminative sparse coding method for classification, therefore to reduce shadow effects and improve the ISA extraction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - The Ocean Circulation of Chatham Sound, British Columbia, Canada: Results From Numerical Modelling Studies Using Historical Datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Chatham Sound, a semi-enclosed inland sea located off northern British Columbia, is an important waterway due to many proposed industrial activities related to the Port of Prince Rupert, along with its high levels of marine productivity. The oceanographic forcing in Chatham Sound is complex due to a combination of large tides, seasonally strong winds, and large freshwater discharges. Although much oceanographic data have been collected over the past six decades, past studies of the oceanographic regime of the full Chatham Sound area have been very limited. Using these extensive forcing datasets, high-resolution three-dimensional numerical modelling using the Coastal Circulation model for Sediment transport was conducted to investigate the tidal and wind-driven currents in the stratified waters of Chatham Sound. The numerical study shows the progression of the river-dominated lower salinity near-surface waters being advected northward, especially on the eastern side of Chatham Sound, with more saline waters on the western side of the Sound, especially in areas of exchanges with the waters of Hecate Strait through side channels. These surface circulation results are in good agreement with the large-scale representation of the outer diffuse Skeena River plume as seen in high-resolution Landsat satellite imagery. The model was operated over a representative year with four seasonal model runs. Southern Chatham Sound was found to be dominated by large tidal currents. Seasonal variations of residual flow were also investigated. Significant correlation between non-tidal current speeds and Skeena River discharges was found in the Skeena River delta area and through narrow tidal channels in southern Chatham Sound. In other offshore areas, non-tidal currents were found to be constrained near the surface and driven mainly by winds.

AB  - It is a meaningful issue on how to download remote sensing data to the ground stations through data relay satellites efficiently. Taking the priority of tasks, the success rate, the utilisation of bandwidth and time window constraints into consideration, this work proposes an efficient real-time scheduling and proactive data download algorithm for the data download task of Earth Observation Satellites. The NP-hard problem of scheduling between multi satellites with lots of tasks is transformed into individual satellite dynamical scheduling. To make a convincing argument, we perform several experiments to compare the proposed ERS-PDD algorithm with FCFS, EDF, LPTF and SRTF. These experiments show our ERS-PDD algorithm performs better in success rate and the number of permitted tasks.

AB  - NASA's Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission aims at disaggregating L-band radiometer (36 km) with L-band radar (1-3 km) observations to obtain an intermediate resolution soil moisture product (1-9 km). Since SMAP's radar stopped operations in July 2015, a substitution with ESA's Sentinel 1 C-band radar is underway. For this purpose, the relationship of L-band radiometer and C-band radar observations needs to be determined, especially considering the frequency dependent influence of vegetation. This study investigates vegetation effects on covariations of backscatter and emissivity, considering the SMAP-Sentinel 1 (C/L-band) and original SMAP (L/L-band) frequency configurations. Covariations are expressed as the linear regression slope beta between backscatter and emissivity signatures, which is simulated for corn and coniferous forest stands. Backscatter and emissivity signatures are obtained from Tor Vergata model simulations, whereas random signal disturbances are accounted for by an errors-invariables model. As a general trend, we find that beta tends to zero for increasing VWC, which is mostly explained by a decrease of radar sensitivity to soil moisture. For forest, which shows overall high VWC values (similar to 5-15 kg/m(2)), we thus find low magnitudes of beta in all cases. For corn (similar to 0-7 kg/m(2)), we find considerable non-zero magnitudes of beta for both frequency configurations, whereas the L/L-band case retains high magnitudes of beta longer with respect to C/L-band.

AB  - We utilize information derived from Landsat satellite images to produce eco-environmental vulnerability maps by considering four main factors: hydrometeorology, topography, land resources, and socioeconomics. Twin Taipei Cities are chosen for our study. Their eco-environmental vulnerability assessment (EVA) is first performed. Subsequently, classified regions in needs of environmental protection are proposed. We found that high vulnerable levels are observed in the Taipei Metropolis, consisting of Taipei City and its transboundary regions with New Taipei City as a result of high-density buildings and urbanization with low vegetation. Lowlands in the metropolitan area with concentration of impervious surface might lead to flood if heavy rainfall events occur. In contrast, the regions outside Taipei Metropolis, especially in southwest and southeast parts, have higher quality eco-environment due to better-protected forest areas with lower intervention of human activities. Information of suggested ecological zoning regions is useful for Twin Cities' governments to understand their eco-environmental vulnerability conditions.

TI  - The impact of small unmanned airborne platforms on passive optical remote sensing: a conceptual perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned airborne systems (UAS), particularly the class of UAS referred to as small-unmanned airborne systems (S-UAS), have the potential to revolutionize the science, practice, and role of remote sensing. S-UAS-collected remote sensing data differ from that acquired from larger airborne and space-borne platforms in myriad ways. To provide an indication of the novel remote sensing capabilities that S-UAS are poised to enable and identify research priorities for realizing the full potential of remote sensing from these novel platforms, characteristics of S-UAS platforms and their impact on data and information products are analysed in the context of remote sensing model and the remote sensing communication model. Results indicate that S-UAS will not only enable a range of novel remote sensing capabilities but also present clear challenges to the remote sensing community. These challenges, including increased data volume, a paucity of appropriate analysis approaches, and restrictions on autonomous operation (both regulatory and technological), point towards several near-term research priorities.

TI  - A Fast Algorithm for Retrieving Maps of Atmospheric Pollution by Fine Particulate Matter from Multispectral Satellite Images
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new algorithm for retrieving the total content of atmospheric fine particulate matter (FPM) (particles with a size of less than 1.0 and 2.5 mu m) from multispectral satellite images in visible and IR regions of the electromagnetic spectrum is described. The algorithm is based on the regression relations between the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, microphysical parameters of aerosol, and geometrical parameters of the satellite scene. The regression equations are built based on the calculated TOA brightness in the spectral channels of the satellite instrument for the ensemble of randomly generated parameters of the atmospheric radiative transfer model and geometrical parameters of the satellite scenes. Subsequently, this allows real-time mapping of the atmospheric FPM pollution directly from the satellite images without solving ill-posed inverse problems based on the solar radiation transfer in the atmosphere and aerosol light scattering. The algorithm suggested is implemented and tested for the MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) satellite instrument. Comparison of the MERIS-retrieved total content of the atmospheric FPM with AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) data shows a standard deviation of similar to 0.5 mu g/cm(2). The applicability of the algorithm developed to real-time monitoring of the regional and transboundary transport of the atmospheric FPM pollutants during wildfires is demonstrated.

TI  - Hyperspectral Features of Oil-Polluted Sea Ice and the Response to the Contamination Area Fraction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers have studied oil spills in open waters using remote sensors, but few have focused on extracting reflectance features of oil pollution on sea ice. An experiment was conducted on natural sea ice in Bohai Bay, China, to obtain the spectral reflectance of oil-contaminated sea ice. The spectral absorption index (SAI), spectral peak height (SPH), and wavelet detail coefficient (DWT d5) were calculated using stepwise multiple linear regression. The reflectances of some false targets were measured and analysed. The simulated false targets were sediment, iron ore fines, coal dust, and the melt pool. The measured reflectances were resampled using five common sensors (GF-2, Landsat8-OLI, Sentinel3-OLCI, MODIS, and AVIRIS). Some significant spectral features could discriminate between oil-polluted and clean sea ice. The indices correlated well with the oil area fractions. All of the adjusted R-2 values exceeded 0.9. The SPH model1, based on spectral features at 507-670 and 1627-1746 nm, displayed the best fitting. The resampled data indicated that these multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors could be used to detect crude oil on the sea ice if the effect of noise and spatial resolution are neglected. The spectral features and their identified changes may provide reference on sensor design and band selection.

TI  - Study of continuous air pollution in winter over Wuhan based on ground-based and satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive research was conducted to analyze the formation and characteristics of continuous air pollution during winter in Wuhan, China, based on ground and satellite joint observation. The effect of meteorological conditions, the source of pollutants and the optical properties of aerosols were investigated. The pressure and the accumulation of pollutants were the two main causes of continuous haze formation. The continuous cold high-pressure system, accompanied by a stable inversion layer, limited the contaminants below the height of 700 m on 15-23 January. The height of the boundary layer was below 1 000 m, based on the lidar observation. Meteorological condition contributes to the accumulation of pollutants. Then, dust transport and local anthropogenic pollutant emissions promoted the accumulation of pollutants, resulting in continuous haze pollution. Different from the heavy pollution (the 24 h-average PM2.5 is more than 200.0 mu gm(-3) ) over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the contaminants in the Wuhan area were mainly primary pollutants, including airborne dust and anthropogenic pollutants. Moreover, a photochemical reaction was observed. However, the extent of secondary pollution formation was not high during haze pollution. Result in the particle size distribution confirmed the process of dust transport. Fine-mode and coarse-mode particles sometimes appear in the haze pollution in winter. According to the satellite data, the AOD maintained a large level of approximately 0.8 during the pollution. The aerosol extinction ability was relatively strong during the pollution period, whether aerosol is absorbed or a scattering effect dominated. In this study, the formation process of haze pollution revealed which can be used to validate air-quality models over the Wuhan region and can also provide guidance for government for the prevention work of haze pollution over Central China.

AB  - This study evaluated the potential of a compact polarimetric (CP) mode SAR concept for the retrieval of winter wheat LAI values. First, the CP SAR data used in this study were simulated from full polarimetric SAR data. A total of 19 CP parameters were extracted from CP matrices and from CP decomposition results. Second, a hybrid inversion model based on nonlinear genetic partial least square (GA-PLS) algorithm was built to determine the relationships between CP SAR parameters and LAI values. Finally, the mapping and estimation of winter wheat LAI using the CP SAR parameters by GA-PLS algorithm were implemented. Our study indicates that by using a CP SAR dataset, LAI retrieval can yield an accuracy of R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 0.40 m(2)/m(2). Our study has significant implications for field crop condition monitoring and growth stage estimation, providing relevant data for agronomic practices and precision agriculture.

TI  - Intercomparison of CALIOP, MODIS, and AERONET aerosol optical depth over China during the past decade
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) were intercompared and validated against ground-based measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) as well as space-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over China during June 2006 to December 2015. This article aims to evaluate CALIOP daytime AOD using MODIS and AERONET AODs. Comparing the AOD between CALIOP and AERONET in different regions over China using quality control flags to screen the AOD data, we find that CALIOP AOD is generally lower than AERONET AOD especially at optical depths over 0.4 likely due to differences in the cloud screening algorithms and general retrieval uncertainty. Comparison between CALIOP AOD and MODIS AOD results show that the overall spatio-temporal distribution of CALIOP AOD and MODIS AOD is basically consistent. As for the spatial distribution, both data sets show several high-value regions and low-value regions in China. CALIOP is systematically lower than MODIS over China, especially over high AOD value regions for all seasons. As for the temporal variation, both data sets show a significant seasonal variation: AOD is largest in spring, then less in summer, and smallest in winter and autumn. A long-term linear trend analysis based on the domain averaged monthly mean CALIOP and MODIS AOD shows agreement among CALIOP and MODIS for the trends over the 10-year period in four regions examined. The trends in AOD derived from CALIOP and MODIS indicate a decline in aerosol loading in China since 2006. It is found from frequency comparison that CALIOP and MODIS AOD generally exhibit a degree of correlation over China. Statistical frequency analysis shows that CALIOP AOD frequency distribution shows a higher peak than MODIS AOD when AOD < 0.4. For the most part, mean MODIS AOD is higher than mean CALIOP AOD. Evaluation of CALIOP AOD retrievals provides the prospect for application of CALIOP data. The intercomparison suggests that CALIOP has systematically underestimated daytime AOD retrievals, especially deteriorating with increasing AOD, and therefore, CALIOP daytime AOD retrievals should be treated with some degree of caution when the AOD is over 0.4.

AB  - This article presents a novel method using a closed-form solution derived from the first, second and third moments to estimate the parameters of K-distribution probability density function (PDF) and its applications to ship detection using dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Two key parameters which define a K-distribution PDF, equivalent number of independent looks (ENIL, L) and order parameter (), can be simultaneously estimated. The derivation has been provided and the applications to ship detection have been described with emphasis on K-distribution function to model ocean samples from a combined dual-polarization system for ship detection. This method along with its applications to ship detection has been thoroughly evaluated with RADARSAT-2 data. This article also presents the knowledge-based target discrimination methods to reduce false alarms when detection is applied to the ocean environment in the presence of sea ice. The detection results were evaluated using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

TI  - Improving large-scale moso bamboo mapping based on dense Landsat time series and auxiliary data: a case study in Fujian Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forest, especially moso bamboo forest, is very important to human society. However, our ability to detect large-scale moso bamboo with optical remote sensing is still limited due to the spectral similarity with other forest species and the influence of cloud occurrence. In this study, we examined the capability of dense Landsat time series for moso bamboo forest mapping by comparing three different interpretation schemes. For each scheme, two experimental groups were further conducted to investigate the usefulness of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures. Considering classification accuracy, the full-season compositing strategy was regarded as the most efficient. It was generally beneficial to include GLCM textures as input features, although their usefulness would be partially offset due to noise/correlation issues. We also investigated the roles of 15 types of auxiliary covariates in extracting moso bamboo and found some of them could enhance the classification performance significantly. With the full-season compositing scheme and crucial auxiliary covariates, an improved moso bamboo mapping performance (93.21% in overall accuracy and 73.97% in minimum accuracy) was observed within the study area. Our evaluation results are promising to provide robust guidelines for remote mapping of moso bamboo forest over large areas.

AB  - Aiming at the characteristics of long delay, high error code, high dynamoic and asymmetric propagation of uplink and downlink in space-ground integrated data link, an integrated data link slot synchronization method based on moving nodes is proposed. By using the numbering in the asking messages and response messages, the time required for each message transmission is determined, and the synchronization can be completed in different slots to improve the utilization efficiency of the time resource. Aiming at the high-speed motion of nodes, a change rule of propagation delay is assumed, which is calculated by increasing the number of message transmission times. Then, the slot deviation caused by node motion is calculated and the deviation is compensated and the synchronization accuracy and stability is improved. The simulation results show that the integrated data link slot synchronization algorithm improves the synchronization accuracy under the premise of completing the integrated data link synchronization.

AB  - Based on the field investigation and long term remote sensing data, the dynamic changes of the alpine wetland in Tibet were studied. Results showed the alpine wetlands accounted for 13.99% of total wetlands in China in 2010. The area of lakes were 31653.16 km(2), accounting for 58.79 % of total wetlands in Tibet. Lakes were mostly located in Northern Tibet, accounting for 93.37% of the total lakes in Tibet. The variation in lake shape is also significant in Northern Tibet. Lake appeared an increasing trend in the past 20 years, with an increase of 35.3 %. However, river and swamp exhibited a tendency of decreasing with 833.49km(2) and 2761.30 km(2). The degraded swamp wetlands mainly distributed in Northern Tibet, representing 95.2% of the total reduced area. There existed 12.43% of reduced swamp converted into lakes or rivers on the basis of remote sensing image interpretation.

AB  - With rapid urban growth in recent years, the understanding of urban biophysical composition and dynamics has become an important research topic. Land surface temperature (LST) is a more important parameter in studying the material exchange and energy exchange between the land and the atmosphere, a key parameter of physical course of the earth top layer in the area or global scale, an important index of monitoring the earth resource and studying the ecological environment system of the land surface, it has very important function in many aspects, such as climate, hydrology, ecology, environment and military affairs. The new space technology with 3S (GIS, GPS, RS) has offered a technological measure in evaluating and monitoring the land surface composition and LST. GIS technologies can offer analysis tools; GPS technologies can provide accurate location information; RS technologies can provide accurate spectral information. RS technologies constitute a potentially scientific basis for examining urban composition and monitoring its changes over the time. The vegetation-impervious surface-soil-water (V-I-SW) model in particular provides a foundation for describing urban/suburban environments and also serves as a basis for further urban analyses comprising urban growth modeling, environmental impact analysis and socioeconomic factor estimation.This paper developed a normalized spectral mixture analysis(NSMA) method for examining urban composition in Zhengzhou area using Landsat ETM+ data. In particular brightness normalization method was applied to reduce brightness variation. Through this normalization brightness variability within each V-I-S-W component was reduced or eliminated, thus allowing a single end-member to represent each component. Furthermore, with the normalized image four endmembers (namely vegetation, impervious surface, soil and water) were chosen to model heterogeneous urban composition using a constrained spectral mixture analysis(SMA) model. The accuracy of impervious surface estimation was assessed and compared with the other existing models. The results indicate that the proposed model is a better alternative to existing models with a lower root mean square error for impervious surface estimation in the study area. The transformed ETM+ images were unmixed into four fraction images (vegetation, impervious surface, water and soil) with a constrained least-square solution.This paper managed mono-window algorithm to retrieve land surface temperature based on the Landsat ETM+ hot infrared image and the meteorological data, thus gained the land surface temperature image. Finally, it received the conclusion by analyzing the coupling relationship between land surface composition and LST: the vegetation-LST relationship was middle negative correlation. The relationship of water and LST was also middle negative correlation. The relationship of impervious surface and LST was the positive correlation, but the correlation coefficient was quite low. The relationship of soil and LST was high negative correlation.

AB  - This research proposes an approach based on the ensemble of multiple empirical algorithms to better estimate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration as the proxy for algal blooms in inland waters from Sentinel-2A (S2A) multispectral imagery. Recent studies on Chl-a retrieval from newly launched S2A satellite imagery mainly use a single/individual empirical algorithm. So far, no research effort has been made to synthesize the information from different empirical models for improving the estimation accuracy. Using S2A image data and coincident extensive in situ water truth data, we compared a number of empirical algorithms, among which 2BDA, 3BDA, and NDCI yield the lowest RMSE of 4.50, 4.57, and 4.71 mu g/L respectively. An optimally weighted combination ensemble method by pseudoinverse technique reduces the RMSE to 4.07 mu g/L. Our proposed spectral space partition guided ensemble method that exploits advantages of each individual algorithm can further reduce the RMSE to 3.57 mu g/L, 20.6% improvement over the best individual algorithm.

TI  - Malaria burden and treatment targets in Kachin Special Region II, Myanmar from 2008 to 2016: A retrospective analysis
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Although drug-based treatment is the primary intervention for malaria control and elimination, optimal use of targeted treatments remains unclear. From 2008 to 2016, three targeted programs on treatment were undertaken in Kachin Special Region II (KR2), Myanmar. Program I (2008-2011) treated all confirmed, clinical and suspected cases; program II (2012-2013) treated confirmed and clinical cases; and program III (2014-2016) targeted confirmed cases only. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of the three programs on malaria burden individually based on the annual parasite incidence (API), slide positivity rate (SPR) and their relative values. The API is calculated from original collected data and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each year is calculated by using the first-year API as a reference in each program phase across the KR2. Same method is applied to calculate SPR and risk ratio (RR) at the sentinel hospital too. During program I (2008-2011), malaria burden was reduced by 61% (95%CI: 58%-74%) and the actual API decreased from 9.8 (95%CI: 9.6-10.1) per 100 person-years in 2008 to 3.8 (3.6-4.1) per 100 person-years in 2011. Amid program II (2012-2013), the malaria burden increased by 33% (95%CI: 22%-46%) and the actual API increased from 2.1(95%CI: 2.0-2.3) per 100 person-years in 2012 to 2.8 (95%CI: 2.7-2.9) per 100 person-years in 2013. During program III (2014-2016) the malaria burden increased furtherly by 60% (95%CI: 51% - 69%) and the actual API increased from 3.2(95%CI: 3.0-3.3) per 100 person-years in 2014 to 5.1 (95%CI: 4.9-5.2) per 100 person-years in 2016. Results of the slide positivity of the sentinel hospital also confirm these results. Resurgence of malaria was mainly due to Plasmodium vivax during program II and III. This study indicates that strategy adopted in program I (2008-2011) should be more appropriate for the KR2. Quality-assured treatment of all confirmed, clinical and suspected malaria cases may be helpful for the reduction of malaria burden. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - The inversion of total suspended particulate matter (TSM) from ocean color remote sensing data in coastal waters is still highly inaccurate due to contributions of various oceanic constituents and non-linear independently variation of each other. Since the absorption and scattering by molecules, aerosols, and hydrosols and reflection, transmission over the sea surface, the initially completely unpolarized sunlight becomes partially polarized after transmitting in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system (AOS). Hence, the polarization of the sunlight, which contains embedded information on atmospheric and water optical properties, has largely been neglected. In addition, the parallel polarization radiance (PPR) has two significant advantages in effectively diminishing the sun-glint contamination and enhancing the ocean color signal at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA). In this study, the directional variations in parallel polarized water-leaving radiance of suspended particulate matters in coastal waters, based on the vector radiative transfer simulations (RT), were examined. The simulations reveal that the traditional radiation intensity (I) and parallel polarization radiance (PPR) display significant multidirectional and spectral variations with respect to the observation geometries, and TSM concentrations. Moreover, the water-leaving (Lw) radiance for I and PPR have the same angular distribution pattern and magnitude under different bands. In addition, the relative fraction of Lw to Lt for PPR is large than I, indicating that the PPR can improve to retrieve the Lw radiance at the TOA. Furthermore, an exponent relationship between the Rrs_p and the TSM concentration has been established with low corresponding AD (1.258%) and RMSE (0.202). It demonstrates that the polarization of the Lw radiance is closely related to oceanic constituents, and has great potential for the retrieval of TSM concentrations.

AB  - With the advantages of high spatial resolution and definition, and rich information, land classification and land utilization of urban surface can be reached by using the high resolution remote sensing data. Based on the high resolution remote sensing image data Worldview-1 and Worldview-2 as the main data source, using the methods of stereo images, object-oriented land use classification technique and architecture shadow, this study (1) extracts 5-meter resolution DEM data of Shilipu district in Wuhan and the average relative error compared with the measured DEM data of ground points is 3.71% with relatively high precision, (2) obtains the land use information of this area with an accuracy rate of 90%, and (3) achieve the data of building height in this area with the relative error of less than 20%.

AB  - Identifying event instance in text plays a critical role in building NLP applications such as Information Extraction (IE) system. However, most existing methods for this task focus only on monolingual clues of a specific language and ignore the massive information provided by other languages. Data scarcity and monolingual ambiguity hinder the performance of these monolingual approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel multilingual approach - dubbed as Gated MultiLingual Attention (GMLATT) framework - to address the two issues simultaneously. In specific, to alleviate data scarcity problem, we exploit the consistent information in multilingual data via context attention mechanism. Which takes advantage of the consistent evidence in multilingual data other than learning only from monolingual data. To deal with monolingual ambiguity problem, we propose gated cross-lingual attention to exploit the complement information conveyed by multilingual data, which is helpful for the disambiguation. The cross-lingual attention gate serves as a sentinel modelling the confidence of the clues provided by other languages and controls the information integration of various languages. We have conducted extensive experiments on the ACE 2005 benchmark. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Timely and accurately monitoring of cropland use is of critical significance to ensure food security. Shaanxi province of China has experienced major land use and land cover changes due to the rapid urban sprawl and the implement of the Grain for Green Project. This paper aimed to investigate cropland use changes in Shaanxi from 2000 to 2015 based on MODIS EVI time-series data by utilizing shape-matching cropping index mapping method. The shape-matching method we formerly developed was proved to be an efficient method in mapping cropland use intensity. We firstly divided the study area into six different geomorphic zones, and then randomly selected training samples in each zone. After that, the cropping status for each sample was visually interpreted and used as reference data to train the optimal thresholds for detect cropping index in each zone with the shape-matching cropping index mapping model. Then the cropland use maps for 2000 and 2015 was derived. Finally, the cropland use changes were obtained by spatial analysis of these two cropland use maps. Results show that: (1) The dominant land use is double cropping and non-grain crop production in Guangzhong Plain both in 2000 and 2015. And most cropland in other zones was used for non-grain crop production in the two study years. (2) There were totally 2 585.3 km(2) cropland newly developed and 7 042.8 km(2) cropland lost in the past fifteen years. Areas with increased use intensity is 4 084.9 km(2), while areas with decreased use intensity is 10 889.3 km(2) during this period. (3) Extensive cropland use changes were taken places in the Wind Drift Sand Region, the Loess Plateau, the Guanzhong Plain and the Hanjiang Basin. Our findings could provide great support for local agriculture management.

TI  - Winter wheat mapping using a random forest classifier combined with multi-temporal and multi-sensor data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is a major staple food crop in China. Accurate and cost-effective wheat mapping is exceedingly critical for food production management, food security warnings, and food trade policy-making in China. To reduce confusion between wheat and non-wheat crops for accurate growth stage wheat mapping, we present a novel approach that combines a random forest (RF) classifier with multi-sensor and multi-temporal image data. This study aims to (1) determine whether an RF combined with multi-sensor and multi-temporal imagery can achieve accurate winter wheat mapping, (2) to find out whether the proposed approach can provide improved performance over the traditional classifiers, and (3) examine the feasibility of deriving reliable estimates of winter wheat-growing areas from medium-resolution remotely sensed data. Winter wheat mapping experiments were conducted in Boxing County. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method can achieve good performance, with an overall accuracy of 92.9% and a kappa coefficient () of 0.858. The winter wheat acreage was estimated at 33,895.71ha with a relative error of only 9.3%. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach has been evaluated through comparison with other image classification methods. We conclude that the proposed approach can provide accurate delineation of winter wheat areas.

AB  - The remote sensing data have respective advantages in application of structural extraction and research. The Landsat 8 OLI image can be used to rapidly delineate the large-scale lineaments due to its large swath width; the ASTER data can be used to delineate mid-scale structures shown by the boundaries of different rocks on the basis of more SWIR bands; the high spatial resolution Worldview-2 images can be used for detailed visual interpretation of small-scale structures. In this study, we applied the OLI, ASTER and Worldview-2 data to the research of the structural framework in western Beishan orogenic belt and provide some new evidence for its tectonic evolution. Our results show that the faults in the study area constitute an imbricate fan system. It proved the ability of integrated utilization of OLI, ASTER and Worldview-2 data in the regional structural framework research.

AB  - The fragmented land use is small and the distribution of rice is broken. Besides, the rainfall with larger and the cloud pollution is more serious in the southern area. The optical remote sensing data is easily disturbed by cloud and rain, further increasing the difficulty of rice yield estimation form optical remote sensing data. Therefore, In order to accurately and quantitatively monitor the spatial distribution information of rice planting, the study takes Lingao County of Hainan Province as the research area and uses the 113 scene C band dual polarized Sentinel-1A radar image data (free use) with the resolution of 5x20m in 2017. The results showed that the surface canopy of the crops increased gradually during the growth of rice, and the surface water content decreased gradually, which resulted in the increase of the backscatter coefficient of rice, in which the change of VH polarization was obvious. In order to reduce the backscattering coefficient of the water body affected by the water body, the normalization treatment of water body is proposed, that is (P-VV/VH-T-VV/VH) / (P-VV/VH+ T-VV/VH), P is the VV and VH data of a certain period, and T is the mean of the VV and VH in a certain period. Through the change characteristics and index, we found that only rice has obvious change trend in the normalization data of VV and VH in time series. By 03 month 10, 03 months 22, 04 month 03, 04 month 17, 05 month 09, we can distinguish rice crops with other crops, vegetation and residential areas. The results show that the best monitoring coefficient for extracting rice from time series radar data is the normalized value of VH polarization. Rice is mainly distributed in the southwest and central parts of the north, and the rest is scattered. The total extraction accuracy is 85.52%.

AB  - The full wave method is a computationally-efficient model to solve electromagnetic field of the very low frequency wave in three-dimensional space of the horizontally-stratified medium. When the signal wave propagates further lateral distance from the source, the effect of earth curvature cannot be neglected. We modify the full wave model via considering the effect of earth curvature. Comparing with the planar-stratified model and satellite data, we find that the energy distribution computed by the spherical-stratified model is more compact.

TI  - Assessing a scheme of spatial-temporal thermal remote-sensing sharpening for estimating regional evapotranspiration
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A high temporal frequency of high-resolution thermal data is required in regional evapotranspiration (ET) studies. In this article, a spatial-temporal thermal remote-sensing sharpening scheme, which can be used to perform temporally stable land surface temperature (LST) mapping with high spatial resolution and further facilitate the estimation of ET, is discussed in the context of the Soil Moisture Experiment of 2002. To demonstrate this scheme, relationships between LST and three remote-sensing parameters (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and Bowen ratio) were first used in a thermal disaggregation procedure for retrieving LSTs at a 250-m scale. Then, the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion (STARFM) model was applied to the 250-m LSTs, producing LST data at a fine resolution of 60m and a fine temporal resolution of 1 day. Two remote-sensing-based energy balance models were then used to retrieve the ET at the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer overpass time respectively using 250- and 60-m LSTs. The results showed that the Bowen ratio-based LSTs were matched field observations better than did the LSTs obtained with the other two approaches (NDVI- and FVC-based) at the 250-m scale, and consequently produced 250-m ET mapping that better matched the observed tower-based values. When combined with the STARFM fusion model, the 250-m Bowen ratio-based LSTs produced more accurate time-series LSTs and ET at the 60-m scale. The Bowen ratio, which is more related to surface energy principles and the soil moisture variation, was effective in disaggregating LSTs and promoting the estimation of ET. Overall, sharpened LSTs using the combination of thermal disaggregation procedure and the STARFM fusion model could substantially improve remote-sensing-based ET estimates. Moreover, the STARFM model that can fuse LST from 250 to similar to 100m should be given more attention as long as the thermal disaggregation procedure that can disaggregate LST from 1000to 250m, provided that it contributed approximately 10.1% to further improving ET retrieval performance.

AB  - Inshore ship detection in SAR image faces difficulties on correctly identifying near-shore ships and onshore objects. This article proposes a multi-scale full convolutional network (MS-FCN) based sea-land segmentation method and applies a rotatable bounding box based object detection method (DRBox) to solve the inshore ship detection problem. The sea region and land region are separated by MS-FCN then DRBox is applied on sea region. The proposed method combines global information and local information of SAR image to achieve high accuracy. The networks are trained with Chinese Gaofen-3 satellite images. Experiments on the testing image show most inshore ships are successfully located by the proposed method.

TI  - Satellite-based time series calibration of GF-1 WFV sensors for large view zenith angle observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel satellite cross-calibration method is proposed using image pairs with large view zenith angle observations. Previous studies on cross calibration have focused primarily on image pairs with nadir or small view zenith angles, while this study introduces a technique for large view zenith angle observations using bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction. This technique was applied to images from the wide field of view (WFV) onboard the GAO FEN-1 (GF-1) satellite and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors as it transited over the Dunhuang site in China. A total of 62 image pairs, collected from 2013 to 2016, were used in the cross-calibration process. However, only 12 of 62 image pairs included a small view zenith angle difference (less than 10 degrees), while the other image pairs featured a large view zenith angle difference. An experimental time series calibration was conducted using the proposed technique as well as conventional cross-calibration methods for comparison purposes. Time series calibration results also showed an attenuation trend for GF-1 WFV sensor and produced a calibration equation for day since launch (DSL). Then, the calibration equation by DSL was compared with four vicarious calibration results carried out over the Dunhuang test site from 2013 to 2016 to demonstrate its consistency. The calibration coefficients using the proposed method were also compared with the coefficients from other cross-calibration methods, taking the vicarious calibration coefficient as the reference. The comparison results showed that the calibration coefficients using the proposed method were with higher calibration accuracy and higher calibration frequency than other cross-calibration methods. The cross-calibration uncertainties caused by difference influence factors were analysed quantitatively. The results showed that the calibration uncertainties were decreased from 35.03-44.60% to 5.95-8.26% after BRDF correction, which demonstrated the proposed method to be superior for processing large view zenith angle images. These results suggest the proposed technique could be an effective new tool for future time series satellite calibration.

T2  - LAND SURFACE AND CRYOSPHERE REMOTE SENSING IV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Land Surface and Cryosphere Remote Sensing IV
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - Land surface albedo is considered to be a fundamental quantity for accurate assessment of the surface energy budget. Whereas satellite products usually provide total surface albedo, land surface models and numerous applications often require a separation of snow-free surface albedos of the vegetation canopy and the underlying bare soil. In this paper, a simplified non-linear spectral mixture model (NSM) was firstly presented to describe the canopy radiative transfer process. The soil background's contribution on canopy albedo was approximated using an illumination factor, which is the canopy transmittance. Then, a framework was designed to retrieve the soil VIS albedo using the NSM model, MODIS BRDF (MCD43A3), leaf area index (LAI) (MCD15A2H) and clumping index (CI) products. Finally, the global broadband visible albedo of soil background was indirectly validated using the ECOCLIMAP data, with an R-2 value of 0.889. Therefore, the simplified NSM model is accurate to simulate canopy visible albedo and also to retrieve soil background's albedo, and the first global snow-free albedo of soil background at 500-m resolution is reliable.

This paper tried to present ecological functions in mining cities from two aspects: landscape ecology and ecological carrying capacity. The city of Qitaihe, one of the coal cities in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China, was chosen as a typical study area. Remote sensing data from 1957, 1985, 2000, and 2015, and geographic information system (GIS) techniques were employed to obtain land use and cover information. Methods of landscape pattern indexes and a modified model of ecological carrying capacity which added social and economy index were used to study the spatial and temporal variation of the ecological condition. Results showed that the landscape pattern changed tremendously during the study period due to interference from human activity. The degree of aggregation, dominance, and fragmentation of mining land showed an increasing trend. On the other hand, the ecological carrying capacity per capita declined by 37.4% from 1985 to 2000. Except for the growth of population, the dim social and economic conditions had an impact on this decline too. In addition, spatial distribution of land types and ecological carrying capacity also had some correlation with the city's overall planning. The obtained results also provided suggestions that future research should encourage the combination between ecology and economy, as well as urban planning.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present a processing chain for landscape pattern and ecological security status assessment and prediction based on cellular automata Markov (CA-Markov) and pressure status response pattern (PSRP) models using remotely sensed data (RSD) captured in 1986, 1996, 2006, 2016, and RSD simulated in 2026 over Zhengzhou city, Henan province, China. Three major findings can be withdrawn through the experiments. First, there is a significant changing of landscape type area, especially for building land. The area of building land is up to more than 5%, from 1986 to 2016. Secondly, the heterogeneity of landscape is increasing, and the diversity of landscape is becoming more and more diversifying and complex. Third, the changing trend of ecological security of Zhengzhou city shaped as decreasing and increasing gradually during the last 40 years. While the ecological security status, nowadays, appeared to a good trend by contrast of the previous stages. The predicted results with CAMarkov model show that the level of ecological security is still in moderate and has a trend of moving toward to the center in 2026.

TI  - A Novel Generalized Intensity-Hue-Saturation (GIHS) Based Pan-Sharpening Method With Variational Hessian Transferring
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The popular intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) pan-sharpening method can provide high spatial quality while suffering from some spectral distortion, mainly due to the fact that it cannot estimate an accurate intensity image to substitute the original intensity image in the IHS space. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we particularly use the modeling idea of variational complementary data fusion, and propose a novel yet highly effective pan-sharpening method with variational Hessian transferring in the generalized IHS (GIHS) transform domain, which aims to estimate a more accurate intensity image. More specifically, the novelty of proposed method consists in building a variational Hessian transferring model in the GIHS transform domain to transfer the Hessian-based spatial geometric information of panchromatic (Pan) image to the new intensity image and meanwhile take the spectral information preserving into consideration. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method which can perform higher spectral and spatial qualities, and higher efficiency than some state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new variational pan-sharpening method with Hessian nuclear norm induced spatial consistency, which aims to fuse a low resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image and a high resolution (HR) panchromatic (Pan) image into an HR MS image. In addition to using the fidelity based local spectral consistency term for preserving the spectral information, we particularly exploit the Hessian feature consistence between the HR MS image and Pan image, and propose a new Hessian nuclear norm induced spatial consistency term for preserving the spatial information. Then, the proposed model is solved by an efficient algorithm under the FISTA framework. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms various pan-sharpening methods in terms of higher spectral and spatial qualities.

AB  - This study compared five different seasonal CBERS-04 images for identifying the quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs) in the Yellow River Delta, China. Example-based feature extraction method in ENVI software 5.1 version, one of object-based image analysis, was adopted to segment the images based on edge algorithm, and K near neighbors method was used to identify the QVPs based on the training samples from visual interpretation with segmentation boundary. The research results from the present study showed that the seasonal impacts of multi-temporal CBERS-04 images for mapping the QVPs was important. The experimental results indicated that compared with other seasonal four images the higher precision rate, recall rate and F measure can be achieved by using the late spring season (May) image. Thus, it is significant to select proper seasonal images for monitoring the QVPs.

AB  - The Wide Band Spectral Imager (WBSI) onboard the Tiangong-II space lab of China launched in 2016 has five near-infrared bands and four red bands, which provides a good opportunity to compare the NDVI differences derived from the different combination of broadband red/near-infrared bands. In this work, one WBSI image acquired on March 18, 2017 was used to study the different NDVI differences from the different combination of the red and near-infrared bands in the Yellow River Delta of China. The results indicated that the NDVI based on the red band at 750 nm (the WBSI Band 6) had a steep distribution, and was not suitable for mapping and classifying land cover. When the red band was the same, the mean, standard deviation, median NDVI value and the CC decreases with the spectral wavelength of near-infrared band decreasing. While the near-infrared band was the same, the mean, standard deviation, median NDVI value and the CC increases with the spectral wavelength of red band decreasing. The NDVI derived from bands comparable to those of Landsat TM (NDVI820/665) had a multimodal histogram distribution, and was most suitable to map and classify land cover.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has a significant impact on the precipitation in the lower reaches. Forecasted precipitation with assimilated satellite data in plateau is often closer to the actual situations. Using Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system and The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), three experiments were designed to evaluate the impacts of MHS data assimilation of Tibetan Plateau on lower reaches rainfall forecasts. The results showed that the assimilation of satellite MHS radiance can improve the accuracy of the prediction of precipitation intensity and precipitation zone in the lower reaches. A preliminary analysis of the reasons showed that the MHS data assimilation affected the initial water vapor fields, such that the model had better humidity conditions at the initial stage. The assimilation of conventional wind data increased the wind speed over the plateau. The interaction of water vapor and wind fields increased the accuracy of precipitation forecast in the study case.

AB  - This paper focuses on solving the multi-class change detection problem in bitemporal multispectral remote sensing images. In that case, information that represented in a small number (e.g., two) of the original bands may be insufficient for the accurate identification of a few of multi-class changes. In particular, this problem becomes more difficult in unsupervised change detection cases when ground reference data is not available. In this paper, a solution is proposed by using the potential information represented in expanded features that constructed from the original spectral bands. Experimental results obtained on a real bitemporal remote sensing data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - With the establishment of Xiong'an New Area, the process of urbanization in Xiong'an will further accelerate, and the water area of Baiyang Lake will also be increasingly influenced by man-made and natural factors. In this study, thirty-six Landsat remote sensing images from 1982 to 2017 were used to extract the visible waters of Baiyang Lake, the construction land and rural residential land in Xiong'an New Area. Furthermore, the temporal and spatial changes of visible waters, construction land and rural residential land, as well as precipitation in Xiong'an New Area were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The expansion rate of construction land in urban and rural residential areas was very different before and after 2000, but they all regularly increased year by year, only slightly different in magnitude and increase speed. (2) The fluctuation of the visible water area of Baiyang Lake gradually decreased, and it experienced three various stages: from the continuous decrease by a wide margin of the visible water area to the dramatic fluctuation, and to a relative stabilization gradually. After the year of 2003, the water area of Baiyang Lake had basically stabilized. (3) The annual precipitation in Xiong'an New Area gradually decreased and the fluctuation was obvious. Currently, the Baiyang Lake has become an urban wetland under artificially controlled, and the establishment of Xiong'an New Area will further promote the urban expansion. In the future, it is still necessary to explore and clarify the internal relations between Baiyang Lake and Xiong'an New Area.

TI  - Ice Velocity Variations of the Polar Record Glacier (East Antarctica) Using a Rotation-Invariant Feature-Tracking Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the ice velocity changes from 2004 to 2015 of the Polar Record Glacier (PRG) in East Antarctica were investigated based on a feature-tracking method using Landsat-7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) images. The flow field of the PRG curves make it difficult to generate ice velocities in some areas using the traditional normalized cross-correlation (NCC)-based feature-tracking method. Therefore, a rotation-invariant parameter from scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is introduced to build a novel rotation-invariant feature-tracking approach. The validation was performed based on multi-source images and the making earth system data records for use in research environments (MEaSUREs) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based Antarctica ice velocity map data set. The results indicate that the proposed method is able to measure the ice velocity in more areas and performs as well as the traditional NCC-based feature-tracking method. The sequential ice velocities obtained present the variations in the PRG during this period. Although the maximum ice velocity of the frontal margin of the PRG and the frontal iceberg reached about 900 m/a and 1000 m/a, respectively, the trend from 2004 to 2015 showed no significant change. Under the interaction of the Polar Times Glacier and the Polarforschung Glacier, both the direction and the displacement of the PRG were influenced. This impact also led to higher velocities in the western areas of the PRG than in the eastern areas. In addition, elevation changes and frontal iceberg calving also impacted the ice velocity of the PRG.

AB  - The ocean surface electromagnetic (EM) scattering properties have important applications in marine environmental monitoring and detection of target on the sea. In this article, the accurate model is built to calculate the permittivity of sea water at different sea areas with foams. The relationships between the foam coverage and air-sea temperature and wind speed are analyzed. Then based on the facet-model theory, the modified two-scale model (MTSM) and Vector Radiative Transfer (VRT) theory, the modified facet-based two-scale model (MFBTSM) with foams is presented. To make the scattering model conform better to the practice, the cut-off wavenumber at actual wind speed and frequency of incident wave is considered. Based on satellite data of ocean salinity and temperature at the Western Pacific and Southeast coast, the electromagnetic scattering properties from complex ocean surface with foams at different sea areas are analyzed. On this basis, the Brewster effect at different sea areas is further analyzed. The producing mechanism and changing rules of ocean surface Brewster effect are summarized and analyzed.

AB  - Labeling remote sensing data for classification is costly and time-consuming in practical applications, while sufficient and representative labels are critical for achieving a high accuracy. Transfer learning emerges as an effective method for this issue by reusing samples from other domains. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method which can align the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in source and target domain at the same time. Our method treats the importance of the marginal and conditional distribution discrepancies at different levels and maps the feature sets of source domain and target domain into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to obtain similar feature sets. In particular, we apply the proposed method on the multi-modal remote sensing data including pixel-wise overlaid Orthophoto and Digital Surface Models (DSM). With experiments containing images of different cities with highly distinguishable land-cover patterns as source and target domain, we demonstrate that, as compared to several state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) algorithms, our method can achieve a satisfactory performance on the target domain by a simple statistical classifier trained only by samples in the source domain.

AB  - In the March 11, 2011 Tohoku-Oki, Japan, earthquake, many bridges in Iwate and Miyagi Prefectures were washed away by associated tsunamis. In this study, nine bridges in the inundated areas of Iwate Prefecture, Japan were selected as targets to estimate their damage status from post-event TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite images and Pi-SAR-X2 airborne SAR images. By visual interpretation, washed-away bridges could be identified from both the satellite and airborne very high-resolution SAR images. The statistical analysis was carried out to classify non-damaged bridges, debris blocked bridges and washed-away bridges. Pre- and post-event optical images and filed survey reports were introduced as the truth data of bridges' situation.

AB  - Long-term global land surface temperature (LST) is a very important data source for climate change study. By adding a quadratic term of two adjacent channels' brightness temperature difference, this paper proposed to use a refined generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm to retrieve LST from series NOAA-AVHRR data. Results of the simulation analysis and the sensitive analysis indicated that the refined GSW method had a high retrieval accuracy and a robust performance. The overall root mean square errors (RMSEs) varied from 0.55 K to 0.59 K for NOAA 7-AVHRR to NOAA 19-AVHRR data. In terms of the wet atmosphere, the refined algorithm had a better ability than the GSW algorithm, and the proportion of sub-ranges with RMSE below 0.5 K was 61.7%. Most RMSE errors were within 0.2 K and 0.7 K for sensor noise (NE Delta T) = 0.1 K and NE Delta T = 0.2 K, respectively, compared with the cases of no NE Delta T. Given the uncertainties of emissivity around 1%, the errors were mainly within [0.9K, 1.2K] for dry atmosphere and [0.3K, 0.7K] for wet atmosphere.

AB  - Remote sensing image fusion (also known as pan-sharpening) aims to generate a high resolution multi-spectral image from inputs of a high spatial resolution single band panchromatic (PAN) image and a low spatial resolution multi-spectral (MS) image. In this paper, we propose PSGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for remote sensing image pan-sharpening. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at producing high quality pan-sharpened images with GANs. The PSGAN consists of two parts. Firstly, a two-stream fusion architecture is designed to generate the desired high resolution multi-spectral images, then a fully convolutional network serving as a discriminator is applied to distinct "real" or "pan-sharpened" MS images. Experiments on images acquired by Quickbird and GaoFen-1 satellites demonstrate that the proposed PSGAN can fuse PAN and MS images effectively and significantly improve the results over the state of the art traditional and CNN based pan-sharpening methods.

AB  - Fire Spread Rate (FSR) is one of the key factors for fire rescue and prevention. Remote sensing images have an advantage of acquiring intuitive information timely. To achieve extracting real-time FSR from remote sensing data, a method based on the movement rate of burned area centroid is presented in this study. The FSR extracted from geostationary Himawari-8 (H-8) data in two bushfires outbroke in Esperance, Western Australia in 2015. And the FSR estimated from CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization) Grassland Fire Spread Model (CGFSM) were set as the benchmark to assess the presented approach. The results illustrated that the proposed method yield a promising accuracy by comparing with the FSR from CGFSM in that two fires, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) reaches to 0.76 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.50 m.s(-1). Furthermore, this study provides a potential application of geostationary satellite in extracting real-time wildfire behavior.

AB  - Ongoing information on snow and its extent is critical for understanding global water and energy cycles. Passive microwave data have been widely used in snow cover mapping for its long-time observation capabilities under all-weather conditions. But assessment of different passive microwave (PM) snow cover area (SCA) mapping algorithms have been rarely reported, especially in China. In this study, the performance of seven well documented successfully applied PM SCA mapping algorithms were tested using in situ snow depth measurements over China. The results shown in this study would contribute to the ongoing effort to improve the performance and applicability of PM SCA algorithms.

TI  - Identifying patterns and hotspots of global land cover transitions using the ESA CCI Land Cover dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change is a continuing research focus, not only because of its ecological and environmental effects but also because of the difficulties with accurate change detection and analysis uncertainty. The principal difficulty is the lack of a long time series of annual global land cover maps at a fine resolution. A new global long-term time series of annual datasets called the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) has been published, making it possible to detect the global land cover changes. Using this ESA CCI-LC product from 1992-2015, we quantified the annual transitions of land cover change globally with the trajectory analysis method, analyzed the changes patterns and identified the land cover change hotspots. The total land cover change area for the world was 5.99 million km(2), amounting to only 3.36% of the total continental area. Most changes happened in forest and cropland, accounting 32% of all the land cover changes. Most land cover changes happened in tropical ecoregions. Grassland changes were mainly distributed in the temperate ecoregions, while cropland expansion occurred mainly in the tropical or subtropical ecoregions. The hotspots identified in this paper could provide target areas for further research.

TI  - Feasibility of using consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicles to estimate leaf area index in Mangrove forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become more popular, many studies investigate vegetation based on commercial UAV data. Although compared to satellite data, commercial UAV data can have flexible revisit frequencies, the possibility of using an even cheaper data source, consumer UAVs (red, green, and blue (RGB) only), to study vegetation remains unknown. The purpose of most frequent uses of consumer UAVs is recreation. This paper tests the feasibility of using consumer UAVs for mangrove research and proposed a method for mapping leaf area index (LAI) of mangrove. A commercial UAV image is also used for comparison. RGB-based vegetation indices like Excess Green Vegetation Index (ExG), Negative Excess Red Vegetation Index (NegExR), Green Leaf Index (GLI) and Normalized Green-red Difference Index (NGRDI) were used to build regression models against field measured LAI. The results showed that it was feasible to use consumer UAV data for mapping mangrove forest LAI, and the NegExR achieved the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) in predicting LAI among all the indices. This paper showed that researchers who are neither familiar with aerial photogrammetry nor have access to commercial UAV data could perform high spatial resolution vegetation studies at a low cost.

AB  - With the continuous improvement of the spatial resolution of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), detection of ultra-high voltage (UHV) power transmission line in high-resolution SAR images has become possible. However, the backscattering characteristics of UHV power transmission line in a SAR image are significantly influenced by several factors including the span length and the radar polarimetry. In this paper, the effects of span length and radar polarimetry on the backscattering characteristics of UHV power transmission line are analyzed by using the high-resolution TerraSAR-X images. We first give a brief introduction to the imaging geometry of UHV power transmission line. Subsequently, for different angles between the satellite ground track and the extend direction of power transmission line, the effect of span length on the scattering characteristics of power transmission line is described. In addition, the intensity and pixel size of scattering spots, which are formed by the power transmission line in the co-polarized SAR images, are analyzed. The analysis results show that the span length mainly influences the distance between the scattering spot and the perpendicular bisector of the power transmission lines. Moreover, the backscattering from the power transmission line can be found to be much stronger in the HH polarized SAR images compared with the VV polarized ones.

AB  - Sanqi is a kind of medicine and food homogenous plant. It is one of the highland characteristic agricultural products that develops in priority of Yunnan Province and also pillar crops of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. It is of great significance for assessing the agricultural development in the region by grasping the planting information quickly. Remote sensing image has the characteristics of wide coverage area and short return period. Therefore, it has become an important mean to quickly understand agricultural situation on the help of remote sensing image to extract crop information. For this reason, based on the remote sensing images of the 30-m resolution Landsat 8 in Maguan County in October 2014, using the OIF best band combination and the maximum likelihood supervised classification method, the spatial information of the Sanqi distribution in Maguan County was extracted. The extraction result was analyzed with an accuracy of 82.3%. The results of extraction can better reflect the regional distribution of Sanqi in Maguan County, and also provide a reference to other regions that plant Sanqi.

TI  - Comparison of Different Machine Learning Approaches for Monthly Satellite-Based Soil Moisture Downscaling over Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although numerous satellite-based soil moisture (SM) products can provide spatiotemporally continuous worldwide datasets, they can hardly be employed in characterizing fine-grained regional land surface processes, owing to their coarse spatial resolution. In this study, we proposed a machine-learning-based method to enhance SM spatial accuracy and improve the availability of SM data. Four machine learning algorithms, including classification and regression trees (CART), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Bayesian (BAYE), and random forests (RF), were implemented to downscale the monthly European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) SM product from 25-km to 1-km spatial resolution. During the regression, the land surface temperature (including daytime temperature, nighttime temperature, and diurnal fluctuation temperature), normalized difference vegetation index, surface reflections (red band, blue band, NIR band and MIR band), and digital elevation model were taken as explanatory variables to produce fine spatial resolution SM. We chose Northeast China as the study area and acquired corresponding SM data from 2003 to 2012 in unfrozen seasons. The reconstructed SM datasets were validated against in-situ measurements. The results showed that the RF-downscaled results had superior matching performance to both ESA CCI SM and in-situ measurements, and can positively respond to precipitation variation. Additionally, the RF was less affected by parameters, which revealed its robustness. Both CART and KNN ranked second. Compared to KNN, CART had a relatively close correlation with the validation data, but KNN showed preferable precision. Moreover, BAYE ranked last with significantly abnormal regression values.

TI  - Emissivity image generation of Gaofen-5's thermal infrared bands using ASTER data

CP  - 5th International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)
CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - To explore the application of Gaofen-5's thermal infrared (TIR) data, algorithm development and validations needs to be conducted before its launch; and image simulation is necessary to provide datasets for such research. In this paper, using ASTER imagery as the data source, a simulation method is proposed for Gaofen-5's four TIR bands' emissivity images. For the first 3 bands, emissivity images are generated through translation models built on spectral correlation between emissivity of Gaofen-5 bands and those of ASTER bands. For the 4th TIR band of Gaofen-5, we propose a spectral matching and spectral mixing method for emissivity image generation. To test the feasibility of our simulation method, ASTER thermal infrared emissivities are simulated and then compared with their actual values. Average relative errors of these simulated emissivities are 4.04%, 2.98%, 1.74%, -4.02% and -2.79% in 5 ASTER TIR bands, indicating that our proposed method can be used for emissivity image generation.

AB  - Radiometric characteristics monitoring of optical remote sensing data is a very essential step that enables further quantitative study and application of the data. In this paper, long term vicarious radiometric calibration using ground reflected radiance-based approach was introduced in this study. A case study of Sentinel 2A multispectral imager (MSI) vicarious radiometric characteristics monitoring based on our proposed approach with an automatic observation system was conducted over a large scale desert at the Baotou calibration site in Inner Mongolia, China. And, twelve clear Sentinel 2A MSI scenes as well as ground measurements were successfully acquired during the year of 2017. Top of Atmospheric (TOA) radiance and reflectance were predicted with introduced approach from ground reflected radiance and atmospheric data. The long term radiometric calibration results suggests that the Sentinel 2A MSI display a stable radiometric performance over the calibration period. Vicarious and onboard radiometric calibration results were also cross compared with average relative error about 5%. Uncertainty analysis also show that the TOA radiance overall uncertainty is less than 3.5% due to the atmospheric characteristics, surface characteristics, and the calibration model uncertainties sources.

AB  - Whether the selection of remote sensing features can he performed effectively will directly affect the quality of classification results. This paper proposes a multi-featured modeling strategy for the desert/grassland biome transition zone to improve the classification accuracy, taking Luoshan area of Ningxia province in China as the studying case and Landsat 8 OLI images of three periods as data source. The sparse representation based on dictionary learning is used as a classifier in order to select the combination of optimal features according to the multi-featured modeling strategy. It shows that the combination of spectrum, vegetation, terrain, architecture and water information can effectively improve the classification accuracy and reduce the classification uncertainty in the desert/grassland biome transition zone, and the best identified feature combinations includes b1 similar to b7, NDVI, DEM, NDBI, VAR(b5), MNDWI. Then, the statistical analysis of land cover changes in the study area from 2013 to 2015 was conducted.

TI  - A Review of Turbidity Detection Based on Computer Vision
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Review
AB  - Computer vision technology has made great progress in practice in recent years, and it also has broad application prospects in turbidity detection. Turbidity detection plays an important role in water environment science, but popular turbidity detection methods have some limitations in aspects of cost, convenience, and space-time coverage. Based on above reasons, researchers are devoted to developing image-based turbidity detection methods as a complementary or even alternative to the popular turbidity detection method. However, the use of computer vision technology to detect turbidity is affected by many factors such as imaging system, feature extraction, model selection, and so on. Currently, there is no comparison and analysis of these methods in a framework. Therefore, this paper introduces typical turbidity detection methods based on computer vision in detail, with their principle, measurement range, accuracy, technical framework, and comparison. In this paper, existing studies are divided into four types according to different image sources, and seven image features mainly used in these studies are pointed out. The objective of this paper is to reviewthe development status, existing problems, future research directions of image-based turbidity detection methods, and establishment of a unified framework which includes principles, technical framework, and main equipment of imaging systems.

TI  - Scene Classification via Triplet Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scene classification is a fundamental task for automatic remote sensing image understanding. In recent years, convolutional neural networks have become a hot research topic in the remote sensing community, and have made great achievements in scene classification. Deep convolutional networks are primarily trained in a supervised way, requiring huge volumes of labeled training samples. However, clearly labeled remote sensing data are usually limited. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel scene classification method via triplet networks, which use weakly labeled images as network inputs. Besides, we initiate a theoretical study on the three existing loss functions for triplet networks, analyzing their different underlying mechanisms for dealing with "hard" and/or "easy" triplets during training. Furthermore, four new loss functions are constructed, aiming at laying more stress on "hard" triplets to improve classification accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the experimental results show that triplet networks coupled with our proposed losses achieve a state-of-the-art performance in scene classification tasks.

TI  - Ship target tracking based on a low-resolution optical satellite in geostationary orbit
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the low-resolution geostationary optical satellite for maritime surveillance, a complete processing algorithm including ship detection and ship tracking is proposed. Potentially ships are first detected by a constant false alarm rate processing and a morphological filter from the area of water. Image coordinates of ships are then corrected and transformed by using rational polynomial coefficients and high-resolution shoreline database. In the ship-tracking procedure, a convenient motion model based on geographical coordinates is established, and the multiple hypothesis tracking method is used to track ships for further removing false targets and getting motion states of targets ultimately. Our algorithm has been tested using GaoFen-4 (GF-4) satellite image sequences and the automatic identification system messages of ships. The results of the experiment show that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect and track ships in complex scenes and estimate ships' motion information accurately with the help of a low-resolution geostationary optical satellite.

TI  - Identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product with an object-oriented approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of 77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.

AB  - Arid and semiarid grasslands around the world are heavily suffering from shrub encroachment. However, the shrub encroachment process is still poorly understood, especially when historical data field samples are insufficient. High-spatial-resolution (HSR) remotely sensed data provides the only large-scale historical record of grasslands. This study investigated the population structure of Caragana genus plants, a typical shrub in the temperate arid and semiarid grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China. Shrub individuals were identified from HSR images and the age of shrub individuals were estimated, then a caragana population age structure which can calculate mortality and regeneration was established with a negative exponential function.

TI  - Variations of Laohugou Glacier No. 12 in the western Qilian Mountains, China, from 1957 to 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers were solid reservoirs and important water resources in western China, but they were retreating significantly in context of global warming. Laohugou Glacier No. 12 was the largest valley glacier in Qilian Mountains. In this study, realtime kinematic (RTK) data, topographic map and WorldView-2 satellite imagery were used to measure changes in terminus, extent and volume of Laohugou Glacier No. 12. Results showed that Laohugou Glacier No. 12 was shrinking significantly since 1957. From 1960 to 2015, the terminus reduction of Laohugou Glacier No. 12 was 402.96 m (3.99%) in total, and glacier length decreased to 9.7 km from 10.1 km. Reduction of glacier area and volume were the most obvious. From 1957 to 2015, glacier area and volume decreased by 1.54 km2 (7.03%) and 0.1816 km(3), respectively. Reduction trend of terminus and area was slowing in 1950 - 1980s, even stable for a period in the mid-1980s, and then accelerated. Ice core analysis result and nearly meteorological station data shown an increasing trend of temperature in 1957 - 2015, it was a main reason of continuous retreating of Laohugou Glacier No.12.

AB  - This study aims to assess multidimensional poverty at the county level in Hebei Province in 2015 through a new method using NPP/VIIRS nighttime light composite data, and to put forward constructive suggestions for the government's policy on poverty alleviation. The eradication of poverty is a major mission of the Chinese government. Accurate measurements and identifications of poor regions critically influence both research and policy. Here we demonstrate an accurate and inexpensive method to assess multidimensional poverty from satellite imagery while reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce. This study referenced the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach and constructed the corresponding multidimensional poverty index system. Taking Hebei Province as a sample, it established the logarithmic model between the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and the average nighttime light index (ANLI). The method of this paper can provide an important reference for the Chinese government to identify and evaluate the accurate poverty alleviation in the future. It is feasible to use nighttime light data to assess the multidimensional poverty of China. In the future, we can use nighttime light data to monitor and predict the multidimensional poverty in a long and dynamic way.

TI  - Estimation of net primary productivity of forests by modified CASA models and remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase the accuracy of predicting net primary productivity (NPP), in this study, Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model was modified by developing new methods to estimate absorbed photosynthetically active radiation or fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and water stress coefficient (WSC). In the modified model, FPAR was derived based on its non-linear relationship with leaf area index. Moreover, WSC was estimated using leaf water potential from soil moisture instead of a traditional evapotranspiration-based method. This study was conducted in Baiyun District area of Guangzhou, China, using Gaofen-1 (GF-1), Landsat 7, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. The predictions from the original and three modified CASA models and MODIS NPP product MOD17A3 were compared with field observations. The results showed that all the CASA-based models led to similar spatial distributions of forest aboveground NPP estimates. Overall, the estimates increased with elevation because the valley bottoms were dominated by developed or urbanized areas whereas the hillslopes and hilltops were largely vegetated. Based on root mean square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE between the observed and predicted values, the CASA model that integrated the modifications of both FPAR and WSC increased the estimation accuracy of NPP by 8.1% over the original one. The increase in accuracy was mainly contributed by the modification of FPAR. This suggested that the modification of FPAR provided greater potential than that of WSC for improving the predictions of CASA model. Compared to the CASA models, MOD17A3 had lower accuracy of aboveground NPP estimates. This study also showed that the fine spatial resolution GF-1 image provided a new source of data used to estimate NPP of forest ecosystems.

TI  - Classification of marine bioregions on the east coast of South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine bioregional planning requires a meaningful classification and spatial delineation of the ocean environment using biological and physical characteristics. The relative inaccessibility of much of the ocean and the paucity of directly measured data spanning entire planning regions mean that surrogate data, such as satellite imagery, are frequently used to develop spatial classifications. However, due to a lack of appropriate biological data, these classifications often rely on abiotic variables, which act as surrogates for biodiversity. The aim of this study was to produce a fine-scale bioregional classification, using multivariate clustering, for the inshore and offshore marine environment off the east coast of South Africa, adjacent to the province of KwaZulu-Natal and out to the boundary of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), 200 nautical miles offshore. We used remotely sensed data of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a and turbidity, together with interpolated bathymetry and continental-slope data, as well as additional inshore data on sediments, seabed oxygen and bottom temperature. A multivariate k-means analysis was used to produce a fine-scale marine bioregionalisation, with three bioregions subdivided into 12 biozones. The offshore classification was primarily a pelagic bioregionalisation, whereas the inshore classification (on the continental shelf) was a coupled benthopelagic bioregionalisation, owing to the availability of benthic data for this area. The resulting classification was used as a base layer for a systematic conservation plan developed for the province, and provided the methods for subsequent planning conducted for the entire South African EEZ. Validation of the classification is currently being conducted in marine research programmes that are sampling benthic biota and habitats in a sampling design stratified according to the biozones delineated in this study.

AB  - Common data models (CDM) have enabled the simultaneous analysis of disparate and large data sources. A literature review identified three relevant CDMs: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) was the most cited; next the Sentinel; and then the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). We tested these three CDMs with fifteen pre-defined criteria for a diabetes cohort study use case, assessing the benefit (good diabetes control), risk (hypoglycaemia) and cost effectiveness of recently licenced medications. We found all three CDMs have a useful role in planning collaborative research and enhance analysis of data cross jurisdiction. However, the number of pre-defined criteria achieved by these three CDMs varied. OMOP met 14/15, Sentinel 13/15, and PCORI 10/15. None met the privacy level we specified, and most of the other gaps were clinical and cost outcome related data.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates innovative ways that outdoor educators can actively promote young participants' authentic voice in educational research and, in turn, increase our understanding of their worldview through accurately recording what children are seeing, hearing, doing, and touching when they are beyond our researcher's gaze. The study was conducted with an Australian primary school class who completed a 1-year place-based outdoor learning program. It employed a novel research design wherein video footage was obtained from body-worn cameras mounted on the chests of the children. The footage depicts first-person visual and audio data from children's viewpoints and deepens our understanding of children's learning experiences. Additional data included observations, curriculum work samples, academic results, interviews, and student-generated photographs. Results highlight that footage provides unique insights regarding triangulating findings on student learning experiences. Body-worn cameras may be used to enhance young people's participation in research when integrated into a broader child-friendly approach.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of modern literary utopias. The relevance of the study is determined by the state of the active process of re-evaluation of the past and the formation of the image of the future in the modern public consciousness of Russia. The novelty of the study is determined by the lack of knowledge of the utopia of the 21st century. The thematic and substantial evolution of utopias is considered, their connection with transformations of public historical consciousness is revealed. The characteristic of the main stages of development of public historical consciousness of Russia in 1990-2010 is presented. The analysis of utopian variants of development of history of Russia, represented in the works of art of the beginning of the 21st century, is made. The direct object of the analysis was the works by X. van Zaychik (V. Rybakov, I. Alimov) "Eurasian Symphony," by E. Chudinova "The Winners," by A. Barenberg "Firstly The Planes" and S. Buratovsky "Yesterday There Will Be War." Utopian projects presented in modern historical fiction are analyzed. The characteristic of counterfactual modeling as a method of representation of the concept of history is given. The author raises the question of the specifics of modern readership and functions of historical fiction in the public consciousness. The results of the comparative analysis of the "monarchic" and "Soviet" version of utopias of the beginning of the 21st century are presented. The ratio of conservative and modernist components in the worldview of the authors is revealed. New features of images of Stalin and Beria in modern historical fiction are shown.

TI  - Regional-scale monitoring of cropland intensity and productivity with multi-source satellite image time series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of growing populations and limited resources, the sustainable intensification of agricultural production is of great importance to achieve food security. As the need to support management at a range of spatial scales grows, decision-support tools appear increasingly important to enable the timely and regular assessment of agricultural production over large areas and identify priorities for improving crop production in low-productivity regions. Understanding productivity patterns requires the timely provision of gapless, spatial information about agricultural productivity. In this study, dense 30-m time series covering the 2004-2014 period were generated from Landsat and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images over the irrigated cropped area of the Fergana Valley, Central Asia. A light-use efficiency model was combined with machine learning classifiers to assess the crop yield at the field level. The classification accuracy of land cover maps reached 91% on average. Crop yield and acreage estimates were in good agreement (R-2=0.812 and 0.871, respectively) with reported yields and acreages at the district level. Several indicators of cropland intensity and productivity were derived on a per-field basis and used to highlight homogeneous regions in terms of productivity by means of clustering. Results underlined that regions with lower water-use efficiency were not only located further away from irrigation canals and intake points, but also had limited access to markets and roads. The results underline that yield could be increased by roughly 1.0 and 1.4t/ha for cotton and wheat, respectively, if the access to water would be optimized in some of the regions. The minimum calibration requirement of the method and the fusion of multi-sensor data are keys to cope with the constraints of operational crop monitoring and guarantee a sustained and timely delivery of the agricultural indicators to the user community. The results of this study can form the baseline to support regional land- and water-resource management.

The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 30 m topographical data, gridded rainfall (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) data, station based potential evapotranspiration (PET) and IRS P6 LISS-III satellite data of year 2000 (used for land use classification) were taken as distributed input into the model. The model parameters were calibrated on grid size 500m x 500m using stream flow data of flood year 1994, and further, validated for independent data of flood years 1998 and 2007. The model performance was quantitatively assessed using statistical indicators, RMSE (=168.3- 175.7 m(3)/s and 20.5-15.9 mm), NSE (=0.69-0.68 and 0.89-0.87), and r (=0.78-0.77 and 0.96-0.94) on daily as well as monthly time scales respectively, during calibration and validation periods. The calibrated model would be useful for prediction of runoff and stage along Tapi River at Hathnur Dam, India.

AB  - Local and large-scale upwellings in the Kerch Strait and in the Black Sea adjacent waters are considered based on the contact and satellite data. The spatial scales and the temporal variability characteristics of these phenomena as well as regularities of thermohaline field transformation are identified. It is shown that a stable northwestern wind generates local upwelling pockets in the southern and central areas of the Kerch Strait. Quite a rare natural phenomenon when a wind-generated local upwelling induces temperature rise in the coastal waters is described. The upwelling observed in late September is accompanied by water temperature growth in the strait. It is revealed that the Black Sea subsurface waters that flow to the strait within the upwelling circulation system and that are of total suspended and dissolved organic matters low concentrations, contribute to improving water quality. Large-scale upwelling is originated in the Feodosiya Gulf; its influence extends to the Kerch Strait and to a wide strip along the eastern coast of the Crimea. The cycle of this kind of upwelling varies within the range of 1-8 days. Maximum frequency is typical for an upwelling cycle of about 24 hours. Considerably variable on interannual scale temporal characteristics of a large-scale upwelling off the eastern coast of the Crimea and in the Kerch Strait are shown on the quantitative level.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Whiting events, or waters with high concentrations of fine-grained calcium carbonate, have been previously reported in southwest Florida using three years of observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Here, the initial case study has been expanded to 13 years (2003-2015) with a statistical analysis that includes environmental data to document and understand longer term temporal and spatial variability of whiting occurrence in the same region. Annual mean whiting coverage (km(2)) peaked in 2011 and 2012, with the highest daily coverage in 2008 (126.0 km(2)). Over the time series, whiting events showed spatial variability based on distance from shore. Whiting seasonality also varied within the extended time series. Multivariate linear and non-linear regressions between mean whiting coverage (km(2)) and several environmental variables (wind speed, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and nearby river discharge) were performed over the entire study region as well as subregions based on spatial division from the coast line. Statistically significant correlations have been found with sea surface temperature and river discharge in subregions. These findings suggest that although observing spatial and temporal patterns of whiting events is possible with modern satellites, understanding the mechanisms regulating their initiation and maintenance is more difficult.

AB  - The cloud variability and regime transition from stratocumulus to cumulus across the sea surface temperature front in the Kuroshio region over the East China Sea are important regional climate features and may affect the Earth's energy balance. However, because of large uncertainties among available cloud products, it is unclear which cloud datasets are more reliable for use in studying the regional cloud features and in validating cloud simulations in the region by climate models. In this study, the monthly low cloud amount (LCA) and total cloud amount (TCA) datasets in the region from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) are validated against the combined product of CloudSat + CALIPSO (CC) in terms of consistency and discrepancy in the climatologically mean, seasonal cycle, and interannual variation. The results show that LCA and TCA derived from MODIS and CALIPSO present relatively high consistency with CC data in the climatological annual mean and show similar behaviors in seasonal cycle. The consistency in LCA between the three datasets and the CC is generally good in cold seasons (winter, spring, and fall) but poor in summer. MODIS shows the best agreement with CC in fall, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 at a confidence level over 99 %. CALIPSO and MODIS can provide a competitive description of TCA in all seasons, and ICOADS is good in terms of the climatological seasonal mean of TCA in winter only. Moreover, the interannual variation of LCA and TCA from all datasets is highly correlated with that from CC in both winter and spring with the Matching Score ranging between 2/3 and 1. Further analysis with long-term data suggests that both LCA and TCA from ICOADS and MODIS can be good references for studies of cloud interannual variability in the region.

AB  - Remote sensing data provides scientists with synoptic coverage of the Earths surface, allowing us to understand its system dynamics in a way that would be impossible with more direct observation. As more satellites have been deployed in recent years, imagery has become more readily available and diverse, encompassing a wider range of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions than ever before. While these data better inform our understanding of the Earth, anyone hoping to leverage this information is hampered by the large size and complexity of these datasets, a lack of easily accessible computing resources, and the broad expertise required to correctly interpret the imagery.To fully leverage the information in these disparate datasets, data fusion methods must be implemented that abstract access to them. Large scale fusion of geospatial data, using physically based and statistical methods, can be accomplished to create a living model of the earth. This presentation will discuss the Descartes Labs approach to data fusion and normalization as well as our effort to leverage these capabilities toward a synoptic earth model. Topics will include the current status of the physical normalization algorithms deployed into the Descartes Labs Platform as well as efforts to harmonize and abstract access to multi-vendor constellations.

AB  - The recent impulse in development of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies has simplified the application of this in multiple research areas. This simplification was not favorable before, due to the limitations in dimensionality, processing time, computational resources, among others. Working with multispectral remote sensing (RS) images, in an artificial neural network (NN) was quite complex. Due the methods used required millions of processes that took a long time to be executed and produce competitive results compared with the state of the art (SoA). Deep learning (DL) strategies have been applied to alleviate these limitations and have greatly improved the use of neural networks. Therefore, this paper presents the analysis of DL-NNs to perform semantic segmentation of multispectral RS images. Images are captured by the constellation of satellites Sentinel-2 from the European Space Agency. The objective of this research is to classify each pixel of a scene into five categories: 1-vegetation, 2-soil, 3-water, 4-clouds and 5-cloud shadows. The selection of spectral bands for the formation of input datasets for segmentation of these classes is very important. The spectral signatures of each material aid to discern among several classes. Results presented in this work, show that the AI strategy proposed offer better accuracy segmentation than other methods of the SoA in competitive processing time.

TI  - Genetic parameters for milk urea concentration and milk traits in New Zealand grazing dairy cattle
T2  - New Zealand Journal of Animal Science and Production
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for milk urea (MU), yields of milk (MY), fat (FY), crude protein (CPY) and lactose (LY), concentrations of fat (FP), crude protein (CPP) and lactose (LP) and efficiency of crude protein utilisation (ECPU) in grazing dairy cows. Data consisted of 1284 herd-test records of milk traits and MU from 468 mixed-breed cows in two herds. Univariate and bivariate repeatability animal models were used to estimate heritabilities (h(2)) and genetic (r(G)) and phenotypic (r(p)) correlations among the traits. Estimates of h(2) for MU and ECPU were 0.24 and 0.11, whereas h(2) estimates for MY, FY, CPY and LY ranged from 0.10 to 0.20. Estimates of h(2) for FP, CPP and LP were 0.37, 0.59 and 0.19, respectively. The estimates of r(P) for MU with other traits were near zero. The r(G) of MU with MY (0.38), and of MU with LY (0.31) were positive and significant (P<0.01) whereas the r(G) of MU with FP (-0.80), CPP (-0.66) and LP (-0.76) were negative and significant (P<0.01). The r(G) between MU and ECPU was -0.09. These estimates of genetic parameters can be used to predict genetic responses to selection for reduction of MU.

TI  - The Use of Insecticide-Treated Curtains for Control of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and Dengue Virus Transmission in "Fraccionamiento" Style Houses in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are major public health threats in the tropical and subtropical world. In Mexico, construction of large tracts of "fraccionamientos" high density housing to accommodate population growth and urbanization has provided fertile ground for Ae. aegypti-transmitted viruses. We investigated the utility of pyrethroid-treated window curtains to reduce both the abundance of Ae. aegypti and to prevent dengue virus (DENV) transmission in fraccionamiento housing. Windows and doors of fraccionamiento homes in urban/suburban areas, where Ae. aegypti pyrethroid resistance associated with the Ile1016 knock down resistance (kdr) mutation in the voltage gated sodium channel gene was high, and in rural areas, where kdr resistance was low, were fitted with either insecticide-treated curtains (ITCs) or non-treated curtains (NTCs). The homes were monitored for mosquito abundance and DENV infection. ITCs reduced the indoor abundance of Ae. aegypti and the number of DENV-infected mosquitoes in homes in rural but not in urban/suburban study sites. The presence of non-treated screens also was associated with reduced numbers of mosquitoes in homes. "Super-infested" homes, yielding more than 50 mosquitoes, including DENV-infected mosquitoes, provide a significant public health risk to occupants, visitors, and people in neighboring homes.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - COSMO-SkyMed di Seconda Generazione (CSG) will ensure operational continuity to the currently operating "first generation" CSK constellation. The CSG constellation will consist of two satellites in Low Earth Orbit equipped with an X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The CSG program is managed and co-financed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the Italian Ministry of Defence. A wider portfolio of Spotlight imaging modes is offered with respect to CSK, among which there are new Spotlight civilian sub-metric modes. Furthermore, products acquired with squinted attitude (i.e. mean pitch angle during the acquisition different by zero) or with multi-swath approach could be used to serve more requests in a defined area, that otherwise could not be served because of conflict for time gap violation. Upgraded Spotlight focusing algorithms have been developed in order to correctly manage side-effects on the SAR Impulse Response Function (IRF) image quality depending on the long integration time and squinted geometry. The paper presents the new Spotlight processing algorithm enhancements providing details about design, implementation and verification results. Image quality and processor time performances have been assessed by simulated data representative of the various operational Spotlight CSG acquisition modes.

AB  - The increasing number of directional wave spectra from satellites is a very important opportunity for the improvement of operational wave forecast. This will lead to a better understanding of swell dissipation which is still a top task in wave modeling. This work aims to investigate how the assimilation of different sources of directional wave spectra will impact the analysis and forecast of wave parameters. Two satellites, sentinel-1A and 1B, provide the level 2 SAR wave spectra, which have been qualified for operational use regarding to the calibration/validation phase developed in the last two years. This year the launch of the satellite CFOSAT will ensure a third source directional wave spectra from the real aperture radar SWIM and a significant wave height at nadir look. Synthetic wave data of SWIM and wave spectra from S1A and S1B are assimilated conjointly in the wave model MFWAM for 1 cycle of 13 days during the southern winter season. Two sets of synthetic SWIM data with and without instrumental errors have been tested in the assimilation. The validation of the results with altimeters significant wave heights shows a significant impact in the periods of analysis and forecast. In this study we also investigated the impact of instrumental errors provided by SWIM simulator and the wavelength cut-off on the assimilation results.

TI  - Detecting and mapping levels of <i>Gonipterus scutellatus</i>-induced vegetation defoliation and leaf area index using spatially optimized vegetation indices
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Gonipterus scutellatus outbreaks may severely defoliate Eucalyptus plantations growing in South Africa. Therefore, detecting and mapping the severity and extent of G. scutellatus defoliation is essential for the deployment of suppressive measures. In this study, we tested the utility of spatially optimized vegetation indices and an artificial neural network in detecting and mapping G. scutellatus-induced vegetation defoliation, using both visual estimates of percentage defoliation and optical leaf area index (LAI) measures. We tested both field methods to determine which of the two were more superior in detecting vegetation defoliation using optimized vegetation indices. These indices were computed from a WorldView-2 pan-sharpened image, which is characterized with a 0.5-m spatial resolution and eight spectral bands. The indices were resampled to spatial resolutions that best represented levels of G. scutellatus-induced defoliation. The results showed that levels of defoliation, using visual percentage estimates, were detected with an R-2 of 0.83 and an RMSE of 1.55 (2.97% of the mean measured defoliation), based on an independent test data-set. Similarly, LAI subjected to defoliation was detected with an R-2 of 0.80 and an RMSE of 0.03 (0.06% of the mean measured LAI), based on an independent test data-set. Therefore, the results indicate that the cheaper less-complicated visual percentage estimates of defoliation was the more superior model of the two. A sensitivity analysis revealed that NDRE, MCARI2 and ARI ranked as the top three most influential indices in developing both percentage defoliation and LAI models. Furthermore, we compared the optimized model with a model developed using the original image spatial resolution. The results indicated that the optimized model performed better than the original 0.5-m spatial resolution model. Overall, the study showed that vegetation indices optimized to specific spatial resolutions can effectively detect and map levels of G. scutellatus-induced defoliation and LAI subjected to defoliation.

AB  - Sen2Cor is a Level-2A processor designed to correct Sentinel-2 Level-1C products from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver a Level-2A surface reflectance product. A key-parameter for accurate atmospheric correction is the knowledge of the spatially and temporally very variable aerosol content of the atmosphere The multi-spectral instrument on board Sentinel-2 has the appropriate spectral bands to derive the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of the atmosphere, provided the image contains reference areas of known reflectance behavior, preferably dense dark vegetation (DDV). If the granule contains no DDV pixels, a fallback solution is required. The former solution was to generate an AOT map based on the start visibility set in the configuration file. In this updated Sen2Cor version, meteorological AOT estimates are retrieved from ECMWF ftp server and pre-processed. The integration and assimilation of ECMWF aerosol estimates into Sen2Cor atmospheric correction is described and recent validation results are presented.

TI  - Trends in vegetation greenness dynamics in protected areas across borders: what are the environmental controls?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring temporal trends in ecosystem functioning of protected areas (PAs) provides important knowledge of local and regional ecological responses to both environmental and anthropogenic drivers of change. Understanding such changes constitute a great global effort to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services. We characterized the inter-annual trends of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) seasonal dynamics in the PAs of southern Spain and northern Morocco. We used a time series of satellite images of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Terra sensor from January 2001 to December 2012. The EVI inter-annual trends were grouped into four patterns of trends. Patterns of trends in the EVI seasonal dynamics may be climate driven in the PAs of both countries. However, socioecological processes might be an additional underlying cause of the patterns of trends in the EVI seasonal dynamics of Moroccan PAs and Spanish wetland PAs. The use of remote sensing to monitor temporal trends in ecosystem functioning should be considered to understand the ecological responses to drivers of change in natural ecosystems.

TI  - "TSEVNITSA" ("PANPIPE") BY M. LERMONTOV: FEATURES OF THE GENRE
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the poem "Panpipe" ("Tsevnitsa") by M. Lermontov and its genre nature. In understanding of the literary genre, the article relies on N. L. Leiderman's concept. It draws attention to the fact that at the heart of any genre lies a certain canon that carries in itself the memory of the prototypes or archetypes that were formed in the earliest epoch of the existence of human consciousness. The author of the article is convinced by N. L. Leiderman's idea about the existence of more or less stable types of content characteristic of specific genres. Genre content is characterized by such aspects as subject matter, problems, aesthetic pathos and the extent of the scope of reality, and is conditioned by the generic meaning that specifies the relationship between the man and the world. Following S. I. Ermolenko, the author believes that the structure of the lyric genre is determined by a flexible but stable relationship between the type of lyric subject (the type of subject organization), the nature of the intonational-melodic system and the background associated with each genre. The meaning that is acquired in the structure of the lyric genre by the subjective organization of the text and the form of expression of the author's ideas is obvious. In the work of such poet as M. Lermontov, with his penchant for open confession, the problem of expressing the author's mind is even more important.The author reveals traditions of anthological miniature, elegy and epitaph in the poem "Panpipe". At the same time, the specificity of certain genre-forming elements functioning in the text does not allow to attribute the fiction to any one of these genres unconditionally. Interwoven with each other within a single poem, representative motives and images acquire an atypical meaning, complicating the text in the question of matching the canon.In addition, the specificity of genre structures revealed during the analysis leads to the formation of several subjects of consciousness within the "Panpipe". Each of them has its own vision of the worldview.The author believes that such an organization of the poem's text is caused by the complicated attitude of M. Lermontov to the genre tradition of an anthological miniature: when entering into polemics with it, the young author is forced to clearly present the object of discussion in order to convey the content of the dispute to the reader.

TI  - "THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF OUR NATIONALITY" IN THE WORKS OF FYODOR BUSLAEV
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to give a general idea of the role of Fyodor Buslaev in formation and development of Russian philology. The author speaks about the innovative nature of Buslaev's understanding of the role of science as one of the most important factors of social consciousness and self-awareness. Buslaev posed to the Russian philology the task of a holistic interpretation of the people's worldview, developed and proposed ways to solve it, laying the foundations of the comparative-historical method of scientific research, which he continued to improve throughout his scientific work. The article emphasizes the universal nature of Buslaev's scientific thinking, he perceives the phenomenon under study multifaceted, in the light of both linguistic and literary problems, and in correlation with the historical context. The merit of Buslaev is the affirmation of the high aesthetic and moral value of folk literature as the basis for the origin and development of written literature. As the leader of the mythological school, Buslaev defined the strategic direction of the development of Russian philology. His studies in the field of folklore have significantly deepened the notion of the specific nature of reality reflection in the main genres, and the scope of the regional peculiarities of the folklore existence. Buslaev introduced a large array of works of medieval Russian literature into scientific circulation; he laid the foundation of Russian medieval studies.Particular attention is paid to the independent, original approach of Buslaev to the solution of problems common to European philology. Seeking to study a genuinely popular world outlook, the scientist came to an understanding of its inner dynamics, conditioned by historical circumstances, he developed the concept of three periods of progress of folk poetry. The author prefers to talk not about the transfer of Buslaev to the position of the school of borrowing, but about the complication and enrichment of the comparative-historical method in his writings of the 1870s. Buslaev comes to an understanding of the multi-level nature of the connections between the creativity of different peoples, conditioned not only by genetic kinship or borrowing in the process of communication, but also by typological closings due to the similarity of the conditions of historical existence.

AB  - Based on the Temperature Independent Spectral Index (TISI) method, the inversion of land surface emissivity was performed with MODIS infrared data over the Taklimakan Desert. In the process of land surface emissivity retrieval, the RossThick-LiSparseR BRDF model and the modified Minneart's BRDF model were used to calculate the surface albedo. The retrieved emissivities were compared with MODIS emissivity products. The results show that the inversion error is small when the RossThick-LiSparseR model is been used, the average errors of the channels 31 and 32 are 0.0084 and 0.0023, respectively, and the emissivity decreases with the increase of the observation angle. By using the modified Minneart's BRDF model, the average error of channels 31. 32 are 0.0364,0.0259 respectively.

AB  - Automatic extraction of rural residential areas from high-resolution remote sensing images in large regions is a challenging task, because all kinds of background features, such as roads, green houses, and urban areas, must be excluded effectively by an extraction method. For the unsupervised methods of rural residential areas extraction, it is difficult to manually design features which are only sensitive to residential areas. At the same time, the supervised methods utilize training samples to obtain the discrimination between rural residential areas and the background features. However, manual labeling in large regions is tedious and time-consuming. The drawbacks of the existing methods for extracting rural residential areas limit their application in large regions. Therefore, we proposed a novel methodology for extracting rural residential areas in large regions based on fast acquisition of training samples and the fully convoluted network (FCN). A block-based method was proposed to extract rural residential areas rapidly and acquire training samples. Then, the large amount of training samples were used to train the FCN for rural residential area extraction. Finally, all ZY-3 satellite images in in the coastal area of Shandong, China were feed into the FCN, and the extraction result were obtained.

TI  - Analysis of the 2018 Hualien earthquake (Taiwan) by using SAR interferometry and pixel offset techniques

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Active and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring II

AB  - The local magnitude (ML) scale 6.22 earthquake struck eastern Taiwan on 6 February 2018. The epicenter was on the coastline near Hualien and caused a maximum shaking intensity of 7 in Hualien City, which was the most severely affected area. The crushed buildings and main surface cracks are distributed along the Milun fault, which is a oblique-slip fault. The earthquake is the largest of a sequence of events that affected the area over a period of days. In order to identify the surface deformation from Milun fault to coastal mountain range of Taiwan, we processed C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-2 interferometric pairs acquired across the earth- quake date, from both ascending and descending orbits. The Generic Mapping Tools Synthetic Aperture Radar (GMTSAR), and SNAPHU tools were used. According to the interferometric line-of-sight (LOS) displacement maps, the northwestern Milun fault moved of about 40 cm in the descending geometry, and about 0-10 cm in the ascending one, while the southwestern part of the fault moved 15-20 cm in the ascending geometry and is stable in the descending one. By combining interferometric LOS displacements derived from both ascending and descending acquisition geoemtries, just E-W and vertical displacement components can be derived. However, GPS and field survey results show northwards movements ranging from 50 and 70 cm over the Milun tableland, which is located on the eastern side of Milun fault. In order to provide SAR-based displacement measurements along north-south direction, we adopted the pixel-offset technique. The offsets along the azimuth direction were derived by computing the maximum of the amplitude cross-correlation of two SAR images, by using estimation windows of 128 x 128 pixel size. The 3D displacement was then computed by combining through least-square method the interferometric LOS displacements from ascending and descending acquisition geometry, and azimuth displacement component derived though pixel offset. Results indicate that, in the northern part of Milun tableland the maximum of E-W displacement reaches 60 cm, and that the whole Milun tableland moves northwards (up to about 60 cm) and upwards (up to about 40 cm). Moreover, the western side of Milun fault shows westwards movement, while Hualien city is affected by subsidence. The correlation coefficients in three directions between GPS data and 3D displacement are 0.81 (E-W), 0.89 (N-S), and 0.91 (U-D).

T2  - VIRUS EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-species transmission of viruses poses a sustained threat to public health. Due to increased contact between humans and other animal species the possibility exists for cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. By using conventional PCR amplification and next generation sequencing, we obtained 130 partial or full genome kobuvirus sequences from humans in a sentinel cohort in Vietnam and various mammalian hosts including bats, rodents, pigs, cats, and civets. The evolution of kobuviruses in different hosts was analysed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We estimated and compared time of origin of kobuviruses in different host orders; we also examined the cross-species transmission of kobuviruses within the same host order and between different host orders. Our data provide new knowledge of rodent and bat kobuviruses, which are most closely related to human kobuviruses. The novel bat kobuviruses isolated from bat roosts in Southern Vietnam were genetically distinct from previously described bat kobuviruses, but closely related to kobuviruses found in rodents. We additionally found evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses within rodents. Overall, our phylogenetic analyses reveal multiple cross-species transmissions both within and among mammalian species, which increases our understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity and the complexity of their evolutionary history.

AB  - The thawing time and lake ice completely covered time can directly reflect the climate change in the region, and the duration of the lake ice can also reflect the local climate change. The traditional field monitoring of lake ice requires a lot of manpower and material resources, and the timeliness is poor, so it is not suitable for long-term ice condition monitoring. Since 1960s, remote sensing image has been used because of its wide range, fast speed, low cost and so on. More and more widely used in all kinds of research, the long-term monitoring of lake ice can also use remote sensing monitoring. Based on the Landsat series of remote sensing data, the Neural Network Algorithm was used to study the remote sensing image of Namco lake in the lake ice segmentation. The lake ice condition of Namco lake was monitored from 1988 to 2016.

AB  - Much attention has been paid nationally and internationally to shifting cultivation in upland Myanmar since Forest Department of Myanmar indicates that it is the main underlying cause for deforestation. However, knowledge of the explicitly spatial pattern of forest lands affected by shifting cultivation, transition characteristics and the impact of shifting cultivation for Reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is scare. In this study, the scale, intensity and duration of shifting cultivation during 2002-2016 were detected by means of MODIS time series imageries using improved vegetation change tracker (VCT) based on Integrated Forest Z-score (IFZ) derived from the spectral-temporal properties of forest lands change processes.

AB  - As the carrier of economic activities, land resource is an indispensable production factor of economic development. Economic growth leads to increased demand for land and changes in land utilization form. Therefore, changes in land use and land cover can reflect regional economic development situations to some extent. This paper proposed a method to predict regional economic situations based on remote sensing images, in which land use and land cover data is extracted by remote sensing images classification. Taking Zhoushan City as study area, the land use and land cover information from 2000 to 2015 was obtained through Landsat satellite images and then was used to construct regional economic development prediction models for 7 economic indexes. The results showed that the prediction errors of gross domestic product, products of primary industry, products of secondary industry, products of tertiary industry, fixed assets investment, gross output value of fisheries, and total tourist income are 7.8%, 9.11%, 6.93%, 7.74%, 15.31%, 7.29%, 11.76%, respectively.

AB  - Land use/land cover change (LUCC) is the most direct manifestation of the interaction between human activities and the natural environment, which is of great significance to regional development, environmental change, and resource bearing capacity. As the first prefecture-level city in China that established by islands, the spatial-temporal variation of LUCC in Zhoushan City was analyzed by classification of Landsat images from 1985 to 2015. The results showed that: (1) Construction land expanded rapidly along the coastal plains, the area increased about 5 times mainly by developing cropland and reclaiming land from sea and tidal flat; (2) By reclaiming land from sea, there are different degrees of expansion along the coastline of various islands, 37.99 km(2) new land was obtained and nearly half of the land has been developed into construction land. (3) The area of cropland decreased significantly due to the occupation of construction land while the forest is well protected which has increased slightly in area.

AB  - Remote sensing images play a critical role in natural disaster prevention and damage estimation. With the fast advances in hyperspectral sensors, the hyperspectral imaging also known as imaging spectrometry is becoming a relatively recent trend. Hyperspectral images are expected to be more effective in object detection, environmental monitoring, urban growth monitoring, and damage assessment. In this paper, we present a 4 layers deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for soil detection by using the combination of 80 synthetic hyperspectral bands and its original 8 multispectral bands which are collected by the WorldView-2 satellite. Our experiment result shows that by using the combined 80 synthetic hyperspectral bands and the original 8 multispectral bands, the area under the curve (AUC) scores of our CNN model for soil detection on the three testing images has been improved by 7.42% in average from 76.26% to 83.48%, as compared to the result by using the 8 multispectral bands alone. We also applied the CNN model onto a set of high-resolution data which is created by pan-sharpening the original multispectral bands and its synthetic hyperspectral bands, which quadrupled the spatial resolution of the combined synthetic hyperspectral bands. With the increased spatial resolution of the combined synthetic hyperspectral bands, the average AUC scores of our CNN model was furtherly improved by 10.02% from 81.44% to 91.47%. This significant improvement indicates that by using the pan-sharpened synthetic hyperspectral bands, the performance of CNN model for soil detection has been greatly improved, the synthetic hyperspectral bands with increased spatial resolution is a great alternative in improving the performance of object detection and classification in remote sensing applications.

TI  - MONITORING LAND DEFORMATION DUE TO GROUND WATER EXPLOITATION AND RECHARGE WITH SBAS-INSAR TECHNIQUE
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Overexploitation of groundwater has become a major geological hazard all over the world especially in Changzhou City, China, which brought about land subsidence and finally affected the development of urbanization in this area. In this paper, we used X-band COSMO-SkyMED SAR data acquired from 2011 to 2012 and Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) to monitor spatially and temporally land subsidence/rebound information in Changzhou City. The InSAR result indicated that land subsidence occurred in area around the urban center (parts of Xinbei District and Wujin District), with the maximal subsidence rate of 49 mm/year at Xinbei District and 70 mm/year at northeast portion of Wujin District, respectively. The central urban districts (e.g., Zhonglou, Tianning, Qishuyan, etc.) exhibited a slight land rebound at an uplift rate of 4 mm/year. Levelling and GPS measurements were used to validate the InSAR measurements. The comparison result showed that InSAR measurement had a good agreement with levelling data, and the errors were less than 2 mm. Groundwater data was use to investigate the inducement of land deformation. We found that Groundwater withdrawal in the central urban districts has been generally prohibited since 2000, which has resulted in stabilization of land subsidence and produced a rebound in groundwater levels. However, excessive exploitation of groundwater still persists in the surrounding areas where considerable levels of subsidence occurred.

CL  - Miami, FL
AB  - In recent years, the API level 24 allow the user have access to the GNSS raw measurements including pseudorange, doppler and carrier phase, which opens a new era for precise navigation on smart devices. As we known, many manufactures produce smartphones that access raw GNSS measurements, like Google, Huawei, Samsung et al. Different manufactures may use different GNSS chipset, which may result in different performance of measurements and navigation.The objective of this paper is to assess the performance of different types of smartphones including Huawei Mate9, Huawei P10, Samsung Note8, Google Pixel2 and HTC U11+ in open sky area. All of these smartphones are declared to be able to track GPS, BDS, Galileo and GlONASS satellites and access the pseudorange, and the first-three can also output the carrier phase measurements .Firstly, the tracked satellites number, SNR and their NMEA results were compared with that from nearby Trimble-R10. The result shows that each types of smartphone has its advantages and disadvantages. The Huawei Mate9 and Huawei P10 tracked fewer BDS and Galileo satellites, but they can track many satellites from GPS and GLONASS. For Google Pixel2 and HTC U11+, BDS satellites can be tracked only sometimes and also some Galileo satellites for Google Pixe12. Samsung Note8 can receive satellite data from all operational GNSS systems stably, though the satellites number is fewer for each system.For Samsung Note8, Google Pixel2 and HTC U11+, the SNR of most trackable satellites is above 20 and just few of them are between 10 and 20, while for Huawei Mate9 and Huawei P10, many satellite can be tracked whose SNR is between 10 and 20. Statistics results of the NMEA show that the accuracy of NMEA from Huawei Mate9 and Huawei P10 is much better than that from the other three phones. The accuracy of NMEA form Huawei P10 is highest and its RMS are 1.77m and 0.99m in north and east respectively.Secondly, The analysis of double-differenced pseudorange residual indicates that the UTC 11+ performs worst and its doubledifferenced residual varies within +/- 50m, the other four phones are almost at the same level and vary within +/- 30m.Double-differenced carrier phase residual shows obvious duty-cycle for all these smartphones, which limit the use of carrier phase. As different smartphone has different implementations of duty-cycle, the clock behaviors were analyzed and compared with each other, which allow us characterize the duty-cycle of these devices. We concluded that the higher precision compensated for temperature variations (TCXO)Hardware clock is not continuous (turning on and off) during the non-tracking periods for Google Pixel2 and HTC U11+, while for Huawei Mate9, Huawei P10 and Samsung Note8, the TCXO is turned off and low-power consumed crystal oscillator (XO) is providing time.After a comparison of the positioning result with raw pseudorange measurements, we did not find obvious difference for the five devices, then the doppler measurements are introduced to smooth the pseudorange and it can improve the accuracy effectively.

TI  - Monitoring land deformation in Changzhou city (China) with multi-band InSAR data sets from 2006 to 2012
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over exploitation of groundwater in Changzhou city, China can cause land deformation, which in turn proves detrimental to the urban infrastructure. In this study, multi-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets (C-band Envisat ASAR, L-band ALOS PALSAR, and X-band COSMO-SkyMed) acquired from 2006 to 2012 were analysed using the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) time-series method to investigate the relationship between spatial-temporal distribution of land deformation and groundwater exploitation. Annual deformation rate inferred from multi-band interferograms ranges from -58 to 24mmyear(-1). Levelling-survey data were used to validate the multi-band InSAR measurements. The results showed that these two types of measurements were generally in agreement. Correlating groundwater-table and multi-band InSAR measurements at six groundwater-well stations showed that with the rise of the water table, the land rebounded. But in some areas with larger subsidence, continual subsidence was observed even though the water table rose after the prohibition of groundwater exploitation. This may have been caused by the hysteresis effect due to the consolidation of strata (especially for the creep deformation). Our study provides scientific evidence on the management of groundwater extraction and the assessment of land-subsidence hazards.

AB  - A new geophysical model function (GMF), called C_SARMOD2, has been developed to determine coastal wind speed. A total of 3078 RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A VV-polarized SAR images were collocated with in situ buoy measurements, which was used to derive transfer functions and then to validate the wind speed retrievals. The wind speeds retrieved by the proposed C_SARMOD2 model are more similar to buoy measurements with almost no bias and a root mean square error of 1.84 m/s. Two representative quad- and dual-polarization SAR images acquired from coastal regions are used as case studies to examine C_SARMOD2 performances. The case study and statistical validation results suggest that the proposed C_SARMOD2 has the potential to measure coastal wind speeds at sub-kilometer resolutions and also advocate for the necessity of revisiting the methodologies for ocean surface wind speed measurements in coastal areas.

AB  - The formation of surface urban heat island (SUHI) is one of the most common effects of the urbanization and its long time series analysis on fine-scale remains poorly understood. In this study, the diurnal and seasonal Landsat-scale data were obtained by using spatiotemporal data fusion (STF) method. We quantified the diurnal and seasonal SUHI and analyzed their spatial variations and possible underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrate the following: the annual mean SUHI varied markedly during the day and night, with a great deal of spatial heterogeneities. The SUHI differed greatly by season, characterized by a higher intensity in summer than in spring, autumn and winter during the day, and it is the opposite at night. Moreover, the negative correlation between land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed an amplifying effect of the developed areas for SUHI, while areas with a predominance of vegetation attenuated the effect of SUHI.

AB  - Han River is the water source region of the middle route of South-to-NorthWater Diversion in China and the ecological projects were implemented since many years ago. In order to monitor the change of vegetation in Han River and evaluate the effect of ecological projects, it is needed to reveal the spatial-temporal change of the vegetation in the upper reach of Han River quantitatively. The study is based on MODIS/Terra NDVI remote sensing data, and analyzes the spatial-temporal changes of the NDVI in August from 2000 to 2016 at pixel scale in the upper reach of Han River Basin. The results show that, the area with increasing NDVI between 0 and 0.005 per year accounts for 62.07% of the area of upper reach of Han River Basin, and the area with changing rate between 0.005 and 0 per year accounts for 26.65% of the research area. The area with significant decreasing trend only accounts for 2.76 %, while area significant increasing trend accounts for 13.47 %, and the area with increasing NDVI is much larger than the area with reducing NDVI. The vegetation index of each county is evaluated and found that, the areal proportion with significant decreasing trend in Hantai is the biggest, reaching 35.57 %. The areal proportion with significant increasing trend in Zhenba County, Ziyang County, Xunyang County, Zhashui County, Shangzhou District, Shanyang County and Yun County is larger than the others, and the areal proportions are more than 20 %. The largest areal proportion with significant increasing trend is in Shangzhou District and it reaches 31.11 %. On the whole, the area ratio in all districts and counties with increasing NDVI is much larger than the area ratio with decreasing NDVI.

TI  - Role of Sertoli Cell Proteins in Immunomodulation
T2  - PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Sertoli cell, over the past 30 years, have been elevated from simple mechanical elements to the rank of a "sentinel" in spermatogenesis. By delivering potent immunomodulatory and trophic proteins, Sertoli cells are unique cell type with a pivotal role in maintaining testis immune privilege and the immune-protection of the antigenic germ cells.Conclusions: The findings from SC transplantation studies utilizing experimental animal models of disease, demonstrate the presence of the same immuno-modulation properties and mechanisms at tissue and organ sites far from testis. The complex pathways that generate and maintain the immune tolerance involve the production of several immunomodulatory or immune-related proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, mediators of the inflammation, complement inhibitors or adhesion molecules.A better definition and understanding of these Sertoli cell proteins and the mechanisms of immuno-protection should help to elucidate their role in the spermatogenic process. The demonstration of their capabilities in transplantation experiments suggests that Sertoli cells may be good candidates in cell therapy for a number of cell-mediated chronic diseases.

AB  - Through the EU FP7 Horizon 2020 ECOPOTENTIAL project, a novel and innovative approach to classification has been developed, which is termed the Earth Observation Data for Ecosystem Monitoring (EODESM), and has been built on concepts behind an implementation of the Earth Observation Data for Habitat Monitoring (EODHaM) system generated as part of the EU FP7 BIOSOS project, applied to Very High Resolution (VHR) Worldview data. The EODESM system facilitates routine classification of land covers according to the Food and Agricultural Organisations Land Cover Classification System (FAOLCCS), translates these to other taxonomies (including General Habitat Classifications; GHCs) and facilitates routine detection of change and the generation of maps indicating the causes and consequences of such change.

TI  - An evaluation of contemporary savanna fire regimes in the Canastra National Park, Brazil: Outcomes of fire suppression policies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire has shaped plant evolution and biogeochemical cycles for millions of years in savanna ecosystems, but changes in natural fire regimes promoted by human land use threaten contemporary conservation efforts. In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes. The study has broader implications for conservation management in fire-prone savannas in South America generally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Stephan Lobachevsky was born on October 28, 1873 (Julian date) in the Vilshanka (Olshanka) village of the Elisavetgrad district (currently the village in Kirovohrad oblast) in the family of the Kherson eparchial archpriest Volodymyr Lobachevsky.The future historian had got his education at the Odesa seminary. During 1894-1898, he studied at the Kyiv Theological Academy and received the candidate degree. On September, 26 the bishop of Katerynoslav consecrated Lobachevsky as a priest.Since 1901, the father Stephan held the cathedra of catechesis at the 2nd Odesa boys' gymnasium. Since 1906, he was a board member of the Odessa seminary administration, an acting member of Cherson consistory, the fourth priest at the Odessa Cathedral of the Transfiguration of the Saviour (Spaso-Preobrazhenskyi) and the catechist at the Maria Gymnasium for girls.In 1907, the Kyiv Theological Academy council gave him a master of theology degree for a successful defense of dissertation which was his only valuable historical work. He also explored the issue of the religious indifferentism in his journalistic articles.Since 1921, Stephan Lobachevsky was supervised by the Cheka, then by the local GPU. The known criminal cases took place in 1921, 1922, and 1927. Lobachevsky transferred from Odessa Savior-Transfiguration cathedral to the Intercession (Pokrovska) church, and later to the Dormition (Uspenska) church.The final impact on Lobachevsky was made by the repressions against the church at the early 1930s. The Special Council of the OGPU on November 3, 1931, banned him to Kazakhstan for three years. The place and the year of his death were unknown, though he had already been dead to the time of rehabilitation in 1959.Lobachevsky was prominent as the author of fundamental research on the biography and doctrine of Saint Anthony of Egypt. His research on the Eastern monasticism founder started with the candidate dissertation at the Kyiv Theological Academy.The dissertation received the high mark. This gave its author the right to present the same, but upgraded work for a master's degree. Lobachevsky presented his text to the Academy council on March 13, 1906. His master's dissertation had the title " St. Anthony the Great (his life, writings, and moral selfless doctrine)". His defense took place only on May 11, 1907, as witnessed by the Academy council protocols. Up to this time, it was already published in Odessa in 1906.Lobachevsky's monograph consisted of the four parts. In the first one author presented the significance of Anthony in the history of Christian monasticism. The second part was dedicated to his detailed biography. Lobachevsky meticulously analyzed the smallest details and argued on discussions in the historiography. The key part is the third one, where the main results were presented. It was devoted to the problems of authenticity and authority of the texts considered to be St. Anthony's works. The last part contained the moral selfless doctrine of the Saint. Odessa priest's investigation was the first comprehensive study of the life and the worldview of the Egyptian hermit in the Russian empire.

AB  - One of the main barriers to increase the solar energy share is its intermittency. In this work, we compared ground observations in different timescales (1-, 5- and 30-minutes) with satellite effective cloud cover coefficient variability, with 30-minutes time resolution. The smallest discrepancies happen when analyzing the same timescale (30-minutes), where the Pearson correlation for all sites was up 0.94. However, when the frequency of the solar irradiance measurements increased, the correlation decreased. A solution may be the use of downscaling methods, which may be a topic for future work. The most important result achieved in this study was the development of a simple methodology for evaluating the surface solar irradiance variability using only the cloud cover obtained from visible satellite imagery. The results denoted that the proposed methodology is an interesting alternative to evaluate the solar irradiance variability over large areas with satisfactory accuracy, where no ground data is available.

TI  - Peculiarities of distribution and fishery of pelagic fish species in the autumn-winter period in the area of Mauritania
T2  - Trudy VNIRO
M3  - Article
AB  - Particular attention is paid to the description of cunene horse mackerel migration which has a determining influence on the fishery nature during this period. As a source material, daily vessel reports (SSDs), database on reconstructed trawling positions of fishing vessels, satellite data on sea surface temperature (SST) and information on length composition of catches according to the SSD data on the assortment of fish production were used. In the period under study, dynamics of the species composition shows a steady increase in the share of cunene horse mackerel in the catches yielded from August to March. The dates for beginning and ending of the migration of cunene horse mackerel and mackerel species associated with it in the waters of Mauritania are determined. The migration of fish from the Moroccan EEZ usually occurs in the interval between the first decade of November and the first decade of December, at the SST in the range of 20,5-22,5 degrees C. It ends in the period from the third decade of January to the third decade of February, at the SST within the range of 18,0-20,5 degrees C. Duration of the presence of cunene horse mackerel mass concentrations in the EEZ of Mauritania during the period of the autumn-winter migration fluctuated within 43-91 days averaging 67 days. It is shown that the migration of commercial concentrations occurs over the depths from 50 to 500 m, mainly along the border of the coastal zone prohibited for fishing. Therefore, even minor fluctuations in the channel of concentrations migrating to the east or west radically change the fishing situation. The most efficient fishery in the autumn-winter period is possible from December to January when the maximum daily catch volume and the optimum species composition of catches are noted.

AB  - We perform unsupervised domain adaptation for classification of remote sensing images by exploiting unsupervised manifold alignment approach. Manifold alignment method utilized corresponding points between domains to align data manifolds of source and target domains, where the corresponding points can be constructed by labeled information. Supposing labeled samples are not available in target domain, we proposed neighbor consistency (NC) constraint to select some target points that have reliable predictions. These points and labeled source data are then used to construct corresponding relationships, resulting in unsupervised manifold alignment. The neighbor consistency based unsupervised manifold alignment is denoted as NCUMA in this paper. Both multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NCUMA approach.

M3  - Article
AB  - We perform unsupervised domain adaptation for the classification of remote sensing data by learning a shared subspace in this paper. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is applied to each class, making the approach able to minimize the domain shift on a per-class basis. Furthermore, manifold regularization is employed to constrain the data manifold of both the source and target data to be preserved in the subspace. The manifold regularization in conjunction with the per-class MMD strategy is called manifold regularized distribution adaptation (MRDA) algorithm. Since the class mean of target data should be estimated by the predicted labels, we integrate spatial information and overall mean coincidence (OMC) method to improve the prediction accuracy, resulting in Spa_OMC_MRDA approach. Experimental results on both multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data indicated the good performances of the proposed approach.

TI  - Evaluating water conservation effects due to cropping system optimization on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation of the conventional double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize has caused serious problems regarding water resources and the environment on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain (HP), China. Reducing or replacing high water consumption crops (such as winter wheat) is the most impactful way to effectively save water in the HP region. In this study, crop coefficient and vegetation remote sensing data were used to estimate evapotranspiration (ETa for winter wheat and summer maize on the HP from 2009 to 2013. For early maize, ETa and yield were based on the results from the APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) crop model, which had been calibrated and validated using field experimental data. The effects on groundwater conservation and grain yield were estimated at the regional scale for the conventional winter wheat (WW) and summer maize (SM) double cropping system (Y1M2) and three alternative cropping systems: three harvests in two years system (Y2M3, 1st year: WW-SM; 2nd year: early maize), four harvests in three years system (Y3M4, 1st year: WW-SM; the next two years: early maize), as well as a continuous early maize monoculture system (Y1M1). The results showed that: (1) Relative to YiM(2), the water savings in each alternative cropping system exceeded 50% of the groundwater overdraft on the HP. The evapotranspiration of Y2M3, Y3M4 and Y1M1 decreased by 14%, 19% and 29% over that of Y1M2 (740 mm), respectively. The economic water use efficiencies (WUEe) of the alternative cropping systems were 7%-16% greater than that of Y1M2. The groundwater drop by Y1M2 (0.59 m year(-1)) was higher than that by Y2M3 (0.20 m year(-1)) and Y3M4 (0.07 m year(-1)), and the drop by Y1M1 was negative, indicating a groundwater rise of 0.20 m. The groundwater overdraft in Y1M2 was 160 mm (3.83 billion m(3)), and the alternative cropping systems were more sustainable, with groundwater overdrafts that were less than the recharge value of 128 nun on the HP. (2) In comparison with Y1M2, the total yield was reduced by 2.28, 3.04 and 4.56 billion kg a(-1) (or 7.7%, 10.2% and 15.3%) for Y2M3, Y3M4 and Y1M1, respectively, which accounted for < 15% of the regional total or < 1% of the national total. It is important to note that the yield loss of the alternative cropping systems was below the net grain export amount in Hebei province, so the grain supply and demand could be roughly balanced. (3) In summary, Y2M3 is a preferred alternative cropping system over Y1M2 in the near future because of the advantages of high WUEe, economic return, mitigated groundwater level decline and balance between wheat supply and demand on the HP. Y1M1, which had the least water use and highest WUEe and economic return, is an option for the most serious groundwater overdraft area despite a contradiction between the traditional dietary habit and complete abandonment of wheat. Y3M4 is recommended as the transitional cropping system between Y2M3 and Y1M1.The method in this study is applicable to relevant regional research, and the results can be of use to the government when formulating policies on cropping systems and groundwater management.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) estimation based on remote sensing data has often relied on the use of spectral vegetation indices from optical data. However, it is difficult to accurately estimate LAI due to saturation of spectral signals. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems have emerged as promising technologies for overcoming the saturation problem, and an increasing number of studies have been conducted on LAI estimation using LiDAR data. In this study, we compared the performance of LAI estimation using LiDAR height and intensity data, and explored the potential for estimating forest LAI using combined LiDAR height and intensity data. LAI estimation models were established using LiDAR height, intensity, and a combination of LiDAR height and intensity metrics based on a random forest regression algorithm. Our results show that the laser intercept index derived from LiDAR height or intensity data was the most important predictor for LAI. Field measurements of LAI at 64 sites were used to assess the power of various LiDAR metrics in predicting LAI. The results show that both LiDAR height and intensity metrics alone could reliably estimate forest LAI. However, compared to LiDAR intensity metrics [R-2 = 0.610 with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.664], LiDAR height metrics had a better predictive power (R-2 = 0.765 with RMSE of 0.562). Moreover, the combined LiDAR height and intensity metrics resulted in the highest LAI estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.809 with RMSE of 0.501). Therefore, the combination of LiDAR height and intensity data has a great potential for improving the LAI estimation accuracy.

AB  - Vegetation monitoring is important in earth science. It plays an essential role in biomass estimation, soil moisture retrieval, irrigation planning, and it also can help us better understand climate change, among others. Sentinel-1 data acquired since 2014 with a particularly short revisit period is well suited to monitor vegetation growth. In this paper, we analyze the temporal behavior of backscattering coefficients as well as the cross-pol ratio (VH/VV) of an agricultural area and a forest obtained from Sentinel-1A data. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from Landsat 8 data is used to roughly differentiate vegetated and non-vegetated areas. This study verifies the feasibility of Sentinel-1 data to vegetation monitoring, and gives the physical interpretation of the observed experimental results, which provides a useful information for the next phase of radar data applications, such as image classification.

TI  - Spectral Mapping Based on Panchromatic Block Structure Analysis
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusing panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images, i.e., pansharpening, can obtain a high-resolution MS (HRMS) image. In this paper, we propose a spectral mapping framework for pansharpening problem based on PAN block structure analysis (PBSA). The PBSA employs boundary, inner uniqueness, and neighborhood comparisons as block structure characteristics to classify the PAN image blocks into pureness composition and mixture composition. For the PAN blocks with pureness composition, they can directly copy the spectral information of corresponding MS pixels. For the mixture PAN blocks, assuming that they can linearly represented by some pure PAN blocks, their spectral signals can get via a weighted average from the relative pure PAN blocks. The experiments on real PAN and MS pairs show that the proposed pansharpening method not only conforms to the structure of the PAN image but also preserves the spectral information of the MS image. The final fused HRMS image shows good performance in visual effect and objective assessment.

AB  - In order to solve the problem that the geographic distribution of shared bikes does not match the geographical distribution of user needs, an automatic planning and scheduling method was established in this paper. Through effective rewards and penalties mechanisms, the motivation of users to participate in shared bike scheduling was motivated, and users were encouraged to regulate parking and optimize the overall state of typical areas, which in turn allows the shared bike to flee the "black hole" of the city, return to the hot spot area from the non-hot spots, and increase the utilization rate of the bike. In this paper, we have defined a new scheduling method and scheduling criteria, which distinguishes users into active scheduling users and passively scheduled users, thereby dividing different scheduling areas and seeking optimal scheduling points. The use of GPS positioning function to determine whether the user to regulate parking, ultimately through the reward and punishment mechanism for users to change the cost of riding so that the sustainable development of shared bikes benign.

AB  - The technology of Internet of Things(IoT) and remote sensing technology become more and more closely linked, and hyperspectral remote sensing data can be obtained through IoT. Hyperspectral image classification is a popular issue in the domain of remote sensing. It is possible to achieve high accuracy and strong generalization through good classification method is used to process image data. In this paper, an efficient hyperspectral image classification method based on rotation forest and extreme learning machine with kernel(ROF-KELM) is presented. The proposed method uses non-negative matrix factorization(NMF) to do feature segmentation in order to get more effective data firstly. Extreme learning machine with kernel(KELM) is chosen as base classifier to improve the classification efficiency. The proposed method inherits the advantages of KELM and has an analytic solution to directly implement the multiclass classification. Then, mutual information theory is used to select base classifiers with high correlation. Finally, the results are obtained by using the voting method. Two simulation examples, classification of AVIRIS image and the UCI public data sets respectively, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Coupled with the independent component analysis (ICA) and estimated thin-cloud reflectance data, an algorithm to remove thin-cloud effects on the operational land imager (OLI) data of Landsat-8 was studied. The algorithm was evaluated with a subimage extracted from Landsat-8 041/036 scene acquired on 16 March 2015. Thin clouds were effectively removed visually after the algorithm. In the algorithm validation, a cloud-free Landsat-8 image acquired on 1 April 2015 was selected as the "truth". Spatial correlation coefficients of the March image before the cloud-removal algorithm and April image and of the March image after the algorithm and April image were evaluated on the band-by-band basis. The coefficients increased significantly after the algorithm. Thus, the developed algorithm was quantitatively effective and valid.

AB  - Luoma lake is the fourth largest lake on Jiangsu Provice as well as the hub of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. With a widen sight, the lake is magnificent. Lakes are the carrier of regional water cycle and play the role of regional ecosystem. Human activities and natural factors greatly affect the expansion and contraction of the waters. Monitoring the area of water can provide a scientific basis for the local development. Compared with traditional optical remote sensing monitoring the area of water, all day, all-weather and high -resolution SAR images are playing a great role. SAR image interpretation using active contour model segmentation technique is an innovative method for measuring the area of water.

TI  - A Novel Bimodal Imaging Agent Targeting HER2 Molecule of Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanobubble (NB), a newly developed nanoscaled ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) for molecular imaging, has been widely researched for these years. Targeting it with functional molecule, nanobubble can adhere selectively to cellular epitopes and receptors outside the vasculature via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of tumor blood vessel. To enhance the targeting rate of our previous prepared NBs-Afiibody for HER2 (+) breast cancer imaging, we introduced a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye, IR783, in this study to enhance tumor-specific targeting rate and provide a promising modality for dual-mode imaging. The prepared IR783-NBs-Affibody presented a uniform nanoscale size around 482.7 +/- 54.3 nm, good biosecurity, and stability over time. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) of IR-783 was 15.09% in the conjugates leading to a successful NIR fluorescence and ultrasound enhancement imaging ex vivo. IR783-NBs-Affibody was able to automatically accumulate on BT474 cells with a highly increased targeting rate of 85.4% compared with previous NBs-Affibody of 26.6%, while Affibody-guided HER2 binding was only found in HER2-positive cell lines (BT474 and T-47D). The newly developed IR783-NBs-Affibody is characterized with favorable HER2 targeting ability and bimodal imaging capability for breast cancer. Thus, IR783-NBs-Affibody holds great potential in molecular diagnosis for patients with breast cancer.

M3  - Review
AB  - Fallopian tube carcinoma (FTC) accounts for a very small portion of female genital malignancies. Here the authors report a rare case of diagnosed FTC in a 52-year-old woman in April 2006. The patient underwent subtotal abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, partial rectectomy, and colostomy of sigmoid colon, and received 19 cycles of paclitaxel chemotherapy. hi February 2009, recurrent carcinoma in the remnant cervix was found, with invasion of the bladder and left ureter. The patient then underwent remnant cervix resection, left partial uretero-cystectomy, cysto-ureteral anastomosis, and stoma apothesis, and was treated with four cycles of paclitaxel. In March 2014, bilateral breast masses were palpated. Pathological findings suggested invasive carcinoma in bilateral lesions. Left modified radical mastectomy and right mastectomy with sentinel ipsilateral lymph node biopsy were performed. Further immunocytochemical evaluation of the surgical specimen confirmed the metastasis of FTC to the breast. The patient only received four cycles of docetaxel due to hone marrow suppression and left renal failure.

TI  - Contextual Analysis Based Approach for Detecting Change from High Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial contextual feature plays an important role in high resolution remote sensing image. A new approach based on local variance analysis is introduced to spatial contextual feature extraction for change detection in this paper. In the proposed approach, the change magnitude between the paired central pixels of a local area (e.g., a 3 x 3 sliding window) in multitemporal images depends on surrounding pixels in the difference image, and this change magnitude is quantitatively measured based on the standard deviation of the difference image within the local area. This difference image contextual property may be useful particularly when high-resolution images are used. Finally, the change magnitude image is classified as a binary CD map by using SVM. This proposed approach is applied to SPOT-5 multitemporal datasets and two QuickBird multitemporal images from two case studies, which are quantitatively compared and validated. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible.

M3  - Article
AB  - The nomad's model of the world is reasonable and rational; comprehending the universal laws, it often extrapolates its own qualities and structures to surrounding world (up to the cosmic scales). In creating the picture of a real world, the nomad endows it with meanings and values that go far beyond the ordinary everyday life. The aim of our research involves not only the depth of the study of certain aspect of historical and cultural era, but also the determination of the field of culture, where 'everything and everyone is connected'. It involves the determination of the role of nomadic spiritual culture in the world culture; the analysis of religion of the ancient Turks Tengrism; the relationship and mutual enrichment of Tengrism with a complex, multi-element nomadic culture. Without the study of cosmogonic conceptions of nomadic world, it is impossible to comprehend the spirituality, complex worldview of the ancient Turks.

T2  - STUDYING TEACHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In higher education, doctoral training has been identified as a process of stewardship development whereby individuals learn the knowledge and skills required to advance their respective disciplines. Self-study of teacher education practices is one approach that has gained the interest of doctoral students to help them understand their own development whilst also forging recommendations for others in publications. In this self-study, we worked to understand the experiences of Shrehan, a teacher from England beginning doctoral study in the USA. Shrehan had no experience teaching at the college level prior to moving to the USA, and she saw self-study as an opportunity to understand her development and acculturation into an unfamiliar system of higher education. Data were collected through journaling, critical-friend discussions, and artefacts, as well as student data in the form of surveys, exit slips, and focus-group interviews. Qualitative data analysis of Shrehan's experiences was guided by the four stages of acculturation theory - honeymoon, culture shock, adjustment, and recovery. Shrehan's journey emphasizes the importance of getting to know undergraduate students and building rapport as key aspects of teaching at the college level. Self-study provided Shrehan with a heightened personal-identity awareness that increased her cultural sensitivity and broadened her worldview. Results are discussed with reference to acculturation theory and future directions for research are provided.

TI  - LakeTime: Automated Seasonal Scene Selection for Global Lake Mapping Using Landsat ETM plus and OLI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat series of satellites provide a nearly continuous, high resolution data record of the Earth surface from the early 1970s through to the present. The public release of the entire Landsat archive, free of charge, along with modern computing capacity, has enabled Earth monitoring at the global scale with high spatial resolution. With the large data volume and seasonality varying across the globe, image selection is a particularly important challenge for regional and global multitemporal studies to remove the interference of seasonality from long term trends. This paper presents an automated method for selecting images for global scale lake mapping to minimize the influence of seasonality, while maintaining long term trends in lake surface area dynamics. Using historical meteorological data and a simple water balance model, we define the most stable period after the rainy season, when inflows equal outflows, independently for each Landsat tile and select images acquired during that ideal period for lake surface area mapping. The images selected using this method provide nearly complete global area coverage at decadal episodes for circa 2000 and circa 2014 from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors, respectively. This method is being used in regional and global lake dynamics mapping projects, and is potentially applicable to any regional/global scale remote sensing application.

T2  - DOKLADY NATSIONALNOI AKADEMII NAUK BELARUSI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the causes and mechanism of change in the climatic pause from 1998 to 2014. In particular, based on the satellite data and the meteorological reanalysis we found a relationship between the temperature of the tropical region of the Pacific Ocean, the speed of the surface wind, and the total content of water vapor in the atmosphere. We also showed that the climatic pause can be explained by a decrease in the water vapor content in the atmosphere and evaluated how this decrease affected the radiation balance of the ground surface. The observed dynamics of water vapor is shown to lead to a decrease in the incoming part of the radiation balance of the ground surface by an amount, which is more than one order of magnitude larger than that caused by the increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide. It was demonstrated that a decrease in the cloud cover optical thickness could also lead to the stabilization of the global temperature by means of radiative heating of the underlying surface.

TI  - Estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations over Beijing with MODIS AODs Using an Artificial Neural Network
T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Three years of Aerosol Optical Depths (AODs) retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and five meteorological parameters from the NCEP FNL reanalysis data, are used to generate an Artificial Neutral Network (ANN)-based nonlinear model for estimating the surface PM2.5 concentrations over Beijing. To increase the number of both the training and forecasting samples for better training results and to guarantee the continuity and representativeness of the samples, the MODIS AODs are gridded with seasonally dependent windows sizes. The past PM2.5 concentrations simulated by the ANN model are contrasted with the real observations for six years from 2008 to 2013. The results indicate that the ANN model can effectively simulate the surface PM2.5 concentrations, and the mean bias, correlation coefficient, and the root mean square error between these data are -16.10, 0.73, and 55.43, respectively. This study also demonstrates that the Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) is the most important meteorological factor in constructing the ANN model. Compared to the linear regression model using only AOD, the correlation coefficient can be increased from 0.68 to 0.76 with the ANN model by using both the AOD and the PBLH data.

AB  - While change of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is generally attributed to change of natural conditions, it is also important to evaluate the influence of human activities on lakes with the rapid increase of population in the plateau. Using a total of 786 clear-sky images of Landsat, we try to study the trend of lakes' area and shape in the TP and investigate the role human activities play. During the past 25 years, the area of lakes in the TP has experienced a rapid increase, and reservoirs and salt lakes also appeared to expand, but the shape and area of the lakes close to cities and roads have little change. In general, total 43 lakes affected by human activities increased 841.3 km(2) in the surface area, and all of them located in the northeast or southwest of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - With the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, the volume of image datasets in many application areas is growing exponentially and the demand for Land-Cover and Land-Use change remote sensing data is growing rapidly. The full complexity of the scenes and the interactive retrieval for the change information has become increasingly difficult. To address these challenges, this study proposed an improved SVM+ GA relevance feedback model in the remote sensing image change information retrieval. The proposed approach can take consideration of avoiding local maxima in the SVM kernel parameters optimization and the subset feature selection simultaneously by combining GA. The remote sensing image change information retrieval experimental results compared with the remote sensing image change information retrieval model showed that the proposed relevance feedback approach can achieve a promising result.

TI  - AN ASSESSMENT OF SURFACE SOIL MOISTURE BASED ON <i>IN SITU</i> OBSERVATIONS AND LANDSAT 8 REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we derived regional soil moisture (SM) using the latest Landsat 8 image and in situ soil moisture observations at the People's Victory Irrigation District, China. Landsat 8 image was used to construct the temperature-vegetation-dryness-index (TVDI), which integrates the vegetation index (VI) and land surface temperature (LST) to reflect the regional soil moisture conditions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) were used in this study to construct the LST-VI feature space. The correlations between the in situ soil moisture observations and the three TVDIs calculated via the LST-NDVI, LST-EVI, and LST-MSAVI were analyzed. The results indicated that the three TVDIs had a negative correlation with the soil moisture. Then the effective depth of the surface soil moisture was analyzed and found that the soil moisture at a depth of 0-200 mm had a stronger correlation with the TVDIs than the other depths. Finally, the retrieval models were verified by using the remote sensing and in situ soil moisture data on another day.

TI  - Simultaneous Estimation of Multiple Land-Surface Parameters From VIIRS Optical-Thermal Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods for estimating land-surface parameters from remotely sensed data generally focus on a single parameter with a specific spectral region, resulting in physical and spatiotemporal inconsistencies in current satellite products. We recently proposed a unified inversion scheme to estimate a suite of parameters simultaneously from both visible and near-infrared and thermal-infrared MODIS data. In this letter, we implemented this scheme to estimate six time-series parameters [leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, surface albedo, land-surface emissivity, land-surface temperature (LST), and upwelling longwave radiation (LWUP)] from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. Several components of these schemes are refined, including the incorporation of a snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function model, determination of the best band combination, and better estimation of the snow-covered surface emissivity by accounting for the snow-cover fraction. Validation using the measurements at 12 sites of SURFRAD, CarboEuropeIP, and FLUXNET, and intercomparisons with MODIS and Global Land-Surface Satellite products, are carried out: the retrieved albedo, LST, and LWUP achieved accuracies (R-2) of 0.77, 0.96, and 0.95, root mean square errors of 0.06, 2.9 K, and 18.3 W/m(2), and biases of 0.01, 0.09 K, and -0.08 W/m(2), respectively. The retrieved parameters can achieve comparable or higher accuracy than existing products, which indicates that the unified algorithm can be applied effectively to the VIIRS data with high physical and temporal consistency and accuracy.

AB  - This study explored the feasibility of mapping the canopy closures of mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam using Sentinel-2 multispectral composite image. Forest canopy closures were determined in accordance with the level of volume stocks. A method of object-based support vector machine classifier was first applied to derive LULC and then to differentiate the canopy closure over the mangrove forest. Results showed that object-based SVM classification was able to achieve an accuracy of kappa of around 0.73 which is around 0.2 higher than the kappa of a pixel-based SVM classification. However, there was a level of around 11%-24% commission rate and omission rate in the rich, medium, and poor classes of canopy closure. Further research to improve the performance of canopy closure classification is needed in order to obtain more accurate information for management planning.

AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important input parameter for many land surface models. The accuracy of satellite LST products directly affect its application; therefore, it is necessary to evaluate LST products. In this study, two satellite remotely sensed LST products, i.e. AMSR2 LST and MODIS LST, were evaluated against the in-situ LSTs at 17 ground sites in Heihe River Basin in 2014. Results show that both AMSR2 and MODIS LSTs have good correlations with the in-situ LST, with R-2 from 0.80 to 0.98 except at AR2 site at daytime. However, both of these two products have large systematic errors compared with the in-situ LST. The possible main reason is the scale mismatch between the FOV of the longwave radiometer and the AMSR2 and MODIS pixels.

AB  - High-precision DEM can be generated by SAR interferometry processing with GaoFen-3 repeat-pass data. This paper presents the first results from GaoFen-3 SAR Interferometry obtained with two interferometric SAR data pairs at the selected experiment sites. The temporal separations were 29 days. At the site the coherence requirements were met, resulting in high quality interferogram. The experimental results show that GaoFen-3 repeat-pass data have some good characteristics, such as high imaging quality, stable spatial baseline, high temporal correlation and spatial correlation, which has a good repeatpass SAR interferometry application prospect.

TI  - Large-scale estimates of gross primary production on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau based on remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetation gross primary production (GPP) is an important variable for the carbon cycle on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Based on the measurements from 12 eddy covariance flux sites, we validated a light use efficiency model (i.e. EC-LUE) to evaluate the spatial-temporal patterns of GPP and the effect of environmental variables on QTP. In general, EC-LUE model performed well in predicting GPP at different time scale over QTP. Annual GPP over the entire QTP ranged from 575 to 703 Tg C, and showed a significantly increasing trend from 1982 to 2013. However, there were large spatial heterogeneities in long-term trends of GPP. Throughout the entire QTP, air temperature increase had a greater influence than solar radiation and precipitation (PREC) changes on productivity. Moreover, our results highlight the large uncertainties of previous GPP estimates due to insufficient parameterization and validations. When compared with GPP estimates of the EC-LUE model, most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) GPP products overestimate the magnitude and increasing trends of regional GPP, which potentially impact the feedback of ecosystems to regional climate changes.

AB  - Accurate assessment of fire severity is essential for evaluating the economic loss and ecological impacts from fire, and forest restoration planning. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) can delineate three-dimensional forest structure at individual tree to forest stand level. Here we proposed a new method (tree crown Profile Area Change, cPAC) to quantify fire severity for individual tree from pre-and post-fire LiDAR data. Individual tree crown was firstly segmented from pre-fire LiDAR derived canopy height model. Fire severity was then calculated as the profile area change between pre-and post-fire height percentile curves delineated from LiDAR point clouds within each tree segment. We applied this cPAC method to assess the severity of the American fire, 2013 in Sierra Nevada forest, California, USA. Comparing with plot level field measurements, the fire severity quantified by our cPAC method was strongly correlated with insitu basal area changes (R-2 = 0.75), whereas other simple LiDARmetrics (canopy cover change R-2 = 0.36, tree height change R-2 = 0.37) or the Landsat imagery-derived difference in the Normalized Burn Ratio showed much weaker relationships (R-2 = 0.20). Although the general fire spatial extents were consistent, our cPAC method outperformed Landsat-based and other simple LiDAR-metrics in illustrating the tree biomass loss at finer gradient with higher precision.

AB  - In this paper, the 1 km Mixed Pixel Clumping Index (MPCI) was calculated using the 30 m HJ-1A/1B CCD data in the arid and semi-arid region, Western China. To validate the result, an indirect validation method was proposed. In this method, the 1 km effective LAI was retrieved from the satellite data using the PROSAIL model first, and then corrected to the true LAI with the MPCI data. The comparison between the retrieved true LAI and the MODIS product shows a significant improvement relative to the effective LAI. The correlation R-2 rise from 0.52 to 0.70 and the RMSE falls from 0.58 to 0.42. It indicates that the MPCI calculation is reasonable and valid for LAI retrieval from the satellite data.

AB  - Compared with conventional RTK, Network RTK possesses the advantages of wide coverage, high real-time positioning accuracy, high reliability and etc., which becomes a hot spot in the field of high-precision positioning with its wide application range. The positioning principle of BDS/GPS Network RTK algorithm and the processing strategies of observation errors are explored, based on which, the resolution algorithm of integer ambiguities of double difference carrier phase between reference stations for BDS/GPS is researched. Then a high-precision BDS/GPS error processing model is established within the coverage range of reference stations. Further, the error processing of the mobile station is made by using the method of regional error correction between BDS/GPS reference stations. After that, the integer ambiguity resolution method of BDS/GPS carrier phase in mobile station is studied. Finally a set of BDS/GPS Network RTK data processing software is developed according to the algorithm proposed in this contribution, which is analyzed and verified with measured dual frequency observation data of BDS/GPS. The results show that the network RTK centimeter level positioning accuracy of BDS/GPS can be effectively achieved by the proposed algorithm.

TI  - The healthcare seeking rate of individuals with influenza like illness: a meta-analysis
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Not all individuals with Influenza like illness (ILI) seek healthcare. Knowing the proportion that do is important to evaluate the actual burden and fatality rate of ILI-relevant diseases, such as seasonal influenza and human infection with avian influenza. A number of studies have investigated the healthcare seeking rate, but the results varied from 0.16 to 0.85. We conducted this analysis for better understanding the healthcare seeking rate for ILI, and providing fundamental data for researchers in relevant fields.Methods: In this meta-analysis, a total of 799 articles, published as of 13 December 2016, were retrieved from Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane, and 11 of them were included after screening. The pooled estimates and factors which influence healthcare seeking rates were analysed.Results: The overall pooled healthcare seeking rate was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.46-0.59). The rate was significantly higher during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 (0.61, 95% CI: 0.51-0.74), in children (0.56, 95% CI: 0.55-0.57) and in patients with documented fever (0.62, 95% CI: 0.53-0.72) than during non-pandemic periods (0.39, 95% CI: 0.33-0.45), in adults (0.45, 95% CI: 0.42-0.48) and in patients without documented fever (0.44, 95% CI: 0.38-0.50). Meta-regression indicated that these three factors could jointly explain 70.1% of the total heterogeneity among published studies.Conclusion: The healthcare seeking rate of ILI patients is needed for estimation of the burden of ILI in the general population based on data from routine ILI sentinel surveillance systems.

AB  - Using 12 periods RADARSAT-2 HH polarization data and combining with the Alpha approximation model, the soil moisture of the study area was retrieved and then compared with the MODIS retrieval results. Then, the DInSAR results of RADARSAT-2 were used to investigate the effect of high intensity underground mining activities on surface soil moisture. The study found that the soil moisture values of RADARSAT-2 had a good correlation with MODIS retrieval results. In the four comparison groups, the maximum correlation coefficient was 0.599 (p<0.01). The comparison among the 72 soil moisture values of the six mining subsidence areas and the non-subsidence areas in the study area in 2012 showed that there were 38 soil moisture values of the non-subsidence area was higher than that of the subsidence area, which indicated that the high-intensity mining activity had a certain negative impact on the surface soil moisture.

AB  - In this paper, we construct an enteromorpha remote sensing dataset. We take the eight channels data, from Band 1 to Band 8, in Landset 8 as spectral features of the dataset and consider the features extracted by Local Binary Patterns algorithm(LBP) and Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix algorithm (GLCM) as texture features. Combining these two types of features, we create a novel machine learning dataset including enteromorpha, land, seawater, and cloud samples. Then we use the single-channel threshold method and the multi-channel ratio method to label the entire data set pixel-by-pixel based on the feature of spectral characteristics and ground reflection spectra. Four classifiers are trained via Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Expectation Maximization (EM) and Stack Autoencoders (SAE) on our dataset respectively. A new classifier with a set of weight coefficients, which is called weighted classifier, can be obtained by combining above classifiers according to the accuracy of the four classifiers on all kinds of samples. Experiments show that the classification accuracy of these classifiers in our dataset are higher than 90% and weighted classifier reaches 93.59%. If we only focus on enteromorpha data, the best classifier is KNN classifier which has the correct rate of 95.8%.

AB  - The exchange of heat and water vapor between land surface and atmosphere over the Third Pole region (Tibetan Plateau and nearby surrounding region) plays an important role in the Asian monsoon, westerlies and the northern hemisphere weather and climate systems. Supported by various agencies in the People's Republic of China, a Third Pole Environment (TPE) Observation and Research Platform (TPEORP) is now implementing over the Third Pole region. The background of the establishment of the TPEORP, the establishing and monitoring plan of long-term scale (5-10years) of it will be shown firstly. Then the preliminary observational analysis results, such as the characteristics of land surface energy fluxes partitioning and the turbulent characteristics will also be shown in this study. Then, the parameterization methodology based on satellite data and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) observations has been proposed and tested for deriving regional distribution of net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux (evapotranspiration (ET)) and their variation trends over heterogeneous landscape of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) area. To validate the proposed methodology, the ground-measured net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux of the TPEORP are compared to the derived values. The results show that the derived land surface heat fluxes over the study areas are in good accordance with the land surface status. These parameters show a wide range due to the strong contrast of surface features. And the estimated land surface heat fluxes are in good agreement with ground measurements, and all the absolute percent difference is less than 10% in the validation sites. The sensible heat flux has increased slightly, and the latent heat flux has decreased from 2001 to 2016 over the TP. It is therefore concluded that the proposed methodology is successful for the retrieval of land surface heat fluxes over heterogeneous landscape of the TP area. Further improvement of the methodology and its applying field over the whole Third Pole region were also discussed.

AB  - This reported study was intended to advance the retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. A novel method was proposed by introducing the vegetation coverage into the Water Cloud Model (WCM) to improve the retrieval accuracy of the LAI. LAI is a strong indicator of crop productivity, and vegetation coverage has a strong relationship with the LAI (R-2 = 0.9733), a function can be created to express their relation. Finally, the accuracy in this innovative LAI retrieval method were evaluated. The results showed that the accuracy of estimation was improved greatly (R-2 was increased to 0.6055 and 0.6422 from 0.3491 and 0.3561 in VH and HH polarization). Thus, the method has operational potential for the LAI retrieval of crop in agriculture regions.

CP  - 9th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing - Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)
CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Supervised classification on remotely sensed data is a classical method to detect objects automatically and to update topographical datasets. To train the classifier, already labeled image data are needed. The training labels are typically created manually for parts of the given data, which is time-consuming and thus costly. Another approach would be to use the labels from an old and outdated dataset, called map, to avoid manual effort. Due to changes over time some of the labels might be wrong, and thus the used classifier has to be able to deal with that. In this paper, we apply label noise robust classification on two hyperspectral datasets using a simulated outdated map for training.

CL  - Oradea, ROMANIA
AB  - In this paper is investigated correlation LST-Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI-2), LST-Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) and LST-Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI). Land surface temperature is a very important indicator of the earth's environmental analysis. Vegetation indices combine reflectance measurements from different electromagnetic spectrum to provide information about vegetation cover on Earth. Iasi County is considered as study area in this research Landsat-8 OLI was used in this study for modelling. Images were taken on April 4th and September 27th 2017. The images were corrected radiometric and atmospheric. Between LST-EVI2 and LST-OSAVI are strong negative correlations, while correlation LST-MSAVI is positive. R-2 for all correlations have high values between 0.980 and 0.999. On September values for R-2 is slightly low that April. In conclusion, these correlations can be used to study vegetation healthy, drought damage and areas where Urban Heat Island can occur.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES E-LAND RECLAMATION EARTH OBSERVATION & SURVEYING ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although we often take the trees and plants around us for granted, almost every aspect of our lives depends upon them. They clothe us, feed us, provide us with oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and give us building materials and medications. Vegetation, in Iasi County - the study area in this paper, is predominantly of forest-steppe. In this study is investigating correlation LST - sparse/dense vegetation extraction from NDVI, in three different moments of 2017. Landsat 8 images, which have undergone pre-processing, were used as based date. A lot of papers showed that the surface temperature of the work was confirmed from Landsat 5/7/8. Many researches indicated that between LST and NDVI is a linear relationship. It is noticeable that correlation coefficient has closer values to 1 for relationship LST - NDVI dense; R-2 is about 0.9, while R2 is about 0.7 for relationship LST -NDVI sparse. In conclusion, this correlation can be used to study vegetation health, drought damage, and areas where Urban Heat Island can occur.

TI  - Above-ground biomass estimation for <i>Quercus rotundifolia</i> using vegetation indices derived from high spatial resolution satellite images
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of vegetation parameters, such as above-ground biomass, with high accuracy using remote sensing data, represents a promising approach. The present study develops models to estimate and map above-ground biomass of Mediterranean Quercus rotundifolia stands using one QuickBird satellite image in pan-sharpened mode, with four multispectral bands (blue, green, red and near infrared) and a spatial resolution of 0.70 m. The satellite image was orthorectified, geometrically and radiometrically corrected. Object-oriented classification methods and multi-resolution segmentation were used to derive a vegetation mask per forest species. Data from forest inventory (24 plots) and vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SR and SAVI) derived from high spatial resolution satellite images were used for an area of 133 km(2), in southern Portugal. The statistical analysis included correlation, variance analysis and linear regression. The linear regression models fitted included the arithmetic mean and the median values of the vegetation indices per inventory plot as explanatory variables. The overall results of the fitted models show a trend of better performance for those with the median value of the vegetation index as the explanatory variable. The best fitted model (R-2 = 75.3) was associated with the Simple Ratio (SR) median value as an explanatory variable. A Quercus rotundifolia above-ground biomass map was produced.

TI  - What's going on with land-use in Cuba?: Disparate data sets and the Cuban agricultural transition
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on agricultural land-use changes in Cuba following the fall of the Soviet Union. In response to the end of Soviet subsidies, which previously underwrote Cuba's industrial agricultural system, the government rapidly transitioned from large, centralized agricultural operations to small-scale farming and cooperatives to address local food security. This paper uses a variety of empirical data sources, including remote sensing data available from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to unpack some of the land-use implications of this radical agrarian transition. Combined, these data shed new light on the magnitude and nature of agrarian landuse changes that have occurred over the past several decades in Cuba. The paper concludes by placing these empirics in the context of shifting geopolitics and the increasing impacts of climate change, issues of great concern to Cuba and other island nations in the Caribbean.

T2  - NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ariids such as Genidens genidens are particularly susceptible to overfishing because of their complex reproductive mechanisms, which result in slow replenishment of stocks. In this study, we obtained data about the reproductive ecology of the catfish G. genidens in the Guanabara Bay estuary, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, providing supporting information for management of its fishery. The sex ratio, mean size of each sex at first sexual maturation, and female fecundity were determined and the reproductive period was characterized. The males:females ratio was 1:2. The fecundity is low and increases proportionally to the females' growth in total length and weight. The breeding season occurs during the wannest months of the year, with spawning extending from October through March and incubation from December through April. Sexual maturation is late, with males maturing at a larger size than females. Skipping spawning was also identified in females. Based on the reproductive biology, it is suggested that the catch be restricted to individuals larger than 20 cm, considering the L-75 of the males, and that fishing be prohibited from December through March, to include the main period of spawning season by females and oropharyngeal incubation by males.

AB  - To probe the molecular composition of a remote target, a laser is directed at a spot on the target, where melting and evaporation occur. The heated spot serves as a high-temperature blackbody source, and the ejected substance creates a plume of surface materials in front of the spot. Bulk molecular composition of the surface material is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated spot through the ejected plume. The proposed method is distinct from current stand-off approaches to composition analysis, such as Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), which atomizes and ionizes target material and observes emission spectra to determine bulk atomic composition. Initial simulations of absorption profiles based on theoretical models show great promise for the proposed method. This paper compares simulated spectral profiles with results of preliminary laboratory experiments. A sample is placed in an evacuated space, which is situated within the beam line of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. A laser beam is directed at the sample through an optical window in the front of the vacuum space. As the sample is heated, and evaporation begins, the FTIR beam passes through the molecular plume, via IR windows in the sidewalls of the evacuated space. Sample targets, such as basalt, are tested and compared to the theoretically predicted spectra.

AB  - The payload Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on the satellite Sentinel-2A provides data with strong spectral information, reasonable spatial resolution and good revisit time, which make them suitable for crop monitoring. With the availability of the image data over the complete rice growing season over two consecutive years, spectral time series analysis of rice crops is conducted in this study for the Riverina region of Coleambally, New South Wales, Australia. Vegetation and water indices are adopated to compare the growing patterns of rice over the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 growing seasons. Rice crops of different varieties are identified and examined. Different seed sowing methods are also compared in terms of their effect on the latter season. The results show that the growth pattern of rice follows a particular trend that can be distinguished from other types of vegetation. This is facilitated by a property unique to rice where water sensitive indices produce a higher reading than vegetation indices during the initial flooding period of the season, after which, the crop growth reverses this and the biomass sensitive index becomes larger. Spectral analysis of rice crops planted via various methods reveals that the drill sowing method did not produce this unique characteristic as the late flooding time results in a very short submersion period for the rice seedlings, which is a valuable finding.

AB  - Advancements in acquiring bathymetry and capturing features below the water's surface have significantly improved our knowledge of what lies beneath rivers, lakes, and oceans. Surveying techniques utilize methods such as multibeam, side scan sonar, laser scanners, satellite derived bathymetry (SDB), and topographic-bathymetric (topobathy) lidar. Of these methods, bathymetric lidar is becoming the emergent sensor of choice to survey nearshore bathymetry (0-4 meters typically).NOAA's National Geodetic Survey (NGS) collects a variety of remote sensing data using both traditional and emerging technologies. NGS products include: topobathy lidar datasets, aerial photographs (nadir and oblique), the National shoreline, and Continuously Updated Shoreline Products (CUSP).Topobathy lidar is flown on a small aircraft at low altitude following predetermined flight plans and staging. Bathymetric lidar sensors provide an efficient, flexible, cost effective and overall safer method to acquire coastal bathymetry whereas multibeam can be utilized more effectively beyond the 4 meter depth curve. NGS operates the Riegl VQ-880-G topobathy airborne laser scanning sensor and surveys coastal shorelines, as well as monitors the spatial and temporal nature of nearshore bathymetry. Nadir imagery is also collected, orthorectified for viewing, and supports the construction of topobathy elevation models.NGS acquires aerial photogrammetry via a Trimble Digital Sensor Systems to independently verify shoreline changes and to aid topobathy lidar data collection. These high-resolution digital cameras are also used for emergency response to collect pre- and post-event (oblique and nadir) imagery which assist in response and recovery efforts along coastlines impacted by major events (e.g. Hurricanes: Harvey, Sandy, Katrina; Tornadoes in Joplin and Tuscaloosa; Midwest U.S. flooding and human-induced disasters like Deepwater Horizon, etc.). Coastal oblique imagery is especially important for emergency response because it is collected at a 35-40 degree angle to provide a view of a wider area; improving the visibility of vertical structures, such as the sides of buildings, as opposed to only the tops of buildings as typically seen in traditional imagery. NOAA acquires and rapidly disseminates these images to support homeland security and emergency response requirements. Additionally, several commercial sources have incorporated the aerial imagery into internet based map servers to provide search capabilities based on street addresses, city names and points of interest.At times, NGS must also utilize satellite imagery to monitor shoreline changes and generate derived products (e.g. CUSP and satellite derived bathymetry). These products are especially important for remote regions such as Alaska or small geographic areas where aircraft logistics and competing priorities make it challenging to maximize the utilization of NOAA's platforms. Satellite imagery provides a rapid analysis over a large area but is limited by imagery resolution, weather conditions, and water column quality.In this paper, we will describe the historical perspective of remote sensing in NGS, the different remote sensing technologies and products used today, and the outlook for optical technologies being explored for use at NGS in the future.

TI  - Radiometric calibration framework for ultra-high-resolution UAV-derived orthomosaics for large-scale mapping of invasive alien plants in semi-arid woodlands: <i>Harrisia pomanensis</i> as a case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Orthomosaics derived from consumer grade digital cameras on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used for biodiversity monitoring and remote sensing of the environment. To have lasting quantitative value, remotely sensed imagery should be calibrated to physical units of reflectance. Radiometric calibration improves the quality of raw imagery for consistent quantitative analysis and comparison across different calibrated imagery. Moreover, calibrating remotely sensed imagery to units of reflectance improves its usefulness for deriving quantitative biochemical and biophysical metrics. Notwithstanding the existing radiometric calibration procedures for correcting single images, studies on radiometric calibration of UAV-derived orthomosaics remain scarce. In particular, this study presents a cost- and time-efficient radiometric calibration framework for designing calibration targets, checking scene illumination uniformity, converting orthomosaic digital numbers to units of reflectance, and accuracy assessment using in situ mean reflectance measurements (i.e. the average reflectance in a particular waveband). The empirical line method was adopted for the development of radiometric calibration prediction equations using mean reflectance values measured in only one spot within a 97 ha orthomosaic for three wavebands, i.e. red, green and blue of the Sony NEX-7 camera. A scene illumination uniformity check experiment was conducted to establish whether 10 randomly distributed regions within the orthomosaic experienced similar atmospheric and illumination conditions. This methodological framework was tested in a relatively flat terrain semi-arid woodland that is invaded by Harrisia pomanensis (the Midnight Lady). The scene illumination uniformity check results showed that at a 95% confidence interval, the prediction equations developed using mean reflectance values measured from only one spot within the scene can be used to calibrate the entire 97 ha RGB orthomosaic. Furthermore, the radiometric calibration accuracy assessment results showed a correlation coefficient r value of 0.977 (p<0.01) between measured and estimated reflectance values with an overall root mean square error of 0.063. These findings suggest that given the entire scene being mapped is experiencing similar atmospheric and illumination conditions, then prediction equations developed using mean reflectance values measured in only one spot within the scene can be used to calibrate the entire orthomosaic in semi-arid woodlands. The proposed methodological framework can potentially be tested and adapted for use in large-scale crop mapping and monitoring in precision agriculture, land-use/land-cover classification as well as plant species delimitation, particularly for mapping widespread invasive alien plants such as H. pomanensis.

M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplains in the Amazon are areas of great economic, social and ecological importance. Occupation in these areas brings various impacts due to its complexity and fragility. This paper aims to analyze dynamics of change in land use and land cover in the floodplain of Lago Grande do Curuai, near Santarem city, in the state of Para. To that end, geotechnologies associated with landscape metrics and an analysis of two different geographic clippings of the region were used. The first geographic clipping covers the entire hydrographic basin, focusing on the analysis of the natural vegetation cover (dryland and lowlands); the second geographic clipping shows the area divided in six landscape zones, whose criteria are the productive systems and the characteristics of use of the region. We classified images from satellites Landsat 5 and 7 from the years 1985, 1997 and 2014. Landscape metrics established patterns that facilitated the comparison between different times. In the first geographic clipping, metrics show a moderate dynamic in the period. Although there is a decrease in dry land forest areas, the class in which there is greater increase is the secondary/"capoeira"vegetation. There are increases in the pasture areas, the farmlands, however, remain stable; pasture and farming areas occur in a dispersed way in the territory and in small allotments; this dynamic revealed by classification indicates that cultivation areas are occupied by rotation, being occupied and abandoned over time. In the second geographic clipping, zones 3 and 4 concentrate most of the processes of replacing the natural vegetation cover by anthropic activities. The analysis in different geographic clippings shows the researched area has heterogeneous patterns of occupation in time and space.

TI  - Investigation of the reasons for not using helmet among motorcyclists in Kerman, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INJURY CONTROL AND SAFETY PROMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to investigate reasoning and interpretation of motorcyclists for not using helmet utilizing qualitative methodology of grounded theory'. The field of the study was Kerman, a cultural-historical city at the south-east of Iran. Participants were 21 young male motorcyclists. Two sampling strategies were used: maximum variation and snowball sampling. To collect data, in-depth, open-ended interviews were conducted. Data analysis yielded seven categories: fatalism; a barrier to social relationships; peer group pressure and negative labelling; messing up the appearance; disturbance in hearing and vision; barrier to normal breathing; and heaviness and superfluity of helmet. Based on the findings of the current study, it could be concluded that socio-cultural contexts, motorcyclists' worldview and partly helmet-related problems are of the main factors which affect motorcycling. Therefore, the studies, policy-makings, and intervening programmes to control injury and to promote safety among motorcyclists should be focused on socio-cultural barriers to helmet use in general and changing the motorcyclists' standpoints toward fatalism in particular. Helmet-related problems should be considered, too.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) techniques are based on spectral data registered by RS scanners as energy reflected from the Earth's surface or emitted by it. In "geological" RS the reflectance (or emittence) should come from rock or sediment. The problem in tropical and subtropical areas is a dense vegetation. Spectral response from the rocks and sediments is gathered only from the gaps among the trees and shrubs. Images of high resolution are appreciated here, therefore. New generation of satellites and scanners (Digital Globe WV2, WV3 and WV4) yield imagery of spatial resolution of 2 m and up to 16 spectral bands (WV3). Images acquired by Landsat (TM, ETM+, OLI) and Sentinel 2 have good spectral resolution too (6-12 bands in visible and infrared) and, despite lower spatial resolution (10-60 m of pixel size) are useful in extracting lithological information too. Lithological RS map may reveal good precision (down to a single rock or outcrop of a meter size). Supplemented with the analysis of Digital Elevation Model and high resolution ortophotomaps (Google Maps, Bing etc.) allows for quick and cheap mapping of unsurveyed areas.

TI  - APPLICATION OF SATELLITE SENTINEL-1 RADAR IMAGES FOR DESCRIPTION OF ICE PHENOMENA ON DEBE RESERVOIR
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-FORMATIO CIRCUMIECTUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter conditions of low air temperature cause development of ice phenomena at rivers and reservoirs, creating often problems in their exploitation. There is a need to continuously monitor the spatial extension of ice phenomena and their different forms. Local water authority (RZGW Warszawa) prepares for rivers under their administration a daily reports on ice conditions in winter. Ice reports are prepared from visual inspection of the RZGW personnel visiting selected sections of the river course. This is specially problematic in holidays and weekends when usually data from observations are missing. In this study it is tested application of microwave remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 platform to observe the development and recession of the ice cover at the Debe reservoir in winter 2017. Satellite Sentinel-1 radar images are distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) on the open access policy. These are two satellites A and B which every 2 days collect images in SAR active remote sensing technique. Debe reservoir was created in 1963 by closing by the barrage Narew river below its confluence with Bug river. Maximum water head is 7.10 m, and average 6.8 m. Area of the reservoir is 30.3 km(2) average discharge of Bug river at Wyszkow gauge is 162 m(3). s(-1), and Narew river at Zambski Kokielne gauge 139 m(3). s(-1). Retention time of water in the reservoir is 3-4 days. Comparison of the average water temperature at gauge Zambski Kokielne and Wyszkow from the winter half-year of the period 1963-1981 shows the increase of water temperature by 0.5-1 C after the year 1972 when Ostroleka power station was put in to operation.. This difference in the temperature between Narew and Bug rivers is reflected by the ice conditions at the end of winter season. Sentinel-1 SAR instrument emits electromagnetic wavelength of 6 cm (C band), and are use two polarizations VH and VV. Using SNAP program geometric correction and color composite was created for selected images at the beginning and end of ice cover at Debe reservoir on Narew river, covering period January 5-March 6, 2017. It has been found that interpretation of the Sentinel-1 images is most problematic if we want to detect boundary between open calm water and new fast ice. The flow of pancake ice on January 5, 2017 had been recorded and the pattern of ice distribution compared to flow lines calculated by the hydrodynamic CCHE2D model. Result of the hydrodynamic modeling shows circulation pattern in the widest part of the reservoir where are also the most favorable conditions for lake type of ice cover formation. End of ice cover is represented by the image of February 26, 2017 which shows the Narew river free from ice due to higher temperature of the water. Relatively simple visual interpretation of the Sentinel-1 VH and VV images can by used in the study of ice phenomena on major rivers and lakes.

TI  - How to Improve Patient Handoff Quality for Ensuring Patient Safety: A Systematic Review
T2  - 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION (THE 2ND ICHA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Hospital Administration (ICHA)
CL  - South Jakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Patient handoff is defined as a transfer and acceptance of responsibility for patient care that is achieved through effective communication. Communication breakdown in handoff procedures can lead to serious impacts in the patient's care, inappropriate treatment, and potential harm to the patient. The aim of this systematic review is to know barriers in handoff process and find strategies to improve patient handoff quality for ensuring patient safety. The current study is systemic review with PRISMA method, retrieved from online databases such as ProQuest and PubMed using keywords 'patient handoff' OR 'patient handover' AND 'patient safety'. The period of the study that has been reviewed is three years backwards. Based on this review, potential barriers that can lead to handoff failure are lack of standardized handoff tool, lack of chances for face-to-face communication and the ability to interactive discussion, and lack of staff training and handoff supervision. Several improvement strategies to increase patient handoff quality based on this review are: implementation of standardized verbal and written handoff protocols, face-to-face interaction with active discussion opportunities, minimal interruptions, accurate and up-to-date information with critical issues highlighted, staff education and training, handoff process supervision, leadership and regulation support. Improvements or impacts on patient safety were only stated in three journals. Barriers in handoff process must be addressed to find recommendation for handoff process improvement. By addressing barriers, patient handoff quality can be increased by several improvement strategies. Further studies are needed to prove the impact of effective patient handoff in reducing sentinel and adverse events.

TI  - Speckle filtering of Synthetic Aperture Radar images using filters with object-size-adapted windows
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle degrades the radiometric quality of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image. Previous methods for speckle reduction have used a fixed-size window for filtering the entire image. This, however, may not be effective for the entire image, as land covers of different sizes require different filtering windows. In this paper, a novel method is proposed by which each pixel in the image is filtered with a window appropriate for the size of object within it. The real in-phase and the imaginary quadrature components of the SAR images determine the best window size and the pixels in the intensity image are filtered using their own optimal windows. The proposed method is presented for both single- and multi-polarized SAR images, and the results of several common filters that were modified are presented. This approach is applied to two RADARSAT-2 images: one over San Francisco, California, USA and the other over St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, producing results that were similar to, or outperformed, comparable filters while retaining details and suppressing speckle effectively. While the method was successful for single-look intensity data, it offers great potential for multi-look and amplitude data as well.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the performance of the Silhouette index by applying the K-Harmonic Means algorithm to cluster different types of remote sensing datasets. The preliminary experimental results showed that the junction between the K-Harmonic Means algorithm and the Silhouette index is suitable for remote sensing images which present an insignificant degree of overlapping between clusters. Indeed, the Silhouette index returns a clear maximum which is synonym of the correct number of cluster. In contrast, the Silhouette index fails to return the real number of clusters when we deal with remote sensing data of which the clusters present a high degree of overlapping. To cope with this drawback, the angle based method was introduced to detect the correct number of clusters; the results prove the efficiency of the proposed process. Also, two comparisons were conducted, the first one between the well-known K-Means algorithm and the K-Harmonic Means and the second between the Silhouette index and the WB index in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Harmonic Means algorithm and also the Silhouette index.

AB  - This study demonstrated the utility of entropy computation using the satellite precipitation remote sensing data to assess the sustainability of rainfall in tropical catchments. There were two major issues need to be anticipated in monitoring the tropical catchments; first is the frequent monitoring of the rainfall and second is the appropriate indicator that sensitive to rainfall pattern changes or disorder. For the first issue, the use of satellite remote sensing precipitation data is suggested. Meanwhile for the second issue, the utilization of entropy concept in interpreting the disorder of temporal rainfall can be used to assess the sustain ability had been successfully adopted in some studies. Therefore, we hypothesized that the use of satellite precipitation as main data to compute entropy can be a novel tool in anticipating the above-mentioned conflict earlier. The remote sensing entropy results and in-situ river level showed good agreement indicating its reliability. 72% of the catchment has moderate to good rainfall supply during normal or non-drought condition. However, our result showed that the catchments were highly sensitive to drought especially in the west coast and southern part of the Peninsular Malaysia. High resiliency was identified in the east coast. We summarized that the proposed entropy-quantity scheme was a useful tool for cost-effective, quick, and operational sustainability assessment This study demonstrated the utility of entropy computation using the satellite precipitation remote sensing data to assess the sustainability of rainfall in tropical catchments.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of rangeland productivity in semi-extensively grazed arid rangelands is a prerequisite for livestock management in relation to sustainable use of pastoral resources. The objective of this study was to assess rangeland productivity based on normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. Data on phytomass were measured on 61 field samples in arid rangelands of Morocco, covering various rangeland categories during autumn (November) and spring (April), i.e. when phytomass is at low and high levels, respectively, for two consecutive years (2008 and 2009). Dekadal EROS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (eMODIS) NDVI data were linearly regressed to field measurements for these four periods. Results show that phytomass values were correlated with NDVI during spring, with R-2 and RMSE values of 0.82 and 0.3 t ha(-1), respectively. This study indicates there is a high potential for operational use of remotely sensed data to estimate rangeland phytomass of semi-extensively grazed rangelands.

TI  - Psychological Essentialism in Serek ha-Yahad and the Two Spirits Treatise
T2  - DEAD SEA DISCOVERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the psychological mechanisms that underpin Qumran sectarian dualism and its construction of in-group/out-group boundaries. Specifically, evidence from experimental and developmental psychology and cognitive anthropology is used to argue that Serek ha-Yahad and the Two Spirits Treatise (1QS 3:13-4:26) reflect a deeply-engrained psychological essentialism wherein non-group members are conceptualized as having inherently different biological essences. This essentialist tendency is easily extended to the social domain in what scholars call the "naturalization" of social groups. After reviewing this literature, the paper examines the Serek and Treatise's use of kinship terms, the word "spirit," and language denoting human nature and living species, in order to demonstrate that essentialist intuitions about outsiders provide a foundation for the sect's dualistic worldview. Importantly, the essentialist thinking in these texts is also firmly grounded in and channeled through the intertextual interpretation of scripture, drawing heavily on the rich creation vocabulary in Genesis 1-3.

AB  - Satellite missions are typically thought of singly or in the small blocks corresponding to a funded program. However, in many mission areas the need is to provide a continuous and sustained on-orbit capability far beyond the borders of a single mission or even a single program. For example, in weather and environmental remote sensing the U.S. geostationary program currently launching comprises four geostationary satellites (GOES-R through GOES-U) and five satellites in polar low-earth orbit (LEO) (SNPP launched and four JPSS yet to launch). In weather and environmental mission area we want decades-long remote sensing data records and there is a strong disutility to any gap in service. There is near certainty that the U.S. will continue its weather and environmental satellites beyond the current program, but there is no official plan to do so. This presents both a problem and opportunity when designing constellations. In designing and analyzing launch and production policies we should consider not a single satellite mission or a single funded program but a whole sequence of production and launch programs (most of which are in the unplanned future). In considering the far "out-years", we might discover that decisions made today may have complex consequences in the future, and policies that seem logical in the context of a single program may not be effective when considered over the lifetime of several programs. As part of the NOAA Satellite Observing Systems Architecture (NSOSA) study we made a broad study of launch policies for long-term sustainment of diverse constellation types, concentrating on how to optimize trades between reliable service provision and cost efficient use of resources.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are emerging pathogens of increasing global public health concern due to their rapid increase in geographical range, and the impact of climate change. Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are of concern due to the risk of re-emergence and introduction by migratory birds. Human cases due to WNV have never been reported, and those of JEV are rare in Singapore. Four sentinel vector surveillance sites were established in Singapore to understand the potential risk posed by these viruses. The present study revealed active JEV transmission in Singapore through the detection of JEV genotype II inCulex tritaeniorhynchus collected from an avian sanctuary. ACulex flavivirus, similar to the Quang Binh virus isolated fromCulex tritaeniorhychus in Vietnam andCxFV-LSFlaviV-A20-09virus isolated in China, was also detected inCulex spp. (vishnui subgroup).No WNV was detected. This study demonstrates the important role that surveillance plays in public health, and confirms the circulation of JEV among wildlife in Singapore despite the absence of reported human cases. Surveillance, collaboration between public health and wildlife managers, and control of mosquito population remain the key measures in risk mitigation of JEV transmission in the enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes.

AB  - This article describes the "Sao Francisco Floodplain Project" (SFFPP) aiming at defining a Mean Ordinary Flood Line (MOFL) on the banks of the Sao Francisco River, in East Central Brazil. Land inserted within the MOFL of large rivers in Brazil are characterized as government-owned and are ruled by a special legislation. The lack of consensus for an effective method for this delimitation has raised much conflicts between dwellers, land owners and the federal government. To solve this, the SFFPP first aims to determine the mean flood plain level using historical water level data and then find all the dates since the launch of the first satellite sensor with a 30 m resolution (Landsat-4, 1982) corresponding to these particular water levels with a small margin of error. All Landsat images corresponding to these dates were acquired to produce a delineation of the MOFL. In a thorough series of tests to extract the water surface, the K-means segmentation using the shortwave infrared band of Landsat yielded the best results. A first refining of the MOFL was performed by interpolating the Landsat bands to improve the smoothness of the waterline. This refinement reduced the average distance error between the Landsat water edge and the true water edge from 9 to 7.5 meters. Then, some sections of the MOFL was further completed or refined using high-resolution multi-source satellite images where available. These first results were very encouraging and we were able to acquire Landsat images for each section of the river corresponding to the mean flood water level. Because Brazil has been suffering a significant reduction in rainfall since 2013, no recent SAR or optical images such as Sentinel-1 and -2 could be used. Analysis of the water level time series confirmed an alarming decreasing trend in the water discharge of the Sao Francisco River.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Agent Based Modelling (ABM) for the simulation of rainfall runoff and soil erosion used in a watershed monitoring activity. The study utilizes Landsat 8 imagery for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map generation, ASTER DEM for obtaining elevation information and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) 36 year weather data of Asan watershed, Uttarakhand, India. In the proposed model, four major agents (raindrops, soil, elevation and water amount) have been defined for estimating the soil erosion in the region. Moreover, the direct runoff has been simulated using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method. The analysis of the entire time series using this approach shows that there have been substantial changes in the rainfall runoff pattern primarily due to the varying environmental conditions of the study area since the late 1980s. Furthermore, a rough estimate of the soil erosion and deposition in the area have been computed which is aligned with the theory of sediment transport and deposition. In order to automate the entire model workflow, an open source cross platform tool has been developed using Python, R and NetLogo libraries. The Open Agent Based Runoff and Erosion Simulation (OARES) tool incorporates a generic interface for analysing large spatio-temporal datasets in watershed studies. The overall analysis concludes that the results obtained using ABM are comparable to that of the conventional hydrological models, and henceforth, ABM could be utilized as a future potential hydrological modelling paradigm.

TI  - Parameterization of the middle and upper tropospheric water vapor from ATOVS observations over a tropical climate region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a highly variable, but important greenhouse gas that regulates the radiation budget of the earth. Its variability in time and space makes it difficult to quantify. Knowledge of its vertical distribution, in particular, is crucial for many reasons. In this study, empirical relationships between isobaric layers of PWV over Peninsular Malaysia are examined. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique on Advanced Television and Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) observations, from 2005 to 2011, has been used to propose a relationship of the form, W=alpha(WL)(beta) for the middle (MW) and upper (UW) layers PWV. W is either MW or UW with alpha and beta as regression coefficients, which are functions of latitude. Coefficients of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of respective values between 0.75-0.86 and 1.65-2.38 mm, across the zones, were obtained for both the MW and UW predictions, with a mean bias (MB) below +/- 1 mm.The predicted and observed PWV presented a better agreement northerly. Initial predictability test for each model was done on two independent data sets: ATOVS (2012-2015), and radiosonde (2010-2011) at Penang, Kuantan and Sepang stations, with very good outcomes. The results of the tests revealed remarkable performances, when compared with two previously reported models. The inclusion of variable regression coefficients, and the utilization of satellite-derived data, which provide soundings of data-void regions between radiosonde networks, proved to have optimized the results.

CL  - AISECT Univ, Bhopal, INDIA
AB  - Remote sensing has many applications including bathymetry mapping in shallow water areas from multispectral images. It is considered a useful reconnaissance tool to save time and cost to be used in the preliminary survey. This paper aims at assessing the performance of three techniques used for bathymetry modeling to obtain water depth. In this research, three models are applied to obtain water depth using optical bands of Landsat-8 multispectral images. The selected algorithms (models) are principle component analysis (PCA), ratio model (RM), and 3rd polynomial model. The images are first corrected for the effects caused by atmospheric conditions and sun specular. The bands are then calibrated using ground truth measurements obtained using GPS and single-beam echo sounder in the area of the eastern harbor of Alexandria, Egypt. The study area represents a low turbid, mud bottom, and shallow water area. The three algorithms are implemented, and the results are compared with echo sounder data. The root mean square error (RMSE) is computed for the three techniques for different spectral bands combinations. RM resulted in RMSE 1.04 m using the coastal and green bands. The RMSE of PCA was 1.02 m resulted from the blue and green bands. The 3rd polynomial yielded 0.91 m using from the green band. The capability of using Landsat-8 images in bathymetry was approved. In addition, the outperformance of green band usage in bathymetry was also argued.

AB  - Seagrass meadows play a vital role in coastal ecosystems health as constitute an important pillar of the coastal environment. So far, regional scale habitat mapping was implemented with the use of freely available medium scale satellite images (Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8). The Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have increase the spatial resolution of the observation from meter to sub-decimeter. Using sub-decimeter imagery, seagrass can be mapped in great detail revealing significant habitat species and detect new habitat patterns.In the present study, we suggest a multi-scale image analysis methodology consisting of georeferencing, atmospheric and water column correction and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA). OBIA process is performed using nearest neighborhood and fuzzy rules as classifiers in three major classes, a) seagrass, b) shallow areas with soft bottom and c) shallow areas with hard bottom (reefs). UAS very high-resolution data treated as in situ observations and used for training the classifiers and for accuracy assessment. The methodology applied in two satellite images Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 with 10m and 30m spatial resolution respectively, at Livadi beach, Folegandros Island, Greece.The results show better classification accuracies in Sentinel-2 data than in Landsat-8. There was a great difficulty in the detection of the reef habitat in satellite images because it covered a small area. Reef habitat was clearly detected only in the UAS data.In conclusion, the present study highlights the necessity of new high precision geospatial data for examining the habitat detection accuracies on satellite images of different resolutions.

TI  - PHRASEOLOGICALLY REPRESENTED CONCEPTS AS PART OF FORMING STUDENTS' LINGUISTIC CONSCIOUSNESS
T2  - 12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The article is devoted to the features of phraseologically represented concepts which are helpful in forming students' linguistic consciousness in the course of learning English. Whatever profession learners of English specialize in, it is evident that in order to be efficient in using English as a tool of solving all sorts of communicative tasks they have to elaborate linguistic consciousness compatible with their inherent national and cultural worldview. Hence the objective of the present work is to analyze peculiarities of conceptual content verbalization by phraseological means and to reveal their role in forming students' national and cultural specificity of the world perception.The most outstanding feature of a phraseologism is that its general meaning is not made as a mere addition of its components' meanings, but as a special integrated semantic unity, sometimes totally different from the primary result of the mentioned addition. That is what makes phraseology so loaded in terms of cultural awareness and so important in terms of students' linguistic awareness.The authors describe the basic types of phraseological concepts: reflective picture, scheme, frame, script. Thus, a reflective picture conveys colligated sensory images, the most obvious features of an object. A scheme is an abstraction which obtains certain content in the particular situation. A frame describes the sequence of events. Scripts show some dynamics of events and actions.Depicting linguistic and cultural aspects of phraseological concepts, the authors clarify their role and participation in representing peculiarities of the world perception, this or that nation way of thinking and associative links. In addition, the article proves that the phraseological level of a language significantly fixes the values and spiritual system of a society, its moral, ethical and aesthetic preferences, features of the mentality of a particular linguocultural community.The research is conducted with the help of methods of cognitive linguistics. Application of the cognitive approach to the study of the language phraseological system allows to define the knowledge structures which are represented by phraseological concepts and to work out the optimal ways of delivering phraseologisms as a learning material to students of English.The authors conclude that phraseology makes one of the most demanding layers of language to be studied by non-native speakers. At the same time it is one of the most engaging areas, mastering which helps students increase authenticity of their English speaking style.

TI  - Toward a Surface Soil Moisture Product at High Spatiotemporal Resolution: Temporally Interpolated, Spatially Disaggregated SMOS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution surface soil moisture is required for most hydrological and agricultural applications. The recently developed Disaggregation based on Physical and Theoretical Scale Change (DisPATCh) algorithm provides 1-km-resolution surface soil moisture by downscaling the 40-km Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. However, the temporal resolution of DisPATCh data is constrained by the temporal resolution of SMOS (a global coverage every 3 days) and further limited by gaps in MODIS images due to cloud cover. This paper proposes an approach to overcome these limitations based on the assimilation of the 1-km-resolution DisPATCh data into a simple dynamic soil model forced by (inaccurate) precipitation data. The performance of the approach was assessed using ground measurements of surface soil moisture in the Yanco area in Australia and the Tensift-Haouz region in Morocco during 2014. It was found that the analyzed daily 1-km-resolution surface soil moisture compared slightly better to in situ data for all sites than the original disaggregated soil moisture products. Over the entire year, assimilation increased the correlation coefficient between estimated soil moisture and ground measurements from 0.53 to 0.70, whereas the mean unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) slightly decreased from 0.07 to 0.06 m(3) m(-3) compared to the open-loop force-restore model. The proposed assimilation scheme has significant potential for large-scale applications over semiarid areas, since the method is based on data available at the global scale together with a parsimonious land surface model.

TI  - MAPPING OF SLOW VERTICAL GROUND MOVEMENT CAUSED BY SALT CAVERN CONVERGENCE WITH SENTINEL-1 TOPS DATA
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MINING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The geodetic measurements optimization problem has played a crucial role in the mining areas affected by continuous ground movement. Such movements are most frequently measured with the classical geodetic methods such as levelling, tachymetry or GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). The measuring techniques are selected with respect to the dynamics of the studied phenomena, surface hazard degree, as well as the financial potential of the mining company. Land surface changes caused by underground exploitation are observed with some delay because of the mining and geological conditions of the deposit surroundings. This delay may be considerable in the case of salt deposits extraction due to slow convergence process, which implies ground subsidence maximum up to a few centimeters per year. Measuring of such displacements requires high precision instruments and methods. In the case of intensely developed urban areas, a high density benchmark network has to be provided. Therefore, the best solution supporting the monitoring of vertical ground displacements in the areas located above the salt deposits seems to be the Sentinel 1-A radar imaging satellite system.The main goal of the investigation was to verify if imaging radar from the Sentinel 1 mission could be applied to monitor of slow ground vertical movement above word heritage Wieliczka salt mine. The outcome of the analysis, which was based on DInSAR (Differential SAR Interferometry). technology, is the surface distribution of annual subsidence in the period of 2015-2016. The comparison of the results with levelling confirmed the high accuracy of satellite observations. What is significant, the studies allowed to identify areas with the greatest dynamics of vertical ground movements, also in the regions where classical surveying was not conducted. The investigation proved that with the use of Sentinel-1 images sub centimeters slow vertical movements could be obtained.

TI  - DESCARTES ABOUT ANTHROPOLOGICAL GROUNDS OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE "EARLY WRITINGS"
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of this work is to find the key to understanding the paradox of Descartes' way of philosophizing during the recourse to the text of "early writings". Realization of the set purpose involves the consistent solving of such tasks: by referring to the research literature, to outline the forms of transition to modern methodology; to explicate the main reasons for philosophy anthropologization by Descartes; to analyze the role of art as the main form of expressing Descartes' worldview in the "early writings". Theoretical basis. Studies by Descartes experts and the phenomenological tradition. Originality. The analysis of the "early writings" allows to determine the origins of the main doctrine of Descartes' philosophizing. Its role is manifested in the course of clarifying the main motives of the anthropological approach of the French philosopher. That entails their rootedness in the Copernican-based scientific revolution of the New Age. A prerequisite for the authentic comprehension of the radical change carried out by Descartes is the attention to the paradigmatic significance of art, which is most fully asserted in the "early writings". It is substantiated that the appeal of young Descartes to the experience of art influences his understanding of science, as well as the awareness of human presence in the development of the scientific picture of the world and the distinction of the main components of human nature - mind and will. Conclusions. During the analysis of the contemporary literature devoted to Descartes, there is outlined the tendency to go beyond the notions of naivety and simplicity of his position, one of the manifestations of which is the increased attention to anthropology. The main motives for its actualization are rooted in the scientific revolution of the New Age, which are the form of completion of the radical worldview change initiated by Copernicus. It is about the vision of man as the main component of the universe, attention thereto in the search for the source point and the decisive authority for the world development, reflection of the thinker's desire to build his own ethical doctrine based on human nature. While comprehending the "early writings", the author focuses on the interpretation by young Descartes of art as a form of expression of truth, which enables the authentic comprehension of human nature. These ideas became the basis for the further work of the thinker, and today they open up new perspectives of exploring the anthropological foundation for later works.

TI  - Presentation of biological indicators of the effects of climate change on biodiversity in the New Aquitaine region (South West, France): the climate sentinel species
T2  - Bulletin de la Societe Linneenne de Bordeaux
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the local effects of climate change on biodiversity is essential to guide environmental and management policies for natural areas. The lack of knowledge at the regional level has led to the development of a research program "Climate sentinels". The main hypothesis of the program is that effects on biodiversity are particularly detectable in species that have low movement abilities. These "climate sentinel" species would be the first to respond to local climatic variations by adaptation or local extinction. From the territory of New Aquitaine (France), 20 biological indicators of climate change in different ecosystems (dune, dry, wet, mountain and forest) were chosen: plants communities of ecosystems, insects (butterflies, dragonflies, bumblebees), amphibians (Rana pyrenaica, Hyla molleri, H. arborea), reptiles (lberolacerta bonnali, Timon lepidus, Zootoca vivipara, Emys orbicularis, Vipera berus) and mammals (Marmota marmota, micromammals). This paper presents the method of development of these indicators and the research hypotheses associated with climate sentinel species.

T2  - Bulletin de la Societe Linneenne de Bordeaux
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term standardized monitoring protocols for climate by biological indicators is necessary for modeling projections of the impacts of climate change on the state of biodiversity. In the territory of the New Aquitaine region (southwest, France), around 20 "sentinel climate" indicators have been developed, including Lepidoptera, which are listed as relevant indicators of wet heaths. In practice, the exhaustive observation of lepidoptera species can not be carried out. It is replaced by samplings whose associated observation effort is estimated by the coverage rate calculated from the diversity profile, in particular singletons. In the case of the Brousteyrot wet heaths, the diversity profile corresponds to the cumulative observations from May to August 2017 on the 4 transects of 200 m (118 individuals, 16 species). The coverage rate of 92 % is lower than a threshold conventionally one used in statistics of 95 %. In order to improve the sampling effort, the number of observations in 2018 has been increased every 15 days, or 8 passages between May and August. Then, the graphs of the diversity profiles function of q (Hill number) can be summarized by 6 parameters. Over several years of monitoring, these smoothing data are elements that can be compared for the same site, in time, with climatic variations, and analysed between several sites of the same nature, for example wet heaths.

TI  - Evaluating and comparing Sentinel 2A and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral indices for estimating fire severity in a Mediterranean pine ecosystem of Greece
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between three field-based fire severity indices (Composite Burn Index-CBI, Geometrically structure CBI, weighted CBI) and spectral indices derived from Sentinel 2A and Landsat-8 OLI imagery on a recent large fire in Thasos, Greece. We employed remotely sensed indices previously used from the remote sensing fire community (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), differenced NDVI, differenced NBR, relative differenced NBR, Relativized Burn Ratio) and seven Sentinel 2A-specific indices considering the availability of spectral information recorded in the red-edge spectral region. The statistical correlation indicated a slightly stronger relationship between the differenced NBR and the GeoCBI for both Sentinel 2A (r=0.872) and Landsat-8 OLI (r=0.845) imagery. Predictive local thresholds of dNBR values showed slightly higher classification accuracy for Sentinel 2A (73.33%) than Landsat-8 OLI (71.11%), suggesting the adequacy of Sentinel 2A for forest fire severity assessment and mapping in Mediterranean pine ecosystems. The evaluation of the classification thresholds calculated in this study over other fires with similar pre-fire conditions could contribute in the operational mapping and reconstruction of the historical patterns of fire severity over the Eastern Mediterranean region.

AB  - Understanding cityscapes using remote sensing data has been an active research field for more than two decades. Meanwhile, machine learning provides generalization capabilities compared to hierarchical and rule-based methods. This paper evaluates several machine learning algorithms in order to fuse shadow detection and shadow compensation methods for building detection using high resolution aerial imagery. Three complex and real-life urban study areas were used as test datasets with various: (i) kinds of buildings structures of special architecture, (ii) pixel resolutions and, (iii) types of data. Objective evaluation metrics have been used for assessing the compared algorithms such recall, precision and F1-score as well as rates of completeness, correctness and quality. For both approaches, i.e., shadow detection and building detection, the computational complexity of each machine learning algorithm was examined. The results indicate that deep learning schemes, such a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), provides the best classification performance in terms of shadow detection and building detection.

TI  - Variations of Ecosystem Service Value in Response to Land-Use Change in the Kashgar Region, Northwest China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing anthropogenic activities have significantly altered ecosystems in arid oasis regions. Estimating the impact on a wide range of ecosystem services is important for decision making and the sustainable development of these regions. This study analyzed time-series Landsat data to determine the influences of oasis land-use changes on the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region in Northwest China. The following results were found. The total value of the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region were approximately $10,845.3, $11,218.6, $10,291.7, and $10,127.3 million in 1986, 1996, 2005, and 2015, respectively. The water supply, waste treatment, biodiversity protection, and recreation and cultural services were the four ecosystem services with the highest service value, contributing 77.05% of the total ecosystem services. The combined contribution rate of food production and raw material value was only about 4.02%, relatively small. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated total ecosystem service value (ESV) for this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. The findings of this study will be crucial for maintaining the stability and sustainable development of the oasis region, where socio-economic development and the integrity of the natural ecosystem complement each other. Furthermore, the results provide a scientific basis for decision makers in land use management, and provide a reference for researchers in the Northwest China.

M3  - Article
AB  - Formation and development of the Talysh ethnic consciousness under the conditions of the Talysh 'geoethnic reserve' have been analyzed. Certain ethnoforming elements of the Talysh culture, i. e. factors promoting preservation of the basic constants of the Talysh ethnic consciousness, have been revealed. On the one hand, it is a cult of rocks, stones, groves and trees, and on the other hand it is worship of air, water, land and fire, which with the appearance of Zoroastrianism at first, and later of Shia Muslim, were not absorbed and peripheralized, but filled with new religious and ethical contents presenting moral and esthetic ideals of the Talysh people. The role of a myth and religion as an obligatory early stage of formation of the Talysh ethnic culture has been determined; regularities of formation of the Talysh ethnic consciousness have been shown; steps of ethnogenesis and a world view of the Talysh ethnos have been enlightened. Introduction of strange cultural tradition components could not eliminate the existing valuable attitude of 'the geoethnic reserve', but right opposite, they created syncretic environment stimulating evolution of the Talysh ethnic consciousness towards world judgment in the system of moral and ethical images considerably enriching the Talysh ethnos outlook. Having been formed this syncretic environment effected significantly the Talysh ethnos social attitude, as well as, predetermined a prevalent character of religious values in Talyshes spiritual and socio-political life.

T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common type of breast cancer, with a unique pathogenesis and distinct clinical biology. ILCs display a characteristic loss of E-cadherin, are largely estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and low to intermediate grade. These features portend a favorable prognosis, but there is a tendency for late recurrences and atypical metastases. ILCs tend to be insidious and infiltrative, which can pose a challenge for diagnosis, and emerging data suggest they may have a propensity for a differing response to standard therapies.

T2  - PEACE REVIEW-A JOURNAL OF SOCIAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrary to popular belief, at first glance, traditional African religions-although they have been de-structured, undermined, and overshadowed in public visibility by Islam and Christianity-are not dead. Like Islam and Christianity, traditional religions have ambiguities in their organization and societal ethical codes, where good and evil and love's splendor and destructive passions are enmeshed. Traditional religions are alive and well and their worldview still influences African understanding of and insight on Christianity and Islam. As the foundation for a global world vision, it is useful to analyze traditional religions in all their ambiguity for the positivity and negativity that they emulate as well as the general population's attitude toward the issue of social peace in Africa.

AB  - The Environment Agency-Abu Dhabi developed extensive habitat, land cover, land use maps in 2015 using a very high resolution satellite imagery acquired between 2011 and 2013. This map can be used as a baseline map to allow efficient monitoring. In this work, we aim to establish a framework for short term updates to the maps to quickly enable efficient planning. With the availability of multi-spectral images, various spectral bands apart from visible (Red, Green and Blue) bands can be used in habitat mapping. This paper presents the work of land cover classification in the region of Abu Dhabi, UAE using a Worldview-2 satellite image. The proposed approach makes use of Random Forest algorithm, applied on the Fully-Connected features obtained from AlexNet framework using a 20% training samples on a 3-band input. Then, ensemble of outputs of Random Forest over different 3-bands combination is used to make the final prediction. The results are validated against the ground truth obtained from Environment Agency, Abu Dhabi. Eventually, our aim is to develop a robust classification approach and then adapt automatic change detection approaches to temporally update the baseline maps.

AB  - In this paper, precipitable water vapor (PWV) values calculated from MODIS satellite data are compared to the PWV values calculated from GPS data. Analysis of one-year data from 9 stations, shows that the MODIS derived PWV values correlate well with the GPS PWV values with the correlation coefficients of 0.85, 0.94 and 0.85 for tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions respectively under the clear sky conditions. The average root mean square (RMS) error for clear sky conditions were calculated to be 7.80 mm, 5.47 mm and 4.19 mm for tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions respectively. It was found that, generally MODES overestimates the PWV values especially in regions with higher water vapor content.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The research was based on a comparative study of three representative rural areas (Dovras, Larissa, and Messapia) in Greece. Remote sensing data were collected (maps, aerial photographs) for the landscape analysis and elaborated using GIS linked with economic and social parameters regarding land use. By using a selected core set of landscape indicators, this research aims at providing a useful tool for assessing agroecosystem management at territorial level and hopefully assist decision-making for the promotion of sustainability. The selected tool showed that the study area of Messapia presented the highest level of environmental sustainability, while the area of Dovras showed the best combination of agricultural productivity and landscape management. Results showed that the ecoregions of Dovras, Larissa, and Messapia presented a landscape composed of important ecological function areas in the percentages of 40%, 15%, and 70%, respectively, and of cultivated areas in the percentages of 55%, 71.19%, and 19.75%, respectively.

AB  - The problem of tree/plant volume and health estimation plays a key role in precision agriculture applications especially for Variable Rate Treatments (VRT). Today VRTs are available at reasonable costs and most of the platforms are able to apply a given rate in a given position by using a prescription map that is usually designed by an agronomist basing on historical data and scouting on the field. In this scenario several technologies are involved at different stages as the acquisition of data to take decision by using ground and/or aerial vehicles, data analytics to derive prescriptions and variable rate controller also aided by auto-steering to apply the desired quantity. This pipeline works if and only if all the stages are trustable. In particular, it is import to acquire data at different times in order to evaluate the best rate considering the phenological phase and the previous/current status. Aerial (unmanned) vehicles are currently used to map the status but for complex crops as vineyards, it is necessary to properly segment soil vs crop/tree. Moreover aerial images offer a partial view that in case of vineyards it is not sufficient considering that only upper canopy could be sensed. In this case, it is necessary to integrate top view with lateral ones that could be acquired also by using tractors during the application of treatments. In this paper we present an integrated approach where ground data are collected and processed in real-time also showing how these data could be integrated with aerial data. Data are collected by using LiDAR sensor and processed by a set of algorithms deployed as ROS nodes to estimate the volume and health of a plant/tree to support the creation of management zones.

AB  - In this paper, a multi-target inversion scheme is adopted for joint estimation of crop biophysical parameters from dual-pol SAR data. The single-output support vector regression (SVR) method is extended to a multi-output support vector regression (MSVR) method to estimate biophysical parameters. The MSVR is implemented for simultaneous retrieval of plant area index (PAI) and crop biomass from the Sentinel-1 C-band dual-pol (VV+VH) data. In this particular study, the inversion algorithm is trained and validated for the canola crop using in-situ measurements collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2016 (SMAPVEX16-MB) Manitoba campaign. The validation results indicate a good correlation coefficient (r) of 0:72 and 0:85, with a RMSE of 0:35m(2)m (2) and 0:48 kgm (2) for PAI and wet biomass respectively. In addition, the mapped PAI and wet biomass values at flowering stage of canola capture the variability in crop growth from Sentinel-1 data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - First results from a systematic harmonic analysis of HF radar (HFR) derived ocean surface current observations in the northwestern Bay of Bengal (BoB) during 2010 is presented. The daily-averaged HFR currents compared reasonably well to composite daily surface currents from multiple satellites with correlation coefficient of 0.90 (0.69) for zonal (meridional) component. A set of sequential daily currents demonstrated sustained northward (southward) alongshore flow during February-April (October-December) with peak magnitude of about 1.8 (1.2) m/s. On tidal scales, harmonic analyses of zonal and meridional components at nearshore and offshore locations indicated that among semi-diurnal tidal components, M2 dominates over S2 and N2; time-scales of which were verified from available coastal tide gauges nearby. Amplitudes of semi-major axis for M2 and K1 tidal ellipses are 7.16 (6.13) and 4.02 (3.30) cm/s in nearshore (offshore) location indicating relatively stronger tidal currents in nearshore location. Finally, significant shallow water constituents S4, MS4 and M3 (M4, 2SM6 and M6) at nearshore (offshore) location are identified, which are due to non-linear interaction of tidal currents with bathymetry. Both semi-diurnal and shallow water tidal currents show dominance along isobaths in offshore region, which turn progressively across-isobath as they move nearshore.

AB  - The synergistic use of spatial features with spectral properties of satellite images enhances thematic land cover information. This study aims to address the lack of high-level features by proposing a classification framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn deep spatial features for wetland. In particular, a CNN model was used for classification of remote sensing imagery with limited number of training data by fine-tuning of a preexisting CNN (AlexNet). The classification results obtained by the deep CNN were compared with those based on well-known ensemble classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), to evaluate the efficiency of CNN. Experimental results demonstrated that CNN was superior to RF for complex wetland mapping even by incorporating the small number of input features (i.e., 3 features) for CNN compared to RF. The proposed classification scheme serves as a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art machine learning tools for processing remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Technological accidents can be vast in scope and require a rapid response to evacuate the affected region. Access routes to nuclear power stations are essential for the preparation of emergency plans in the event of technological disasters. The Admiral Alvaro Alberto Nuclear Power Plant (Central Nuclear Almirante Alvaro Alberto - CNAAA) in Angra dos Reis, Brazil, is located in a region with high rainfall and rugged terrain. This article presents digital image processing and geoprocessing procedures for mapping landslide-susceptible areas and landslide scars associated with the CNAAA access routes. Digital Elevation Models and their derivations were used to identify landslide-susceptible areas, and LANDSAT images were used to map the land cover. The information was superimposed, and the hazard areas and potential landslide scars were mapped. Most of the study area is medium or high risk for landslide events. Landslides scars mapping achieved over 50% of accuracy representing a potential methodology for the risk assessment and landslides monitoring in the study area. The results demonstrate that further and detailed studies must be performed in the areas in order to maintain the access roads available for eventual evacuations in a technological disaster event.

TI  - Can the global modeling technique be used for crop classification?
T2  - CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop detection from remote sensed images is of major interest for land use and land cover mapping. Classification techniques often require multi-temporal images. However, most of these techniques assume that the cultural cycle occurs at the same dates across plots or for a given crop and do not take into account the sensitivity to initial conditions of the dynamical behaviors. Such hypotheses are not well adapted when a wide diversity of practices is observed for the same crops from one crop field to another, which is often the case in tropical context. To cope with these difficulties, a new classification technique based on the global modeling technique is introduced in this paper. It is first applied to a case study based on chaotic oscillators. It is then tested on crop classification observed from satellite data.The Berambadi watershed (South India) is taken as a case study to test this new classification approach. Crop classification is a difficult problem in Southern India where optical satellite images are scarce during the monsoon season due to cloud cover, and where crop land is divided in parcels (i.e. crop fields) of very small sizes with diversified crops. The Landsat-8 images were used to monitor an ensemble of 104 parcels of ten different crops (irrigated and non-irrigated). Using global modeling, a bank of crop models was first obtained for the ten crops considered in the study. A metric is introduced to compare the observed signal to the obtained crop-models used as reference for each crop dynamic. Based on this metric, the possibility to use global models as references for distinguishing crops is investigated. The results provide a good proof-of-concept and show promising potential for crop classification. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The advanced techniques like remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) can be of great use for their assessment, management and monitoring. The availability of remotely sensed data from different sensors of various platforms with a wide range of spatio-temporal, radiometric and spectral resolutions made remote sensing as, perhaps, the best source of data for large-scale applications in agriculture and forest resource monitoring. The integrated use of remotely sensed data, GPS and GIS will enable natural resource managers and researchers to develop management plans for a variety of agriculture and forest resource management applications. In the present chapter, examples of remote sensing and GIS applications in agriculture and forest resource monitoring were reviewed.

AB  - Physical sampling of water for off-site analysis is necessary for many applications like monitoring the quality of drinking water in reservoirs, understanding marine ecosystems, and measuring contamination levels in fresh-water systems. In this paper, the focus is on algorithms for efficient measurement and sampling using a multi-robot, data-driven, water-sampling behavior, where autonomous surface vehicles plan and execute water sampling using the chlorophyll density as a cue for plankton-rich water samples. We use two Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), one equipped with a water quality sensor and the other equipped with a water-sampling apparatus. The ASV with the sensor acts as an explorer, measuring and building a spatial map of chlorophyll density in the given region of interest. The ASV equipped with the water sampling apparatus makes decisions in real time on where to sample the water based on the suggestions made by the explorer robot.We evaluate the system in the context of measuring chlorophyll distributions. We do this both in simulation based on real geophysical data from MODIS measurements, and on real robots in a water reservoir. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in several ways including in terms of mean error in the interpolated data as a function of distance traveled.

AB  - Tropical forest clearing owing to timber produce, agricultural and infrastructure development has been widely reported. Hence, studying forest cover dynamics is crucial for better forest management practices. Till date, many methods have been developed to analyze the forest cover dynamics from satellite data. One of the most important and accurate being forest canopy density mapping (FCD) using Forest Canopy Density Mapper, hereafter referred to as FCD-M, which was developed under ITTO Project based on Rikimaru's methodology. However, FCD-M was only commercially available and had specific data requirements as it was developed for Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, which limited its scope for wider applications. This paper presents an open source platform for FCD mapping developed in R framework (FCD-R) based on Rikimaru's methodology. FCD-R is flexible enough to work on datasets other than Landsat, provided the information in the required wavelength regions for calculation of indices is available. FCD-R was applied on a part of the Central Himalayan region to study forest cover dynamics over a period of 15 years. FCD Maps for 2000 and 2016, along with change dynamics are presented in the following sections.

TI  - CARBON DYNAMIC SHIFTS WITH LAND USE CHANGE IN MARGALLAH HILLS NATIONAL PARK, ISLAMABAD (PAKISTAN) FROM 1990 TO 2017
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change (LUC) particularly the conversion of forest to other land uses, determines the scale of forest carbon shifts. Here, remotely sensed data Multispectral Satellite Images (MSI) of the study area for the year 1990, 2000, 2010, 2017 and geographic information system (GIS) tools were used to analyze the land use change patterns. For biomass calculation and related forest carbon losses in the Margallah Hills National Park of Pakistan the field inventory data were collected by random forest sampling from 1990 to 2017 . Our results showed that during the period from 1990 to 2017, the area under dense forest decreased by 11.14% (0.41% yr(-1)), while the area under open forests increased by 4.28% (0.15% yr(-1)). Similarly, agricultural land and settlements increased by 53.17% (1.96% yr(-1)) and 67.78% (2.51% yr(-1)) respectively, during the same period. The conversion of forests into other land uses resulted in the reduction of carbon value. In 1990, carbon loss is estimated at 5531.5 MgC.yr(-1) (7.22%) of the total carbon pool. Overall, land use change released 154 GgC (5.70 GgC.yr(-1)), highlighting that land use change significantly alters carbon dynamics of the Park. Land use change and related carbon losses indicating the magnitude of anthropogenic disturbances in the Park. The preservation and rehabilitation of degraded forest as well as reforestation of the converted forests are necessary for forest carbon conservation meeting emissions reduction obligations of the Kyoto Protocol.

AB  - Digital Elevation Model represents elevation in two dimensional varying raster. It provides significant analysis of the terrain characteristics and planning. Availability of high-resolution satellites helps extraction of DEM at different global scales from the stereo imagery. Cartosat-1 is an along track sensor which acquire stereo data acquired continuously with fore and aft cameras. Stereo data including Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) is used to generate DEM based on standard Rational Polynomial Model. This paper evaluates the DEM generated from Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) for Carosat-1 stereo pair with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM. The accuracy of the DEM extracted from ASP is tested with the standard SRTM DEM. The performance analysis shows that correlation of AMES DEM with SRTM shown 0.97 and RAISE of order 13.64m. The AMES DEM has shown high correlation and low RMSE values with the standard SRTM DEM.

AB  - In this work we present a fully parallel SBAS-DInSAR processing chain for the effective and massive generation of Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) deformation time-series. The pursued strategy to develop such a parallel processing chain fully benefits from the data acquisition characteristics of the TOPS mode, consisting of a series of bursts that can be considered as separate images to be independently processed. Such a data structure fosters the intrinsic parallelization of the S-1 IWS interferometric data processing, which can automatically be carried out through the exploitation of high-performance distributed computing infrastructures, and of efficient algorithms for tackling the huge data flow provided by the S-1 constellation.In order to demonstrate the capability of the presented S-1 P-SBAS processing chain to deal with the huge amount of data acquired by the S-1 constellation, we process a very extended dataset acquired over Italy from which we compute the mean velocity maps and corresponding deformation time-series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Swaziland introduced rotavirus vaccine in the National Immunization Program, in May 2015, with the objective of reducing the burden of rotavirus diarrheal disease. We monitored the early impact of the vaccine in reducing rotavirus diarrhea.METHODS: We conducted sentinel rotavirus surveillance from January 2013 to December 2016 in children under five years of age admitted due to diarrhea attending Mbabane Government Referral Hospital in the Hhohho Region and Raleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital in the Manzini Region. All cases had stool samples collected and tested for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay.RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2016, 596 samples were collected and tested. Rotavirus positivity reduced from average of 50.8% (172/338) (in 2013-2014 (pre vaccine period)) to 29% (24/82) in 2016, post-vaccine introduction. The median age of children with rotavirus infection increased from average of 10months in 2013-2014 to 13.7months in 2016. The peak season for all-cause diarrhea and rotavirus-specific hospitalizations among children under five years of age was June-August in all years with a blunting of the peak season in 2016. Rotavirus positivity among children 0-11months reduced from an average of 49% in 2013-2014 (116/236) to 33% (15/45) in 2016, a 33% reduction following rotavirus vaccine introduction.CONCLUSION: There has been a rapid reduction of all-cause diarrhea and rotavirus hospitalizations in Swaziland, particularly in young children and during the rotavirus season, after the introduction rotavirus vaccine. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor the long-term impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction.

TI  - Remote sensing-based assessment of veld fire trends in multiple interwoven land tenure systems in Zimbabwe
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study used Landsat imagery, MODIS fire data and in situ meteorological data to determine emerging fire trends in interwoven multiple tenure systems in Zimbabwe. Remote sensing enabled fire trends to be determined across terrain and official records barriers. The number of fires and area burnt increased from 2001 up to 2009 then fluctuated across tenure systems. Fire events rose from 9 to 80 per year in some of the tenure systems. Complex relationships among number of fires, area burnt and weather variables within and across tenure systems were identified. The fire situation was responsive to intervention; the positive fire trends were reversed from 2009 onwards. Projected trends show that fire events could be reduced to negative values in three systems, while in two they could double by 2026. The veld fire problem could be eliminated if a holistic approach is adopted to tackle it across sectoral and land tenure divides.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are essential due to their high biodiversity and primary production, however they are extremely complex and with high spatial and temporal variability. Thus, to properly manage them it is necessary a systematic monitoring. Remote sensing can be very useful due to the spatial and spectral improvement of satellites and the availability of airborne or drone hyperspectral sensors. Unfortunately, the mapping of coastal areas is challenging due to the low SNR received at the sensor, as a consequence of the minimum reflectivity of the seafloor and the atmospheric and water column disturbances. In this context, the goal of this work is to obtain a robust classification methodology to generate accurate benthic habitat maps applying object-oriented and pixel-based classification methods in shallow waters using WorldView-2 and AHS (Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner) images. Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain) was studied due to its complexity and the presence of important seagrass meadows.

AB  - Land cover information is a fundamental parameter in a wide range of applications like urban growth, land degradation, climate change, food security, environmental sustainability, etc. In this context, remote sensing satellites can provide valuable data to allow the generation of thematic maps. On the other hand, the recent availability of hyperspectral sensors on board aircrafts and drones offers an opportunity to improve the resolution and accuracy of land cover maps. In island territories, where land is usually a scarce resource, the need of very high spatial resolution (VHR) is essential. In this context, we have generated VHR land cover maps using multispectral Worldview data and hyperspectral airborne CASI information. In particular, after corrections and pansharpening enhancements, we have analyzed pixel-based and object-based classification approaches using different input band combinations. We have compared the performance when using multispectral or hyperspectral imagery and its robustness depending on the quality of the training samples considered.

TI  - DTN-Based Nanosatellite Architecture and Hot Spot Selection Algorithm for Remote Areas Connection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To extend the network coverage to rural and remote areas, there are different solutions with their advantages and disadvantages. We propose to use a nanosatellite network and to exploit the ability to cope with large delays and disruptions provided by the delay-and disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) paradigm. The connection from remote areas is managed through ground stations called cold spots that collect data from rural nodes and address them to the nanosatellites. Nanosatellites carry and download data to hot spots that address them to the Internet destinations. On the reverse direction, Internet data are addressed to hot spots, uploaded on nanosatellites and delivered to the rural destinations through cold spots. The problem of choosing the "optimal" hot spot to address data from the Internet source is important because a wrong choice could lead to large delivery delays. In this paper, we propose "gRANteD": a Nanosatellite-DTN Network for rural and remote areas. gRANteD includes "HotSel," a hot spot selection algorithm to minimize the delivery time of all data destined to rural users. The performance evaluation is carried out through a DTN module which implements gRANteD and HotSel, within the framework of Network Simulator 3.

AB  - A new permanently instrumented radiometric calibration site for high/medium resolution imaging satellites in the visible/near-IR has been set up in Gobabeb, Namibia in July 2017. The station location has been decided after a global analysis of satellite data assessing surface spatial homogeneity, cloud coverage, temporal variability, atmospheric turbidity etc. which has been compared with insitu data (surface reflectance, BRDF etc.) from a field campaign which took place in late 2015. The instrumentation automatically measures atmospheric (aerosol optical thickness etc.) and surface conditions (BRDF) from 414 nm to 1600 nm in 12 narrow spectral bands. The data processing is performed at CNES and includes the calibration of the photometer itself using in-situ measurements, and the simulation of the top-of-atmosphere radiance seen by any optical sensor over-passing the site, thus calibrating the sensor. This paper describes the instrument location, measurement protocol, calibration principle and calibration results of satellites Sentinel2A and Sentinel2B.

TI  - Statistical inferential techniques for approaching forest mapping. A review of methods
T2  - Annals of Silvicultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of remote sensing data at no or low costs can be used as ancillary data in order to spatialize and improve the estimation of forest attributes and without increasing the sampling effort and costs. In this review paper, a description of the main statistical inferential techniques for approaching forest mapping is proposed. This article reviews the most used forest mapping methods based on the sole spatial information as well as techniques exploiting auxiliary information from remotely sensed data. The advantages and drawbacks of each method have been described on the basis of several factors, such as the aims of the investigation and the area under examination. Two main groups were here discussed with model-based methods on one side and model-assisted methods on the other, moving the attention from the model used to interpolate surfaces to the sampling scheme. Model-based methods include kriging, locally weighted regression, K-NN, decision trees and neural networks, while the inverse distance weighting interpolator is presented in the model-assisted group.Reliable and up-to-date information on forest characteristics are mandatory tools for any decisional process. The main input data of such systems are wall-to-wall maps depicting the spatial structures of forests and additional elements. Actually, if the original aim of forest inventories was to estimate harvestable timber amounts, a general interest towards multipurpose surveys is mandatory. Such information must deal with increased costs and more time-consuming procedures.

AB  - In this paper, a novel approach for the retrieval of snow wetness is presented for Sentinel-1 (S-1) data. The approach uses the information on snow proprieties provided by the hydroclimatological model AMUNDSEN and confirmed by comparisons performed at different sematic level to train a regressor that is able to exploit the dual-polarimetric information provided by S-1.

TI  - Environmental modeling of occurrence of dolphinfish (<i>Coryphaena</i> spp.) in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico reveals seasonality in abundance, hot spots and migration patterns
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dolphinfish are little known migratory fish targeted by sport, artisanal and commercial fleets. In this study, we analyzed a 10year database of incidental catches of the tuna purse seine fleet in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico with the aim to understand the environmental determinants of the spatial distribution and seasonal migration patterns of dolphinfish. We modeled the probability of occurrence of dolphinfish as a function of spatial (geographical coordinates), temporal (month/year) and environmental variables (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll [CHL] and sea surface height [SSH], inferred from satellites) using logistic Generalized Additive Models. Dolphinfish preferred waters with SST values from 23 to 28 degrees C, low (<0.2mg/m(3)) CHL values, and primarily positive SSH values. Two dolphinfish hot spots were found in the study area: one in an oceanic zone (10 degrees-15 degrees N, 120 degrees-125 degrees W), which was more defined during spring, and one on the Pacific side of the Baja California Peninsula, which became important during summer. Models suggested that dolphinfish migrated through the study area following a corridor that ran from the Gulf of Tehuantepec along the Equatorial Upwelling zone to the oceanic hot spot zone, which in turn connected with the hot spot off the BCP. This migratory corridor went around the Eastern Pacific Warm Pool, which suggested that dolphinfish avoided this high temperature-low production zone. Dolphinfish occupied zones close to certain oceanic features, such as eddies and thermal fronts. Results suggested that the primary cause of the biological hot spots was wind-driven upwelling, because the hot spots became more important 3-4months after the peak in upwelling activity.

TI  - THE ROLE OF THE LIGHT AND DARKNESS MYTHOLOGEM IN THE MECHANISM OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS TRADITION CONTINUITY
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the work is to reveal the cultural specifics of the inclusion of the light and darkness mythologem into the mechanism of religious culture continuity. Methodology. The methodology of the work is based on cultural approach involving discourse of interdisciplinary dialogue, which determines integration of principles and methods of religious studies into the cultural research analytics. The methodological basis of the specified scientific research is a combination of activity-based, axiological, ethical, philosophical and anthropological, phenomenological, religious, functional, semiotic and hermeneutical methods of research adapted to the cultural approach in understanding the mechanism of incorporating the light and darkness mythologem into the process of religious culture continuity. The scientific novelty of the research lies, firstly, in inclusion of the light and darkness mythologem into the problem field of social and humanitarian discussions, which seek to find new cultural models that would form organic synthesis of traditional and innovative principles in its structure; and secondly, in revealing peculiarities of translation of inherited experiences that affect the composition of religious culture and determine the algorithms of social and cultural dynamics of society. Understanding the role of the light and darkness mythologem as the expresser of the Christian religious tradition continuity reveals the prospect of expanding and deepening the analytical capabilities of cultural studies in the context of religious culture. Conclusions. The light and darkness mythologem in the mechanism of religious culture continuity is the instrument of translating universal, repeatable in accordance with the foundations of the Christian worldview and at the same time unique conceptual and life strategy of an individual and peculiarities of his/her spiritual experience - struggle and creativity. Inclusion of the light and darkness mythologem into the continuity of religious culture development is determined by its active inclusion in the axiological and ethical aspects of the latter, which constitute the content of ideologically motivated and purposeful activities of people with the subsequent transfer of cultural and religious experience/result to further generations.

AB  - Icebergs represent a danger to navigation in cold waters. Detection and tracking of large icebergs using space-borne scatterometers, altimeters and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems have seen a large amount of work in the last decades. However, the identification of small icebergs is still challenging especially when these are embedded in sea ice. In this work, a recently proposed iceberg detector the intensity Dual-Pol Ratio Anomaly Detector (iDPolRAD) is tested using ALOS-2 L-band data. The detector is designed for dual-polarized incoherent SAR images, however in this work we want to investigate the loss of performance with respect to using coherent data. Therefore different versions of the iDPolRAD requiring quad-pol data are proposed here and tested.The ALOS-2 data were acquired on the East Coast of Greenland, where a large number of icebergs are visible in the images. The results show that different polarisations could bring different information and therefore the availability of dual-pol could improve the detection although a quad-pol algorithm will not be operational at the moment due to the limited size of the swath.

TI  - Estimation of live fuel moisture content of shrubland using MODIS and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is a critical parameter affecting vegetation flammability and fire behaviour. Reliable and updated estimations of LFMC are needed by fire managers for operational wildfire risk assessment. However, detailed and constant monitoring of LFMC in the field is costly and time-consuming. Remote sensing technologies are an important source of geospatial data that can provide spectral information related to LFMC at different temporal and spatial resolution. In this study, we used a database of LFMC monitoring sampled during 2016 and 2017 (n=81) in a monospecific Cistus ladanifer L. shrubland in Madrid region (Central Spain). C. ladanifer is a representative shrub species commonly found in Mediterranean fire-prone areas, and has been already identified as an indicator species for wildfire risk assessment by different regional fire services. A set of spectral indices (SI) derived from MODIS images (MODO9GA) were calculated at 500 m resolution and compared with field data. We also used Sentinel-2 images for SI retrieval at 20 m resolution with the aim of addressing the scale problem between field sampling site and the low spatial resolution of MODIS data. The same SI were calculated adapting formulations to Sentinel-2 spectral resolution. The timelag between images and field sampling date was limited to a maximum of 2 days for operational purposes. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the potential of SI for LFMC estimation, comparing results for both type of images. Most of the SI tested showed a significant correlation with LFMC data derived from MODIS (n=62) and Sentinel-2 (n=35). For MODIS, the best indices were EVI, VARI, and VIGREEN (R-2=0.82, MAE=12%), followed by NDVI and SAVI (R-2=0.76, MAE=14%). For Sentinel-2, the best indices were VARI (R-2=0.72, MAE=13%), EVI (R-2=0.71, MAE=13%), VIGREEN (R-2=0.67, MAE=14%) and NDVI (R-2=0.62, MAE=14%). In both cases, a significant multivariate model was found including NDVI and VARI, with a slight increase in prediction accuracy compared to simple regression models (R-2=0.85 with MAE=11% for MODIS, and R-2=0.76, MAE=12% for Sentinel-2). Our findings indicate that MODIS and Sentinel-2 images provide similar results for the SI tested, and that both satellites can be used for near real-time estimation of LFMC in C. ladanifer shrubland. The proposed models can be used to improve monitoring of the variability of LFMC during the year, as well as helping the integration of remote sensing data on wildfire danger rating systems.

AB  - Air quality is strongly affecting human lifestyle all over the world, and its impact is apparent on healthcare, sustainable development, welfare and public administration policies. Accurate understanding of the polluting processes requires to analyze huge volumes of records, so that significant patterns and regularities can be detected. In this paper, we introduce a framework to explore the air pollution dynamics over all Europe by means of a data driven feature extraction approach. Taking advantage of MODIS records, we are able to investigate daily trends of air quality from 2003 to 2016. By means of an automatic learning scheme based on mutual information maximization, we extract the most significant patterns in the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to identify relevant air pollution trends that can be associated with specific physical phenomena on ground.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Missions and Sensors: Development, Implementation, and Characterization V
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - Landsat-8 has been operating on-orbit for 5+ years. Its two sensors, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), are continuing to produce high quality data. The OLI has been radiometrically stable at the better than 0.3% level on a band average basis for all but the shortest wavelength (443 nm) band, which has degraded about 1.3% since launch. All on-board calibration devices continue to perform well and consistently. No gaps in across track coverage exist as 100% operability of the detectors is maintained. The variability over time of detector responsivity within a band relative to the average is better than 0.05% (1 sigma), though there are occasional detectors that jump up to 1.5% in response in the Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) bands. Signal-to-Noise performance continues at 2-3x better than requirements, with a small degradation in the 443 nm band commensurate with the loss in sensitivity. Pre-launch error analysis, combined with the stability of the OLI indicates that the absolute reflectance calibration uncertainty is better than 3%; comparisons to ground measurements and comparisons to other sensors are consistent with this. The Landsat-8 TIRS is similarly radiometrically stable, showing changes of at most 0.3% over the mission. The uncertainty in the absolute calibration as well as the detector to detector variability are largely driven by the stray light response of TIRS. The current processing corrects most of the stray light effects, resulting in absolute uncertainties of similar to 1% and reduced striping. Efforts continue to further reduce the striping. Noise equivalent delta temperature is about 50 mK at typical temperatures and 100% detector operability is maintained. Landsat-9 is currently under development with a launch no earlier than December 2020. The nearly identical OLI-2 and upgraded TIRS-2 sensors have completed integration and are in the process of instrument level performance characterization including spectral, spatial, radiometric and geometric testing. Component and assembly level measurements of the OLI-2, which include spectral response, radiometric response and stray light indicate comparable performance to OLI. The first functional tests occurred in July 2018 and spatial performance testing in vacuum is scheduled for August 2018. Similarly, for TIRS-2, partially integrated instrument level testing indicated spectral and spatial responses comparable to TIRS, with stray light reduced by approximately an order of magnitude from TIRS.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we consider the general linear model {y, X beta, V}, where y is the observable random vector with expectation X beta and covariance matrix V. Our interest is on predicting the unobservable random vector y(*), which comes from y(*) = x(*)beta+epsilon(*), where the expectation of y(*) is x(*)beta and the covariance matrix of y(*) is known as well as the cross-covariance matrix between y(*) and y. The random vector y(*) can be considered as a kind of unknown future value. We introduce upper bounds for the Euclidean distances between the BLUPs, the best linear unbiased predictors, when the prediction is based on the original model and when it is based on the transformed model {Fy, FX beta, FVF'}. We also show how the upper bounds are related to the concept of linear sufficiency, and we apply our results into the mixed linear model.

TI  - On the role of Lermontov in Russian culture. Some preliminary remarks
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-YAZYK I LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - The following text is a presentation that was held by V.Markovich at the international conference "The 200th Anniversary of the Birth of M. Lermontov" on October 9th, 2014, at the Institute of Russian Literature (Russian Academy of Sciences). Comparing the first elegy of the 19th century, "The Country Churchyard" by Zhukovsky, and Lermontov's poem "I go out on the road alone...", V. Markovich argues that the latter is the first poem in Russian culture to lay down the law of hesitation between two polarities - unbearability and impossibility. Impossibility is the only possible response to unbearability in the world of text. That is how Russian cultural dynamics can be described: fluctuation between two historical stages of cultural evolution finds itself again and again as the main form of mental stability in Russia, the stability of reappearing conflicts becoming a form of their insolubility. One of the anomalies of Russian culture starts to show and it can be studied against the background of universal polarities. As such background we can use the pattern of Mircea Eliade which is based on the antinomy of two types of worldview and existence, regularly appearing in world history; but this time the types are synchronous rather than alternating. The first one is "historically oriented", "western" and "modern", relying on the concept of history progressively moving towards a certain goal, whereas the second one is "archaic", "traditional" and "oriental", determined by the laws of repeating patterns. Nations are divided into "historic" and "ahistoric". The former understands its own existence as history and build history, whereas the latter sees development as a painful process and tries to escape from its horror and oppression, "constantly returning" to the original archaic ways. It is impossible to change the type of existence. Therefore, Russian culture combines two incompatible types, without any prospect of their future synthesis. This tragic anomaly is ineradicable, and the only possible solution is alternating between its two manifestations: a catastrophic and unbearable one and an under-active and entropic one. The anomaly of cultural development makes it unpredictable and opens inexhaustible possibilities.

AB  - In Indonesia, a huge amount of peat has accumulated under peat swamp forest over millennia. However, a repeatable large-scale fire as a result of land clearing has rapidly devastated these tropical peatlands. These disturbances (e.g. climate change, deforestation, peatland drainage, forest and peatland fires, and land conversion) change the ecosystem respiration and resulting a high carbon emitted to the atmosphere. To restore the peatland ecosystem, Indonesia government makes a special force by using three activities, namely rewetting, replantation, and communal empowerment. These activities need an accurate peatland monitoring. However, accessing the spatial variation of the peatland is quite limited, difficult and laborious. Therefore, we investigated the existence of tropical peatland in Siak, Riau Province, Indonesia. We measured soil moisture at four different types of land cover (namely; forest, oil palm, shrubs, and agriculture) a long with two types of peat conditions. We estimated the Constanta Dielectric (epsilon) values obtained from a fully polarimetry for ALOS 2/PALSAR. Results indicated that the e of oil palm was lower in non-peat area than in peat area, whereas the decrease in e probably in peat area resulted from the rapid growth of oil palm.

T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Severe relapses that required treatment were important outcomes in the sentinel trials of disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Identifying such relapses in administrative data would allow comparative-effectiveness studies of DMTs to be conducted in real-world clinical settings.Methods: All relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and secondary-progressive (SPMS) patients living in Manitoba between 1999 and 2015 were identified using a validated case definition and linkage to the Manitoba MS Clinic database. All healthcare interactions potentially due to relapses were extracted from population-based administrative (hospital, physician claims and prescription) databases. These "relapse markers" included varying thresholds of outpatient prednisone scripts, day hospital or emergency room (ER) codes for intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone therapy, family physician, neurologist or ER physician billing codes and hospital admissions due to MS. Algorithms using combinations of these markers were compared with a reference standard of neurologist-defined relapses. The most useful algorithms were also examined on a biannual basis over the study period to assess for trends in the sensitivity of relapse detection.Results: 1131 participants with RRMS or SPMS were linked to administrative databases. Analysis of potential relapse markers over the whole 1999-2015 time period was limited by inconsistent coding of same day or ER admissions for IV methylprednisolone administration.Widespread adoption of high-dose oral outpatient prednisone for relapses since 2009 resulted in a progressive improvement in relapse marker sensitivity. The best algorithm consisted of oral prednisone prescriptions > 50 mg/day for 3-60 days and same day hospital or ER assessment codes with MS as the most responsible diagnosis (sensitivity 70%, specificity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 96%, kappa 0.8 in 2013-2015).Conclusions: Severe relapses can be identified from administrative datasets with reasonable accuracy. The trend since 2009 toward outpatient relapse treatment will improve the sensitivity of relapse detection with longitudinal follow-up of this cohort and will allow comparison of severe relapse rates between different DMTs, supporting future comparative effectiveness studies.

AB  - Traditional sample complex correlation change detection (CCD) for synthetic aperture radar decorrelates and thus exhibits false change in areas of low clutter-to-noise power ratio. The complex reflectance change detection (CRCD) maximum likelihood estimator uses a noise power estimate for each SAR image to lower false change. This paper extends the CRCD metric to use spatially varying noise power estimates. The Sentinel-1 SAR constellation is a publicly available data source operating in an interferometric mode with a wide 250km swath width. The noise power varies significantly across each Sentinel-1 image. The CRCD estimate with spatially varying noise (SV-CRCD) is applied to Sentinel-1 flood mapping. Accuracy improvements are demonstrated over CCD due to SV-CRCD rejecting false change in regions of low return.

TI  - Predictive Factors for Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with ACOSOG Z0011 Criteria
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nodal staging constitutes an element of great importance in the treatment planning for early breast cancer. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrated that sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy alone results in rates of local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival equivalent to those seen after axillary lymph node dissection. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of patients that fulfill the ACOSOG Z0011 inclusion criteria and to define predictive factors for non-SLN positivity. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the breast surgery database of the Argentinian Society of Mastology was carried out. Patients were selected if they fulfilled the ACOSOG Z0011 inclusion criteria. The association of clinical and pathological factors with non-SLN positivity was evaluated in univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Among 8,262 patients, 973 had positive SLN, and 348 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Histological grade (G3 vs. G1-2, odds ratio (OR) 1.81; p = 0.024), tumor size (T2 vs. T1, OR 2.39; p = 0.001), and age (>50 vs. <50 years, OR 1.95; p = 0.007) were associated with non-SLN positivity in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Although the clinical relevance of our data is not established, older women with tumors bigger than 2 cm and/or high histological grade are at greater risk of having metastatic disease in the lymph nodes if axillary lymph node dissection is avoided. This subgroup of patients represents only 30% of the trial population. (C) 2018 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg

AB  - Embedded devices are designed to cover many possible use cases. In practice only a small subset of features may be used in a given deployment. As devices age, some features turn out to be security risks. We address these problems by creating Sentinel, a secure mode profiler for embedded devices. Sentinel uses a bus tapping interface to derive a partial control flow graph during device execution. This graph represents the subset of device modes actually observed during use. The control flow graph is generated without any prior knowledge of the device or its software and constitutes a security profile which can be used to audit device execution in order to detect attacks. The profile can be easily enforced by existing bus monitors with minor modifications.

TI  - Platonism or psychologism? The philosophy of Lotze's logic
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL READINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - When not ignored by scholars, Lotze's logic is understood as an example of either psychologism or Platonism. As a matter of fact, despite his allowance for the topic of the origin of concepts, Lotze manages to avoid logical psychologism. At the same time, concepts cannot be said to have validity (Geltung) in the same way as propositions in themselves do: were this the case, one could actually ascribe Lotze a form of Platonism. Avoiding the crass dichotomy between realism and nominalism, Lotze works out a meticulous analysis of the relation between general concepts and our knowledge of reality, which is perfectly compliant with his teleological worldview.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF MIGRATION PROCESSES ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. CHALLENGES FOR AN INDIGENOUS MIGRATION POLICY
T2  - DERECHOS Y LIBERTADES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is intended to assess how the rights of indigenous peoples (particularly those deemed to be structural to their worldview) are affected, limited, cut back or transformed as a consequence of indigenous migratory processes. It also seeks to provide an overview of how indigenous culture and identity are globally modulated as a result of the above. Indigenous rights, solidly rooted in their territory, become mobile rights due to migration. The hypothesis here is that the violence systematically exerted on indigenous peoples in their ancestral territories (the epicenter of their worldview and identity) compels them to migrate, to become mobile and to move away from those territories. In parallel, it will be suggested that an indigenous migration policy is necessary to address such double indigenous and migrant status.

TI  - Reference intervals for B-esterases in gull, <i>Larus michahellis</i> (Nauman, 1840) from Northwest Spain: influence of age, gender, and tissue
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last years, cholinesterase (ChE) and carboxylesterase (CbE) activities have been increasingly used in environmental biomonitoring to detect the exposure to anticholinesterase insecticides such as organophosphorates (OPs) and carbamates (CBs). The aim of this study was to determine ChE and CbE enzymatic activities present in liver and muscle of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis), a seabird species considered suitable to monitor environmental pollution. In order to provide reference data for further biomonitoring studies, the influence of different factors, such as gender, age, sampling mode, and tissue, was considered in the present study. Our data report a statistically significant difference in CbE enzymatic activity comparing liver and muscle samples (P < 0.05) along with an age-related CbE activity in liver samples (P < 0.05). Moreover, according to our results, capture method might influence CbE and ChE activity in both liver and muscle samples (P < 0.05). These findings underline the importance to assess basal levels of ChE and CbE activity considering, among other factors, gender-, age- and organ-related differences and confirm the suitability of Larus michahellis as a sentinel species especially within an urban environment.

M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This work sought to learn which and how are the professional experiences that influence upon significance processes of obstetric care in nurses working in toco-surgery rooms.METHODS: This was a qualitative study with grounded theory approach. Individual interviews were conducted with 16 nurses who work in two public hospitals in a border city in northern Mexico. Data analysis was performed according to that proposed by Strauss and Corbin.RESULTS: Four categories were identified that explain the relationship established among the professional experiences and the significance processes of obstetric care; these are: Dilution of borders and demand for interculturality, Modification in the scale of values associated to care, Institutional and public policy crises, and Violence endured within the work setting. Obstetric care is signified within an imaginary that recognizes the existence of a globalized context, which requests problematizing the worldview not of the "other" but of "many others", and not merely from those receiving care, but also from other professionals who participate in institutional care.CONCLUSIONS: Significance processes analyzed show how the socio-historical situation and current policy require new attitudinal skills and knowledge for nursing to participate efficiently in obstetric care.

CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - Due to the similarity of the radar backscatter over open water and sand surfaces a reliable near real-time flood mapping based on radar sensors in arid areas is usually not possible. Within this paper an approach is presented to enhance the results of an automatic Sentinel-1 flood processing chain of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) by removing overestimations of the water extent related to sand surfaces using a Sand Exclusion Layer (SEL) derived from time-series information of Sentinel-1 data sets. The methodology was tested and validated on a flood event in May 2016 at Webi Shabelle River, Somalia, which has been covered by a time-series of 202 Sentinel-1 scenes within the period April 2014 to May 2017. The algorithm proved capable to significantly improving the classification accuracy of the Sentinel-1 flood service at this study site. Experimental results with variable lengths of the time-series have shown that the classification accuracy increased with increasing number of data sets at the cost of higher computational demand.

TI  - Detection of anti-<i>Leptospira</i> spp., anti-<i>Brucella</i> spp., and anti-<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> antibodies in stray dogs
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dogs can act as intermediary hosts, reservoirs, and sentinel animals for zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis, toxoplasmosis and leptospirosis, and human contact with domestic animals can spread these infections. These diseases are globally distributed, and are a uniquely severe health issue, since they can infect a great range of animals, including humans. The purpose of this work was to determine the prevalence of anti-Leptospira spp., anti-Brucella spp., and anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in stray dogs. Blood samples were collected from 181 stray dogs and used for serological diagnosis. Of the analyzed samples, 36.46%, 16.57%, and 9.39% were positive for T. gondii, Leptospira spp., and B. canis. The results indicate that these zoonotic diseases are highly prevalent in stray dogs in the northwestern region of the state of Parana. The high infection rates for these zoonotics in the canine population is an indication that the environment is contaminated with a variety of different microorganisms, exposing both humans and dogs to different sources of infection.

The LULC maps were obtained using Landsat 5 and 8 data (Processing level 1) through supervised classification using the maximum likelihood classifier. Seven thematic classes were identified: dense vegetation, sparse vegetation, riparian vegetation, cropland, planted forest, bare soil, and water. From the LULC maps, classes related to the natural landscape (dense, sparse, and riparian vegetation) were grouped into forest patches, which was then ordered by size: very small ( Copyright: CC BY 4.0

Seven thematic classes were identified: dense vegetation, sparse vegetation, riparian vegetation, cropland, planted forest, bare soil, and water. From the LULC maps, classes related to the natural landscape (dense, sparse, and riparian vegetation) were grouped into forest patches, which was then ordered by size: very small (< 5 ha); small (5-10 ha); medium (10-100 ha); large (100 ha); and a general class (no distinction of patch size). Then, metrics of area, size and density, edge, shape, proximity and core area were calculated. The dense vegetation portion of the study area decreased considerably within a given time, while the portion of cropland and bare soil increased. Overall, in the Catole river basin, the total area of natural vegetation decreased by 3,273 hectares (4.62%). Landscape metrics analysis exhibited a reduction in the number of very small patches, although the study area was still considered as fragmented. Moreover, a maximum edge distance of 50 m is suggested for conducting studies involving core area metrics in the Catole watershed, as values above this distance would eliminate the very small patches.

TI  - Mapping the coloured dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient in a eutrophic reservoir using remotely sensed images
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has 3 major sources: (1) autochthonous or surface water-derived of algal origin, (2) allochthonous or terrestrial material from soils, and (3) synthetic organic substances of man-made or industrial origin. Thus, its correlation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or chlorophyll a (Chl-a) depends on environmental dynamics and their related changes. Because coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is the coloured fraction of DOM, historical measurements of DOM may be used as a suitable proxy for CDOM. In this research we (1) evaluated the performance of a set of bio-optical models, including empirical models and a quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA), by using simulated reflectance data based on the Thematic Mapper sensor parameters (TM); and (2) analyzed the possible sources of CDOM/DOM in a tropical eutrophic reservoir for a 15-year TM/Landsat-5 time series. Results showed that the literature-based models failed to retrieve the CDOM absorption coefficient (a(CDOM)) from simulated reflectance data. After correlation and collinearity analyses (2D colour correlation plot), an alternative wavelength (485 nm) and band ratio (B4/B1) gave the best relation to a(CDOM). The proposed model had satisfactory performance (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.0001, RMSE = 7%, Nash-Sutcliffe= 0.91). Two significantly different a(CDOM) patterns were identified for the Funil hydroelectric reservoir (Brazil): one associated with land cover land use and rainfall/runoff occurrence and the other with elevated Chl-a associated with algal blooms.

AB  - A mitigation named reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has been developed as one of the most cost-effective strategies to tackle climate change due to forest loss. Timely and accurate forest data are required for REDD+ programs to succeed. A series of multi-temporal Landsat imageries obtained during the period from 1995 to 2015 were used to evaluate deforestation in Central Kalimantan REDD+ boundaries. By using support vector machine (SVM) classification method, the LULC types was mapped with a kappa coefficient greater than 0.8 facilitated a reliable interpretation of LULC changes. In 1995, the forest occupied the total area at around 72.6% while it decreased dramatically to a level of 59.5% and 53.8% in 2005 and 2015. The deforestation in the REDD+ project area in the two decades from 1995-2005 and 2005-2015 was 321.2 and 131.1 thousand hectares.

TI  - The influence of land-cover type on the relationship between NDVI-LST and LST-<i>T</i><sub>air</sub>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (T-2m or T-air) measurements from 20 ground weather stations in Berlin were used to estimate the relationship between air temperature and the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) measured by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer over different land-cover types (LCT). Knowing this relationship enables a better understanding of the magnitude and pattern of Urban Heat Island (UHI), by considering the contribution of land cover in the formation of UHI. In order to understand the seasonal behaviour of this relationship, the influence of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as an indicator of degree of vegetation on LST over different LCT was investigated. In order to evaluate the influence of LCT, a regression analysis between LST and NDVI was made. The results demonstrate that the slope of regression depends on the LCT. It depicts a negative correlation between LST and NDVI over all LCTs. Our analysis indicates that the strength of correlations between LST and NDVI depends on the season, time of day, and land cover. This statistical analysis can also be used to assess the variation of the LST-T-2m relationship during day-and night-time over different land covers. The results show that LSTDay and LSTNight are correlated significantly (p = 0.0001) with T-2mDay (daytime air temperature) and T-2mNight (night-time air temperature). The correlation (r) between LSTDay and T-Day is higher in cold seasons than in warm seasons. Moreover, during cold seasons over every LCT, a higher correlation was observed during daytime than during night-time. In contrast, a reverse relationship was observed during warm seasons. It was found that in most cases, during daytime and in cold seasons, LST is lower than T-2m. In warm seasons, however, a reverse relationship was observed over all land-cover types. In every season, LSTNight was lower than or close to T-2mNight.

AB  - Two spectra of solar direct normal irradiance (including circumsolar) are estimated based on spatio-temporal averages of the relevant atmospheric parameters extracted from two different databases: MODIS satellite sensor retrievals and AERONET sun photometer network. The satellite database is used to calculate an average spectrum for the area of the Atacama Desert. The AERONET database is used for two purposes: (i) to apply bias-removal linear methods to correct the MODIS parameters over Atacama Desert, and (ii) to calculate an average local spectrum for the Paranal station. The SMARTS radiative transfer model is used to obtain the three representative spectra developed in this study. Both the Atacama Desert and Paranal spectra are compared against each other and also to the world reference, ASTM G173. In one of the cases, significant differences are found for short wavelengths. In order to quantify the relative importance of these spectral differences, the propagation of errors due to the use of each spectrum is evaluated for CSP applications over the Atacama Desert, considering twelve different scenarios involving the reflectance, transmittance or absorptance of various materials.

AB  - The Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project is a NASA initiative aiming to produce a seamless, harmonized surface reflectance record from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, respectively. The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, geographic co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and bandpass adjustment. As of version 1.3, the HLS v1.3 data set covers 9.12 million km2 and spans from first Landsat-8 data (2013) to present. HLS products provide near-daily surface reflectance information with a common geometric framework, and are suitable for a variety of agricultural and vegetation monitoring tasks, including analysis of crop type, condition, and phenology.

TI  - Simeon Rajaona on Western ways of thinking and the authentic Malagasy mind
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In two papers early in his career, Simeon Rajaona - one of Madagascar's most famous intellectuals - argues that Westerners have tended to distort the Malagasy worldview by interpolating Western notions into their understanding of it. As a result, the authentic characteristics of the Malagasy mind have been missed by many in the West. He claims that when compared to Westerners, Malagasy have a distinct notion of truth, a different style of reasoning, a different conceptual connection with the world, and a distinct ethical system. His work on this topic is pioneering and insightful. We think that Rajaona is correct on some points but that others are overestimated. In the essay, we explain his work and raise challenges for most of his claims and express agreement with him in parts. While we express scepticism about his claims involving truth, reasoning, and conceptual connection, we agree with him that there is a distinctive Malagasy ethics, though it has analogues in the West. At the end of the paper, we sketch what we take to be distinct elements in the Malagasy worldview relative to Rajaona's claims.

AB  - Accurate phenotyping with unmanned aerial vehicles is a remote sensing application that has received recent attention as plant breeders seek to automate the expensive and time consuming traditional manual acquisition of measurements of plant traits. This paper focuses on the prediction of sorghum biomass utilizing high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data. Two methods are investigated for biomass prediction. The first uses nonlinear regression models to predict biomass directly from remote sensing data, based on features from Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and hyperspectral data. The second strategy focuses on the biophysical sorghum crop model, APSIM, first, using remote sensing data to parametrize the crop model, and then simulating the biomass. Results from both approaches are provided and evaluated for an agricultural test field at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) at Purdue University.

TI  - Remote sensing of nutrients in a subtropical African reservoir: testing utility of Landsat 8
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is useful for water quality assessments but current remote sensing applications favour parameters that are easy to detect such as chlorophyll-a. An assessment of the utility of Landsat 8 for detecting nutrients was conducted in Mazvikadei reservoir in Zimbabwe. The main objective was to determine whether nutrients often overlooked by remote sensing and yet are the main determinants of water quality can be remotely sensed. Sampling targeted ammonia, nitrates and reactive phosphorus from May to October 2015. In situ nutrient concentrations were regressed against reflectance derived from Landsat 8 imagery. Strong negative relationships were found between ammonia and the near-infrared band in July (R-2=0.80, p<0.05) as well as between nitrates and the blue band (R-2=0.67, p<0.05) in June. Overall, the results suggest that the cool dry season is the optimum time to use Landsat 8 for monitoring nutrients in tropical lakes.

TI  - Testing utility of Landsat 8 for remote assessment of water quality in two subtropical African reservoirs with contrasting trophic states
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality problems continue on a global scale and this creates the need for regular monitoring using cheaper technologies to inform management. The objective of this study was to test for significant relationships between the field-measured and Landsat 8 OLI sensor-retrieved water quality parameters. The study was carried out in two reservoirs with contrasting trophic states in Zimbabwe. Results show that the Blue/Red ratio had strong predictive relationships with Secchi disc transparency (R-2>0.70) and turbidity (R(2)0.65). The Near-infrared/Red ratio was a strong predictor of chlorophyll-a in Mazvikadei (R-2>0.84) whereas in Lake Chivero, which is more polluted, the red band was the most useful predictor (R-2=0.69). Overall, our work demonstrates the utility of using Landsat 8 band ratios for remote assessment of water quality in African reservoirs as a value-addition to the traditional field-based methods, which are expensive resulting in data scarcity.

TI  - Tolstoy's Text and Intertextuality in Solzhenitsyn's Novel "Cancer Ward"
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research paper is dedicated to the problem of differentiation between Tolstoy's texts and inter textual elements in Solzhenitsyn's "Cancer Ward" by means of revealing the frequency and relevance of an appeal to the ideas of Tolstoy as well as Stalin, Gorky, Bacon, Pushkin, Herverg. In "Cancer Ward" Tolstoy's ideas put forward in the story "What Men Live by", in the short novel "Cossacks" and in the novels "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina", engender disputes between their characters about the meaning of life. These ideas serve as a rate scale of the events, set the highest religious and moral objectives, influence reflecting characters thus, leading some of them to the adoption of his ideas and spiritual resurrection whereas others to the search for their own answers to the question of being. In Solzhenitsyn's short novel the title of Tolstoy's story "What Men Live by" serves as an epigraph; the system of characters is built in accordance with the person's integration into the dialogue with Tolstoy's ideas and the cultural heritage. Oleg Kostoglotov bearing in mind Tolstoy's lessons does not take anyone's opinions on trust. He develops his own attitude to everything that is happening and becoming spiritually transformed he triumphed over death. The quoted opinions of the philosophers, political leaders and writers about "social" behavior of the Man are "secondary" compared with the ontological values presented in Tolstoy's works and do not play a determinative role in the formation of Solzhenitsyn's characters' worldview. In terms of genre composition, the "Cancer Ward" is a philosophical and publicist short novel. The predominance of Tolstoy's text over the intertextuality is an additional evidence of the timeless significance of his ideas for people of the following centuries.

TI  - Circumpolar spatio-temporal patterns and contributing climatic factors of wildfire activity in the Arctic tundra from 2001-2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have seen an increased frequency of wildfire events in different parts of Arctic tundra ecosystems. Contemporary studies have largely attributed these wildfire events to the Arctic's rapidly changing climate and increased atmospheric disturbances (i.e. thunderstorms). However, existing research has primarily examined the wildfire-climate dynamics of individual large wildfire events. No studies have investigated wildfire activity, including climatic drivers, for the entire tundra biome across multiple years, i.e. at the planetary scale. To address this limitation, this paper provides a planetary/circumpolar scale analyses of space-time patterns of tundra wildfire occurrence and climatic association in the Arctic over a 15 year period (2001-2015). In doing so, we have leveraged and analyzed NASA Terra's MODIS active fire and MERRA climate reanalysis products at multiple temporal scales (decadal, seasonal and monthly). Our exploratory spatial data analysis found that tundra wildfire occurrence was spatially clustered and fire intensity was spatially autocorrelated across the Arctic regions. Most of the wildfire events occurred in the peak summer months (June-August). Our multi-temporal (decadal, seasonal and monthly) scale analyses provide further support to the link between climate variability and wildfire activity. Specifically, we found that warm and dry conditions in the late spring to mid-summer influenced tundra wildfire occurrence, spatio-temporal distribution, and fire intensity. Additionally, reduced average surface precipitation and soil moisture levels in the winter-spring period were associated with increased fire intensity in the following summer. These findings enrich contemporary knowledge on tundra wildfire's spatial and seasonal patterns, and shed new light on tundra wildfire-climate relationships in the circumpolar context. Furthermore, this first pan-Arctic analysis provides a strong incentive and direction for future studies which integrate multiple datasets (i.e. climate, fuels, topography, and ignition sources) to accurately estimate carbon emission from tundra burning and its global climate feedbacks in coming decades.

TI  - Fast detection of significantly transformed areas due to illegal waste burial with a procedure applicable to Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of illegal waste burial is a serious threat to human health and ecosystems. These illegal activities occur most often in areas which have been heavily modified and considered degraded, mainly quarry areas and landfills, even if it is licensed.To identify the areas where there is suspicion of illegal waste burial, a great amount of time is often necessary. As a matter of fact, the detection of suspicious areas is often based on a comparison of available airborne images with high temporal and spatial resolution, and surveys. This is also done to gather significant aspect of change as deep soil reshuffle in small excavation areas. These methods however, take a long time to be applied because large areas have to be analysed within sub-areas. Consequently, there is loss of understanding related to a wider and complete phenomenon that allows us to have information of all the territory that has undergone heavy transformations, especially if due to illegal conduct of waste disposal. As a result, there are no enough data to strategically evaluate how to counteract such illegal activities.Since these areas have already been heavily disturbed and subjected to continuous changes over time, one or more detection techniques in a standardized procedure might only be applicable in some contexts. The above method comparison and survey is certainly a useful tool for detecting areas affected by excavation activities or waste illegal disposal. It also provides information where significant transformations have occurred in a short time.The purpose of this work is the development of a processing procedure with Landsat images applicable to agro-ecosystems that can produce results in heavily transformed areas where suspicion of illegal waste burial is high.

AB  - In the context of the Spot World Heritage (SWH) initiative, the long term archive of Spot 1 to 5 satellite data will be reprocessed. This initiative gives the opportunity to increase Spot data quality and production efficiency with the introduction of new state-of-the-art processing methods. In this context, we consider the Spot 5 Supermode processing chain and the introduction of a new denoising method. Our objective is to propose the best denoising method in terms of efficiency and accuracy for the Spot 5 Supermode data production. We report two experimentations that lead to the choice of the Non Local Bayes (NLB) denoising method; it is fast, accurate and remains stable in terms of efficiency and quality for different landscapes and image sizes. We also introduce two optimized versions of the NLB algorithm that increase the computation efficiency by a factor up to 4.

AB  - The intensity of a wildfire depends in large part on the fuel available to the fire, including surface bark, leaf litter, and over- and understorey vegetation. The amount and configuration of these fuels are affected by cycles of destruction during fires and slow regrowth. Current fuel amounts, required for predictions of future fires, are therefore difficult to quantify as past fire history and fuel recovery must be taken into account. Most fire services rely on visual inspections of forest recovery, however, these are often subjective and very labour-intensive. Remote sensing offers an automated alternative with the potential for rapidly assessing fuel state over large areas allowing for continuous monitoring over time. This paper describes a new index for measuring temporal fuel state, called the Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI). The index provides an alternative to the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which is prone to potentially large uncertainties due to large levels of seasonal dynamics. The VSPI estimates a vertically integrated burn severity and ecosystem recovery measurement for forested areas. The method is applied in this paper to a fire in Western Australia, the 2005 Perth Hills fire to demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of this new index. For this fire the VSPI provides a better estimate of fire severity and shows fuel disturbance levels for two years longer than the NBR, providing an improved estimation for post-fire vegetation recovery and vegetation condition assessment suitable for fire predictions.

TI  - JRA-55CHS: An Atmospheric Reanalysis Produced with High-Resolution SST
T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - As an additional product of the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) project, a new global atmospheric reanalysis product, named JRA-55CHS, is under construction. It utilizes quarter-degree sea-surface temperature (SST) as lower-boundary condition with the same data assimilation system as the JRA-55 Conventional (JRA-55C), into which no satellite data is assimilated. The SST data can resolve steep SST gradients along the western boundary currents (WBCs), which are not necessarily well represented in many of the other atmospheric reanalysis products, including the JRA-55C. The present paper briefly documents basic performance of the JRA-55CHS, through comparing it with the JRA-55C and satellite observations in focusing on the major WBC regions. In the JRA-55CHS, mesoscale atmospheric structures along the WBCs are well reproduced in their climatological-mean fields as captured in the satellite observations. Their interannual-to decadal-scale variations associated with SST variations are also reasonably reproduced. The corresponding atmospheric features are less obvious in the JRA-55C owing to smoother SST prescribed. Furthermore, comparison between the two reanalysis products reveals that the influence of frontal-scale SST distributions can reach into the middle and upper troposphere, especially in summer. The JRA-55CHS will be useful for deepening our understanding of the nature of midlatitude frontal-scale air-sea interactions.

AB  - Cloud detection is a key issue for exploiting the information from Earth observation satellites multispectral sensors. For Proba-V, cloud detection is challenging due to the limited number of spectral bands. Advanced machine learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), have shown to work well on this problem provided enough labeled data. However, simultaneous collocated information about the presence of clouds is usually not available or requires a great amount of manual labor. In this work, we propose to learn from the available Landsat-8 cloud masks datasets and transfer this learning to solve the Proba-V cloud detection problem. CNN are trained with Landsat images adapted to resemble Proba-V characteristics and tested on a large set of real Proba-V scenes. Developed models outperform current operational Proba-V cloud detection without being trained with any real Proba-V data. Moreover, cloud detection accuracy can be further increased if the CNN are fine-tuned using a limited amount of Proba-V data.

CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Kernel methods have been very successful in remote sensing problems because of their ability to deal with high dimensional non-linear data. However, they are computationally expensive to train when a large amount of samples are used. In this context, while the amount of available remote sensing data has constantly increased, the size of training sets in kernel methods is usually restricted to few thousand samples. In this work, we modified the kernel ridge regression (KRR) training procedure to deal with large scale datasets. In addition, the basis functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space are defined as parameters to be also optimized during the training process. This extends the number of free parameters from two (in the standard KRR with an RBF kernel) to more than fifty thousand in our experiments. The effectiveness of the proposal is illustrated in the problem of surface temperature estimation from MetOp-IASI hyperspectral infrared sounding data. The data set used contains more than one million samples, but the proposed method could potentially be trained with much more data.

AB  - In this work we present a methodology to estimate the 3D distribution of water vapor in atmosphere based on the use of SAR interferometry (InSAR) and Sentinel-1 data. Maps of propagation delay in atmosphere are assimilated in a high resolution Numerical Weather Model to enhance the forecast of atmosphere parameters. These are used to compute the atmosphere refractivity. Furthermore, 3D maps of hydrometers in atmosphere are derived after the assimilation of InSAR data. Both refractivity and hydrometeors maps are used to map 3D Water vapor patterns in atmosphere. Examples of InSAR signatures of water vapor in atmosphere are shown. We show how the 3D maps liquid refractivity and hydrometeors can be a useful tool to map moisture in atmosphere in case of convective phenomena in atmosphere.

AB  - In this work, we study the problem of assimilating high resolution Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) maps using the Weather Research and Forecast 3D Variational Data assimilation system (WRF-3DVar). The PWV maps are obtained using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and the SAR interferometry (InSAR) technique. The influence of the high resolution PWV data on the initial condition of WRF and during the next 12 hours is studied. We demonstrate that the assimilation of InSAR PWV maps increases both the water vapor concentration and temperature over areas affected by extreme weather events so correctly generating localized convection cells. The PWV forecast, after the assimilation of InSAR maps, are compared with the PWV estimates provided by a dense GNSS network. The precipitation pattern and amount are compared to meteorological radar measurements. The case study of the extreme weather event that affected the city of Adra, Spain, on 6th September 2015, is used to demonstrate how the assimilation of high resolution PWV maps.

AB  - This paper presents an evaluation of methods for detecting temporal changes in multi-spectral satellite imagery. A comparison of algorithm performance on both real and simulated satellite imagery is included. The real-world dataset (WorldView-2) required accurate registration and truth labeling, while the simulated satellite imagery and respective truth were readily available. An array of algorithms from conventional to statistical, distribution based, geometrical, graph-based and other approaches were evaluated. The Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area-Under-ROC Curve (AUC) metrics were used for algorithm evaluation. Finally, the performance of various algorithms on simulated vs real images is discussed, which may be helpful in further applications of simulated imagery. The Graph-based methods, Chronochrome, Complexity and Outlier shift approaches performed well on both real and simulated datasets. A Python-based graphical user interface was written to automate the algorithm evaluation process and display the results.

AB  - Geographical information system and remote sensing data are now more remarkable for the extraction of lineaments. Lineaments studies provide the tectonic history of geological settings. It is the objective of this study to demonstrate the extraction of lineaments from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) of Kelantan area. The current approach applied different image processing techniques on Landsat 8 imagery to achieve its gold. The image processing techniques include; principal component analysis (1,2,3), Band ratios (7/5,6/4, 4/2) and Minimum Noise Fraction bands (7,5,3). Gamm stretching and directional filtering facilitate the extraction of lineaments. The results of this study indicate that the area is affected by several structural trends (N-S, NW-SE, and NE-SW). The structural trends sever as conduits for gold mineralization fluids. The methodology demonstrates capability in extracting lineaments from Landsat 8 imagery. The methods locate known gold deposits and also highlight new locations for new ones.

AB  - This paper investigated the potential of multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data for detecting burned areas in southern African deciduous savannahs. Prior to Sentinel-1, low cost, frequent, global coverage of C-band SAR data with a high level of spatial detail (<1 ha) were not available. The study took place in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa (SA). Pre-fire and post-fire Sentinel-1 dual polarized (VH, VV) C-band backscatter values for 30 burn events recorded by a 500-m MODIS burned area dataset in 2015 were examined. For all burned areas, a systematic backscatter decrease from pre-fire to post-fire conditions was observed. The burned areas exhibited a mean backscatter decrease of 1.85 dB and 1.12 dB, and 93% and 83% of the fire events had backscatter decreases greater than the Sentinel-1 0.38 dB radiometric accuracy, for VH and VV respectively. The decrease in backscatter was hypothesised as being due to a reduction in grass biomass and grass/soil moisture levels post-fire. This research provides evidence that burned areas can be detected by C-band space borne SAR in southern African savannahs.

TI  - Detection and mapping of bracken fern weeds using multispectral remotely sensed data: a review of progress and challenges
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bracken fern is one of the major invasive plants distributed all over the world currently threatening socio-economic and ecological systems due to its ability to swiftly colonize landscapes. The study aimed at reviewing the progress and challenges in detecting and mapping of bracken fern weeds using different remote sensing techniques. Evidence from literature have revealed that traditional methods such as field surveys and modelling have been insufficient in detecting and mapping the spatial distribution of bracken fern at a regional scale. The applications of medium spatial resolution sensors have been constrained by their limited spatial, spectral and radiometric capabilities in detecting and mapping bracken fern. On the other hand, the availability of most of these data-sets free of charge, large swath width and their high temporal resolution have significantly improved remote sensing of bracken fern. The use of commercial satellite data with high resolution have also proven useful in providing fine spectral and spatial resolution capabilities that are primarily essential to offer precise and reliable data on the spatial distribution of invasive species. However, the application of these data-sets is largely restricted to smaller areas, due to high costs and huge data volumes. Studies on bracken fern classification have extensively adopted traditional classification methods such as supervised maximum likelihood classifier. In studies where traditional methods performed poorly, the combination of soft classifiers such as super resolution analysis and traditional methods of classification have shown an improvement in bracken fern classification. Finally, since high spatial resolution sensors are expensive to acquire and have small swath width, the current study recommends that future research can also consider investigating the utility of the freely available recently launched sensors with a global footprint that has the potential to provide invaluable information for repeated measurement of invasive species over time and space.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXIV
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The modern optical satellite sensors capture images in stereo and tri-stereo acquisition modes. This allows reconstruction of high-resolution (30-70 cm) topography from the satellite data. However, numerous areas on the Earth exhibit complex topography with a lot of "discontinuities". One case is tectonic fault sites, which form steep topographic escarpments enclosing narrow, deep corridors that mask parts of the ground. Built with common approaches (stereo or tri-stereo), a digital surface model (DSM) would not recover the topography in these masked zones.In this work, we have settled on a new methodology, based on the combination of multiple satellite Pleiades images taken with different geometries of acquisition (pitch and roll angles), with the purpose to generate fully-resolved DSMs at very high-resolution (50 cm). We have explored which configurations of satellites (i.e., number of images and ranges of pitch and roll angles) allow to best measure the topography inside deep and narrow canyons.We have collected seventeen Pleiades Images with different configurations over the Valley of Fire fault zone, USA, where the fault topography is complex. We have also measured sixteen ground control points (GCPs) in the zone. From all possible combinations of 2 to 17 Pleiades images, we have selected 150 combinations and have generated the corresponding DSMs. The calculations are done by solving an energy minimization problem that searches for a disparity map minimizing the energy, which depends on the likelihood for pixels to belong to a unique point in 3D as well as regularization terms. We have statistically studied which combinations of images deliver DSMs with the best surface coverage, as well as the lowest uncertainties on geolocalisation and elevation measures, by using the GCPs. Our first results suggest that an exceeding time between our acquisitions leads to DSM with a low covered area. We conclude that Stereo and Tri-Stereo acquisition in one-single pass of the satellite will systematically generate a better DSM than multi-date acquisition. We also conclude that in some cases, multi-date acquisitions with 7-8 images can improve the DSM robustness compared to multi-date acquisitions with fewer images.

TI  - Modeling emissions for three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry transport models
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Poor air quality is still a threat for human health in many parts of the world. In order to assess measures for emission reductions and improved air quality, three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry transport modeling systems are used in numerous research institutions and public authorities. These models need accurate emission data in appropriate spatial and temporal resolution as input. This paper reviews the most widely used emission inventories on global and regional scales and looks into the methods used to make the inventory data model ready. Shortcomings of using standard temporal profiles for each emission sector are discussed, and new methods to improve the spatiotemporal distribution of the emissions are presented. These methods are often neither top-down nor bottom-up approaches but can be seen as hybrid methods that use detailed information about the emission process to derive spatially varying temporal emission profiles. These profiles are subsequently used to distribute bulk emissions such as national totals on appropriate grids. The wide area of natural emissions is also summarized, and the calculation methods are described. Almost all types of natural emissions depend on meteorological information, which is why they are highly variable in time and space and frequently calculated within the chemistry transport models themselves. The paper closes with an outlook for new ways to improve model ready emission data, for example, by using external databases about road traffic flow or satellite data to determine actual land use or leaf area. In a world where emission patterns change rapidly, it seems appropriate to use new types of statistical and observational data to create detailed emission data sets and keep emission inventories up-to-date.Implications: Emission data are probably the most important input for chemistry transport model (CTM) systems. They need to be provided in high spatial and temporal resolution and on a grid that is in agreement with the CTM grid. Simple methods to distribute the emissions in time and space need to be replaced by sophisticated emission models in order to improve the CTM results. New methods, e.g., for ammonia emissions, provide grid cell-dependent temporal profiles. In the future, large data fields from traffic observations or satellite observations could be used for more detailed emission data.

AB  - Soil moisture content is an essential climate variable that is operationally delivered at low resolution (e.g. 36-9 km) by earth observation missions, such as ESA/SMOS, NASA/SMAP and EUMETSAT/ASCAT. However numerous land applications would benefit from the availability of soil moisture maps at higher resolution. For this reason, there is a large research effort to develop soil moisture products at higher resolution using, for instance, data acquired by the new ESA's Sentinel missions. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it presents the validation status of a pre-operational soil moisture product derived from Sentinel-1 at 1 km resolution. Second, it assesses the possibility of integrating Sentinel-2 data and additional ancillary information, such as parcel borders and high resolution soil texture maps, in order to obtain soil moisture maps at "field scale" resolution, i.e. similar to 0.1 km Case studies concerning agricultural sites located in Europe are presented.

TI  - Predictive performance of regression models to estimate Chlorophyll-a concentration based on Landsat imagery
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a key parameter to describe water quality in marine and freshwater environments. Nowadays, several products with Chl-a have derived from satellite imagery, but they are not available or reliable sometimes for coastal and/or small water bodies. Thus, in the last decade several methods have been described to estimate Chl-a with high-resolution (30 m) satellite imagery, such as Landsat, but a standardized method to estimate Chl-a from Landsat imagery has not been accepted yet. Therefore, this study evaluated the predictive performance of regression models (Simple Linear Regression [SLR], Multiple Linear Regression [MLR] and Generalized Additive Models [GAMs]) to estimate Chl-a based on Landsat imagery, using in situ Chl-a data collected (synchronized with the overpass of Landsat 8 satellite) and spectral reflectance in the visible light portion (bands 1-4) and near infrared (band 5). These bands were selected because of Chl-a absorbance/reflectance properties in these wavelengths. According to goodness of fit, GAM outperformed SLR and MLR. However, the model validation showed that MLR performed better in predicting log-transformed Chl-a. Thus, MLR, constructed by using four spectral bands (1, 2, 3, and 5), was considered the best method to predict Chl-a. The coefficients of this model suggested that log-transformed Chl-a concentration had a positive linear relationship with bands 1 (coastal/aerosol), 3 (green), and 5 (NIR). On the other hand, band 2 (blue) suggested a negative relationship, which implied high coherence with Chl-a absorbance/reflectance properties measured in the laboratory, indicating that Landsat 8 images could be applied effectively to estimate Chl-a concentrations in coastal environments.

AB  - The Islamization of language could not be deniable when Isalamization process is carried out in any cultures. Arabic language is being charged with Divine inspiration in the form of Revelation so that Arabic becomes the noblest one among the humankind's language and it is the only divinely inspiration living language. The Islamic key concepts as represented by its worldview is encompassing some vocabularies which are use in any languages such as the words Allah (God), Rasulullah (Messenger), Jannah (Paradise), Akhirah (The Day After), iman (belief), adl (justice), etc. In Indonesian language for example, these basic Arabic vocabularies also used as key concepts in understanding of Islam. However, because of social dynamic and developing era of politics, economics or culture in Indonesia deIslamization of language takes place as well. In fact, changing meaning of the key concepts of Islam and shifting paradigm of thoughts cause to devastating of Muslim's religiosity.

AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is usually referred to as an important parameter for vegetation health monitoring and also used as control parameter in terrestrial ecosystem change detection. In recent year several models have been developed for FVC measurement using satellite data and digital images at regional and global scale. For the validation and modification in these models need to a precise ground truth information. FVC measured using digital camera act as an efficient ground truth information, but it is also lack in accuracy due to limited number of images and sampling points are possible to take with camera. Drone is the recent trend for precision agriculture monitoring and can be used as substitute to overcome these problems. In this paper an efficient method of ground truth FVC measurement using drone image is developed, which is further used for development of a sigmoid model to measure FVC using Sentinel-2 data for larger area. Results of the obtained model are compared with ground truth FVC and obtained value of RMSE is 0.10. FVC are also measured with dimidiate pixel model and obtained RMSE value with ground truth FVC is 0.17. Results show that developed model can be used for efficient measurement of fractional vegetation cover.

AB  - Virtual Water Values (ViWA) is an interdisciplinary research project of geographers, remote sensing scientists, agro-economists, computer scientists and landscape planners. It aims at supporting the implementation of water and food related SDGs by first developing a global, high resolution monitoring system for agricultural yields, water use efficiency and actual virtual water contents of agricultural products based on COPERNICUS Sentinel-2 time series. This data is used as input to GCE simulations of global agricultural trade and to identify global hot-spots of unsustainable (inefficient) water use and trade (both green and blue) by agriculture. Scenarios of trade incentives and regulations will be analyzed for their potentials and effectiveness to improve the sustainability of global agricultural water use. The Danube river basin is one regional case study of ViWA.Here the role of irrigation water use as well as upstream-downstream water conflicts is studied. First results of the continental and regional monitoring and simulations of actual yields, water use efficiencies and virtual water contents are shown and discussed.

TI  - A hybrid gene selection approach to create the S1500+ targeted gene sets for use in high-throughput transcriptomics
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Changes in gene expression can help reveal the mechanisms of disease processes and the mode of action for toxicities and adverse effects on cellular responses induced by exposures to chemicals, drugs and environment agents. The U.S. Tox21 Federal collaboration, which currently quantifies the biological effects of nearly 10,000 chemicals via quantitative high-throughput screening(qHTS) in in vitro model systems, is now making an effort to incorporate gene expression profiling into the existing battery of assays. Whole transcriptome analyses performed on large numbers of samples using microarrays or RNA-Seq is currently cost-prohibitive. Accordingly, the Tox21 Program is pursuing a high-throughput transcriptomics (HTT) method that focuses on the targeted detection of gene expression for a carefully selected subset of the transcriptome that potentially can reduce the cost by a factor of 10-fold, allowing for the analysis of larger numbers of samples. To identify the optimal transcriptome subset, genes were sought that are (1) representative of the highly diverse biological space, (2) capable of serving as a proxy for expression changes in unmeasured genes, and (3) sufficient to provide coverage of well described biological pathways. A hybrid method for gene selection is presented herein that combines data-driven and knowledge-driven concepts into one cohesive method. Our approach is modular, applicable to any species, and facilitates a robust, quantitative evaluation of performance. In particular, we were able to perform gene selection such that the resulting set of sentinel genes adequately represents all known canonical pathways from Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB v4.0) and can be used to infer expression changes for the remainder of the transcriptome. The resulting computational model allowed us to choose a purely data-driven subset of 1500 sentinel genes, referred to as the S1500 set, which was then augmented using a knowledge-driven selection of additional genes to create the final S1500+ gene set. Our results indicate that the sentinel genes selected can be used to accurately predict pathway perturbations and biological relationships for samples under study. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Tapping the Tacit Knowledge of Playfield Swings to Learn Physics: A Case Study of Childhood Reflections by Pre-service Teachers
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Children experience physical phenomena and formulate an epistemological worldview before contact with school science. School science extends thought about the same phenomena to deeper levels but does not always link with out-of-school experiences. This study explored preservice teachers' indigenous knowledge or tacit knowledge about the playground swing and its use to teach the physics of the simple pendulum. The preservice teachers' indigenous knowledge experiences with playground swings may be a pivot for linking their physics teaching to out-of-school experiences. A phenomenological research design was used to explore experiences of eight preservice teachers. Data were collected using focus group interviews and personal interviews and were thematically analysed. Findings show that young players become aware of relationships between variables; they are attracted to the swings for specific reasons; they connect experiences at swings with physical laws. However, pre-service teachers are not able to connect this tacit knowledge with formal science. Yet teachers should realise that school physics explains everyday experiences which they know in their vernacular. The lack of such a link may disadvantage learners in understanding ideas expressed in English, which is not their mother tongue. Thus, teachers need to link indigenous tacit knowledge with school physics in order to develop effective teaching strategies.

AB  - The article shows that the virtual world cannot claim the status of culture in the classical sense, because it has no key characteristics: the ability to symbolize forms, reproducibility, ethical criteria. The absence of ethical standards and spiritual aspects is one of the main problems of the phenomenon of digital reality. Prospects for the development of Digital Culture in the anthropological aspect are associated with the need for its philosophical understanding and identification of the influence on the spiritual world of human being. The students are heterogeneous in the virtual behavior related to the Internet and the perception of Digital Culture. Three behavioral patterns were defined in the virtual environment among the students. These patterns influence students' ecological outlook and real behavior.

TI  - Implementation of machine-learning classification in remote sensing: an applied review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Machine learning offers the potential for effective and efficient classification of remotely sensed imagery. The strengths of machine learning include the capacity to handle data of high dimensionality and to map classes with very complex characteristics. Nevertheless, implementing a machine-learning classification is not straightforward, and the literature provides conflicting advice regarding many key issues. This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs. We illustrate these issues through applying machine-learning classification to two publically available remotely sensed data sets.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine appreciative attitudes toward Jews - a historically marginalized and targeted worldview identity group in the context of American higher education - among non-Jewish undergraduates. Drawing from a sample of 13,489 students across 52 institutions and using a multilevel modeling approach, we found that appreciative attitudes toward Jews varied by students' perceptions of structural, psychological and behavioral climate dimensions related to worldview and by students' identification patterns, including worldview. Of specific interest to Jewish educators, the presence of a Jewish organization on campus was associated with greater appreciative student attitudes toward Jews after controlling for demographic and other institutional covariates.

AB  - Evaluation of vegetation cover by using the remote sensing data can provide enhanced results with less time and expense. In this paper, we propose a new automatic algorithm for detection of vegetation regions in high-resolution satellite/aerial images. It uses only color channels of the image and involves two modeling and evaluation phases. In the modeling phase, after extracting color and texture features for the pixels within a few manually-indicated vegetation areas, a model is obtained based on principle component analysis (PCA). In the evaluation phase, the same color and texture features are primarily computed for every pixel of the specified image. Then, an error value is computed for each pixel which determines the model mismatch score. Finally, by thresholding the error image consisting of all error values, the vegetation regions can be distinguished from the background. Experimental results demonstrated outstanding solution quality for the proposed algorithm (so-called PCAM, standing for PCA-based modeling) compared to a number of counterpart methods.

AB  - Since optical remote sensing images are useless in cloudy conditions, a possible alternative is to resort to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, many conventional techniques for Earth monitoring applications require specific spectral features which are defined only for multispectral data. For this reason, in this work we propose to estimate missing spectral features through data fusion and deep learning, exploiting both temporal and cross-sensor dependencies on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series. The proposed approach, validated focusing on the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), shows very interesting results with a large performance gain over the linear regression approach according to several accuracy indicators.

TI  - Human Settlement Dynamics in the Bamenda III Municipality, North West Region, Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Every human settlement, from its occupation by a pioneer population continues to undergo a process of dynamism which is the result of socio economic and dynamic factors operating at the local, national and global levels. The urban metabolism model shows clearly that human settlements are the quality outputs of the transformation of inputs by an urban area through a metabolic process. This study seeks to bring to focus the drivers of human settlement dynamics in Bamenda 3, the manifestation of the dynamics and the functional evolution. The study made used of secondary data and information from published and unpublished sources. Landsat images of 1989, 1999 and 2015 were used to analyze dynamics in human settlement. Field survey was carried out. The results show multiple drivers of human settlement dynamism associated with population growth. Human settlement dynamics from 1989, 1999 and 2015 show an evolution in surface area with that of other uses like agriculture reducing. Multiple functions and network infrastructure evolve with human settlement. In the Bamenda 3 municipality, the dynamics of human settlements was slow but constant up to the year 2007. In 2007, the Bamenda III municipality was created. It serves as a gateway to the administrative divisions of Boyo, Ngoketunjia, Bui and Donga Mantung and an important transit for passengers and goods to and from the North West Region. It is crossed by a major road and has several education establishments. It attracts every population age group and of various professions such as students and other stakeholders. Farmland is gradually reducing since 1989, transformed continuously into human settlements. This expansion is more of the informal due to a weak implementation of legislation and a weak control mechanism. There is need for a strict control mechanism to reduce informal settlements.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - People seem to have a tendency to increase the relative size of self-representational objects. Prior research suggests that motivational factors may fuel that tendency, so the present research built from terror management theory to examine whether existential motivations - engendered by concerns about death - may have similar implications for self-relevant size biases. Specifically, across two studies (total N=288), we hypothesized that reminders of death would lead participants to inflate the size of self-representational objects. Both studies suggested that relative to reminders of pain, mortality salience led participants to construct larger clay sculptures of themselves (vs. others; Study 1) and a larger ostensible video game avatar for the self (vs. others; Study 2).

TI  - Evaluating the Mid-Infrared Bi-spectral Index for improved assessment of low-severity fire effects in a conifer forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing products provide a vital understanding of wildfire effects across a landscape, but detection and delineation of low-and mixed-severity fire remain difficult. Although data provided by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project are frequently used to assess severity in the United States, alternative indices can offer improvement in the measurement of low-severity fire effects and would be beneficial for future product development and adoption. This research note evaluated one such alternative, the Mid-Infrared Bi-Spectral Index (MIRBI), which was developed in savannah ecosystems to isolate spectral changes caused by burning and reduce noise from other factors. MIRBI, differenced MIRBI (dMIRBI) and burn severity indices used by MTBS were assessed for spectral optimality at distinguishing severity and the ability to differentiate between unburned and burned canopy in a conifer forest. The MIRBI indices were better at isolating changes caused by burning and demonstrated higher spectral separability, particularly at low severity. These findings suggest that MIRBI indices can provide an enhanced alternative or complement to current MTBS products in high-canopy-cover forests for applications such as discernment of fire perimeters and unburned islands, as well as identification of low-severity fire effects.

AB  - Landsat 9 will continue the Landsat data record into its fifth decade with a near-copy build of Landsat 8 with launch scheduled for December 2020. The two instruments on Landsat 9 are Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) and Operational Land Imager-2(OLI-2). TIRS-2 is a two channel pushbroom imager with a 15-degree field of view that will have a 16-day measurement cadence from its nominal 705-km orbit altitude. Its carefully developed instrument performance requirements and associated characterization plan will result in stable and well understood science-quality imagery that will be used for environmental, economic and legal applications. This paper will present a summary of the plan for TIRS-2 prelaunch characterization at the component, subsystem, and instrument level.

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Stray light, any unwanted radiation that reaches a focal plane, presents a significant challenge for both airborne and satellite remote sensing systems by reducing image contrast, creating false signals or obscuring faint ones, and ultimately degrading radiometric accuracy. These detrimental effects can have a profound impact on the usability of collected data, which must be radiometrically calibrated to be useful for scientific applications. Understanding the full impact of stray light on data scientific utility is of particular concern for lower cost, more compact satellite systems which inherently provide fewer opportunities for stray light control. To address these concerns, we present a general methodology for integrating an optomechanical system model with the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) model. The results reported in this paper describe the collection of necessary raytrace data from an optomechanical system model (in this case, using FRED Optical Engineering Software), and also include the initial demonstration of the integration method by imaging DIRSIG test scenes. By integrating a high-fidelity optomechanical system model with a physics-driven, synthetic image generation model like DIRSIG, we are now able to explore system trade studies and conduct sensitivity analyses on parameters of interest, including those that influence stray light, by analyzing their effects on realistic test scenes. This new capability further aids in demonstrating the quantitative linkage between system trade studies and impact to scientific users, which will enhance the writing of system requirements.

TI  - The Witch, the Goat and the Devil: A Discussion of Scapegoating and the Objectification of Evil in Robert Eggers' <i>The Witch</i>
T2  - THEOLOGY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - The demise of a child, a tragedy that occurs every few seconds on the face on this planet, marred by starvation and abject poverty, always constitutes a grim mystery, challenging every religious outlook and philosophy. Robert Eggers' 2015 movie, The Witch, depicts the tragic loss of a baby, in this case posing the additional mystery as to exactly how it occurred. Though the specters of malnutrition and malady haunt this film, the precise circumstances surrounding the child's fate are left largely to the viewer's imagination. The film explores the question as to where we can lay blame for ostensibly senseless tragedy. Within its narrative world, and arguably, within the worldview of the religious imagination more broadly, humanity seeks someone or something to blame for horrific events. Recent tragedies and world history attest to the human tendency, in the face of immense suffering, to scapegoat some alleged culprit, perhaps going so far as to allege their complicity with the devil, to directly identify them as Satanor to more subtly demonize them. No single religion or worldview can boast sole claim to this propensity that to this present day claims lives.The Witch raises the question as to whether culpability for evil resides ultimately with the self, with social structures, with humanity as a whole, with inhuman forces of nature, or within the supernatural realm. The mystery is at its most agonizing when conventional moralizing is befuddled and there is no obvious culprit, no free-willed villain caught with a smoking gun. Eggers' screenplay sustains the ambiguity that can enshroud tragedy such as the unresolved abduction of a child or sudden infant death, blurring the line between facticity and the archetypal imagery through which the psyche seeks to express that which it cannot explain.

TI  - Mapping shallow nearshore benthic features in a Caribbean marine-protected area: assessing the efficacy of using different data types (hydroacoustic versus satellite images) and classification techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various benthic mapping methods exist but financing and technical capacity limit the choice of technology available to developing states to aid with natural resource management. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of using a single-beam echosounder (SBES), satellite images (GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2) and different image (pixel-based Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), and an object-based image analysis (OBIA)) and hydroacoustic classification and interpolation techniques, to map nearshore benthic features at the Bluefields Bay marine protected area in western Jamaica (13.82km(2) in size). A map with three benthic classes (submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), bare substrate, and coral reef) produced from a radiometrically corrected, deglinted and water column-corrected WorldView-2 image had a marginally higher accuracy (3%) than that of a map classified from a similarly corrected GeoEye-1 image. However, only one of the two extra WorldView-2 image bands (coastal) was used because the yellow band was completely attenuated at depths 3.7m. The coral reef class was completely misclassified by the MLC and had to be contextually edited. The contextually edited MLC map had a higher overall accuracy (OA) than the OBIA map (86.7% versus 80.4%) and maps that were not contextually edited. But, the OBIA map had a higher OA than a MLC map without edits. Maps produced from the images also had a higher accuracy than the SAV map created from the acoustic data (OAs >80% and kappa >0.67 versus 76.6% and kappa=0.32). SAV classification was comparable among the classified SBES SAV data points and all the final maps. The total area classified as SAV was marginally larger for satellite maps; however, the total area classified as bare substrate using the images was twice as large. A substrate map with three classes (silt, sand, and coral/hard bottom) produced from the SBES data using a random forest classifier and a Markov chain interpolator had a higher accuracy than a substrate map produced using a fractal dimension classifier and an indicator krig (the default choice) (72.4% versus 53.5%). The coral reef class from the SBES, OBIA, and contextually edited maps had comparable accuracies, but covered a much smaller area in the SBES maps because data points were lost during the interpolation process. The use of images was limited by turbidity levels and cloud cover and it yielded lower benthic detail. Despite these limitations, satellite image classification was the most efficacious method. If greater benthic detail is required, the SBES is more suitable or more effort is required during image classification. Also, the SBES can be operated in areas with turbid waters and greater depths. However, it could not be used in very shallow areas. Also, processing and interpolation of data points can result in a loss of resolution and introduces spatial uncertainty.

AB  - In preparation for Canada's launch of the RADARSAT-Constellation, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada examined whether Compact Polarimetry (CP) would be suitable for estimation of surface soil moisture. In this study, CP RH and RV intensities were simulated from RADARSAT-2 Quad Pol data. A simple transfer function was developed between RH and HH intensity, as well as RV and VV. These HH- and VV-like intensities were then used with the Integral Equation Model to estimate soil moisture. These retrievals were validated against in situ networks, demonstrating the potential that RCM CP is likely to present for soil moisture monitoring.

AB  - One of the exceptional advantages of spaceborne remote sensors is their regular scanning of the Earth surface, resulting thus in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS), extremely useful to monitor natural or man-made phenomena on the ground. In this chapter, after providing a brief overview of the most recent methods proposed to process and/or analyze time series of remotely sensed data, we describe methods handling two issues: the unsupervised exploration of SITS and the reconstruction of multispectral images. In particular, we first present data mining methods for extracting spatiotemporal patterns in an unsupervised way and illustrate this approach on time series of displacement measurements derived from multitemporal In SAR images. Then we present two methods which aim to reconstruct multispectral images contaminated by the presence of clouds. The first one is based on a linear contextual prediction mode that reproduces the local spectro-temporal relationships characterizing a given time series of images. The second method tackles the image reconstruction problem within a compressive sensing formulation and with different implementation strategies. A rich set of illustrations on real and simulated examples is provided and discussed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th National Conference on Communications (NCC)
CL  - Hyderabad, INDIA
AB  - In the era of advanced communication technology, there is an ever-increasing demand for providing user-specific broadband content to a large population. Though ground infrastructure is directed towards supporting the high bandwidth needs in developed regions, the remote and isolated areas remain devoid of such services. This has led to the evolution of High Throughput Satellite (HTS) systems to deliver uniform broadband connectivity to the developed as well as the unconnected and remote regions. HTS supports a vast range of user requirements like video-on-demand, high data rate corporate links, content distribution/back-haul links from small user terminals. These satellites are capable of providing large system throughput as compared to the conventional Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Broadcast Satellite Service (BSS) satellites due to the use of multi-beam architecture and large system bandwidths. In this paper, the concept, design and features of a High throughput satellite system are discussed and the payload configuration for a geostationary Ka-band HTS over Indian region is presented. With 1 GHz of total user spectrum in forward as well as return links, the Indian Ka-band High Throughput Satellite will provide similar to 80 Gbps of overall throughput with 72 spot beams over India.

AB  - Positioning and navigation with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) like GPS, GLONASS, BEIDOU and GALILEO are more and more deployed in various telemetry applications. Achieving reliable and accurate results is the main objective especially while dealing with safety and critical applications, which need to be robust under challenging environments. Thus, the key solution for a better accuracy position is to integrate a new structure based on Radio Frequency sub-sampling (RFS) aiming to reduce the complexity by including only one RF front-end capable to collect multiple signals at the same time. This RFS architecture allows to digitize the received signals as close to the antenna as possible and has been found to be a useful tool in system design and prototyping. This paper presents an experimental assessment of the reconfigurable GNSS receiver based on GLONASS signals to demonstrate its operation and functionality. To carry out the measures, real-world satellite data are needed. A measurement companion on the GNSS receiver was conducted based on GLONASS signals in the G1 band which were generated by the Labsat2 equipment. To look for the visible satellites, the Parallel Code-Phase Search Acquisition algorithm was used (PCS). Acquisition results for GLONASS G1 are shown and the performance of the receiver is discussed.

AB  - Aerosols play a vital role in influencing the climate both by cooling and warming up the Earth's surface and also by altering the cloud properties. Due to natural and large amount of anthropogenic factors, Indian region observes high variability of loadings in aerosols both in terms of space and time in the planetary boundary layer. Dust storms in India exert momentous influences on weather, air quality, and climate of the country. Detection and monitoring of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at the time of dust storms is challenging, especially in case of short life time of events, and strong interaction with climatic parameters. This paper addresses the study of a dust storm event which hit Indian (North) region on June 13, 2015 parts of Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, UP were affected. AOD variations over the North Indian region has been studied using MODIS level 2 data (MOD04) obtained NASA Terra platform at a spatial resolution of 10 km x 10 km.

TI  - Digital Soil Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithms in a Tropical Mountainous Area

M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT: Increasingly, applications of machine learning techniques for digital soil mapping (DSM) are being used for different soil mapping purposes. Considering the variety of models available, it is important to know their performance in relation to soil data and environmental variables involved in soil mapping. This paper investigated the performance of eight machine learning algorithms for soil mapping in a tropical mountainous area of an official rural settlement in the Zona da Mata region in Brazil. Morphometric maps generated from a digital elevation model, together with Landsat-8 satellite imagery, and climatic maps, were among the set of covariates to be selected by the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to predict soil types using machine learning algorithms. Mapping performance was assessed using the confusion matrix, and the Z-test among the Kappa indexes of the matrices. In a conventional soil survey, the soils described and classified in the Brazilian System of Soil Classification [Argissolos Vermelho-Amarelos Distroficos - PVAd (Acrisols), Cambissolos Haplicos Tb Distroficos - CXbd (Cambisols), Gleissolos Haplicos Haplicos Tb Distroficos - GXbd (Gleysols), Latossolos Amarelos Distroficos - LAd (Xanthic Ferralsos), Latossolos Vermelho-Amarelos Distroficos - LVAd (Rhodic Ferralsols), and Neossolos Litolicos Distroficos - RLd (Neossols)] were grouped into composite mapping units (MU) using the conventional method. The eight algorithms showed similar performance without statistical difference (Kappa 0.42-0.48). The mapping of soils with varying slopes (LAd, LVAd, CXbd) showed lower accuracy, whereas soils on hydromorphic lowlands (GXbd) were classified more accurately. In map algebra, the result was rather satisfactory, with 63-67 % agreement between the conventional soil map and maps produced by machine learning. The areas with the largest disagreement in the DSM occurred in the LAd unit due to subtle color variation in the Latossolos mantle without a clear relation to any environmental variable, highlighting difficulties in DSM regarding hill slope landforms. Model performance was satisfactory, and good agreement with the conventional soil map demonstrates the importance of the DSM as a potential complementary tool for assisting soil mapping in mountainous areas in Brazil for the purpose of land use planning.

AB  - Megacities are urban agglomerations hosting at least 10 million inhabitants. The rise in number, population size, and spatial extent of megacities are among the most prominent manifestations of the process of urbanisation taking place in the contemporary urban age.Until recently, urban growth has been quantified with data derived from satellites mainly for single megacities or for a limited subset of them. With the current advances in Remote Sensing and data processing, the integration of satellite data with other datasets could become a key contributor to the data revolution and support more complete urban studies and better informed policymaking. Although many remote sensing-derived products exist, few are open and free and possess the adequate resolution, information and contents to monitor the process of urban expansion. This research article builds on the premier open and free geospatial information contained in the Global Human Settlements Layer (GHSL) data package (produced at the European Commission - Joint Research Centre). This research takes advantage of existing GHSL data to identify megacities and to analyse their spatial and demographic change over the last 25 years (between 1990 and 2015). This paper quantifies how much and how fast megacities have expanded in spatial and demographic terms, and we provide graphical examples of the different manifestations of growth across megacities.The main findings of our research reveal an average demographic growth in megacities exceeding 2% a year between 1990 and 2000, and of 1.9% a year between 2000 and 2015. In the first period (1990 to 2000), megacities have expanded faster than the global average and more than the average of other urban centres. In the second period, global urban population increase has been greater than that of megacities. The comparative analysis of megacities however, reveals swift population growth in several cases: in seven cities population more than doubled between 1990 and 2015, and in six the average annual population growth exceeded 4% a year. Spatial expansion of megacities tends to occur at rates slower than that of population. In 27 cities built-up per capita has decreased over 25 years, by more than 10% in 17 cities. Megacities also differ in population density (in 2015), which in five is above 10,000 inhabitants per square kilometre, while in others, especially the ones in high-income countries, density remains around half this figure.Results highlight the value of new remote sensing-based data and methods for mapping and characterizing global urbanisation processes, in a consistent and comparable manner across space and time. The provision of open and free data ensures methods and findings can be audited and analyses extended to other cities, while the temporal dimension enables monitoring urbanisation and intergovernmental policies on sustainable urban development.

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Planning for Cities and Regions (SSPCR)

AB  - Data is a key resource to analyze and compare cities and to track urbanization processes and changes in cities. Nowadays, innovative procedures for acquiring and processing remote imagery provide analysts and policy makers with globally consistent multitemporal data on human settlements, which promise unprecedented advances in urban analysis. The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) has been developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre. It contains fine-scale global and multitemporal geospatial data on populations and built-up areas. TheGHSL opens the possibility to study all cities in a globally consistent and comparative way. This study proposes a new methodology to work on the GHSL at city level and to monitor the process of urban expansion, both in terms of spatial footprint and population dynamics. The methodology introduces seven indicators: area [in km(2)], population [inhabitants], built-up [square kilometers], built-up to area ratio, population density [inhabitants per square kilometer], and built-up and area per capita [in square meters]. The changes across reference points in the years 1975-1990 to 2000-2015 are used to monitor and benchmark urban growth and expansion. This research paper illustrates the methodological procedure for data preparation, and it explains the GHSL-derived indicators for monitoring urban analysis. The second part of the research applies the methodology to the Chinese cities of Beijing and Guangzhou to analyze, by a comparative perspective, the two cases. The paper contains data analysis capturing the dynamics of growth of urban areas, population, and built-up surfaces between 1975 and 2015. Guangzhou and Beijing are representative examples of rapid urbanization: Beijing grew faster than Guangzhou in the period 1990-2015 in terms of population, while built-up growth over the same years has been faster in Guangzhou. The comparison of the two cities elicits interesting phenomena such as the different speeds of population and built-up growth in the period 1990-2015.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXIV
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Recent advances in very high resolution (VHR) earth observation (EO) techniques have led to a massive increase in data volumes to be processed. These remote sensing (RS) processing steps are complex and heterogeneous and an optimized use of these algorithms in both High Processing Computer (HPC) and Cloud platforms are still an important and opened study field for RS data providers with actual and future EO missions. The goal of our study is to identify and develop a new architecture to deal with large and increasing quantity of data and versatile production profiles. In this study, we took the example of the actual and complete processing pipeline used in Pleiades production to deliver perfect sensor image. This pipeline is composed of heterogeneous radiometric and geometric processing steps. In the first part, we study five main big data framework solutions. As result of this study, we identify Apache Spark as the best framework to use due to its performance, great development maturity, and data resilience certification. In the second part, and to develop the new processing pipeline, we redesign the processing pipeline with separation of the metadata management and the core processing. These good practices help us to develop and reuse legacy algorithms to an operational processing pipeline compatible with big data paradigm. As result of this development, we successfully identify a generic way to develop new processes and reuse legacy algorithms with large data paradigm and by keeping great performance and, more importantly, gaining platform flexibility.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing is considered as an increasingly important technology for detect underground structures. It can be applied to a wide range of applications as shown from various researchers. However, there is a great need to integrate information from a variety of sources, sent at different times and of different qualities using remote sensing tools. This paper presents the results obtained from field spectroradiometric campaigns at 'buried' underground structures in Cyprus. A SVC-HR1024 field spectroradiometer was used and in-band reflectances were determined for medium and high resolution satellite sensors, including Landsat. A number of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were utilized for the development of a vegetation index-based procedure aiming at the detection of underground military structures by using existing vegetation indices or other in-band algorithms. In this study, test areas were identified, analyzed and modeled under different scenarios, including: (a) the 'natural state' of the underground structure; (b) the different type of crop over the underground structure and imported soil; (c) the different types of non-natural material over the underground structure. A reference target in the nearby area was selected as a baseline.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing is considered as an increasingly important technology for military intelligence. It can be applied to a wide range of military applications, as shown from various researchers. However, there is a great need to integrate information from a variety of sources, rendered available at different times and of different qualities using remote sensing tools. This paper provides a solid methodology to support Sentinel remote sensing detection of deep man made infrastructures in Cyprus using field spectroscopy. A number of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR), Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) and Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), combined with other in-band algorithms were utilized for the development of a vegetation index-based procedure aiming at the detection of underground military structures. The measurements were taken at the following test areas: (a) vegetation area covered with the vegetation (barley), in the presence of an underground military structure (b) vegetation area covered with the vegetation (barley), in the absence of an underground military structure. The test areas were identified, analyzed and modelled under different scenarios. Sentinel-2A is a promising tool for detecting underground structures.

AB  - In modern landscapes, small habitat patches such as woodlands isolated in an agricultural matrix, can be important refuges for wildlife. However, their value as habitat may be compromised by their size and thus knowledge of how habitat structure influences habitat quality is vital to maximize species diversity.This study examined the factors driving avian diversity in four small woods in an agricultural landscape, and how accurately remote sensing (RS) metrics were able to quantify this. Linear mixed-effect models were used to combine annual breeding bird census data with data of habitat structure from satellite images and airborne lidar. The aims were firstly to examine the drivers of bird diversity, and secondly to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the compared RS datasets in quantifying them.The results showed that, at first, bird diversity increased significantly towards the edges, being driven in part by vegetation structure. The amount of understorey vegetation was the most significant driver of diversity, due to which lidar-based models outperformed satellite-based ones. In general, lidar metrics correlated strongly with bird diversity, but such relationships were not discovered with satellite image metrics. The results indicate that the drivers of diversity, especially in fragmented woodlands may be too fine-scaled to be studied without sufficient consideration of the structural component of vegetation, which was proven to be attainable from lidar data.

AB  - The relevance of the work is caused by the need to track the changes in natural environment to anthropogenic impacts, especially in residential areas, and ensure proper valuation of land.The main aim of the study is substantiation of conceptual and technological foundations for creation of monitoring system of the land and the dynamics of the anthropogenic impact on the territory for mapping and cadastral valuation.The methods: interpretation of remote sensing data; route field observations on the reference test sites; method of landscape analysis; method of systemic mapping; analysis of thematic maps of different scale; cartometrics research based on geoinformation technologies.The results. The paper introduces the results of studying the nature of the changes of anthropogenic load on the landscapes of Sakhalin on the basis of cartometric analysis of forest-covered areas, logging, and residential areas by maps in scale 7:700000, published in the mid 1980-s and by space images transmitted from scanner Landsat-7, Landsat-8 with a resolution of 15-30 m. The authors identified the trends to change in the area of different types of landscapes and settlements in the island territory. Landscapes of the south of Sakhalin was subjected to change during the development of forest management, mining, water management. Valuable industrial forests in accessible areas are essentially heavily modified. However, forest management is possible under condition of ensuring environmental safety and reproduction of renewable forest resources in the region. Residential load in the South-Eastern part of Sakhalin is relatively low. The increase in the area of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is not due to multi-storey construction, but due to individual housing construction. The capabilities of ArcGIS allow assessing the growth of the urban area on individual areas of the city.Summary. The authors revealed that for the time between the topographic and space shooting, the residential load on plain type landscapes has increased almost throughout, and especially near residential zones of southern Sakhalin. Environment monitoring allows discovering quickly the effects on the ecosystem and carrying out the actions to reduce negative consequences.

T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - Catch rates and biological information for Atlantic Cod from the Sentinel Survey Program in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Subdivision 3Ps are updated for 2016, and preliminary results presented for 2017. Temporal trends in gillnet (small 3 1/4 inch mesh, large 5 1/2 inch mesh) and linetrawl unstandardized catch rates were similar for all gears, with the highest values at the beginning of each time-series, sharp declines after 1997, and oscillations around or below the series' mean catch rate thereafter. Mean catch rate for small mesh gillnets was consistently higher than that of large mesh gillnets for the entire time-series: peaking at 142 fish per net in 1996, and then averaging 11-36 fish/net; except for its lowest value of 6 fish/net in 2011. Large mesh gillnets yielded the lowest mean catch rate of all gears: declining from 49 fish/net in 1997 to less than 9 fish/net since 2000. Mean catch rate for linetrawls peaked at 223 fish per 1,000 hooks in 1996, and fluctuated around 100 fish/1,000 hooks until 2010 (except in 2006); prior to reaching its lowest value of 62 fish/1,000 hooks in 2014-2015. Sentinel catch rates for large mesh gillnet and linetrawl " control" locations were standardized using Generalized Linear Models. Age-disaggregated standardized catch rates for recent year-classes were generally weaker than those in the past; although proportions-at-age of large mesh gillnet catch rates suggested that the 2008 year-class was relatively stronger. Age-aggregated catch rates were higher at the beginning of each time-series for both gears, declined over the mid-tolate 1990s, then remained at their lowest levels; decreasing below the series' mean of 6.4 fish/net (large mesh gillnets) in 1999, and 86 fish/1,000 hooks in 2009 (linetrawls). Gillnet and linetrawl catch rates for 2016 were 1.5 fish/net and 57.5 fish/1,000 hooks, respectively. Length frequencies of Atlantic Cod measured in Sentinel Surveys indicated that the small mesh gillnet was the least selective gear (retaining small and large fish from multiple year-classes), whereas large mesh gillnets and linetrawls captured larger fish in specific size ranges and few overlapping year-classes. Fish lengths from small mesh gillnets showed several modes between 35 cm and 62 cm throughout the time-series, while those of fish from large mesh gillnets and linetrawls ranged between 62-68 cm and 54-62 cm, respectively. Indices describing the physiological condition of Atlantic Cod varied at both seasonal and annual scales: the liver (hepatosomatic index) and gutted body condition (Fulton's K condition factor) declined over winter and early spring (while the gonadosomatic index increased), then improved over summer after spawning. These trends varied annually over the time-series, but generally declined in 2004-16. Both length and weight-at-age (6+ years) have decreased since the early part of each time-series.

TI  - Estimation of activity the methane seepage from the Black Sea floor using MODIS images and geosciences data
T2  - DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY BULLETIN SERIES-GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The publication presents the results of a certain stage of the study: the features of methane gas seepage characteristics in the transition zone of shelf-continental slope in the region of the Dnieper Paleodelts in the northwestern part of the Black Sea are identified, taking into account the data set: information of satellite images and of geological-geophysical (acoustic) data. About 2000 of the MODIS satellite images (product MOD021KM) are acquired in stages over one year period. The image processing was carried out in the GIS environment. It was established that the volume of methane gas seepage on the investigated site is fixed on satellite images and is most pronounced during increased seismotectonic activity (activation of earthquakes in the Black Sea region) - this is due to the tectonic structure of the study area, which is in the regional plan on the edge of the Eastern European platform, and in the local area, is the Dnepr paleo-delta in the zone of decomposition, which is an additional factor for gas outlets here. On satellite images small clouds are observed in cloudy weather or absence of clouds on the background of continuous clouds. This is due to the physical properties of methane, which is (according to geochemical studies) about 99% of the released gas. Methane rising from the bottom of the sea to the surface, and then to the troposphere is much colder than the surface water and warmer than the atmosphere layer, which provokes the formation of condensate over the site with methane gas seepage, and when the weather conditions change, forming a rainy cloud with a sharp drop in temperature, the volume of methane gas of seepage up are much warmer than clouds, forming a cloudy area on a background of continuous clouds. This phenomenon is recorded in various spectral (thermal and infrared) bands in satellite images (NASA - MODIS, NOAA, etc.), methane rising to the lower layers of the atmosphere intensively absorbs thermal radiation of the Earth in the infrared spectral region at a wavelength of 7.66 mu m. It enables to determine the methane gas seepage in satellite images for future studies of gas outlets from the bottom of the sea, taking into account the geological information and additional hydrological and weather data. The conducted monitoring of the satellite images showed that during the period of increased seismic activity in this region (in particular under the influence of the zone Vranch), it directly affects the tectonic situation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea and increases the emissions of methane gases from the bottom of the sea, which are then recorded on the MODIS sensor.

AB  - Forests are dynamic, complex and multidimensional ecosystems and play an irreplaceable role in social, economic, environmental, ecological and cultural context. Eucalyptus is the most common exotic species in Portugal forests. This species is fundamental in the industries related to the pulp paper production and the concern about their effects in ecosystems is growing. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) combined with Remote Sensing (RS) data can help to understand this complex ecosystem. Moreover, GIS and RS are commonly used in forest management. GIS allows the manipulation, analysis, and generation of considerable amounts of environmental information. This information can be used in the evaluation of ecosystems' conditions and for decision making. The study case of this project was the municipal lands included in "Serras do Porto" and Valongo's Nature 2000 network (Porto district, Portugal). The study zone considered in this work is a landscape of extreme relevance to Porto Metropolitan Area. For decades this area was extensively explored with eucalyptus plantations in order to produce cellulose for paper industry. Due to the characteristics of the area and its extension (40 hectares) the use of GIS became the most accurate and reliable alternative to characterize it. The combination of GIS tools and RS data allows the characterization of terrain relief, namely the analysis of altimetry, hypsometry, hydrography, the creation of environmental indexes such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). RS technology offer the potential to explore the effects of land-use changes and disturbances on forest dynamics at large spatial scales. A Sentinel-2A image was used to produce NDVI, EVI, and NDWI environmental indexes and to generate the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map, through Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin from QGIS software using Minimum Distance algorithm. The LULC was classified with two classes because the study area only presents two types of species: eucalyptus and bare soil. The LULC map obtained was validated through field points collected in the study area with a GPS receptor. An overall accuracy of 92.98% and a kappa statistic of 0.842 was obtained. Also, some of the geographic information obtained in the field was then integrated in QGIS software. Moreover, a phenological study was performed using NDVI values obtained from Sentinel-2A images, to understand the eucalyptus behavior in a certain period of time.. Because of that RS data provided useful information about the landscape dynamics allowing the assess to forest cover change and land use helping to create decision making plans and forest conservation measures.

TI  - Multiscale adaptive reconstruction of missing information for remotely sensed data using sparse representation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the influence of sensor malfunction and poor atmospheric condition, missing information is inevitable in optical remotely sensed (RS) data, which limits the availability of RS data. To tackle the inverse problem of missing information recovery, a multiscale adaptive patch reconstruction method was proposed in this letter. Multiscale dictionaries were learned from different sizes of exemplars in the known image region, which were later utilized to infer missing information patch-by-patch via sparse representation. Structure sparsity was incorporated to encourage the filling-in of missing patch on image structures and determine the patch size for further inpainting. Neighboring information was employed to restrain the appearance of the estimated patch, to yield semantically consistent inpainting result. In view of these ideas, we formulate the optimization model of adaptive patch inpainting and reconstruct missing information through a multiscale scheme. Experiments are performed on cloud removal, gaps filling and quantitative product reconstruction, which demonstrate that our method can well preserve spatially continuous structures and consistent textures without artifacts.

AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization, the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which has raised increasing concern. The goal of this study was to make a detailed analysis of the genesis of the Jinan urban heat island, which may be used to reduce surface temperatures in the city of Jinan. Using the Landsat OLI/TIRS acquired on July 11, 2014 and September 2, 2016, the land surface temperatures (LST) for Jinan city of China were retrieved. The urban biophysical descriptors, including the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and impervious surface area (ISA) were retrieved, and the relationship between LST and urban biophysical properties was further studied. The results showed that LST in the built-up area of Jinan city were higher than in the adjacent suburbs, and the urban heat island effect was significant. Additionally, LST were negatively correlated to the indices MNDWI and SAVI but positively correlated to the index ISA. These results could provide useful guidelines for the city of Jinan city urban construction and urban planning

AB  - Deficiency in the spatiotemporal resolution of remote sensing images limits crop yield estimations at the farm and field scale. High spatiotemporal resolution fusion images blended from moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data may alleviate this problem. This paper selected California's San Joaquin Valley Sheely Farm as study area, using the (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) ESTARFM/(Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Model) FSDAF to fusion image, it can enhance the efficiency of the high spatial resolution remote sensing image for yield estimation. And this paper chose MOD09GA and Landsat images to fusion analysis respectively, then on the basis of the study of the original cotton estimation model, the estimation model of two cotton plots in the study area was established, and the evaluation of the accuracy was carried out. The results showed that: 1) compared with FSDAF model, the ESTARFM model and the fusion image result of ESTARFM and accuracy for the yield estimation was higher, indicating that the two reference Landsat images were superior than the single image for fusion; In addition, from the results of the study, the fusion effect of ESTARFM is better than that of FSDAF. The ESTARFM model referred to the crop growth in the early and middle stage of cotton growth. The fusion result was better than FSDAF model, and FSDAF only referred to the high precision of a reference point in the middle of crop growth. 2) the correlation coefficient between predicted NDVI by the fusion image and cotton yield of A block is higher than that of block B, and the shape of the plot and the type of crop around the block had influence on the fusion result. 3) the predicted NDVI mean value of the three-phase in the flower-blooming stage of cotton growth by fusion images was used for the cotton yield estimation model, and the results showed that it had a higher accuracy than the single stage. And the scatter diagram is more concentrated, which proves the time-series vegetation index played an important role on the crop yield estimation, so fusion images are more important; 4) the accuracy of fusion image estimation is slightly lower than that of Landsat TM image, but the accuracy is above 0.60, and the predicted NDVI of fusion images can also be used for the yield prediction model as the estimated production factor. This study predicts crop yields using fusion images at the field scale, which can be used as a reference for studying vegetation monitoring using remote sensing at the field scale.

TI  - Combined Use of GF-3 and Landsat-8 Satellite Data for Soil Moisture Retrieval over Agricultural Areas Using Artificial Neural Network
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is the basic condition required for crop growth and development. Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first C-band synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellite of China, offering broad land and ocean imaging applications, including soil moisture monitoring. 'Ibis study developed an approach to estimate soil moisture in agricultural areas from GF-3 data. An inversion technique based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is introduced. The neural network was trained and tested on a training sample dataset generated from the Advanced Integral Equation Model. Incidence angle and HH or VV polarization data were used as input variables of the ANN, with soil moisture content (SMC) and surface roughness as the output variables. The backscattering contribution from the vegetation was eliminated using the water cloud model (WCM). The acquired soil backscattering coefficients of G F-3 and in situ measurement data were used to validate the SMC estimation algorithm, which achieved satisfactory results (R-2=0.736; RMSE = 0.042). These results highlight the contribution of the combined use of the GF-3 synthetic-aperture radar and Landsat-8 images based on an ANN method for improving SMC estimates and supporting hydrological studies.

TI  - Characterizing spatial and temporal trends of surface urban heat island effect in an urban main built-up area: A 12-year case study in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately characterizing spatiotemporal changes in surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) is a prerequisite for sustainable urban development. Although urban administrative boundaries have typically been used for SUHI modeling, they are inaccurate, because urban main built-up areas (UMBAs) are not well characterized. In this study, we developed an UMBA extraction method based on impervious surface distribution density (ISDD), to better differentiate suburban boundaries and ensure the integrity of land cover types. Additionally, we propose a new intensity classification method to analyze SUHI spatial distribution and variation. The UMBA was extracted using LANDSAT-8 data, and the temporal dynamics of SUHI intensity (i.e., daily, monthly, seasonal, and yearly changes) were extracted from MODIS data. A case study for Beijing showed that the mean daytime and nocturnal SUHI intensities vary at multiple time scales. In the daytime, SUHI intensities in Beijing UMBA were mainly level-2 and level-3, with central-south Beijing, a high incidence area, at level-3 in spring and summer. At night, with the rise of SUHI intensity levels, the frequency of SUHI intensity levels increased from the periphery to the center within the same season. ISDD had a marked influence on the frequency of SUHI intensity levels during the daytime, and the frequencies of level-1 to level-4 intensities increased with ISDD. This influence tended to weaken when ISDD exceeded 50%.

TI  - Multilingualism and Out-Group Acceptance: The Mediating Roles of Cognitive Flexibility and Deprovincialization
T2  - JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, we systematically study multilingualism as a predictor of acceptance of ethnic out-groups. It is argued that people who speak more languages are more cognitively flexible, that is, they have an enhanced flexibility in understanding and representing information. Higher cognitive flexibility is in turn expected to be related to higher deprovincialization: a reevaluation of one's ethnocentric worldview. Deprovincialization is then expected to result in more openness toward ethnic out-groups, evidenced by a more inclusive notion of the national identity and reduced out-group dislike. Cross-sectional survey data among a representative sample of native Dutch participants from the Netherlands (N = 792) provide convincing support for these hypotheses and show that multilingualism is an important yet understudied factor in social-psychological research on prejudice reduction.

AB  - This work describes the basic guidelines in order to study landslides using remote sensing. There are presented three test cases in different scenarios: The first one in South Tyrol (Northern Italy), the second one in El Hierro Island (Canary Islands, Spain), and the last one in Sierras Chicas (Cordoba, Argentina).Implemented techniques were: a) Photointerpretation, b) Interferometry between pairs to generate displacement maps and c) Multitemporal interferometry (Persistent Scatterer PS) to analyze displacements in temporal series of SAR images.Results include a) inventory vector layers to be obtained from a photo-interpretation, i.e. process recognition and type of rock; b) requirements on both, data to be used in an interferometric analysis and on the characteristics of the area of interest which could affect the resulting displacement.From each studied case, learnt lesson were used to generate the guidelines to extract information to study a generic landslide case using remote sensing.The above generic approach was used to generate several guidelines to be used in a landslide operative monitoring service.

CP  - International Conference on Space Optics (ICSO)
CL  - Chania, GREECE
AB  - Jena-Optronik GmbH is developing the Sentinel-5 NIR spectrometer optics operating in the spectral range from 685 nm to 773 nm. It is purely based on refractive optics and makes use of a grating as dispersive element and a prism for aberration correction. One of the design drivers for the optics design is straylight as small absorption effects in the atmosphere need to be detected. To minimize false light on the detector the straylight characteristics have been analyzed and optimized together with Hembach Photonik GmbH. Special attention needs to be paid to the dispersive nature of the optics as compared to a pure imaging system. Sources of ghosts and scattered light such as surface roughness, particle contamination and scattering at mechanical surfaces are quantified. Main contributors to straylight are identified and strategies for straylight reduction are discussed. Among others this comprises effective means to suppress out-of-band light.

TI  - Uncertainty in establishing forest reference levels and predicting future forest-based carbon stocks for REDD
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest reference levels (FRLs) provide a benchmark for assessing reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), and they are central to demonstrate additionality of REDD+. Attaining realistic FRLs, however, is challenging, especially in complex mosaic landscapes. We established FRLs in northern Laos for different reference periods and tested them against actual carbon stock changes. Annual time series of Landsat satellite images were used to capture the subtle changes in carbon stocks in complex landscapes characterized by shifting cultivation. We found that FRLs differ considerably depending on the reference period chosen. Abrupt land-use changes occurred when hybrid maize replaced traditional shifting cultivation and forests, and this invalidated carbon stock trends that would have been predicted had the FRL been projected into the future. We conclude that demonstrating additionality of REDD+ in fast developing areas is difficult and that payment systems rewarding potential emission reductions against hypothetical extrapolation of FRLs are unlikely to be a cost-effective strategy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Human influenza is predominantly caused by influenza A virus (IAV) - A/H1N1 and/or A/H3N2 - and influenza B virus (IBV) - B/Victoria and/or B/Yamagata, which co-circulate each season. Influenza surveillance provides important information on seasonal disease burden and circulation, and vaccine content for the following season. To study the circulating influenza subtypes/lineages in western Turkey. Community-based sentinel surveillance results during 2003-2016 (weeks 40-20 each season; but week 21, 2009 through week 20, 2010 during the pandemic) were analyzed. Nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with influenza-like illness were tested for influenza virus and characterized as A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or IBV. A subset of IBV samples was further characterized as B/Victoria or B/Yamagata. Among 14,429 specimens (9,766 collected during interpandemic influenza seasons; 4,663 during the 2009-2010 pandemic), 3,927 (27.2%) were positive. Excluding the pandemic year (2009-2010), 645 (27.4%) samples were characterized as A/H1N1 or A/H1N1/pdm09, 958 (40.7%) as A/H3N2, and 752 (31.9%) as IBV, but the dominant subtype/lineage varied widely each season. During the pandemic year (2009-2010), 98.3% of cases were A/H1N1/pdm09. IBV accounted for 0-60.2% of positive samples each season. The IBV lineages in circulation matched the vaccine IBV lineage >50% in six seasons and <50% in four seasons; with an overall mismatch of 49.7%. IBV cases tended to peak later than IAV cases within seasons. These results have important implications for vaccine composition and optimal vaccination timing. Quadrivalent vaccines containing both IBV lineages can reduce B-lineage mismatch, thus reducing the burden of IBV disease.

AB  - The work presents the results of the sociological survey conducted in the 2015/2016 academic year at Siberian State Medical University resulted in obtaining students' opinions on the basic moral and ethical problems of medical practice. The task of the research was to identify the dynamics of transformations of worldview and a set of values of students and related changes in their attitudes to primary issues of bioethics over the past 10 years (using the results of the previous research conducted in 2005). The solution of the first task resulted in emergence of the second task - the transformations revealed required a philosophical analysis and identification of its causes.Semiotic diagnostics of models of healing, based on the ethical square of Ruben Apresyan (2008), allowed one to categorize them in accordance with ethical stands and models of behavior. It was concluded that medical students must master all the models of doctor-patient relationship, and thus adopt all the goals (as well as corresponding ethical components, in other words, paradigms of values) on which these models are based. To exclude the appearance of deviations in the future professional activity, moral education of a modern medical student must begin as early as possible. Mastering the ethical component of doctor's profession must go through a difficult route in all directions of the value paradigms, indicated in the ethical square.

TI  - Jean Paul Sartre: One is Not Born a Philosopher, but Becomes One
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the continuation of Jean Paul Sartre's worldview analysis started in the previous magazine issue (see Logos 94). It scrutinizes Sartre's worldview structure and paradigm; reveals how the universal ontological questionnaire contributes to the "discovery" of existentialism and how the philosopher develops his theory formulating paradigms par excellence. For Sartre existentialism is a form of humanism and a part of practical philosophy as the ultima ratio of human being desperately striving for survival in antagonistic society. By admitting the choice possibility Sartre does not atomizes the value of humanism. On the contrary, he treat existentialism as the material manifestation of humanism. The article shows paradigmatic essence of Sartre's work Critique de la raison dialectique. It maintains that in the frameworks of Sartre's worldview a human being may remain human only within society which functions not on egoistic principles alone; for only in such society he can express his choice in the most meaningful way and give meaning to his personal existence. Sartre's social theory is based on the principles that do not promote alienation phenomenon of a never-ending desperate competitive struggle (and for what?) for the satisfaction of everlasting ego.

AB  - Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) is a powerful remote sensing technique employed to monitor surface displacements, such as ground subsidence or strong deformations caused by geological activity. The quality of the interferometric phase between two combined SAR images is essential for the estimation of the surface deformation. Multiple decorrelation factors may degrade the quality of the measurements and, then, the development of filtering methods for noise suppression is mandatory. In this work, we propose a new strategy to improve noise reduction while preserving the original phase structure. The new method consists in an iterative filter in which noise reduction is achieved progressively. The original phase is filtered with adaptive kernels based on Chebyshev interpolation functions. The filter is especially useful for DInSAR geophysical applications, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions monitoring. The performance of the proposed method has been tested with both simulated data and recently acquired Sentinel-1 SAR data which mapped the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake.

TI  - Automated regolith landform mapping using airborne geophysics and. remote sensing data, Burkina Faso, West Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We have studied the regolith landform distribution in the area of Gaoua, western Burkina Faso, using an integration of geophysical and remote sensing data. Concentration maps of K, Th, U, as well as their ratios, were computed from airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data to assess the geochemical composition of the regolith. The mineralogy of the surfaces was mapped via the analysis of multispectral ASTER and Landsat scenes. Pauli-decomposition data retrieved from polarimetric ALOS PALSAR and Radarsat-2 images were included to characterize the surface properties of the regolith material. Morphometric variables such as slope, curvature, and relative relief were derived from the SRTM digital elevation model to quantify the topographic parameters of the different regolith landforms. An artificial neural network implementation, ADVANGEO, was then employed to extract four basic regolith landform units from the satellite and airborne data. Relic ferruginous duricrusts rich in hematite and goethite belonging to the High glacis, erosional surfaces represented by rock outcrops and sub outcrops, alluvial sediments, and soft pediment materials of the Middle and Low glacis were mapped successfully in the region. The results were compared with the existing geomorphological maps, an independent visual classification, and field observations. We found that the distribution and shape of the iron-rich duricrusts are more accurate than portrayed in the current maps. The best results, with an overall accuracy of 94.21% and a kappa value of 0.92, were obtained for a dataset consisting of gamma-ray spectrometry data combined with derivatives of the SRTM digital elevation model augmented by Landsat, and polarimetric radar data. The approach demonstrates for the first time the potential of machine learning in regolith landform mapping. The proposed combined analysis of airborne geophysics and remote sensing data can be adopted easily in other regions with similar long-term lateritic weathering histories worldwide.

AB  - Significant changes in mangrove ecosystems have occurred across large areas of Australia over the last decade, with these including extensive mangrove dieback (along much of the northern coastline) and cyclone damage. Such changes need to be detected and quantified when they occur, and the recovery from such events monitored over extended periods to ascertain effectiveness of adaptive management strategies. This paper presents the conceptual basis for development and implementation of a monitoring system, with key elements being routine detection of mangrove change (e.g., extent, health, species) using dense time-series of optical satellite data available within the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC), the collation of all publicly available field, drone and aircraft observations through Australia's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN), and the acquisition of new datasets under common protocols. Datasets and products need to be open access to inform policy and enable coordinated scientific research.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the face of differences between the ethical religio-philosophies believed across the globe, how should a media ethicist theorize or make recommendations in the light of theory? One approach is relativist, taking each distinct moral worldview to be true only for its own people. A second approach is universalist, seeking to discover a handful of basic ethical principles that are already shared by all the world's peoples. After providing reasons to doubt both of these approaches to doing media ethics, consideration is given to a third. This under-explored approach offers moral claims that would be reasonable for nearly all long-standing cultures to accept even though they currently do not, with the aim of creating new common ground among them. The chapter advances some rights and responsibilities, particularly as they concern the media's role in respect of self-government and self-expression, on which many of those with African, Confucian, Islamic, and Western foundational commitments could sensibly converge.

AB  - Since the Apollo program or earlier it has been widely believed that the lunar regolith was compacted through vibrations including nearby impact events, thermal stress release in the regolith, deep moon quakes, and shallow moon quakes. Experiments have shown that vibrations both compact and re-loosen regolith as a function of depth in the lunar soil column and amplitude of the vibrational acceleration. Experiments have also identified another process that is extremely effective at compacting regolith: the expansion and contraction of individual regolith grains due to thermal cycling in the upper part of the regolith where the diurnal thermal wave exists. Remote sensing data sets from the Moon suggest that the soil is less compacted in regions where there is less thermal cycling, including infrared emissions measured by the Diviner radiometer on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Here, we performed additional experiments in thermal cycling simulated lunar regolith and confirm that it is an effective compaction mechanism and may explain the remote sensing data. This creates a consistent picture that the soil really is looser in the upper layers in polar regions, which may be a challenge for rovers that must drive in the looser soil.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Mine wastes of the abandoned Pb-Zn mining district of Jebel Hallouf-Bouaouane in the north of Tunisia are continually exposed to erosion and thus threaten soils, vegetation and above all human health. Detecting changes of mine wastes in a quick and timely fashion is the first step towards mitigating their impact and surveying the environment. Thus, this study shows the role and importance of earth observation technology and a type of spatial science processing in mine waste change detection and assessment. Both pre- and post-classification methods based on multitemporal and multisensory Landsat ETM+ and OLI 8 data are performed and compared to evaluate the efficiency of the methods. Field measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of field samples and polished section observations were used to evaluate waste changes identified remotely. The comparison of results shows that the pixel-based iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) pre-classification method offers the best change detection for mine wastes.

TI  - Complexities of intercultural writing process of budding multilingual writers
T2  - SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores challenges faced by twenty-six budding multilingual creative writers. Grounded in a contrastive rhetoric writing perspective, the paper determines the extent to which language is a barrier to creative writers who write in English as a second language. Data was collected from the participants' reflections through an online questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, in which the participants were asked to indicate whether they could express their ideas clearly when writing in English. The study finds that English did not inhibit the writers from expressing thoughts, but 57.1% of the participants feel they would have expressed themselves more freely if they had not been confined to using English only in their writing. It is, therefore, recommended that complementary phenomena ought to occur in multilingual societies in which value will be placed not only on one's ability to operate between languages, but also, and most importantly, on nourishing creativity in a way that would allow one to construct and share knowledge, skills and experiences as well as critically reflect on one's worldview through the eyes of various linguistic repertoires and cultures.

And while it tries to examine a good case study of interactive communication between a teacher and children on the one hand, it also strives to discern the conflict and difficulty that teachers can face. For this, the author made a qualitative research from a group interview with teachers, meeting records, individual interviews, classroom supervision, cooperative class records, class videos with the admission of teachers, and the daily class schedule. The result of this research demonstrates that ‘Emptying and Filling’ is not just the theme oriented toward the life under Christian worldview but also toward educational goal and purpose of the Nuri Curriculum. Additionally, It has turned out to be a theme that not only helps executing activity planned by a teacher but aslo helps encouraging self-led play by children and not to mention, easy to be combined with previously presented other daily life themes. Particularly, in exploring daily life themes, children is to ultimately understand the essential value of life as well as realize the relationship between themselves and the surrounding world. It is expected that the result of this research can be provided as the basis to improve the Christian Early childhood education curriculum in Early childhood educational institutions.

AB  - Drought is a low-onset natural disaster, an insidious and creeping phenomenon that occurs in all climatic regimes virtually. Drought has the characteristic of high frequency, long duration and vast area. Prolonged multiyear drought has caused significant damages both in natural environment, and in the development of the human society. How to forecast the onset, duration and end of droughts effectively has become the research focus. As the remote sensing technology comes out, the real time monitoring droughts over the large areas can be achieved. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from the remotely sensed data are always used to monitor the agricultural droughts in the relation to the plant growth. Using remotely sensed land surface temperature and vegetation index feature space combined with models to estimate surface soil moisture is increasingly important as this method is simple and independent on ground observations Wang developed the Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) based on the information of the LST versus the NDVI scatter plot falling into a triangular shape. It is testified that the VTCI can be used to monitor the drought of an area in real time. It is found that the VTCI index can better reflect the severity of drought when it is used in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi. The Guanzhong Plain in the Shaanxi province is selected as a study area. The drought disaster is one of the natural disasters in this area. Using ten years NOAA/AVHRR data from 2000 to 2009 to retrieve Vegetation Temperature Condition Index time series data, and cubic spine is applied to interpolate the missing data of VTCI, and equal time intervals VTCI time series is got. Based on the VTCI time series, the wavelet neural network model was used to analyze VTCI time series pixel by pixel, and got the 2009 early March to late May drought forecasting results. The results show that, wavelet neural network forecasting results is not very good, as the texture is not clear, the accuracy is poor, and the wavelet neural network is not suitable for VTCI forecasting.

AB  - Coupled with Landsat-8 and SMAP brightness temperature datasets and using the HP model, an algorithm to estimate soil moisture in November of 2015 at Zoige alpine wetland, China was developed. The algorithm was verified using soil moisture data downloaded at NASA Earthdata web site. The spatial patterns of two datasets were similarly to each other with the maximum value occurring near the center but the minimum value in the eastern region. The spatial correlation coefficient of both datasets was 0.6832. The preliminary findings should be very encouraging in the pursuing to produce soil moisture data with high spatial resolution.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of urban settlements is significant to a series of research topics related to environmental and biological changes caused by the urbanization process. Among various technologies, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been successfully applied in urban settlement mapping in the past two decades. Although much effort with varying degrees of success has been made in previous studies, the research work is still ongoing, and three challenges should be highlighted. First, the effect of de-speckling is usually underestimated, to the extent that the improvement of the SAR image quality is totally ignored in some studies. Second, a method that combines full Interferometric SAR (InSAR) information is as yet missing. Third, training samples are generally required to process SAR images to extract urban settlements, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, or even impractical when classifying satellite data at the regional/global scale. To address these issues, this paper presents an automatic method for urban settlement mapping trained by multi-temporal InSAR using social media. To improve the detection performance and reduce false alarm ratio, intensity and coherence are first accurately estimated without loss of image resolution by homogeneous pixel selection and robust estimators. The homogeneous pixels will be also applied to measure urban characteristics from the geometrical prospective. After that, training samples are automatically generated from social media based on the fact that cities and urban areas are nowadays full of individual geo-referenced data such as social network data Finally, these multiple information sources will be fused to extract urban areas based on an improved one class classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in extracting urban areas with good accuracy. This study provides a new de-speckling means to process multi-temporal InSAR and sheds new light on the applications of social media in the field of remote sensing.

AB  - Purpose: Determine the prognostic and predictive significance of tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific serum antibodies in melanoma patients of a large adjuvant vaccination phase III trial.Patients and methods: Serum IgG antibodies were measured against a panel of 43 antigens by a bead-based multiplex assay in 970 stage II melanoma patients of the EORTC18961 trial, evaluating adjuvant ganglioside GM2-KLH/QS-21 vaccination versus observation. Primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS). Patients' sera at baseline, after 12 and 48 weeks of study treatment and at the last available time point (at recurrence/remission) were evaluated.Results: Prognostic clinical variables are gender, surgical confirmation of lymph node-negative status, Breslow thickness and ulceration of the primary. Prognostic spontaneous antibody responses were associated with a significant dismal (GM2, Rhod_E2, SSX2) or good prognosis (CyclinB1, SCYE1v1) for RFS, distant metastasis-free (DMFS) or overall survival (OS). Predictive spontaneous antibody responses based on significant interaction with treatment were RhodN p = 0.02, Rab38 p = 0.04 for RFS, RhodE2 p = 0.006, Recoverin p = 0.04 for DMFS and RhodE2 p = 0.003; Recoverin p = 0.04, NA17.A p = 0.04, for OS respectively. The subgroups of patients according to antibody responses for RFS were determined for RhodN sero-negative (n = 849, HR = 1.07, p = 0.6); RhodN sero-positive (n = 121,HR = 0.42, p = 0.01) and Rab38 sero-negative (n = 682, HR = 1.12, p = 0.42), Rab38 sero-positive (n = 288, HR = 0.65, p = 0.04) patients respectively.Conclusion: We identified prognostic serum antibody responses against TAA in stage II melanoma patients. A set of antibody responses correlated with a beneficial outcome for GM2 vaccination.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate ontological features of child characters as represented in the picture books of Tomi Ungerer. Ungerer endeavors to exhibit a worldview free of prejudice through the use of creative themes and characters of books. For the research purpose, “Allumette” and “Zloty” were chosen. These are two books that contain verbal and visual narratives produced by Ungerer. This study analyzed the appearance, behaviors, emotions, and characters of the two main characters, Allumette and Zloty. In addition, their relationship with others were analyzed. Finally, the outstanding characteristics of Allumette and Zloty were analyzed in comparison to their original characters: Little Match Girl of Hans Christian Andersen and Little Red Riding Hood of the fairy tale. The results are as follows. Both Allumette and Zloty presented multi-level traits displaying childlike characteristics expressing their need for protection and love by adults (e.g., parents), and also grown-up characteristics such as taking care of responsibilities for their own lives or for a sick grandmother. Next, both characters were shown in the development process of continuous ‘becoming’ of their being through their own reasoning and actions, and by listening to others without prejudice when encountering new events of life. These findings have implications to the field of early childhood education in terms of suggesting new image of children.

AB  - As the result of utilization of modern landscapes for various purpose in low mountainous and plain sloping foothills (39.7%) of Kur depression (4036644 hectares) some desertification factors and desertification holes occurred and the danger of degradation of landscapes has increased. In this regard, there is a great need to explore the current state of desertification in the area.The main objective of the research is to determine the current state of the desertification process, mapping and defining the landscape areas that are subject to desertification in Kur mountainous lowland.Route-sectoral, comparison, evaluation, statistical interpretation, satellite image decoding methods and ArcGis software were used during the research. Particularly semi-stratified research methods for the determination of desertification indicators, desertification types and desertification rates have played a special role.The following key findings were obtained during the research:Based on ArcGIS statistical analysis of databases of large scale electronic desalination maps that we have compiled, the areas of desertification of landscapes for the total area and separated physical-geographical regions have been identified and quantitative indicators have been compared.46.1% of the landscape complex of the study area was not affected by desertification in practice. Deserted complexes at various levels make up 53.9% of the total area.Geographical distribution of desertification territories in the area depends on the characteristics of natural and anthropogenic desertification factors and the structural-genetic characteristics of landscapes.Development of desertification in the region is largely caused by active natural exodynamic processes in semi-desert, dry-steppe, arid-sparse forests and bush.In the modern landscape of the study area, sometimes all categories of desertification are observed within a landscape unit.The scientific achievements of the research.For the first time, the area of deserted landscapes has been identified by indicators of desertification in terrain landscapes and factors that led to the formation and development of desertification habitats.It was determined that 11.5% of landscapes were slightly, 16.1% moderately and 26.3% severely deserted in the study area.NDVI Index based on LANDSAT-8 satellite images (2017) of the area is determined during separation of desertification holes and degradation rates in landscapes.Practical implications. The results obtained in the research can be used in landscape planning, preparation of meliorative action plans, efficient use of natural resources and implementation of a number of agricultural and environmental projects.

AB  - This study analyzes the changes in different types of underlying surface in the Don river basin based on the analysis of the Landsat archive of satellite imagery. Interest in this area is due to the fact that in recent years there has been a long low-water period. The authors made the assumption that in addition to climatic factors, the formation of a low-water period is affected by the change in economic activity in the region. Several key dates were chosen - middle 1980s (1985-1986), middle 1990s (1995), middle 2000s (2005), the last 3-4 years, corresponding to the low-water period (2015) - for which Landsat satellite images were analyzed, interpretation schemes based on automated and visual methods were compiled and the areas of different types of land use were analyzed.

The study region is Tolbachinsky Dol (Kamchatka), where a fissure eruption occurred in 2012-2013. This research is based on two-pass differential interferometry for processing a series of Radarsat-2 radar images acquired both from the ascending and descending orbits. During interferometric processing the coherence maps were calculated, which can be used as an additional data source for mapping of the properties of active lava flows. We also calculated the values of lava surface displacements, which highlighted the processes of thermal subsidence. As a result, we have defined a list of mapping parameters that can be extracted from interferometric materials, and have created maps of the dynamics of the lava fields topography.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Mangrove forests are found as isolated units of varying length and width along the coast line of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf ofOman. These forests are scattered within the intertidal and are among emergent plant communities occurring along land-sea margins in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman and a small part of Pakistan in Govatr Bay. Avicennia marina and Rhizophora spp. are found in this region. Recently, as the effect of industrialization and development, as well as global environmental changes, concern about status, health, damage, disturbance and reducing mangrove area are a big challenge both for ecologists and engineers in these regions. Hence, producing mangrove map distributions and monitoring their change during the time is necessary. Mangrove habitat maps have been used for three general management applications: resource inventory, change detection, and the selection and inventory of aquaculture sites. This chapter quantifies mangrove forest cover and monitors their changes in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman from 1977 to 2017, using Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. The mangrove distribution maps are created by using remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). An image processing technique entitled normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) was used to detect mangrove forests in six countries located within the border study area. Even though the results show negative effects of human activity in some regions, overall, mangrove forests increased during 1977-2017. This increase in mangrove forests in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman represent sustainable development and management for mangrove ecosystems in this region.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXIV
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion allows the spectral, spatial and temporal enhancement of images. New techniques for image fusion are constantly emerging shifting the focus from pan-sharpening to spatiotemporal fusion of data originating from different sensors and platforms. However, the application of image fusion in the field of Earth observation still remains limited. The number and complexity of the different techniques available today can be overwhelming thus preventing users from fully exploiting the potential of fusion. The aim of this study is to make fusion products more accessible to users by providing them with a simple tool for spatiotemporal fusion in Python. This tool will contribute to the better exploitation of data from available sensors making possible to bring the images to the spectral, spatial and temporal resolution required by the user. The fusion algorithm implemented in the tool is based on the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) a well established fusion technique in the field of remote sensing often used as benchmark by other algorithms. The capabilities of the tool are demonstrated by three case studies using Sentinel-2 and simulated Sentinel-3 data. The first case study is about deforestation in the Amazon forest. The other two case studies concentrate on detecting change in an agricultural site in Southern Germany and urban flooding caused by the hurricane Harvey.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing data have become available in meteorology, agriculture, forestry, geology, regional planning, hydrology or natural environment sciences since several decades ago, because satellites provide routinely high quality images with different temporal and spatial resolutions. Joining, combining or smoothing these images for a better quality of information is a challenge not always properly solved. In this regard, geostatistics, as the spatiotemporal stochastic techniques of georeferenced data, is a very helpful and powerful tool not enough explored in this area yet. Here, we analyze the current use of some of the geostatistical tools in satellite image analysis, and provide an introduction to this subject for potential researchers.

AB  - The free access to satellite images since more than 40 years ago has provoked a rapid increase of multitemporal derived information of remote sensing data that should be summarized and analyzed for future inferences. In particular, the study of trends and trend changes is of crucial interest in many studies of phenology, climatology, agriculture, hydrology, geology or many other environmental disciplines. Overall, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as a satellite derived variable, plays a crucial role because of its usefulness for vegetation and landscape characterization, land use and land cover mapping, environmental monitoring, climate change or crop prediction models. Since the eighties, it can be retrieved all over the world from different satellites. In this work we propose to analyze its temporal evolution, looking for breakpoints or change-points in trends of the surfaces occupied by four NDVI classifications made in Spain from 1981 to 2015. The results show a decrease of bare soils and semi-bare soils starting in the middle nineties or before, and a slight increase of middle-vegetation and high-vegetation soils starting in 1990 and 2000 respectively.

AB  - Soil loss and transport processes are key issues to understand erosive and sedimentary dynamics in semi-arid environments. The aim of this work was to characterize the erosive patterns of different types of events and to analyse their effect downstream in a mountainous semi-arid watershed. With that purpose, different events have been typified according to atmospheric and hydrological descriptors from information of 1) historical meteorological data, 2) results of simulations from physically-based and distributed hydrological modeling, which includes the snowmelt dynamics, and 3) available MODIS satellite images. For each event, water samples were taken by an automatic measuring device and analysed to determine the suspended sediment loads. The results allowed to identify three types of events. Among them, the maximum values of the measured suspended solids during rainfall-dominated events, with little snow influence, were an order of magnitude higher than the snowfall-dominated events, with values of 25000 mg/l versus 2500 mg/l respectively. The response of intermediate events, despite of low flow, showed a significant gradient. The results highlight the great dynamic variability of the sediment yield along the basin and the importance of the snow in the lamination of the erosive processes and their consequences on reservoir siltation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AMERICAN-EAST ASIAN RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the central role of Japan's rise to global economic prominence in the evolution of Donald J. Trump's worldview. It traces how the transformation of the relationship between the United States and Japan during the 1980s informed Trump's ideas about trade and protectionism, globalization, the international economy, and executive power. Trump, it argues, was a product of U.S.-Japanese relationship; while he began his public career as a prominent critic of Japan, claiming that the country exploited American trade and defense policy, his career in real estate heavily relied on Japanese finance. This contradictory approach continues to shape his understanding of Japan. As president, Trump repeatedly condemns Japan as predatory and protectionist, but also seeks expanded Japanese investment in the United States to revitalize the U.S. economy. Equally important, Trump has expanded criticisms originating with Japan to countries like China and Mexico, international agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the World Trade Organization. By tracing Trump's rhetorical, financial, and diplomatic encounters with Japan over the past thirty years, this article uncovers the sources of Trump's contradictory attitudes towards trade, globalization, and cross-border investment and his understandings of strong leadership and executive power.

TI  - Weathering the Storm: The Shelter of Faith for Black American Christian Families
T2  - MARRIAGE AND FAMILY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Religiosity is one of the most prominent characteristics of many strong African American families. While scholars have examined the role of religion in various macro-level contexts (e.g., churches, communities, organizations), we know less regarding how religion directly influences the worldview and relational processes of African American families. To address this paucity, we provide in-depth, qualitative responses from 26 African American Christian families (N = 55 individuals) regarding how prayer and faith influence their marriage and parenting processes. Qualitative analyses revealed that prayer and faith reportedly influenced strong African American marriages in three domains: (1) General Life Strengths, (2) Marital Strengths, and (3) Parenting Strengths. This study emphasizes the importance of using a strengths-based perspective to understand how religion sustains many strong Black families.

TI  - Radioactive seed localization compared with wire-guided localization of non-palpable breast carcinoma in breast conservation surgery- the first experience in the United Kingdom
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In the UK, guidewires have traditionally been used for localization of non-palpable breast lesions in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery (BCS). Radioactive seed localization (RSL) using Iodine-125 seeds is an alternative localization method and involves inserting a titanium capsule, containing radioactive Iodine-125, into the breast lesion. We aim to demonstrate feasibility of RSL compared with guidewire-localization (GWL) for BCS in the UK.Methods: Data were collected on 100 patients with non-palpable unifocal invasive carcinoma of the breast undergoing GWL WLE prior to the introduction of RSL and the first 100 patients treated with RSL WLE. Statistical comparisons were made using chi(2)-squared analysis or unpaired two-sample t-test. Significance was determined to be at p <= 0.05.Results: Mean total tumour size was 19.44 mm (range: 5-55) in the GWL group and 18.61 mm (range: 3.8-59) in the RSL group (p = 0.548), while mean total specimen excision weight was significantly lower in the RSL group; 31.55 g (range: 4.5-112) vs 37.42 g (range: 7.8-157.1) (p = 0.018). Although 15 patients had inadequate surgical resection margins in the GWL group compared the 13 in the RSL group (15 vs 13%, respectively, p = 0.684), 10 of the patients in the GWL group had invasive carcinoma present resulting in at least one positive margin compared with only 3 patients in the RSL group (10 vs 3%, respectively, p = 0.045).Conclusion: In this study, RSL is shown to be non-inferior to the use of GWL for non-palpable carcinoma in patients undergoing BCS and we suggest that it could be introduced successfully in other breast units.

AB  - Fronts, which are sharp boundaries between distinct water masses, play a substantial role in managing biodiversity of marine species and preserving a resilient ecosystem. The overarching aim of this study is to compare different methodologies for detecting marine fronts. Many marine fronts are identifiable by their strong temperature gradient. For that reason, this study tests how two different edge detection methodologies (Laplacian and Canny) performs on detecting marine once applied on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product of the Sentinel-3 SLSTR instrument. In a few words, the results of this study showed that the Laplacian edge detection overestimates fronts, while the Canny Edge detection algorithm underestimates them. It worth highlighting though that the results are significantly improved using the appropriate filtering and/or image enhancements. The results of the Canny Edge detection algorithm were improved when a histogram equalisation image enhancement was applied before the Canny Edge and the results of the Laplacian detector were improved with median filtering.

T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to develop a malaria risk map for Bahir Dar City, Amhara, which is situated south of Lake Tana on the Ethiopian plateau. Rainfall, temperature, altitude, slope and land use/land cover (LULC), as well as proximity measures to lake, river and health facilities, were investigated using remote sensing and geographical information systems. The LULC variable was derived from a 2012 SPOT satellite image by supervised classification. while 30-m spatial resolution measurements of altitude and slope came from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Metrological data were collected from the National Meteorological Agency, Bahir Dar branch. These separate datasets, represented as layers in the computer, were combined using weighted, multi-criteria evaluations. The outcome shows that rainfall, temperature, slope, elevation, distance from the lake and distance from the river influenced the malaria hazard the study area by 35%, 15%, 10%, 7%, 5% and 3%, respectively, resulting in a map showing five areas with different levels of malaria hazard: very high (11.2%); high (14.5%); moderate (63.3%); low (6%); and none (5%). The malaria risk map, based on this hazard map plus additional information on proximity to health facilities and current LULC conditions, shows that Bahir Dar City has areas with very high (15%); high (65%); moderate (8%); and low (5%) levels of malaria risk, with only 2% of the land completely risk-free. Such risk maps are essential for planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating disease control as well as for contemplating prevention and elimination of epidemiological hazards from endemic areas.

AB  - In the mandatory application of the CPTED, only negative parts of urban parks and vegetation were reflected. Therefore, this study tries to present the positive effects of urban parks and vegetation. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effects of urban parks and vegetation on crime occurrence and to suggest the planning implications of this to CPTED based on theory related to crime, environmental psychology, and crime occurrence analysis. This study used the crime occurrence data of Seoul, NDVI, population, distance from urban park, floating population, and the like. This study collected data from the Statistics Korea, the local government, and Landsat 8 satellite images provided by the USGS and created data of environmental variables and social variables by district using ArcGIS and statistical program. Literature analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and geographically weighted regression were used to determine the relationship between crime occurrence and environmental variables, and to discuss its implication. It was found that crime occurrence has a relationship with the total population (β = .663), the number of amusement facilities (β = .447) and the area of a police station jurisdiction (β= .395). This confirms that a crime rate is low when the floating population is large (β = .241) and vegetation vitality is high (NDVI, β = .281). Vegetation vitality (NDVI) is effective in lowering violence through psychological stabilization, strengthening territoriality and improving regional image. The implications for the allocation of urban park and vegetation, program and management plan of urban park and vegetation to reduce crime occurrence have therefore been presented.

AB  - Morphological attribute profiles (APs) are among the most effective methods to model the spatial and contextual information for the analysis of remote sensing images, especially for classification task. Since their first introduction to this field in early 2010's, many research studies have been contributed not only to exploit and adapt their use to different applications, but also to extend and improve their performance for better dealing with more complex data. In this paper, we revisit and discuss different developments and extensions from APs which have drawn significant attention from researchers in the past few years. These studies are analyzed and gathered based on the concept of multi-stage AP construction. In our experiments, a comparative study on classification results of two remote sensing data is provided in order to show their significant improvements compared to the originally proposed APs.

TI  - Hybrid atmospheric correction algorithms and evaluation on VNIR/SWIR Hyperion satellite data for soil organic carbon prediction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible near-infrared and shortwave infrared data acquired by space-borne sensors contain atmospheric noise, along with target reflectance that may affect its end applications, e.g. geological, vegetation, soil surface studies, etc. Several atmospheric correction algorithms have been already developed to remove unwanted atmospheric components of a spectral signature of Earth targets obtained from airborne/spaceborne hyperspectral image. In spite of this, choosing of an appropriate atmospheric correction algorithm is an ongoing research. In this study, two hybrid atmospheric correction (HAC) algorithms incorporating a modified empirical line (ELm) method were proposed. The first HAC model (named HAC_1) combines (i) a radiative transfer (RT) model based on the concepts of RT equations, which uses real-time in situ atmospheric and climatic data, and (ii) an ELm technique. The second one (named HAC_2) combines (i) the well-known ATmospheric CORrection (ATCOR) model and (ii) an ELm technique. Both HAC algorithms and their component single atmospheric correction algorithms (ATCOR, RT, and ELm) were applied to radiance data acquired by Hyperion satellite sensor over study sites in Australia. The performances of both HAC algorithms were analysed in two ways. First, the Hyperion reflectances obtained by five atmospheric correction algorithms were analysed and compared using spectral metrics. Second, the performance of each atmospheric correction algorithm was analysed for prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) using Hyperion reflectances obtained from atmospheric correction algorithms. The prediction model of SOC was built using partial least square regression model. The results show that (i) both the hybrid models produce a good spectrum with lower Spectral Angle Mapper and Spectral Information Divergence values and (ii) both hybrid algorithms provided better SOC prediction accuracy, in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2), residual prediction deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile (RPIQ), with R-2 >= 0.75, RPD >= 2, and RPIQ >= 2.58 than single algorithms. HAC algorithms, developed using ELm technique, may be recommended for atmospheric correction of Hyperion radiance data, when archived Hyperion reflectance data have to be used for SOC prediction mapping.

TI  - Frontal recession of Parkachik Glacier between 1971-2015, Zanskar Himalaya using remote sensing and field data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Parkachik Glacier is located in the Suru sub-basin of the Upper Indus River, Zanskar Himalaya. The Glacier has been analysed using Corona KH-4B (1971), Landsat-TM (1999), field survey (2015), Google Earth (TM) (2015) and ASTER GDEM (2015) for frontal recession and area changes. Overall, from 1971 to 2015, the Glacier has retreated by 127 +/- 0.09 m i.e. (0.75 +/- 0.07%) at a rate of 2.9 +/- 0.004 ma(-1) with a simultaneous decrease in area from 49.5 to 48.8 km(2) i.e. 740 +/- 0.7 m(2) (1.5 +/- 0.09%) at a rate of 74 +/- 0.7 m(2)a(-1). However, during recent decade (1999-2015), the rate of glacier recession of 3.9 +/- 0.004 ma(-1) with a corresponding area loss of 500 +/- 0.74m(2) (1 +/- 0.1%) was higher than the retreat rate of 2.3 +/- 0.001 ma(-1) and an area loss of 240 +/- 0.02m(2) (0.48 +/- 0.08%) during 1971-1999. In the field, the evidences of glacier recession are present in the form of separated dead ice blocks from the main Glacier, recessional dumps/moraines, active ice calving activity and a small proglacial pond/lake at the terminus/snout of the Glacier. However, the recession over the studied period has been very slow and is controlled by its topographic configuration, particularly the large altitudinal range (6030-3620 m), almost northerly aspect and steep slope (average similar to 30 degrees).

T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to analyze the main differences between the albedo estimates provided by versions V005 and V006 of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 1 km spatial resolution. The largest albedo differences are observed in the estimation of its diffuse component, or albedo White-Sky, which in turn exceeds values from the direct component, or albedo Black-Sky. However, the actual albedo or albedo Blue-Sky, comparable to ground measurements, shows differences between versions very similar to those from the Black-Sky albedo due to the limited presence of aerosols during the study days. A more detailed analysis by differentiating land uses, allows to appreciate the increased capacity of V006 respect V005 to detect rapid changes in albedo due to phenological changes or specific events, such as a rainfall.

TI  - Changes in vegetation cover of the Pantanal wetland detected by Vegetation Index: a strategy for conservation
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Pantanal wetland undergoes landscape alterations that can cause impacts on hydrological processes, changing the flood pulse. The objective of this work is to analyse the vegetation cover of the Pantanal in the period of 2000, 2008 and 2015, and to make a projection for 2030. Therefore, NDVI from the sensor MODIS was analysed and the transition matrix was calculated by the DINAMICA EGO. The methods adopted were open sources. The results were worrisome, indicating alterations of the vegetation cover of the Pantanal, with an increase of short vegetation (grasslands or pastures) in the evaluated period. The projection pointed out that in 2030 the Brazilian Pantanal wetland area will be covered by 78% of short vegetation and only 14% of dense (arboreal-shrubby) vegetation. The approach can be a useful tool for conservation of the Brazilian Pantanal wetland.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean land use and land cover (LULC) have a very dynamic structure as a result of continuous transformation process due to anthropogenic effects and environmental gradients. LULC dynamics are important indicator of environmental condition in temporal and spatial scales. The aim of this paper was to simulate the future LULC of a Mediterranean type watershed located at the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey by incorporating multi-layer perceptron (MLP), artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) approaches. Landsat TM/OLI images in 1990, 2003 and 2014 over the study area were classified using hybrid classification approach. The Kappa statistics of the hybrid classification that combines K-means, decision tree and object based classification method for these three images were 0.81, 0.85 and 0.87 respectively. The LULC map of 2014 was simulated using LULC maps of 1990 and 2003 for calibration and validation. The simulation results were compared with the actual 2014 LULC map to assess the accuracy of the simulation, and the rate of overlap was found as 89%. LULC map of 2025 was estimated using LULC maps of 2003 and 2014. These results indicated that, the area of bareground will reduce 13.31% whereas the rate of forest and agricultural area will increase 8.70% and 6.51% respectively.

AB  - The system of the Russian literary language was formed under the powerful influence of extra linguistic factors that had affected the evolution of the language and become relevant to the reality of the language functioning. This article discusses the realities of the middle of XVII century: on the one hand, the formation and development of Russian literary language of the national period, on the other - the unprecedented phenomenon, the Schism (Raskol) that divided the people into Old Believers and "New" Faith followers. Russian medieval society had certain cultural and religious values and customs. Russian Orthodox Church reform began with the editing of sacred texts; this event led to the transformation of national worldview and caused a change in the cultural and religious consciousness. Eventually, elimination of established medieval values led to the transformation of cultural and religious customs and traditions of the nation, having split the Russian world. The split was manifested in the implementation of the opposition of "Us" - "Them", having a significant impact on the formation of the national cultural pattern.

AB  - In this study, we focus the investigation of land subsidence in Azar oil field by small-baseline SAR interferometry analysis with Sentinel-1 satellite. Azar oil field is one of Iranian the oil fields. This oil field is located in the east of Mehran in Ilam. After extracting a large number of oil wells, heavy rainfall occurred and widespread and extensive cracks were formed in this oil field. These rainfalls caused these cracks to increase. For understanding the reasons for this occurrence, we must exactly monitor the amount of land subsidence and obtain the displacement vectors with the highest accuracy. We processed 36 descending SLC SAR images (complex radar images) between October 2014 and December 2017. The topographic phase contribution was removed using the 1-arcsec (30 m) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We used small-baseline SAR interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar method.

T2  - CUADERNOS DE RUSISTICA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article dwells upon rendering semantic and pragmatic aspects of rituals in Turkish-Russian translation. The authors use novel "My Name is Red" by O. Pamuk and its Russian version (translated by M. Sharov) as the material for comparative study. The research is focused on application of "domestication" strategy, which presupposes cultural adaptation of the text to Russian-speaking recipients' perception. The authors find out that losses in translation process are related to various linguistic, cultural and religious phenomena modeling national worldview. Moreover, a wide range of semantic and pragmatic discrepancies is caused due to use of approximate, but not identical phenomena of target culture to replace ones of the source culture in translation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses variants of interpretation of the image of folk hero and fairy tale landscapes in book illustrations of the Golden Age. When illustrating Children's and Household Tales from the Brothers Grimm's collection in 1892-1894, the German master Hermann Vogel drew from the heritage of late romanticism and the Biedermeier. In his illustrations for Russian folk tales from A. N. Afanasiev's collection in 1901-1903, Ivan Bilibin managed to seamlessly combine the Art Nouveau stylistics with the images and rhythms of folk and Old Russian Art. In both cases distinctive author's style naturally pursues the national artistic tradition. H. Vogel tended towards providing genre entertainment and moral, while I. Bilibin focused more on the artistic image of the path from the day-to-day life to a fairy tale: the path, that leads a hero from his house to the world of forests and swamps, the edge of the worlds (which is most often designated with a diagonal of a fallen tree trunk). Both in German and Russian illustrations, fairy landscapes most often feature the images of a Forest. Vogel's cozy mid-wood full of singing birds and tiny animals seems to provide shelters for lost heroes. In addition to certain superficial sentimentality of the Biedermeier and orientation on children's audience, there is a hint of German romanticists' belief in a special connection of children's souls and the harmonious nature of the Eden. Bilibin's Russian forest is monumental and silent, formidable and splendid, and is closer to the unadapted folk worldview.

AB  - The non-stationarity characteristic of the solar power renders traditional point forecasting methods to be less useful due to large prediction errors. This results in increased uncertainties in the grid operation, thereby negatively affecting the reliability and increased cost of operation. This research paper proposes a unified architecture for multi-time-horizon predictions for short and long-term solar forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The paper describes an end-to-end pipeline to implement the architecture along with methods to test and validate the performance of the prediction model. The results demonstrate that the proposed method based on the unified architecture is effective for multi-horizon solar forecasting and achieves a lower root-mean-squared prediction error compared to the previous best performing methods which use one model for each time-horizon. The proposed method enables multi-horizon forecasts with real-time inputs, which have a high potential for practical applications in the evolving smart grid.

TI  - STUDY OF THE TEMPERATURE CONDITION OF SURFACE WATERS OF NOVOTROITSKY RESERVOIR BASED ON REMOTE SENSING DATA AND EVALUATION OF ITS IMPACT ON FISH GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
T2  - SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. The aim of the study is to analyze and reveal the features of the temperature regime of the Novotroitsky water reservoir surface based on remote sensing data; to determine the influence of the temperature regime of the surface waters of Novotroitsky reservoir on the ecological state of the reservoir, as well as to determine the areas of the surface water zones of the Novotroitsky reservoir with optimal and unfavorable temperature conditions for fish. Methods. The temperature values of the earth's surface (water area) were calculated according to the generally accepted methodology. Its essence lies in the fact that the calculation of the earth's surface temperature is performed after radiometric calibration of the images and compensation of the effect of the optical density of the atmosphere taking into account the emissivity of various objects on the earth's surface. The calculations were performed separately for the 10 and 11 channels of images from the Landsat 8 satellite, and then averaged. Results. Were established the quantitative characteristics of the inhomogeneity of the temperature fields of the water surface of Novotroitsky reservoir during the summer period due to discharges of the heated waters of the Stavropol GRES power plant. The peculiarities of the spatial variability of the temperature fields of the Novotroitsky water reservoir surface in summer season were revealed. It is shown that the use of the Novotroitsky water reservoir as a reservoir-cooler is potentially accompanied by the development of eutrophication processes and creation of risks for drinking purposes, as well as cultural, household and fishery use. The table shows the data demonstrating the temperature condition of the Novotroitsky reservoir water surface. The figure shows the temperature fields of the surface of the Novotroitsky water reservoir. Conclusions. In summer period, half of the water area of the Novotroitsky water reservoir can be attributed to the zones of optimum temperatures for the juvenile pikeperch. Were revealed the periods when the reservoir becomes practically unsuitable for growth and development of juveniles of oxyphilic fish. Excessive rise of water temperature in summer was established in accordance with SanPiN (Sanitary Rules and Regulations) 2.1.5.980-00.2.1.5. Such an increase in temperature is observed in 13-16% of the whole water area

CP  - 13th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)
CL  - Fortaleza, BRAZIL
AB  - Satellite imagery along with image processing techniques prove to be efficient tools for bathymetry retrieval as they provide time and cost-effective alternatives to traditional methods of water depth estimation. In this article, a nonlinear machine learning technique of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to derive shallow water bathymetry data along Sint Maarten Island and Ameland Inlet, The Netherlands, by combining echo-sounding measurements and the reflectance of blue, green, or red bands of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat 7 ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery with 30 m spatial resolution. In the analysis, 80% of data points of the echo-sounding measurements are used for training and the remaining 20% data points are used for testing. The model utilizes the radial basis kernel function (nonlinear) and the other training factors such as the smoothing parameter, penalty parameter C, and insensitivity zone epsilon are selected and tuned based on the learning (i.e. training) process. The overall errors during test phases for Sint Maarten Island (1-15m) and Ameland Inlet (1.00-3.50m) are 8.26% and 14.43%, respectively, reflecting that the model produces significant estimations for the shallow depths ranges, considered in this study. The results obtained are also compared statistically with those estimated from the widely used linear transform model and ratio transform model, which establish a linear relationship between the water depth and band reflectances. Based on the results, it is evident that SVM provides a comparable or better performance for shallow depth ranges and can be used effectively for deriving accurate and updated medium resolution bathymetric maps.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF THE OPEN AND COASTAL OCEAN AND INLAND WATERS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Open and Coastal Ocean and Inland Waters
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - Local changes in specular reflections of visible sunlight on the ocean surfaces can be captured effectively by satellite sensors operating in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This causes the sun-glint imagery to closely resemble the oceanic images obtained using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) further allowing the identification of the various fine scale structures and patterns of the ocean. Moreover, at relevant spatial resolutions, cloud-free conditions as well as optimum relative positions of the sensor, sun and the wave front it is possible to image ocean waves, wave transformations and refraction patterns using Satellite Sun-glint imagery (SSGI). In the present study, Landsat OLI imagery captured along the coast of Brest, France is used to derive ocean wave characteristics such as wavelength, direction, amplitude and then mapped to better understand the process of wave transformation. The 2D fast Fourier transform technique has been used on Band 5 (NIR, 0.851 - 0.879 mu m) to derive the wavelength of swell waves in near-shore regions as well as to analyze the wavelength change. Furthermore, owing to the detector configuration of Landsat 8 OLI there is a small time lag between the channel acquisitions. This effectively helps to infer the space-time characteristics of the surface waves using the cross channel correlation between Band 5 and Band 6 subsequently enabling removal of the directional ambiguity associated with the wave spectra obtained from the analysis. The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the importance of SSGI in deriving relevant coastal information which can be further utilized for bathymetry, surface current and wave motion determinations.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Soil liquefaction and related phenomena, such as ground deformation and lateral spreading, pose significant risk to distributed and critical infrastructure systems. Although liquefaction vulnerability is controlled by geologic and groundwater conditions, its regional assessment is almost exclusively based on geologic material properties or proxies thereof. In this work, we are developing a multivariate methodology that incorporates groundwater conditions by introducing hydrological variables in regional assessment of liquefaction hazards. More specifically, we use remote sensing data and well-monitoring data to set up an integrated hydrological model that provides estimates of soil moisture and depth to water table. We demonstrate the methodology by presenting a case study from the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake in Imperial County. We use reconnaissance data to train a logistic regression model, which yields probabilistic maps of liquefaction occurrence. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach may improve the modeling of regional liquefaction assessment at no additional site investigation cost. However, in order to draw quantitative conclusions on the accuracy improvements, more training data is necessary for which we are collaborating with the ARIA Center at JPL-Caltech.

TI  - Mapping Burned Areas in Tropical Forests Using a Novel Machine Learning Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an application of a novel machine-learning framework on MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data to map burned areas over tropical forests of South America and South-east Asia. The RAPT (RAre Class Prediction in the absence of True labels) framework is able to build data adaptive classification models using noisy training labels. It is particularly suitable when expert annotated training samples are difficult to obtain as in the case of wild fires in the tropics. This framework has been used to build burned area maps from MODIS surface reflectance data as features and Active Fire hotspots as training labels that are known to have high commission and omission errors due to the prevalence of cloud cover and smoke, especially in the tropics. Using the RAPT framework we report burned areas for 16 MODIS tiles from 2001 to 2014. The total burned area detected in the tropical forests of South America and South-east Asia during these years is 2,071,378 MODIS (500 m) pixels (approximately 520 K sq. km.), which is almost three times compared to the estimates from collection 5 MODIS MCD64A1 (783,468 MODIS pixels). An evaluation using Landsat-based reference burned area maps indicates that our product has an average user's accuracy of 53% and producer's accuracy of 55% while collection 5 MCD64A1 burned area product has an average user's accuracy of 61% and producer's accuracy of 27%. Our analysis also indicates that the two products can be complimentary and a combination of the two approaches is likely to provide a more comprehensive assessment of tropical fires. Finally, we have created a publicly accessible web-based viewer that helps the community to visualize the burned area maps produced using RAPT and examine various validation sources corresponding to every detected MODIS pixel.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences
CL  - INDIA
AB  - This article describes an attempt to map snow cover accurately from other land covers using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data of 500 m spatial resolution. The workflow includes reflectance modelling, computing snow-cover fraction (SCF) and establishing an empirical relationship between the SCF and normalized difference snow index (NDSI) to map snow cover at operational level. Regression relationships have been developed between the SCF derived from the linear mixture model (LMM) and snow obtained from the NDSI based on two criteria, namely: SCF greater than 0.0 and SCF greater than 0.1. The best regression equation has been selected by examining respective graph plots using statistical measures of mean absolute error, correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE) and uncertainty analysis. The results have been validated against the actual SCF obtained from a high-resolution 15 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) visible and near infrared (VNIR) scene and covering a substantial range of snow cover of the same area. The selected regression model SCF = 0.25 + 0.35 x NDSI has been tested on other areas and validation efforts show that the pixel-level SCF relationship provides useful results as measured in independent tests against actual SCF obtained from ASTER scene.

AB  - The concerns about global warming and climate change have produced widespread scientific interest in the response of glaciers. One of the important indicators of climate change is glacier change. The glaciers in Indian Himalaya have been retreating which can have several effects. Therefore, there is a need of precise and timely mapping and monitoring of the glacier changes. The advent of high spatial resolution images that provide more detailed information has now allowed analyzing glacier changes at a local level. However, change detection using high spatial resolution images faces additional challenges due to, for example, small spurious changes, etc. Fortunately, these effects are reduced by using object-based approaches rather than pixel-based approaches. In this study, object-based approach has been explored to detect the glacier surface changes from high spatial resolution images of WorldView-2 and Linear Imaging Self-Scanning System (LISS) IV which has not been done till date in Indian Himalaya.

TI  - A Deterministic Compressive Sensing Approach for Compressed Domain Image Analysis
T2  - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ISSPIT)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)
CL  - Louisville, KY
AB  - Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique for acquiring sparse signals at sampling rates much lower than the Nyquist rate. Traditionally to avoid generation of large sensing matrices for 2D signals or images, individual rows or columns of the images are compressed in the sensing phase. This increases the number of matrix multiplication operations and results in a compressed image with a different aspect ratio than the original uncompressed image. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we investigate a 2D deterministic sensing technique that maintains both the aspect ratio and the morphology of the image. We use a linear filtering-based measurement matrix. Through this paper, we demonstrate that deterministic CS will preserve the features and there by enable analysis of the images such as detection and identification of objects in the compressed domain without the need to perform a computationally expensive reconstruction. In order to demonstrate this, images obtained by infra-red electro-optic camera on an airborne platform (low resolution), LandSat (medium resolution) and multispectral images (high resolutions) are chosen. Features of chosen objects from an uncompressed image are compared with those corresponding objects in the compressed image using template matching to demonstrate that such image analysis can be done in the compressed domain. Frobenius norm-based structural similarity analysis for the images at different levels of compression is presented to demonstrate the similarity in structure. Robustness of the deterministic CS technique is shown by performing template matching based image analysis on noisy compressed images.

TI  - Vulvar carcinoma: dilemma, debates, and decisions
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Vulvar carcinoma is a rare and aggressive gynecological malignancy. It affects elderly females, with the mean age at diagnosis being 55-60 years. Regional metastasis to inguinal lymph nodes is common. There is a high incidence of pelvic node involvement, especially in those with pathologically positive inguinal nodes. Surgery appears to be the only curative treatment option in the early stages of the disease. But in most patients, surgery is associated with considerable morbidities and psychosexual issues. Hence, in the quest for a less morbid form of treatment, multimodality approaches with various combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have been suggested for advanced vulvar cancers. Due to the low incidence of the disease, the level of evidence for the success of these treatment modalities is poor. In countries like India, a heterogeneous incidence of vulvar carcinoma exists across the country, with patients presenting at advanced stages when the option of surgery is often supplemented or replaced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this review, we attempt to study the available published literature and trials and discuss the treatment options in various stages of vulvar carcinoma.

AB  - The paper discusses our studies of oil pollution due to natural hydrocarbon seeps on the seafloor in the South-Eastern Black Sea. The patterns of surface oil pollution of the South-Eastern Black Sea are analyzed and described. Trajectories of oil slicks from seabed seepages are analyzed on the base of satellite remote sensing data for 2010-2017. The quantitative assessment of inter-annual, seasonal and spatial variability of natural oil pollution of the region of interest is performed. Maps of oil pollution risks of sea surface and shores in the South-Eastern Black Sea are created. The precise estimation of the actual seafloor source location is made on the base of satellite data. The impact of dynamic and circulation processes and natural factors (current meandering, vortical activity, and wind patterns) on the stretching, spread, and disappearance of oil films is discussed.

AB  - The work studies submesoscale fronts (with characteristic transverse scales lower than the Rossby internal radius of deformation) in inland seas on the base of remote sensing data. We show that we can significantly broaden our insights into the physics and geography of small-scale fronts by employing satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR). During our satellite survey of the Baltic Sea, we obtained many satellite images of the sea surface bearing imprints of fronts of different formation mechanisms and different spatial and temporal characteristics. First we develop a methodology for identifying various submesoscale front signatures in SAR images and list the most common features of front manifestations. We describe characteristic features associated with fronts of different nature which are not usually detectable by traditional observational data sources because of their small scale and because they are often masked by upper-level clouds. The main problem is to discriminate between signatures of fronts in the sea and those in the near - surface layer of the atmosphere. We validated our interpretations of front features in SAR images via the combined analysis of data on the sea surface and marine atmosphere condition, sea surface temperature, and mesoscale water dynamics.

TI  - Snow cover mapped daily at 30 meters resolution using a fusion of multi-temporal MODIS NDSI data and Landsat surface reflectance
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow fall and melt events are complex meteorological phenomena that help chart the effects of climate change and impact many critical environmental processes including hydrologic and biogeographic systems. Daily snow maps, derived from MODIS imagery, provide managers and researchers with vital snow cover information, but only at spatial scales of 500 m or more. Finer resolution time series maps, however, retain large temporal gaps, particularly during recurrent cloud cover. This paper's authors have developed the novel algorithm MODSAT-NDSI to harness the strengths of both coarse and finer spatial resolution imagery by fusing MODIS and Landsat normalized difference snow index (NDSI) data. Daily 30 m snow cover maps were thus generated for 2000 - 2017 with an overall accuracy of 90%, using 33 validation sites distributed throughout south-central British Columbia. Snow cover trends were analyzed across stratified elevation bands and land cover types, revealing that snow cover persists under lower elevation forests for an average of 23.5 d longer than in adjacent open areas during spring. We conclude that the MODSAT-NDSI approach captures temporal and spatial advantages of freely available snow cover datasets and can be modified to suit a variety of novel investigations relating to snow cover or other spectral indices.

TI  - Landscape disturbance caused by non-renewable energy production in a semi-arid region: a case study on the Russian steppe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploration and development of oil and gas (O&G) energy resources can create large-scale and permanent landscape effects that are best measured and understood via fieldwork and geospatial technologies. In this article, we examine O&G surface disturbance in the Orenburg steppe region of southwestern Russia for the year 2015. Utilizing field surveys, remote-sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, we apply a two-pronged approach. First, we map and measure the landscape infrastructure footprint (LIF) to determine the pattern and extent of direct surface disturbance created by O&G facilities and access roads. Second, we conduct a site suitability analysis to identify specific O&G production locations that are most vulnerable to environmental degradation. The approach considers both the particular properties of hydrocarbon production and specific natural features of steppe zones. Suitability patterns represent three indicators: two morphometric parameters (slope and aspect) and one spatial (the remoteness of O&G objects from water bodies). Our findings suggest that O&G production disturbs just over 3% of soil-vegetation cover in our study plot, while more than 13% of O&G objects are located in unsuitable zones based on topographic aspect, and about 11% lie in unsuitable zones regarding distance to water.

TI  - Wetland Mapping Using SAR Data from the Sentinel-1A and TanDEM-X Missions: A Comparative Study in the Biebrza Floodplain (Poland)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research is related to the eco-hydrological problems of the herbaceous wetland drying and biodiversity loss in the floodplain lakes of the Middle Basin of the Biebrza River (Poland). An experiment was set up, with its main goals as follows: (i) mapping the vegetation types and the temporarily or permanently flooded areas, and (ii) comparing the usefulness of the C-band Sentinel-1A (S1A) and X-band TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX) for mapping purposes. The S1A imagery was acquired on a regular basis using the dual polarization VV/VH and the Interferometric Wide Swath Mode. The TSX/TDX data were acquired in quad-pol, a fully polarimetric mode, during the Science Phase. The paper addresses the following aspects: (i) wetland mapping with the S1A multi-temporal series; (ii) wetland mapping with the fully polarimetric TSX/TDX data; (iii) comparing the wetland mapping using dual polarization TSX/TDX subsets, that is, the HH-HV, HH-VV and VV-VH; (iv) comparing wetland mapping using the S1A and TSX/TDX data based on the same polarization (VV-VH); (v) studying the suitability of the Shannon Entropy for wetland mapping; and (vi) assessing the contribution of interferometric coherence for wetland classification. Though the experimental results show the main limitations of the S1A dataset, they also highlight the good accuracy that can be achieved using the TSX/TDX data, especially those taken in fully polarimetric mode. Some practical outcomes significant for the study area management using SAR were also described.

TI  - Assessment of river bank erosion in semi-arid climate regions using remote sensing and GIS data: a case study of Rdat River, Marrakech, Morocco
T2  - ESTUDIOS GEOLOGICOS-MADRID
M3  - Article
AB  - Bank erosion is the process of detachment of material grains constituting the banks under the effect of river water during flood events in a fluvial system in semi-arid regions, which are characterized by irregular floods. The phenomenon of river bank erosion has several environmental impacts on the fluvial ecosystem and studies of it are essential. In this context, the purpose of this study is to provide a simple approach to estimate bank heights in order to evaluate the rate of contribution of river bank erosion to the sediment load of the rivers during the last 32 years and its consequences in the fluvial system. The database considered is Landsat images from 1984 to 2016 and the ALOS PALSAR elevation data of Rdat basin, which is located in the southeast of Marrakech in Morocco, as well as field evidence. These data were processed using remote sensing and GIS tools and then combined to improve the results. The obtained results showed that the river bank of Rdat basin is, significantly, unstable and contributes to the supply of sediments to the river, with a river bank retreat rate of 5 m. yr(-1) and an annual volumetric erosion rate of 286.82 m(3) yr(-1) on average. The sediments released in the river, when eroded from banks, may be the origin of contaminated sediments (phosphorus, Mercury ...) as well as the main cause of the filling of the river channel.

AB  - The AW3D30 dataset is a publically available, high-accuracy digital surface model; the model's cited nominal elevation accuracy is 5 m (1s). In order to verify the accuracy of AW3D30, we selected China as test area, and used field measurement points in the national control point image database as control data. The elevation accuracy of the field measurement points in the national control point image database is better than 1 m. The results show that the accuracy of the AW3D30 satisfies the requirement of 5 m nominal accuracy, and elevation accuracy reached 2 m (1s). Accuracy is related to both terrain and slope. Accuracy is better in flat areas than in areas of complex terrain, and the eastern region of China is characterized by better accuracy than the western region.

AB  - High resolution thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data are widely used in many fields, such as environmental protection, land resources, urban construction and other scientific applications. This article presents a high resolution thermal infrared satellite concept to meet above requirements. The satellite can operate in a sun synchronous orbit, and provide high spatial resolution data (similar to 5m) with a 2-day revisit in 19 spectral bands. The payload of the satellite can obtain radiance data which are subsequently processed into measurements of atmospheric and surface properties, such as land surface temperature (LST), water surface temperature, evapotranspiration, column water vapor, material composition and others. For users with urgent needs, remote sensing data of the payload can be processed by utilizing the Intelligent Onboard Data Processing (IODP) technology, so that event information is obtained onboard. Through the direct data downlink, event information is transmitted to ground stations immediately, so application users can quickly respond. In addition, because of the small swath of the high resolution satellite, the payload must be installed on an agile platform, which can effectively enlarge swath by multi-stripes splicing imaging. In general, this article provides an overview of the technical approach and application direction of high resolution thermal infrared satellites, which can be used as a reference for satellite applications and engineering development.

TI  - What does the fox say? Monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment using wild red foxes as an indicator
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in relation to human population densities. Samples from wild red foxes (n = 528) included in the Norwegian monitoring programme on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food, feed and animals were included. All samples were divided into three different groups based on population density in the municipality where the foxes were hunted. Of the 528 samples included, 108 (20.5%), 328 (62.1%) and 92 (17.4%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. A single faecal swab was collected from each fox. All samples were plated out on a selective medium for Enterobacteriaceae for culturing followed by inclusion and susceptibility testing of one randomly selected Escherichia coli to assess the overall occurrence of AMR in the Gram-negative bacterial population. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to selective screening for detection of E. coli displaying resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In addition, a subset of samples (n = 387) were subjected to selective culturing to detect E. coli resistant to carbapenems and colistin, and enterococci resistant to vancomycin. Of these, 98 (25.3%), 200 (51.7%) and 89 (23.0%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. Overall, the occurrence of AMR in indicator E. coli from wild red foxes originating from areas with different human population densities in Norway was low to moderate (8.8%). The total occurrence of AMR was significantly higher; chi2 (1,N = 336) = 6.53, p = 0.01 in areas with high population density compared to areas with medium population density. Similarly, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli isolated using selective detection methods was low in areas with low population density and more common in areas with medium or high population density. In conclusion, we found indications that occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in Norway is associated with human population density. Foxes living in urban areas are more likely to be exposed to AMR bacteria and resistance drivers from food waste, garbage, sewage, waste water and consumption of contaminated prey compared to foxes living in remote areas. The homerange of red fox has been shown to be limited thereby the red fox constitutes a good sentinel for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Continuous monitoring on the occurrence of AMR in different wild species, ecological niches and geographical areas can facilitate an increased understanding of the environmental burden of AMR in the environment. Such information is needed to further assess the impact for humans, and enables implementation of possible control measures for AMR in humans, animals and the environment in a true One Health approach.

TI  - Urban Dengue Surveillance over Sixteen Years: Integration, Trend Analysis and Participation of Private Medical Sector
T2  - Journal of Communicable Diseases
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The increasing urbanisation and evolution of dengue vector offers favorable grounds for dengue. In absence of effective vaccine and therapeutic interventions, surveillance and reporting becomes mainstay for dengue management.Methods: Extensive efforts integrated various components (vector, human case, laboratory, environment and virus) of dengue surveillance with existing vector-borne disease surveillance in a large municipal corporation of western India. Approximately 80% private sector was involved to enhance and expand epidemiological picture of dengue transmission. Weekly entomological surveillance for immature and mature forms of Aedes mosquito was performed by trained team. Standardised sentinel hospital laboratories confirmed serological diagnosis. Virus serotype surveys and environmental indices were integrated later.Results: Between years 2000- 2016, total 24,506 clinically suspected and 3,515 confirmed cases were tested and reported respectively. After 2006, private sector contributed 10970 (40%) suspected and 971 (30%) confirmed cases. The adult vector density emerged as significantly correlated (r=0.67) to dengue cases. Low (<1) level of larval indices; House index (HI), Container's index (CI) and Breteau index (BI) supported dengue transmission. The virus serotype survey shows predominant DEN-2 strain. The quality controlled and detailed case information guided implementation of prevention and control measure.Conclusions: Integration of dengue surveillance components with special emphasis on private sector leads to better informed program managers and healthcare providers.

TI  - Impact of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis/Still's disease on adolescents as evidenced through social media posts
T2  - OPEN ACCESS RHEUMATOLOGY-RESEARCH AND REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To understand the experience of adolescent systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) patients and those of their parents based on their social media posts.Methods: English language posts related to SJIA, Still's disease, or juvenile arthritis were collected and analyzed.Results: In total, 71 posts created between 2009 and 2015 on 15 websites were identified in November 2015. Of the 32 unique authors, 17 were SJIA patients aged 13-20 years (40 posts), 7 were mothers of SJIA patients (12 posts), and 8 patients had unspecified forms of juvenile arthritis (19 posts). Many patients posted about similar diagnostic experiences marked by 5 phases: 1) early prediagnosis: pain and fatigue overlooked until crisis occurred, 2) first misdiagnosis: doctors talked about "growing pains" and psychosocial problems ("fake pains" to avoid school), 3) second misdiagnosis: severity acknowledged, but diagnosed as leukemia or another cancer, 4) tests: tests leading to diagnosis and treatment conducted, and 5) cognitive identity: patient accepted the diagnosis and its implications. Many adolescent patients, looking back at disease onset in their childhood, described themselves as a "sleeping child" rather than the typical active child. Several patients tried to hide their illness from friends, but expressed concerns openly online. Many patients described SJIA as a powerful external enemy, using terms like "bulldozer," "dragon," and " monster. "Many posts from patients and their mothers used superhero language/imagery to help "fight" SJIA. Some patients also posted about the risk of death.Conclusion: Although most adolescent SJIA patients openly posted about the difficulties of their disease online, they made efforts to hide their disease in the real world. They frequently used superhero words and images in describing their fight for better health. Physicians can use these insights when counseling SJIA patients to provide a narrative that meshes with the patients' worldview and perhaps to improve physician-patient communication to increase treatment adherence.

TI  - Estimating vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza among children and adolescents in Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, 2012-2016
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) has to be estimated anew for every season to explore vaccines' protective effect in the population. We report VE estimates against laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B among children aged 2-17 years, using test-negative design. Pooled data from two German federal states' surveillance systems for acute respiratory illness from week 40/2012 to 20/2016 was used, yielding a total of 10 627 specimens. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between laboratory-confirmed influenza and vaccination status were calculated by multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, illness onset and federal state. VE was estimated as 1-Odds Ratio. Overall adjusted VE was 33% (95% CI: 24.3-40.7). A strong variation of VE between the seasons and subtypes was observed: highest season-and subtype-specific VE of 86.2% (95% CI: 41.3-96.7) was found against A(H1N1) pdm09 in 7-17-year-olds in 2015/16. Low estimates of VE were observed against A(H3N2) in any season, e.g. 1.5% (95% CI: -39.3-30.3) in 2014/15. Estimates showed a tendency to higher VE among 7-17-year-old children, but differences were not statistically significant. Although our findings are common in studies estimating influenza VE, we discussed several explanations for observed low VE.

AB  - This study evaluated and compared the utility of Landsat and ASTER in land cover change detection within granite quarries. Landsat data used was acquired in 1998 and 2015 while ASTER data used was acquired in 2001 and 2013. Both Landsat and ASTER were classified using supervised and maximum likelihood classification. Post-classification and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index change detection techniques were applied to assess and measure changes in land cover caused by granite quarries. Overall classification of ASTER was slightly higher than that obtained for Landsat (overall accuracy (OA) =79% and kappa 0.75vs. OA=75% and kappa 0.71). Both Landsat and ASTER were able to assess land cover changes within granite quarries. Change detection results revealed increase in granite quarries which subsequently resulted in decrease in vegetation and bare land and increase in water bodies within the quarries. The study found ASTER to be better at discriminating granite quarries from other land cover features and was able to detect small water bodies within granite quarries due to higher spatial resolution of bands in the VNIR subsystem. On the contrary, Landsat was found better at detecting changes in vegetation within granite quarries.

AB  - Environmental monitoring is an important aspect in sustainable development. The use of remote sensing in the mining industry has evolved significantly and allows for improved mapping and monitoring environmental impacts related to mining activities. The aim of this study was to measure land cover changes caused by granite quarrying activities located between Rustenburg and Brits towns, North West Province, South Africa using Landsat time series data. Landsat data used in the study were acquired in the years 1973, 1986, 1998 and 2015. Each image was classified using supervised classification and change detection was subsequently applied to measure land cover changes. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to highlight the dynamics in vegetation in the quarries. Accuracy assessment of the classification resulted in an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 75% and 0.71, respectively. The results of post-classification change detection revealed a significant increase of 907.4 ha in granite quarries between 1973 and 2015. The expansion in granite quarries resulted in development of water bodies (2.07 ha) within the quarries. Correspondingly, there were significant losses in vegetation (782.1 ha) and bare land (119 ha). NDVI results showed variability in mean NDVI values within the digitized quarries. The overall mean NDVI values trends showed that most granite quarries had the highest vegetation in 1998, while the least vegetation cover was observed 1986.

TI  - Comparing the Hedging Effectiveness of Weather Derivatives Based on Remotely Sensed Vegetation Health Indices and Meteorological Indices
T2  - WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather derivatives are considered a promising agricultural risk management tool. Station-based meteorological indices typically provide the data underlying these instruments. However, the main shortcoming of these weather derivatives is an imperfect correlation between the weather index and the yield of the insured crop, called basis risk. This paper considers three available remotely sensed vegetation health (VH) indices, namely, the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the vegetation health index (VHI), as indices for weather derivatives in a German case study. We investigated the correlation and period of highest correlation with winter wheat yield. Moreover, we analyzed whether the use of remotely sensed VH indices for weather derivatives can reduce basis risk and thus improve the performance of weather derivatives. The two commonly used meteorological indices, precipitation and temperature sums, were employed as benchmarks. Quantile regression and index value simulation were used for the design and pricing of the weather derivatives. The analysis for the selected farms and corresponding counties in northeastern Germany revealed that, on average, the VHI resulted in the highest correlation with winter wheat yield, and VHI-based weather derivatives were also superior in terms of the hedging effectiveness. The total periods of the highest correlations ranged from the beginning of April to the end of July. VHI- and VCI-based weather derivatives led to statistically significant reductions of basis risk, compared to the benchmarks. Our results indicate that the VHI-based weather derivatives can be useful alternatives to meteorological indices, especially in regions with sparser weather station networks.

TI  - Remote Sensing of a Shallow, Fringing Reef Platform for Analysis of Island Sector Susceptibility and Development of a Coastal Vulnerability Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Like many islands in middle latitudes, Pacific islands are often fringed by protective coral reefs that attenuate wave energy impacting the coastline. Measurement of the extent and distribution of shallow reef platforms by remote sensing of bathymetry enables an assessment of the relative exposure or protection of each part of an island. Fringing reefs are one of a number of physical variables relevant to the coastline's susceptibility to erosion and inundation resulting from extreme weather and conditions exacerbated by climate change and rising sea levels. In this research the extent of shallow reef platform around Lifuka Island, Tonga, was determined using a modified Stumpf band ratio method applied to Landsat 8 and high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery, with aerial LIDAR data available for ground-truth purposes. The results indicate that both sets of satellite imagery provide a means of measuring the bathymetry to at least 15 m with a correlation (R-2) value of 0.87 for Landsat 8 and to 15 m with a correlation (R-2) value of 0.86 for Quickbird, when compared with the LIDAR survey. This article forms part of the research into the preparation of a coastal vulnerability index to inform decision-making and risk assessment for Pacific Island nations at the subisland scale. The mapping of the fringing reef by remote sensing allows its spatial distribution to be considered in the assessment of risk to coastal regions to inundation and erosion processes. Further, it demonstrates the value of freely available Landsat data for planning adaptation to climate change in developing nations at a level pertinent to local governance of villages and communities.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)

AB  - This paper presents a deep-learning based framework for addressing the problem of accurate cloud detection in remote sensing images. This framework benefits from a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN), which is capable of pixel-level labeling of cloud regions in a Landsat 8 image. Also, a gradient-based identification approach is proposed to identify and exclude regions of snow/ice in the ground truths of the training set. We show that using the hybrid of the two methods (threshold-based and deep-learning) improves the performance of the cloud identification process without the need to manually correct automatically generated ground truths. In average the Jaccard index and recall measure are improved by 4.36% and 3.62%, respectively.

TI  - Spatial dynamics of land cover in the Sdamas region (Tiaret, Algeria)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sdamas massif to which our contribution relates is located in West Algeria, it is an integral part of the Tiaret mountains. The aim of our study is to analyze the land cover of the Sdamas region over a 43-year interval grouped into 9 thematic classes: mineral surfaces (urban planning), wetland, vegetation, bare soils and fallow etc. The spatial and temporal dynamics of land use require regular monitoring of vegetation cover from remote sensing imagery. It is for this reason that we relied on field data to perform the diachronic analysis with three well-defined scenes 1972, 1998 and 2015, using Landsat satellite images (MSS, TM and ETM +). The analysis of these maps covering the same region shows the different changes that have taken place at ground level. We found that our natural plant space has undergone a strong degradation, disruption and regression because of different human activities, namely: overgrazing, clearing, fires, urbanization, (there has been a remarkable increase in the population of the communes of the study area). Inadequate and ineffective forestry interventions and work, and lack of sustained protection are reasons of these processes. Factors affecting the forest ecosystem are bioclimate and human action. Indeed, the bioclimate, through atmospheric drought, is the main factor governing the diversity of these formations of the Sdamas mountains.

TI  - Enzymes of <i>Variola louti</i> as potential biomarkers of aquatic pollution with a partial treated sewage
T2  - CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a recently published study we observed that significant changes in the cellular and molecular levels that associated with the accumulation of heavy metals in liver of a sentinel fish species Variola louti collected from Al-Badhae site, which received a partial treated municipal sewage, located along the Jeddah Red Sea coast. The present study was aimed to evaluate pesticide, antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes V. louti to assess the impact of sewage. The concentration of heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Zn) in water from polluted area was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those taken from reference area. Acetylcholinesterase was increased 8.8-10.5 folds in reference area than that in polluted area (P < 0.001). On the contrary, the activities of catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase were significantly higher in polluted area than that in reference area. In conclusion, the high level of heavy metals in water of polluted area had the most effect on the antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. The low level of AChE indicated the presence of the high levels of pesticides in polluted area. These results supported that the sewage should be completely treated before draining in Red Sea.

AB  - Nowadays, the principle of cooperation between the judge and the parties (Le Principe de cooperation entre le juge ET les parties) is dominant in the context of dealing with disputes. This principle has roots in the principle of honesty in the fundamental rights of procedure (Le Principe de loyaute en droit processuel) and it could be traced back to various countries ' rules and regulations. Determination of the manner of cooperation between the judge and the parties to the dispute as well as the issue of preference of one over the other are also important subjects in the literature of modern procedure rights. The evolutions of modern legal systems show that the majority of efforts in the context of proceeding are aimed at the creation of a fair and truth-oriented system. Achieving the former requires a precise and comprehensive schematization of the proceedings in a way that all the players related to the dispute (the judge and the parties) are provided with equal facilities to reach a verdict. In this legal worldview, the proceeding is not a quarrel for victory; rather it is a deployed context that requires a goodwill wielded cooperation between the judge and the parties.

AB  - Landslide is among hazardous kind of disasters, which claiming many of lives and billions of dollars of damages in property every year. Detecting the spatial distribution of landslides is highly important in decision making Interferometry synthetic aperture RADAR (InSAR) is a technique have been employed in many studies, including land surface deformation. The Google Earth (GE) with images in high spatial resolution provide a potential for regional landslide mapping, especially in vegetated areas, where landslides creates bare lands This study aims to detect landslide locations using integration of InSAR technique, Google Earth images and extensive field survey in a part of Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia. A pair of synthetic aperture RADAR (SAR) images were acquired from scihub.copernicus.eu website. In order to extract surface deformation, either imageries were preprocessed and processed through sentinel application platform (SNAP) software. A total number of 152 landslide locations were extracted from phase, coherence and unwrapped bands with the help of the Google Earth images, where they were overlaid on the Google Earth and by zooming in deformed surfaces the landslide locations were identified, extracted and converted into layer format using Geographical Information System (GIS). Geographical Positioning System (GPS) was utilized for validation purposes.

TI  - Wetland Water Level Monitoring Using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR): A Review
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The production of spatially detailed quantitative maps of water level variations in flooded vegetation, and the detection of flow patterns and discontinuities in both managed and natural wetland ecosystems provide valuable information for monitoring these unique environments. Hydrological monitoring of wetlands is also critical for maintaining and preserving the habitat of various plant and animal species. Over the last two decades, advances in remote sensing technologies have supported wetland monitoring and management in several aspects, including classification, change detection, and water level monitoring. In particular, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has emerged as a promising tool for hydrological monitoring of wetland water bodies. However, a comprehensive review of the status, trends, techniques, advances, potentials, and limitations of this technique is lacking. In this study, we evaluate the use of InSAR for hydrological monitoring of wetlands, discuss the main challenges associated with this technique, recommend possible solutions to mitigate the main problems identified in the literature, and present opportunities for future research.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change information is fundamental to support environmental change studies, land management, and many other societal benefits. Here, we assess and quantify the spatial and temporal land cover changes in West Kordofan, Sudan. With (30 m) imagery from Landsat ETM+ for the entire West Kordofan, land cover maps were created to explore the changes in spatially explicit way. The results suggest that land cover changes observed in West Kordofan for 2000 to 2015 reflect emerging environmental risks such as rapidly sand encouragement and land degradation. Sand plain, burnt area and forest increased by approximately 7733.28 km(2), 810.27 km(2) and 258.99 km(2), respectively. The largest relative land cover change over the entire study period was the increase of sand plain. Expansion of sand plain resulted mainly from desert encouragement towards south direction. Accurate information on the patterns of land cover in West Kordofan may contribute to the future establishment of better land use and land cover polices for an effective land management. In addition, land cover information may also help decision-makers to understand and respond appropriately to emerging environmental risks for the inhabited people.

AB  - In this research, land cover changes between 2000 to 2017 were studied in Karbala city (Iraq) using geographic information system techniques and remote sensing data. Satellite imagery data -Landsat7 (2000) and Landsat 8 (2017) - were processed using the supervised maximum likelihood algorithm, and the post-classification comparison method in QGIS 2.14. Four land cover categories, namely, built-up, vegetation, water, and soil have been specified to produce land cover maps for each acquisition date. The overall accuracies were 99.99% (2000), and 99.98% (2017) with Kappa statistics of 0.99, and 0.99. The evaluation of land cover changes shows that built-up, vegetation and soil have been increased by 1.9% (93.5 km2), 0.4% (20.8 km2) and 4.4% (221.3 km2) while water land has a shrink by 6.7% (335.6 km2) respectively. These changes conclude a serious threat to water land which it effects on population growth, human activities and agricultural activities in the study area.

AB  - The proper selection of anchor pixels (hot and cold pixels) for calculating the sensible heat flux (H) in SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) is a critical aspect to be considered. The current study proposes a novel method to select the cold and hot pixels using the soil moisture measurements derived from the SAR images. TheWater cloud Model (WCM) derived soil moisture values combined with NDVI and Land Surface Temperature values were used to locate the anchor pixels in the current study. The results confirmed that the capability of SAR images combined with optical images will help in the appropriate selection of anchor pixels. The ET values obtained in the study showed good agreement with the ground conditions.

AB  - The applications of synthetic aperture radars (SAR) have increased manifold in the past decade, which includes numerous Earth observation applications such as agriculture, forestry, disaster monitoring cryospheric- and atmospheric-studies. Among them, the potential of SAR for ionospheric studies is gaining importance. The susceptibility of SAR to space weather dynamics, and ionosphere in particular, comes at low frequencies of L- and P-bands. This paper discusses one such scintillation event that was observed by L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-2 Phased Array L-type SAR (PALSAR) over southern India on March 23, 2015. The sensors also acquired data sets on four other days on which the ionosphere was quiet. Ionospheric parameter measurements of total electron content (TEC) and amplitude scintillation (S-4) index from ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver at Tirunelveli was used to establish the ionospheric conditions on the days of SAR acquisition as well as to corroborate the S-4 estimated from SAR. Multi-temporal ALOS-2 data sets were utilized to calculate S-4 from two separate methods and the results have a good agreement with GNSS receiver measurements. This highlights the potential of SAR as an alternate technique of monitoring ionospheric scintillations that can be utilized as complementary to the highly accurate and dedicated measurements from the GNSS networks.

AB  - Spaced-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating at low frequencies and capable of earth observation are affected by the layer of ionosphere. The interaction of the signal with the irregularity layer degrades and distorts the SAR image quality. The accurate assumption of size of the irregularities, defined by the axial ratio, in determining the effects of scintillation on the signal is critical. In the present work, the authors have compared the impact of different axial ratios on a pair of SAR images over the Indian subcontinent to estimate scintillation and ionospheric parameters. The parameters are then compared with the available ground-based measurements to determine the precise size of irregularity structure. The amplitude scintillation index, S-4, estimated from the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receivers for two Indian stations of Tirunelveli and Rajkot are used in this study. The assumption of axial ratio value is 60:1 to estimate the parameters was found to correctly fit into the model.

AB  - Various pests and diseases can deteriorate the quality and yield of the capsicum. In order to control these losses, their timely detection is important. Thrips is one of the major pests in capsicum which is unable to detect in initial phase as the symptoms are not visible to naked eyes. Thrips not only causes plant damage but for the serious plant diseases it vectors. In this paper, we address the problem of detection of low infestation of thrips on capsicum leaves using multi-temporal hyperspectral remote sensing data simulated to multispectral sensors such as Sentinel-2 and Tetracam RGB+3. The reflectance data from capsicum leaves with healthy and low infestations of thrips has been collected using handheld spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm and bandwidth varying from 3.22 nm to 3.346 nm during the period of 17 Mar to 13 Apr 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multi-temporal data difficult. We have evaluated the performance of tuned random forest classifier for various set of features such as full feature set of 213 bands, features selected by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) from 213 bands, features simulated to broad bands similar to Sentinel 2 and features simulated to multispectral bands similar to Tetracam RGB+3 (a camera which can be placed on drones). Results suggests that an overall classification accuracy of 92.81 % has been achieved on validation dataset using full feature set whereas accuracy slightly dips down to 90.3, 85.13 and 87.45 % when using selected features by LASSO, bands simulated to Sentinel-2 and Tetracam-RGB+3 respectively. Results imply that, Tetracam-RGB+3 and Sentinel-2 satellite can be effectively used for detection of low-infestation of thrips on capsicum.

AB  - The Mite is one of the major sucking pests in grape which goes undetected in its initial phase as the symptoms are not easily visible to the naked eyes. In this paper, we address the problem of mites infestation detection using temporal hyperspectral data and also evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for mites infestation detection. The reflectance data from grape leaves with healthy and low infestations of mites have been collected using spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm during 15th Jan - 18th Feb 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multi-temporal data difficult. Data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis but this large feature set may cause the over-fitting problem and also poses the requirement of large storage and greater processing time. To avoid this, feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) has been carried out to get the optimum band set. Features selected by LASSO were fed to classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to evaluate their performance. Results suggest that LR based model provides maximum accuracy of 93.24%. In addition to this, to investigate the potential of using Sentinel-2, data in 213 narrow bands were simulated to Sentinel-2. Data has been simulated to 10 and 20m spatial resolution bands available in 350-1050nm range. This simulated 8 band feature set has been fed to the same set of classifiers to evaluate their performance. Results suggests that LR provides maximum classification accuracy of 89.12% using simulated Sentinel-2 bands. Further to validate the algorithm using actual ground observations from the field, we have implemented simulated Sentinel-2 based algorithm on two Sentinel-2 images available during the study period and results are compared with actual ground observations about mites infestation. Results suggest mites detection accuracy of 83.33% which shows the good agreement and potential of Sentinel-2 for mites infestation detection.

AB  - Variability in light absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM) (lambda)), by non-algal particles (a(NAP) (lambda)) and by colored detrital matter (a(CDM) (lambda)) were analyzed in the coastal and deep water regions in the Black sea at the same season (Autumn) to avoid the impact of seasonal variability. The CDOM, NAP and CDM light absorption were parameterized. As result of the parameterization the two parameters were obtained (coefficient et 490 nm and slope coefficient (S): a(CDOM) (490) and SCDOM; aNAP (490) and SNAP; Clam (490) and Sam. The CDOM contributed mainly in the a(CDM) (490) in both coastal (79 +/- 13%) and deep water (88 +/- 6%) regions. It was observed high (in similar to order) variability in the a(NAP) (490) in coastal waters due to resuspension of sediments from the bottom at shallow stations. The average S-NAP values were 0.010 nm' in coastal and 0.012 nm(-1) in deep water regions. For all dataset the relationship between of Clam (490) and S-CDM was described by power function. This equation can be used for refining of the regional algorithm of a(CDM)(lambda) assessment in the Black Sea based on satellite data. The obtained in this research relative absorption of NAP and CDOM could be used for remote assessment of a(NAP) (lambda) and a(CDOM)(lambda) in the Black Sea.

AB  - The analysis and forecast of landslide activity on the territories of cities is an actual task. Remote sensing methods are successfully used to solve a whole range of tasks: from classification to modeling. The possibilities of interpreting data are expanding. The processing involves standard methods of statistical research, methods of theories of fuzzy sets, pattern recognition, and others. This paper describes the experience of involving the method of grouping arguments into a prediction model. Firstly, an irregular time series of values of reflection coefficient on areas of active development of the landslide process is investigated. According to the results of the prognosis, it is proved that in the nearest future changes in solar activity (11-year cycle) will not lead to activation of the process. Secondly, the forecast of the activation of the landslide process under the influence of man-made factors was fulfilled. The connection between the content of readily soluble salts in the pores of forest soils of the aeration zone and the values of the coefficient of reflection and. The model extends the possibilities of using the method of group consideration of arguments for mapping zones of landslide activity in sections of man-made geochemical anomalies. The analysis of the model shows that the connection is. In the future it is possible to determine certain values of salt content and values of reflection coefficients, which will be indicators of the probability of activating the landslide process in other conditions.

TI  - L-Band Temporal Coherence Assessment and Modeling Using Amplitude and Snow Depth over Interior Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides the capability to detect surface deformation. Numerous processing approaches have been developed to improve InSAR results and overcome its limitations. Regardless of the processing methodology, however, temporal decorrelation is a major obstacle for all InSAR applications, especially over vegetated areas and dynamic environments, such as Interior Alaska. Temporal coherence is usually modeled as a univariate exponential function of temporal baseline. It has been, however, documented that temporal variations in surface backscattering due to the change in surface parameters, i.e., dielectric constant, roughness, and the geometry of scatterers, can result in gradual, seasonal, or sudden decorrelations and loss of InSAR coherence. The coherence models introduced so far have largely neglected the effect of the temporal change in backscattering on InSAR coherence. Here, we introduce a new temporal decorrelation model that considers changes in surface backscattering by utilizing the relative change in SAR intensity between two images as a proxy for the change in surface scattering parameters. The model also takes into account the decorrelation due to the change in snow depth between two images. Using the L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) data, the model has been assessed over forested and shrub landscapes in Delta Junction, Interior Alaska. The model decreases the RMS error of temporal coherence estimation from 0.18 to 0.09 on average. The improvements made by the model have been statistically proved to be significant at the 99% confidence level. Additionally, the model shows that the coherence of forested areas are more prone to changes in backscattering than shrub landscape. The model is based on L-band data and may not be expanded to C-band or X-band InSAR observations.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the mixedwood boreal forests of northwest Quebec have modified the landscape heterogeneity in terms of its composition and configuration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the heterogeneity (composition and configuration) of 78,000km(2) of mixedwood boreal forest landscape during recent decades (using Landsat imagery from 1985 to 2013) in areas affected by forest management. The classes Conifer, Mixed-Conifer, Mixed-Hardwood, and Hardwood were differentiated with an object-based classification (accuracy >80.2, Kappa coefficient >0.7). Also, 5 metrics (mean area, largest patch index, percentage the landscape of the core area, perimeter-area fractal dimension, and aggregation index) were calculated. This study showed that conifer-dominant cover dominates the mosaic and accounted for one third of the study area. Nevertheless, the conifer-dominant class showed the greatest decrease (reduction of 35% of its initial area at a rate of 1.7% per year). The metrics indicated that forest management in recent years produced a more heterogeneous landscape in 2013 unlike the landscape in 1985. The fire-influenced, old-growth conifer forests that previously dominated the landscape in northwestern Quebec were transformed by forestry practices into a more heterogeneous landscape.

AB  - In this study, we utilized all available Landsat images over two adjacent orbits between 1997 and 2015 for the quasi automatic detection of clearcuts and storm damages in boreal forest of Finland. Landsat time series modelling and analysis was done utilizing the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm with a slight modification for rapid operative conditions. The change maps derived from dense time series analysis showed a good agreement compared to reference maps of clearcuts and storm damages obtained from visual interpretation of Very High Resolution image pairs, by lack of reliable reference in temporal and or spatial domain.

In this study, we propose a Fully Convolutional Network model for the detection of clouds and shadows in optical satellite images. The proposed model was trained on 165 Landsat images in Finland, and tested on an independent set of images. The cloud and shadow detection accuracy reached 95%, outperforming both quantitatively and qualitatively a selection of other deep learning architectures.

AB  - The Phl-Microsat program in the Philippines was initiated for capacity building and with the end goal of having a source of remotely-sensed data for local planning, disaster risk mitigation, and resource management for the country. To increase its benefits, an established process to effectively utilize these images such as image classification is needed. This study aims to determine the most appropriate supervised algorithm for image classification among a set of classifiers that will yield the best results for DIWATA-I Spaceborne Multispectral Images (SMI). SMI is an optical payload, with 80m resolution, and a multiwavelength selection at 10nm width at 1nm steps. Three study sites within the Philippines were selected to test the classifiers Camarines Sur, Ilocos Norte, and Oriental Mindoro. Spectral reflectance values were then derived from atmospheric calibrations of the images. These images were then classified using six supervised classifiers and were post-processed using Majority Analysis. Accuracy is assessed by comparing the overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, producer's accuracy and user's accuracy extracted from the confusion matrix. From the results, Support Vector Machine and Maximum Likelihood classifiers produced the most desirable and most consistent results.

AB  - Mangroves are unique ecosystem found mainly in tropical coastal region in saline environment and under tidal influence. It has enormous ecological and economic value to the environment and local people. However, the problems are arising in tropical coastal region like Sundarban, where both natural and ever increasing anthropogenic activities have complicated the growth and development of mangroves. Therefore, spatio-temporal monitoring of mangroves has huge importance for their conservation in Sundarban World Heritage Site, the largest mangrove population in the world. Remote sensing has been proven as an important tool to monitor such ecosystem, but the traditional pixel based approach has several drawbacks. Recently, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach in remote sensing has helped to overcome such drawbacks. The present study attempts to analyse the status of mangroves over the time period of 40 years (1975-2015) in the study area using Landsat time series images through OBIA. The result reveals that the mangroves are gradually reducing over the last 40 years and about 4% mangrove area has been converted into water. It is a major indication of increase in sea water level, making many islands vulnerable. The time series analysis in some islands, like Bhangaduni, Bulchery, Dalhousie and Halliday shows the land area as well as mangroves have been destroyed more than one-third. If the process continues at the same rate, these islands may soon completely disappear.

TI  - Monitoring dual-season hydrological dynamics of seasonally flooded wetlands in the lower reach of Mayurakshi River, Eastern India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonally flooded wetlands are often neglected due to their ephemeral and erratic appearance and small size, however, their hydro-ecological importance, socio-economic values are equivalent to the permanent wetlands. Using dual-season Landsat multi-spectral imagery, this study highlights a comprehensive monitoring of the hydrological dynamics of wetlands in the lower reach of the Mayurakshi River at a 14-year temporal resolution with the seasonal mode of 1987-2014 time frames. Our results demonstrate the seasonal and periodic hydrological variability of water presence frequency (WPF) in six wetland complexes defined for this study. The Hijal, Ghambira and Maldah wetland complexes are highly affected by the change of WPF, while Dwarka complex is relatively stable. The assessment of WPF change analysis showed that the method is proficient in identifying stable and physically vulnerable wetland patches and absolute loss of wetland inundation frequency resulting from various anthropogenic causes like regulation of river, dry farming practices and other integrated developmental works. The outcome of our study provides a robust basis for the fundamental hydrological and ecological studies and helpful for the conservation and management of seasonally flooded wetland resources in the tropical monsoon climate.

TI  - Landsat-Derived Estimates of Mangrove Extents in the Sierra Leone Coastal Landscape Complex during 1990-2016
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides the first assessment of decadal changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone. While significant advances have been made in mangrove mapping using remote sensing, no study has documented long-term changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone-one of the most vulnerable countries in West Africa. Such understanding is critical for devising regional management strategies that can support local livelihoods. We utilize multi-date Landsat data and cloud computational techniques to quantify spatiotemporal changes in land cover, with focus on mangrove ecosystems, for 1990-2016 along the coast of Sierra Leone. We specifically focus on four estuaries-Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Yawri Bay, and Sherbro. We relied on the k-means approach for an unsupervised classification, and validated the classified map from 2016 using ground truth data collected from Sentinel-2 and high-resolution images and during field research (accuracy: 95%). Our findings indicate that the Scarcies river estuary witnessed the greatest mangrove loss since 1990 (45%), while the Sierra Leone river estuary experienced mangrove gain over the last 26 years (22%). Overall, the Sierra Leone coast lost 25% of its mangroves between 1990 and 2016, with the lowest coverage in 2000, during the period of civil war (1991-2002). However, natural mangrove dynamics, as supported by field observations, indicate the potential for regeneration and sustainability under carefully constructed management strategies.

TI  - Mountain agriculture extraction from time-series MODIS NDVI using dynamic time warping technique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study attempts to extract Mountain Agriculture using an optimized Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm having endpoint constraints. The DTW was applied over a time-series annual stack of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) using a set of reference time series profiles for three agriculture classes (i.e. double cropping, single cropping, and horticulture) and the pixel-wise similarity is examined to identify the agriculture classes. In addition, Euclidean Distance (ED) was used to compare DTW-based result. The detection accuracy of each class was assessed using Google Earth-based agriculture sample, and the spatial agreement of resultant map was assessed with high-resolution reference data using Pareto boundary technique. The sample based accuracy evaluation reveals that DTW algorithm performed better for double and single cropping agriculture detection in compared to the horticulture. Overall, DTW-based agriculture map (0.81 +/- 0.01) yielded higher overall accuracy in comparison with ED-based agriculture map (0.75 +/- 0.01). The Pareto boundary-based spatial agreement analysis using high-resolution reference data also shows the dominant performance of DTW based agriculture map than an ED-based map. DTW performed better than ED, in terms of optimal distance (OD), in ten out of eleven districts. However, reliable spatial matching (OD less than 0.23) between DTW-based map and reference agriculture map was observed in lower elevation region, especially in Hamirpur (OD=0.06), Bilaspur (OD=0.09), Shimla (OD=0.19) and Una (OD=0.20) district.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important land surface variable for understanding the water cycle, ecosystem productivity, and linkages between water-carbon cycles. For SM studies, observations at microwave frequencies < 10 GHz are more desirable due to larger penetration depths. The NASA Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission provides global observations of SM using passive sensor at L-band. Current active C-band systems such as Sentinel 1 have shown potentialities to estimate SM and improve spatial resolution of SM data from passive sensors. In addition to the SM sensitivity, radar backscatter is highly sensitive to roughness of soil surface and scattering within the vegetation. Despite much progress in the development of backscattering models, there is still a gap in validating such models under dynamic vegetation conditions such agricultural crops. The goal of this study is to calibrate coherent and incoherent backscattering models for corn and soybean using Sentinel 1 and Radarsat-2 observations.

AB  - Although the Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) is a near identical copy of the Landsat 8/TIRS-1 instrument, an important design change to the optical system was designed to mitigate the stray light issue that plagued the TIRS-1 instrument [1, 2, 3]. This change involved the addition of several baffles strategically placed within the optical telescope to block the stray light paths that were present in the TIRS-1 design. The specific optical changes were determined by first characterizing the TIRS-1 stray light paths on-orbit and then deriving a detailed optical model that was used to determine the locations and shapes of the mitigating baffles. The stray light design changes to the TIRS-2 instrument were confirmed through the initial thermal-vacuum characterization tests. Preliminary assessments of TIRS-2 indicate that the total stray light magnitude has been drastically reduced to a total magnitude of approximately 1% or less.

AB  - We present a tool for the automatic generation of co-seismic Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) products by using space-borne SAR data. In particular, the implemented tool relies on the large availability of Sentinel-1 SAR data and on-line earthquake catalogues (e.g. USGS, INGV) to generate co-seismic Line Of Sight (LOS) interferograms and displacement maps. The processing is triggered by the occurrence of a main seismic event, according to the accessible earthquake catalogues. The tool automatically retrieves all the needed SAR acquisitions that cover a defined area across the epicentre and generates the DInSAR products that will be then openly available through the European Plate Observing System (EPOS) portal. Moreover, the possibility to implement the presented tool into the upcoming Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) will significantly reduce the product processing time, thus implying a faster product generation and delivery. Accordingly, such a tool not only will contribute to expand the use of DInSAR products in the geo science field, but also will play a key role on the support of the Civil Protection authorities during the management of seismic crisis.

AB  - We propose a full Space and Time Coherent Change Detection (ST-CCD) that takes advantage of Sentinel-1 (S1) short interferometric revisit to enhance sensitivity in detecting changes at a fine space resolution. It extends the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) used for change detection by single baseline images, to the multi-pass, multi-polarimetric stacks of S1 data. Applications are shown for damage mapping after hazards and for agriculture. A preliminary validation is performed by processing data referred to central Italy earthquake in 2016.

AB  - In this study, multi-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) data are used to constrain the ground deformation due to the August 21st, 2017, Ischia earthquake. InSAR results are the input data to infer the source model of the seismic event. C-band Sentinel-1 and X-band COSMO-SkyMed (c) InSAR results show a displacement pattern in the epicentral area, with a maximum value of similar to 3.5 cm and a dominant vertical component. Preliminary analytical and numerical models suggest that the retrieved InSAR ground displacements are due to the combination of two phenomena: the tectonic dislocation caused by the slip on the fault plane and the surficial displacement caused by the triggering of shallow landslides.

AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a major factor explaining the photosynthesis of vegetation, evapotranspiration, and energy exchange between the earth surface and atmosphere, and there have been studies on accurate and applicable LAI estimation methods. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the actual LAI data, UAV image-based vegetation index, canopy height and satellite image (Sentinel-2) LAI and to present an effective LAI estimation method using UAV. As a result, among the six vegetation indices in this study, NDRE (R2=0.496) and CIRE (R2=0.443), which contained red-edge band, showed a high correlation. The application of the canopy height model data to the vegetation index improved the explanatory power of the LAI.In addition, in the case of NDVI, the saturation problem caused by the linear relationship with LAI was addressed. In this study, it was possible to estimate high resolution LAI using UAV images. It is expected that the applicability of such data will be improved if calibration and correction steps are carried out for various vegetation and seasonal images.

AB  - This study examined the impacts of compositional factors and three-dimensional physical environments on surface temperature in the 340 apartment complexes in Seoul, Korea, using the satellite image data of Landsat8. The results indicated that compositional and three-dimensional physical elements are important factors that affect surface temperatures in apartment complex. The lower building footprint, the higher proportion of green space, and more shadows were critical factors for the lower surface temperature. In addition, natural environment such as wind speeds, slope, hillshade, and building direction showed statistically significant relationships with surface temperatures. Regarding three- dimensional variables, layout variables of apartment complex showed statistically significant relationships. In particular, apartment complexes with a closed layout were more likely to show higher surface temperatures than those with an open layout. In addition, this study found that surrounding environments of apartment complex such as built area ratio and distance to green space are strongly associated with surface temperatures. The analysis results will be helpful to develop mitigation strategies for the lower surface temperature and to improve thermal environment of residential apartment complexes.

AB  - It is always a great challenge for pure optical techniques to maintain good resolution and imaging depth at the same time. Photoacoustic imaging is an emerging technique which can overcome the limitation by pulsed light illumination and acoustic detection. Here, we report a Near Infrared Acoustic-Resolution Photoacoustic Microscopy (NIR-AR-PAM) systm with 30 MHz transducer and 1064 nm illumination which can achieve a lateral resolution of around 88 mu m and imaging depth of 9.2 mm. Compared to visible light NIR beam can penetrate deeper in biological tissue due to weaker optical attenuation. In this work, we also demonstrated the in vivo imaging capabilty of NIR-ARPAM by near infrared detection of SLN with black ink as exogenous photoacoustic contrast agent in a rodent model.

TI  - Urban Imperviousness Effects on Summer Surface Temperatures Nearby Residential Buildings in Different Urban Zones of Parma
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and unplanned urban growth is responsible for the continuous conversion of green or generally natural spaces into artificial surfaces. The high degree of imperviousness modifies the urban microclimate and no studies have quantified its influence on the surface temperature (ST) nearby residential building. This topic represents the aim of this study carried out during summer in different urban zones (densely urbanized or park/rural areas) of Parma (Northern Italy). Daytime and nighttime ASTER images, the local urban cartography and the Italian imperviousness databases were used. A reproducible/replicable framework was implemented named Building Thermal Functional Area (BTFA) useful to lead building-proxy thermal analyses by using remote sensing data. For each residential building (n = 8898), the BTFA was assessed and the correspondent ASTER-LST value (ST_BTFA) and the imperviousness density were calculated. Both daytime and nighttime ST_BTFA significantly (p < 0.001) increased when high levels of imperviousness density surrounded the residential buildings. These relationships were mostly consistent during daytime and in densely urbanized areas. ST_BTFA differences between urban and park/rural areas were higher during nighttime (above 1 degrees C) than daytime (about 0.5 degrees C). These results could help to identify urban thermal Hot-Spots that would benefit most from mitigation actions.

On the set of the images we have applied the DOS for pass from TOA (Top Of the Atmosphere) to BOA (Bottom Of the Atmosphere). After this correction we have applied the Pansharpening with the aim of improving images resolution from 30m/px to 15m/px. Therefore we have estimate NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) and temperature of the ground before and after the fire.

T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is considered important in monitoring the energy flux between the land surface and atmosphere. Due to the diversity of topography in Iran and its effect on the climate diversity, we decided to study the effect of topography on the LST variations. To this end, the LST digital data derived from the observations of the MODIS Terra and Aqua were used. The results indicated that, during the daytime, from sea level up to a height of 400 meters, the LST increased, and then the temperature decreased with increasing altitude, and up to a height of 3000 meters, there was a strong correlation between the two. LST lapse rate was more during the daytime compared with that of the night time and it was more during the winter compared with the summer. LST lapse rate showed larger variability in diurnal cycle, but its monthly patterns were similar in different aspects. The aspect had substantial effect on LST inversion elevation. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between LST and slope was strong in slopes up to 20 degrees.

TI  - Relationship between remote sensing data and field-observed interril erosion
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between different remote sensing data, derived from satellite images, and interrill soil losses obtained in the field by using a portable rainfall simulator. The study was carried out in an area of a hydrographic basin, located in Medio Paraiba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro - one of the regions most affected by water erosion in Brazil. Evaluations were performed for different vegetation indices (NDVI, Savi, EVI, and EVI2) and fraction images (FI), derived from linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA), obtained from RapidEye, Sentinel2A, and Landsat 8 OLI images. Vegetation indices are more adequate to predict soil loss than FI, highlighting EVI2, whose exponential model showed R2 of 0.74. The best prediction models are generated from the RapidEye image, which shows the highest spatial resolution among the sensors evaluated. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Toxoplasma.
T2  - Parasitic protozoa of farm animals and pets.
M3  - Book chapter
AB  - Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the protozoon Toxoplasma gondii affecting animals worldwide. T. gondii has a facultative heteroxenous life cycle with felids as definitive hosts and a wide range of mammalian and avian species as intermediate hosts. Infectious stages are oocysts present in felid feces, bradyzoites forming tissue cysts, and tachyzoites. While two major clonal lineages (type II and III) dominate clinical and natural isolates in Europe and North America, other parts of the world, like Brazil and Argentina, are dominated by non-clonal or other clonal T. gondii lineages, representing a greater genetic diversity. Different animal species show a variable degree of susceptibility to T. gondii infection and to the development of clinical signs. Humans are considered susceptible, and about one third of the human population in the world is estimated to be infected. Toxoplasmosis is an important abortive disease in small ruminants. It is mainly asymptomatic in cattle and chicken, but the latter is an epidemiological sentinel, and isolation of viable parasites from this source is frequent. Infected pigs can show reproductive failure, and, in addition, their tissues are considered, together with infected small ruminant tissues, a relevant source of human infection. Cats and dogs can show neuromuscular disease mainly associated with other immunosuppressive conditions, such as viral infections. Some species like New World monkeys, lemurs, Pallas' cats, slender-tailed meerkats, and some Australian marsupials are highly susceptible to fatal generalized toxoplasmosis. General control measures are presented, focusing on the prevention of human toxoplasmosis.

AB  - Products derived from a single multispectral sensor are hampered by a limited spatial, spectral or temporal resolutions. Image fusion in general and downscaling/blending in particular allow to combine different multiresolution datasets. We present here an optimal interpolation approach to generate smoothed and gap-free time series of Landsat reflectance data. We fuse MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) and Landsat data globally using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The optimal interpolator exploits GEE ability to ingest large amounts of data (Landsat climatologies) and uses simple linear operations that scale easily in the cloud. The approach shows very good results in practice, as tested over five sites with different vegetation types and climatic characteristics in the contiguous US.

AB  - Forest monitoring is a major issue to carry out energetic and environmental policies. Actual context in spaceborne remote sensing data is very promising. Our study aims to test the ability of SAR, optical and textural data to estimate forest parameters (biomass, height, diameter and density), and to evaluate the improvement of combining these remote sensing data. We worked on monospecific pine forest stands. The first results highlighted the synergy between SAR and spatial texture informations. Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data is very promising for the estimation of forest parameters in monospecifics stands. Biomass was estimated with 29.4% relative error (20.7 tons/ha) and height with 14.6% (2.1m) combining four SAR and optical sensors.

AB  - SAR interferograms were produced using ALOS-2 data to detect global coseismic deformations associated with large (magnitude >= 6) and shallow (depth <= 25 km) onshore earthquakes from August 2014 to December 2016. Substantially coherent interferograms were produced for all 30 targeted seismic events, even in tropical areas, where C-band Sentinel-1 interferometry is unreliable due to severe decorrelation. A high degree of coherence of the ALOS-2 InSAR also greatly helps to identify surface ruptures. In this study, surface ruptures were successfully identified in at least seven events. Moreover, left-looking observations of ALOS-2 enable the retrieval of three-dimensional coseismic deformations with high precision, including north-south components, although left-looking observations are conducted only in the onshore area of Japan. In the case of the 2016 central Tottori earthquake in Japan, a clear, four-quadrant, three-dimensional deformation pattern was retrieved, implying that almost pure sinistral slip occurred.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing and demography for more efficient and effective assessment of changing mountain forest distribution
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Species range shifts have been well studied in light of rising global temperatures and the role climate plays in restricting species distribution. In mountain regions, global trends show upward elevational shifts of altitudinal treelines. However, there is significant variation in response between geographic locations driven by climatic and habitat heterogeneity and biotic interactions. Accurate estimation of treeline shifts requires fine-scale patterns of forest structure to be discriminated across mountain ranges. Satellite remote sensing allows detailed information on forest structure to be extrapolated across mountain ranges, however, variation in methodology combined with a lack of information on accuracy and repeatability has led to high uncertainty in the utility of remotely sensed data in studies of mountain treelines. We unite three themes; suitability of remote sensing products, ecological relevance of classifications and effectiveness of the training and validation process in relation to the study of mountain treeline ecotones. We identify needs for further research comparing the utility of different remotely sensed data sets, better characterisation of treeline structure and incorporation of accuracy assessment. Collectively, the improvements we describe will significantly improve the utility of remote sensing by facilitating a more consistent approach to defining geographic variation in treeline structure, improving our ability to link processes from stand to regional scale and the accuracy of range shift assessments. Ultimately, this advance will enable better monitoring of mountain treeline shifts and estimation of the associated to biodiversity and ecosystem function.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The current progress of remote sensing systems, based on airborne and spaceborne platforms and involving active and passive sensors, provides an unprecedented wealth of information about the Earth surface for environmental monitoring, sustainable resource management, disaster prevention, emergency response, and defense. In this framework, mathematical models for image processing and analysis play fundamental roles. Effectively exploiting the potential conveyed by the availability of remote sensing data requires automatic or semi-automatic techniques capable of suitably characterizing and extracting thematic information of interest while minimizing the need for user intervention. The current development of mathematical models and methods for image processing and computer vision allows multiple remote sensing information extraction problems to be addressed successfully, accurately, and efficiently. In this introductory chapter, first, general characteristics of sensors and systems for Earth observation are summarized to define the basic terminology that will be used consistently throughout the book. Remote sensing image acquisition through passive and active sensors on-board spaceborne and airborne platforms is recalled together with the basic concepts of spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolution. Then, an overview of the main families of mathematical models and methods within the scientific field of two-dimensional remote sensing image processing is presented. The overall structure and organization of the book are also described.

AB  - The ECoLaSS project: "Evolution of Copernicus Land Services based on Sentinel data" is developing innovative methods and algorithms for next-generation prototypes of improved or novel operational Copernicus Land services from 2020 onwards. This paper introduces the ECoLaSS project and focusses on developments and first results particularly in view of a new pan-European agricultural service. Dense time series of optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) data are analyzed by means of high-volume data processing chains. Prototype crop mask and crop type maps were successfully derived for a test site in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. The agricultural prototype products are compared with the operational Copernicus High Resolution Layer (HRL) 2015 Grassland product. An outlook presents the next steps towards fit-for-purpose prototypes for pan-European roll-out.

AB  - The review discusses the ideological content of the collective monograph Art, Therapy, Health (2017). It highlights the ideas formulated by all of the co-authors, including their conceptual descriptions. The wording of the article is responsive to its aim and evolves on two intertwining levels. On the one hand, the ideas researched by every single co-author, including their context and related assumptions are briefly discussed in the text. On the other hand, the article highlights certain general connections between the contexts to which different authors subject their research. The texts that are discussed in the article represent a reflexion on both art therapy as such and related research in the neighboring fields. This definition of the field of research emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of art therapy as part of the texts represent the humanitarian disciplines that research visual culture and artistic expression. Another part of the texts is a clear representation of such fields as medical science and related applied research. The array of problems subjected to research is extremely wide. It ranges from intercultural assumptions on the proximity of therapeutic endeavors and artistic expression and goes on to topical research in the field of art therapy. Finally, the array shows the variety and efficiency of methods selected for application.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper management of watersheds is one of the most important methods for using water and soil resources. In the last few decades, accurate and timely estimates of the quantitative and qualitative runoff status are one of the major concerns of large-scale management. The aims of this research are a simulation of monthly runoff, sensitivity analysis, optimization of sensitive parameters, investigation of the effect of land use change over the last four decades on the quantity and quality of the Maroon River (southwest of Iran) at the exit point of the Maroon Watershed (Idnak) in Iran using the SWAT model. For this purpose, the semi-distributed SWAT model and the SUFI2 program were used in the SWAT CUP software package for sensitivity analysis, calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis. In this research, the map of land use change and soil mapping and vegetation cover in the Maroon watershed were first identified over the course of the four decades between 1970 and 2010, using TM and ETM satellite measurements in Landsat. Observations of the Idnak Hydrometer Station were used as the base station during 1970 to 2010 over a period of four decades. Comparison of the effects of land use management options on various components of the hydrological cycle as well as different runoff rates show that if the pessimistic scenario occurs, and with the continuation of the destructive trend in land use to the retreat, values of runoff will increase and there will be more permeability and the drainage will go down to deeper aquifers.

T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The engineering and operational features of the satellite trackers iceST/40-Glacier developed in the Marine Hydrophysical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, and produced by Marlin-Yug Ltd are considered. The trackers are developed to monitor the glaciers' movements. The glaciers' motion characteristics are calculated using the tracker coordinates measured by the satellite GPS receiver and distributed among the users due to the worldwide location and data collection system Argos-2. The satellite tracker construction is simple enough to place it on a glacier. It represents a specially developed measurement algorithm that permits, first, to apply a standard low-cost GPS receiver and, second, to define location with accuracy not exceeding 1.7 m. The measurements required to determine location are done once a week. The tracker lifetime is not less than 24 months. Statistical analysis of the long-term field experiments carried out on the Arctic archipelagos' glaciers results in drawing a conclusion that, the iceST/40-Glacier satellite trackers, being used as a basis, make creation of reliable, technological and low-cost network for regular monitoring the glaciers' movements possible and expedient. The information obtained due to such a network permits to increase navigation safety in the Arctic Ocean marginal seas and can be used for verifying remote sensing data.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this work was to detect changes in a semi-arid forest using Landsat satellite multi-temporal imagery and to circumvent the lack of data on landscape temporal changes. The differential-algebraic method (subtraction) was used on 12 remote sensing variables obtained at different fixed periods. Before applying the differentiations on remote sensing data, a geometric correction and a radiometric normalization of satellite images were carried out to allow images comparison. Differentiation of individual bands (TM4 and TM5), ratios (TM4/TM5 and TM7/TM5), indexes (NDVI and NDMI), Tasseled Cap differentiation (e.g. TCB [Brightness], TCG [Greenness] and TCW [Wetness]) and finally the differentiation of the first three ACPs (ACP1, APC2 and ACP3) were carried out in order to select the best data for the detection of changes. Many radiometric thresholds were tested (11 values) to identify which ones had the ability to determine the best changes in the different studied periods. The most significant values of global precision (GP) (greater than 72% for the four studied periods) obtained in the error matrices were those of the NDVI variable using 0.9 (=standard deviation) at the mean. This allowed the calculation of NDVI changes and the positive, negative and stable proportions for each period. The use of recent very high resolution spatial images for validation allowed us to highlight the causes of changes and the impact of silvicultural works during the period of forest management.

TI  - The Hungarian Writings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
M3  - Book Review
AB  - In the current times of political crisis, a giant thinker such as Karl Polanyi will return to the forefront of intellectual debate. Many of his important early articles have only been available in Hungarian or in German. With the publication of The Hungarian Writings (2016), edited by Gareth Dale (Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at Brunel University London), a major gap in Polanyi studies has been filled. These essays, published for the first time in English, provide a key to understanding Karl Polanyi's later works. The range of issues that are reviewed in these writings is astounding. Everything from Marxism to politics, economics and sociology is examined by the extraordinary mind of the author. Events such as the Russian revolution and the significance of Bolshevism are also explored. Lastly, a section of correspondence to such eminent intellectuals as Georg Lukacs and Istvan Meszaros gives the reader an inside look into the socialist worldview of Karl Polanyi. This book truly shines a new light on many aspects of Polanyi's critique of capitalism developed in his magnum opus, The Great Transformation (1944). Various aspects of The Hungarian Writings will be explored in depth in this critical review.

AB  - Remote sensing data can give the spatial and temporal distribution of chlorophyll-a, which is impossible with field measurements. Chlorophyll-a can be considered crucial due to the fact that it characterizes the level of eutrophication of a marine system. The major aim of this paper is to assess the chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms from satellite images using in situ estimations in the region of Southern Aegean Sea. A data set from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Service (CMES) containing in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations was used to evaluate ocean color retrieval algorithms. Images captured from the Sentinel-2 satellite were used. Methodologically, the images were atmospherically corrected, pixel clouds were removed, and the Maximum Band Ratio was calculated. Then the ocean color algorithm for the Mediterranean Sea (MedOC3) was used to calculate the chlorophyll-a concentrations. The in situ data measurements of chlorophyll-a concentrations were obtained at a depth of 20, 50, 75 and 100 m. The hypothesis for a homogenous sea was used (temperature difference of Delta T<0.2 degrees C) in order to assume that the concentration of chlorophyll-a is the same at the surface as in 20 m depth. A fourth order polynomial equation was fitted to the observed data for estimating the error of retrieval algorithm. Also, linear regression models were utilized between reflectance of a single band, logarithmically transformed band ratios of the visible spectrum and in situ concentrations of chlorophyll-a. Scatter plots, histograms and statistical indexes were calculated in order to evaluate the results. The best fit was calculated using the fourth order polynomial relationship between in situ and satellite data. On the contrary, linear regression model were not able to estimate accurately the chlorophyll-a concentration.

AB  - This narrative presents our experiences as two doctoral students employing variations of mixed methods (MM) in the dissertation research process. We, individually, describe why and when in the research process we decided to use MM for our dissertations. The research question development, writing, defense, and post-research presentations are also explored from two different perspectives. Independently, we present some of the challenges we faced in relation to unique research problems and questions that initially led to using a MM approach. Some of challenges that we discuss include the difficulty locating MM resources and viable models for MM research design in music education. We also explore the required expertise in both quantitative and qualitative knowledge and the confusion surrounding varying degrees of philosophical adherence in MM.We examine our relationship with the dissertation advisors, dissertation readers, and academic faculty. These relationships are described specifically with regard to the variability of interpretation within the methodology and how differing perceptions of worldview influence the research and writing process. We delve into the challenges inherent in these relatively new areas of pluralistic music education research and analyze issues such as: interpreting results, understanding the general approach or meaning of mixed methods research as well as the weighting of design, sequencing data collection and merging of research data. Additionally, we present some of the benefits of having employed a wider research scope through the use of this design and reveal how results of the research were better understood and, in some areas, strengthened.Finally, we compare and contrast our collective findings and offer ideas that could enhance graduate programs; most importantly, what we believe would have been helpful to know prior to engaging in MM. Suggestions and advice are provided for graduate students who are looking to employ MM.

AB  - When solving a number of remote sensing problems, there arose a need for fast satellite imagery of arbitrarily-spaced lengthy territories with complex configuration (borders, roads, rivers, coastlines, etc.), The distinctive features of Earth remote sensing satellites equipped with optical-electronic scanners providing sub-meter spatial resolution are a narrow swath width, which does not allow to take images of arbitrarily-spaced lengthy territories in one-orbit period, and a small pixel size of CCD photocells (i.e., low sensitivity), which does not allow to take images of low-contrast objects, as well as take pictures from neighbouring orbits at low angles of the Sun. An effective technique for controlling the high-resolution remote sensing spacecraft orientation in the process of retargeting (i.e., with non-zero angular velocities) is proposed, which allows to choose the best scan mode and take images of arbitrarily-spaced lengthy territories with complex configuration in one-orbit period, i.e. much faster. Moreover, non-zero angular velocities allow to increase the exposure time and take pictures of low contrast, low light or camouflaged objects. The main characteristics and disadvantages of Earth remote sensing satellites equipped with optical-electronic scanners providing sub-meter spatial resolution are shown in the article. The features of planning high-resolution satellite imagery and remote sensing data processing require consideration of a larger number of additional influencing factors than when using traditional imagery with optical-electronic scanners characterized by sub-meter spatial resolution. The main stages of modeling and planning ultra-fast satellite imaging of lengthy territories, as well as the basic design formulas are considered in the article. To approximate a lengthy object defined by the nodal points on the map, smoothing with a cubic interpolating spline is used. For short forecast periods and low earth circular orbits, sufficient accuracy is achieved with the propagator SGP4, which allows to work with the initial conditions in TLE files generated by NORAD.

AB  - In this paper we tackle the problem of data analysis on high dimensional space of hyperspectral images. The remote sensing data analysis is a complex task due to many factors such as the large spectral and spatial variability. In fact, several approaches suffer from the pixel-mixed problem since mixed pixels are often sources of uncertainty and inaccuracy. Although spectral un-mixing techniques can provide abundance fractions for each class in mixed pixels, spatial distribution of these classes remains still unknown. Sub-pixel mapping techniques provide any solutions to the above-mentioned problem. Nevertheless, most of the proposed methods treat one particular type of objects because they assume that mixed pixels in a single image are identical. Sub-pixel mapping methods employing zonal objects are based on the spatial dependence assumption; the same assumption is used for linear objects while considering objects direction. Whereas, in case of encapsulated objects no spatial correlation is applied. As a result, each type of object requires special treatment, hence, the need for object recognition at sub-pixel scales. In this paper to improve sub-pixel object recognition accuracy in coarse spatial resolution image, we develop in this paper a spectrospatial method based on a graph model, which discriminates between each type of sub-pixel object. The latter is classified into three categories: zonal, linear and small encapsulated objects based on their spatial information in neighboring pixels and their spectral information. In order to determine the suitability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments are performed with a simulated and a real hyperspectral image.

AB  - The reflective solar bands (RSB) of the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft support a variety of science applications. The RSB are primarily calibrated using regularly scheduled solar diffuser (SD) and lunar observations. As the instruments continue to operate beyond their designed life, significant degradation of the instrument gain is observed, particularly at the short wavelengths. In recent years, the onboard calibrators are insufficient in accurately characterizing the response versus scan-angle (RVS) for the RSB. Therefore, the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) has implemented an enhanced approach whereby the on-board measurements are supplemented by observations of the pseudo-invariant calibration sites in Northern Africa to better characterize the on-orbit RVS changes in Level 1B Collection 6 and Collection 6.1 for select short and near-infrared bands of both MODIS instruments. This paper explores the use of alternative Earth-scene targets to characterize the on-orbit RVS. In particular, an alternative version of the on-orbit RVS, with the desert data substituted with the measurements from deep convective clouds (DCC), has been formulated and implemented. Results from this version are compared with the operational C6.1 algorithm. The long-term reflectance trends from the Dome Concordia (Dome C) site in Antarctica are derived using both versions and evaluated for long-term stability for independent assessments. Due to the Earth-scene saturation from the high-gain bands, the paper only focusses on the comparisons for bands 1, 3 and 4 of both MODIS instruments. This study finds that DCC can be used as alternative invariant ground targets in MODIS RVS characterization for these bands.

CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite has operated successfully since its launch in October, 2011. The calibration using regular solar diffuser (SD) observations for the 14 reflective solar bands facilitates the generation of high-quality calibrated products, known as sensor data records (SDR). As SNPP VIIRS nears six years on-orbit, monitoring the on-orbit calibration performance using multiple techniques is vital. One such technique, using the deep convective clouds (DCC), has been widely used to monitor the on-orbit calibration performance of earth observing sensors, such as the MODIS instrument on Terra and Aqua spacecrafts. In this study, the DCC technique is utilized to evaluate the stability of SNPP VIIRS SDR reflectance product for 10 moderate resolution bands (M-bands, M1-M5 and M7-M11) and three imaging bands (I-bands, I1-I3). An empirical Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) correction for the long-term reflectance measurements over DCC is formulated and implemented. The fluctuation in the long-term trending is analyzed to evaluate the uncertainties The BRDF-corrected reflectances over DCC are used to evaluate the stability of the response versus scan-angle (RVS) and its effects in the SDR products. The RVS effects are analyzed based on the difference in mode reflectances over DCC among six different frame zones. Results indicate that the RVS effects should be monitored for an improved VIIRS RSB calibration in the future.

T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The article deals with the consideration of certain types of value models of human creation from the standpoint of philosophical anthropology and social philosophy. It is about certain models that fulfill the worldview-semantic modes of a person. Theoretical basis. The authors cover (O. Polishchuk - Thesis I; V. Mudrakov - Thesis II) peculiarities of such models in the process of creation of "the new types of a person". The process of reformatting these types and its means are studied. The process of valuing metamorphoses of Ukrainians is taken as an example The research is limited to the Soviet period and the period of independence, which is reflected respectively in Thesis I - The Phenomenon of Homo Sovieticus and Thesis II - A Person in the Situation of Post-Homo Sovieticus. The emphasis is on the peculiarities of the value matrix of these types and their ideological potential. Originality is in the disclosure of anthropological models that correspond to the value functionality, that is, the determination and expression of the essence of a person. It is shown that certain projects, under the conditions of forced reformatting, by their value reduction are classified as inhuman. They are based on the narrative of ideological myth and deprived of the projection of the complete development of a personality. The proposed approach allows to revise the current trends of such projections and, most importantly, to predict their value potentials in the dynamics of the transformational progress of the essence of the modern Ukrainian. Conclusions. The essay reflects the process of transformation of the worldview-semantic modes, which are represented by two situations-products - the Soviet person and the contemporary. The first type is formed by the mythology of political ideology. This person is deprived of himself or herself. Their collective identity is brought up by the anthropological effect of violence and fear. The second type is very similar. This person finds himself or herself in the situation of value disorientation, nostalgic impulses and instrumental thinking. Their task is to move towards the "monad personality". This is possible by means of formation of the "own philosophy", "inherent teleology of a breakthrough", as well as by taking into account the problem of consolidation and radicalism of external factor.

TI  - Looking for a White Male Effect in Generation Z: Race, Gender, and Political Effects on Environmental Concern and Ambivalence
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The White male effect has been presented in past literature as a way to explain the tendency for White males to have lower environmental concern and risk perceptions than female and non-White individuals. Recently, research has proposed the White male effect may be a conservative White male effect, due to findings that political ideology impacts environmental concern. This study used a sample of young college-educated adults from Generation Z to test whether the conservative White male effect is present for environmental concern and ambivalence toward a proenvironmental worldview in this younger generation. Online surveys were distributed to undergraduate students at a large northeastern university in spring of 2016. A total of 1,940 surveys were returned. Results showed a lack of a unique White male, or conservative White male, effect above and beyond differences explained by gender, Whiteness, and political affiliation. The implications of this effect's absence are discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation through biomass and carbon storage. Due to rising concern towards global climate change and carbon sequestration, a practical method to estimate the forest biomass and carbon stocks is necessary. Therefore, this study attempted to quantify aboveground biomass (AGB) within the mangrove ecosystem in Malaysia. A total of 150 sample plots at Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve were established in 2014. This study estimated and mapped the AGB based on Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) satellite image. Four types of vegetation index were examined in this study. Simple and multilinear regression methods were employed which correlated field data with the derived vegetation indices for the estimation of AGB in the entire study area. Results demonstrated that the multilinear regression method improved the accuracy of estimation. Estimated AGB ranged between 33.65 and 437.46 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 133.97 Mg ha(-1). Total AGB for the entire study area was approximately 1.30 million Mg. Error of estimation largely occurred when AGB exceeded 300 Mg ha(-1). The study showed that multilinear technique was reliable for the estimation of AGB in mangrove forests based on the SPOT-5 image.

TI  - Activation of preexisting transverse structures in an evolving magmatic rift in East Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inherited crustal weaknesses have long been recognized as important factors in strain localization and basin development in the East African Rift System (EARS). However, the timing and kinematics (e.g., sense of slip) of transverse (rift-oblique) faults that exploit these weaknesses are debated, and thus the roles of inherited weaknesses at different stages of rift basin evolution are often overlooked. The mechanics of transverse faulting were addressed through an analysis of the Kordjya fault of the Magadi basin (Kenya Rift). Fault kinematics were investigated from field and remote-sensing data collected on fault and joint systems. Our analysis indicates that the Kordjya fault consists of a complex system of predominantly NNE-striking, rift-parallel fault segments that collectively form a NNW-trending array of en echelon faults. The transverse Kordjya fault therefore reactivated existing rift-parallel faults in similar to 1 Ma lavas as oblique-normal faults with a component of sinistral shear. In all, these fault motions accommodate dip-slip on an underlying transverse structure that exploits the Aswa basement shear zone. This study shows that transverse faults may be activated through a complex interplay among magma assisted strain localization, preexisting structures, and local stress rotations. Rather than forming during rift initiation, transverse structures can develop after the establishment of pervasive rift-parallel fault systems, and may exhibit dip-slip kinematics when activated from local stress rotations. The Kordjya fault is shown here to form a kinematic linkage that transfers strain to a newly developing center of concentrated magmatism and normal faulting. It is concluded that recently activated transverse faults not only reveal the effects of inherited basement weaknesses on fault development, but also provide important dues regarding developing magmatic and tectonic systems as young continental rift basins evolve.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel surveillance for diarrhoea is important to monitor changes in rotavirus epidemiological trends and circulating genotypes among children under 5 years before and after vaccine introduction. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care introduced rotavirus vaccine in national immunization program in May 2014.METHODS: Active hospital-based surveillance for diarrhoea was conducted at 3 sentinel sites from 2008 to 2016. Children aged less than 5 years, who presented with acute gastroenteritis as a primary illness and who were admitted to a hospital ward or treated at the emergency unit, were enrolled and had a stool specimen collected and tested for rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Genotyping of positive stools was performed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and genotyping assays. Pre-vaccine introduction, 10% of all positive stool specimens were genotyped and all adequate positive stools were genotyped post-vaccine introduction.RESULTS: During the pre-vaccine period, a total of 6491 acute gastroenteritis stools were collected, of which 3016 (46%) tested positive for rotavirus and 312 (10%) of the rotavirus positive stools were genotyped. During the post-vaccine period, a total of 3750 acute gastroenteritis stools were collected, of which 937 (25%) tested positive for rotavirus and 784 (84%) were genotyped. During the pre-vaccine introduction the most frequent genotype was G9P[8] (21%) followed by G2P[4] (12%), G1P[8] (6%), G2P[6] (5%), G12P[6] (4%), G9P[6] (3%) and G8P[4] (3%). G1P[8] (30%) was most dominant two years after vaccine introduction followed by G9P[6] (20%), G2P[4] (15%), G9P[8] (11%) and G1P[6] (4%).CONCLUSION: The decline in positivity rate is an indication of early vaccine impact. Diversity of circulating strains underscores the importance of continued monitoring and strain surveillance after vaccine introduction.

AB  - Surface mining causes drastic land cover and land use changes and it has huge ecological, and environmental impacts. Restoration, reclamation, classification, and monitoring of surface mining region have several research aspects. In classification of surface mining, water bodies in mining regions are detected along with water bodies in non mining areas using various spectral information of satellite imagery. Water bodies in mining region have distinct characteristic. Detection of these distinct characteristics, and separation of mine, and non mine water body areas are the motivation of this paper. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a widely practiced water detection technique which is used here. Detection of water bodies from NDWI may falsely detect few bare soil regions. Hence, in this work, bare soil regions are detected by Bare soil Index (BI) and further removed from the water map. The modified water map is analyzed by connected component computation and further mine, and non mine water bodies are separated by using the concept of clay mineral ratio.

TI  - Implementation of a standardized handoff protocol for post-operative admissions to the surgical intensive care unit
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The transfer of critically ill patients from the operating room (OR) to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) involves handoffs between multiple providers. Incomplete handoffs lead to poor communication, a major contributor to sentinel events. Our aim was to determine whether handoff standardization led to improvements in caregiver involvement and communication.Methods: A prospective intervention study was designed to observe thirty one patient handoffs from OR to SICU for 49 critical parameters including caregiver presence, peri-operative details, and time required to complete key steps. Following a six month implementation period, thirty one handoffs were observed to determine improvement.Results: A significant improvement in presence of physician providers including intensivists and surgeons was observed (p = 0.0004 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Critical details were communicated more consistently, including procedure performed (p = 0.0048), complications (p < 0.0001), difficult airways (p < 0.0001), ventilator settings (p < 0.0001) and pressor requirements (p = 0.0134). Conversely, handoff duration did not increase significantly (p = 0.22).Conclusions: Implementation of a standardized protocol for handoffs between OR and SICU significantly improved caregiver involvement and reduced information omission without affecting provider time commitment.

AB  - The phenomena of atmospheric changes due to urbanisation are increasing in big cities worldwide, one of the most prominent of which is the appearance of urban heat islands. Remote sensing based on satellites and sensors sensitive to different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum has enabled new and easier ways of monitoring urban heat islands. This paper describes a procedure for determining the temperature of the Sarajevo area based on Landsat satellite images. In addition to measuring urban heat islands, more detailed analyses of the zones were carried out, profiles have been made through characteristic surfaces, and finally, comparisons with the air temperatures of the weather stations were done. The paper offers basic guidelines for calculating the phenomenon of urban heat islands and represents the basis for further studies of the urban heat island in the Sarajevo area.

AB  - Classification of crop types from multi-temporal SAR data is a complex task because of the need to extract spatial and temporal features from images affected by speckle. Previous methods applied speckle filtering and then classification in two separate processing steps. This paper introduces fully convolutional networks (FCN) for pixel-wise classification of crops from multi-temporal SAR data. It applies speckle filtering and classification in a single framework. Furthermore, it also uses dilated kernels to increase the capability to learn long distance spatial dependencies. The proposed FCN was compared with patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The proposed method performed better when compared with the patch-based CNN and SVM.

TI  - Can chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in meso-oligotrophic shallow waters be estimated using statistical approaches and empirical models from MODIS imagery?
T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in inland waters through remote-sensing techniques is complicated by local differences in the optical properties of water. In this study, we applied multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) and four models (Appel, Kahru, FAI and O14a) to estimate the Chl-a concentration from combinations of spectral bands from the MODIS sensor. The MLR, NPMR and ANN models were calibrated and validated using in-situ Chl-a measurements. The results showed that a simple and efficient model, developed and validated through multiple linear regression analysis, offered advantages (i.e., better performance and fewer input variables) in comparison with ANN, NPMR and four models (Appel, Kahru, FAI and O14a). In addition, we observed that in a large shallow subtropical lake, where the wind and hydrodynamics are essential factors in the spatial heterogeneity (Chl-a distribution), the MLR model adjusted using the specific point dataset, performed better than using the total dataset, which suggest that would not be appropriate to generalize a single model to estimate Chl-a in these large shallow lakes from total datasets. Our approach is a useful tool to estimate Chl-a concentration in meso-oligotrophic shallow waters and corroborates the spatial heterogeneity in these ecosystems.

TI  - The Inner-Core Temperature Structure of Hurricane Edouard (2014): Observations and Ensemble Variability
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The inner-core thermodynamic structure of Hurricane Edouard (2014) is explored, primarily through an examination of both high-altitude dropsondes deployed during NASA'sHurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) and a 60-member convection-permitting ensemble initialized with an ensemble Kalman filter. The 7-day forecasts are initialized coincident with Edouard's tropical depression designation and includeEdouard's significant intensification to a major hurricane. Ten-member ensemble groups are created based on timing of near-rapid intensification (RI) onset, and the associated composite inner-core temperature structures are analyzed. It is found that at Edouard's peak intensity, in both the observations and the simulations, the maximuminner-core perturbation temperature (similar to 10-12 K) occurs in themidlevels (similar to 4-8 km). In addition, in all composite groups that significantly intensify, the evolution of the area-averaged inner-core perturbation temperatures indicate that weak to moderate warming (at most 4K) begins to occur in the low tomidlevels (similar to 2-6 km) similar to 24-48 h prior to RI, and this warming significantly strengthens and deepens (up to similar to 8km) similar to 24 h after RI has begun. Despite broad similarities in the evolution of Edouard's warm core in these composites, variability in the height and strength of the maximum perturbation temperature and in the overall development of the inner-core temperature structure are present among the members of the composite groups (despite similar intensity time series). This result and concomitant correlation analyses suggest that the strength and height of the maximum perturbation temperature is not a significant causal factor for RI onset in this ensemble. Fluctuations in inner-core temperature structure occur either in tandem with or after significant intensity changes.

AB  - Image segmentation is useful for mapping vegetation communities since it aggregates pixels into homogenous zones. Multiresolution segmentation, a bottom-up multi-scale segmentation algorithm, is one of the most widely used and successful algorithms. The algorithm requires image band weights, scale parameter, shape, and compactness values to be specified prior to segmentation. The persistent challenge is how to identify these values, which are often determined by trial and error experimentation. This paper aimed at determining pre-segmentation image analyses that can inform the specification of the multiresolution segmentation parameter values, in order to optimise mapping of savannah vegetation community boundaries on high spatial resolution images. The vegetation boundaries in the 56 land types of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, were targeted for segmentation. Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery acquired during the peak vegetation vigour period was used. The high (10m) spatial resolution green, red, and near-infrared bands were selected for use. The KNP's large size required a mosaic of successively acquired image frames. Multiresolution segmentation was performed using eCognition Developer 9. Pre-segmentation principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that none of the bands had superior data dimensionality. Therefore, equal band weights of 1 were specified. The original 16-bit top-of-atmosphere reflectance data showed that the vegetation communities had high within-community variance. Texture enhancement of the reflectance data using 3x3 kernel variance showed that the vegetation communities were more distinguishable by texture than the untransformed reflectance data. A heterogeneity-based scale parameter value of 388, and a high shape (texture') value of 0.9 at the expense of the reflectance (colour') value of 0.1, were specified. The scale parameter value was determined by averaging object coefficient of variation values on the texture image bands. Pre-segmentation fieldwork revealed transitional vegetation boundaries, necessitating the low compactness value of 0.1 (i.e. high smoothness value of 0.9). From the segmented objects, samples per respective vegetation community were specified for k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classification (k=1). All of the 100 land type polygons were subsequently delineated, with overall mapping accuracy of 86.2%. Fuzzy membership of border objects successfully reproduced the transitional vegetation boundaries. The successful delineation of the savannah vegetation communities indicated that pre-segmentation PCA and analysis of potential objects' variance-based texture can provide guidance on parameter values to specify for the inherently iterative multiresolution segmentation.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop novel RS methods for studying HM pollution of crops typical of small land plots in mountainous regions. For that purpose during the acquisition of a SPOT7 high resolution multispectral satellite image, synchronous sampling was done of non-edible parts (leaves) of agricultural crops growing in town of Kajaran (Armenia) and its surroundings. A total of 38 samples were collected: 15-potato and 23 -beans. As a result a database has been produced for Mo, Cu, Ni, Cd contents in non-edible parts of crops. Then raw, normalized values of spectral reflectance and vegetation indices of the SPOT7 image were correlated with absolute contents of HM. The pre-analysis of the determined correlation links shows the existence of direct and inverse correlations. The derived correlations are significant at 0.05, 0.01 levels that allows to develop a RS methods for assessment and monitoring.

T2  - LAND SURFACE AND CRYOSPHERE REMOTE SENSING IV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Land Surface and Cryosphere Remote Sensing IV
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - The characteristics of this GPP estimation method correspond to the photosynthesis process. The photosynthetic rate varies from it's capacity by weather conditions, where depression thereof is controlled by stomatal opening and closing. In this study, we used flux data from a dry area and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) surface temperature products to define a canopy conductance index. First, we studied the contribution ratios of elements of canopy conductance using the big-leaf model with diurnal change flux data averaged over 8 days. Next, the correlations of meteorological and flux elements with surface temperature data from MODIS were studied. The largest contributor to the denominator of canopy conductance was found to be vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and that of the numerator was evapotranspiration. During the period around noon, evapotranspiration did not change dramatically and the canopy conductance index was estimated as the slope of 1/VPD, which changes over time. In the dry area, the surface temperatures around 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. were strongly correlated with VPD at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., respectively. For dry areas, therefore, the slope of 1/VPD can be estimated using surface temperature data from satellite sensors.

AB  - The increasing use of satellite faraway sensing for civilian use has proved to be the most cost effective means of mapping and monitoring environmental changes. From this point, these new tools are now essential in monitoring operations for vegetation and non-renewable resources, especially in developing countries. Data can be gotten as frequently as required to deliver information for determination of quantitative and qualitative changes in terrain. In reaching the aim of studying the forest composition and the vegetation dynamics during the time using satelitar imagery a k-means algorithm of chromatic analysis is proposed. In this way, by using comparisons between chronologically ordered records, could be described the vegetation changes and its developments in a given area. The exposed method in the present work suggests the joining two successive phases: the first step were used resolution suitable satellite images in order to succeed in building a model. The study was conducted between 1990 and 2017 by using LANDSAT data set. In the second phase, are applied chromatic investigation algorithm in order to succeed in reaching a map of vegetation composition. The case study is that of Independenta Forest from Galati County. For discussion are presented three cases of September 2011, 2016 and 2017 Preliminary results on the composition evaluations are promising and the research is ongoing.

AB  - We propose a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that makes use of image fusion to efficiently cluster remote sensing data. Exploiting nonlinear structures in multimodal data, we devise a clustering algorithm based on a random walk in a fused feature space. Constructing the random walk on the fused space enforces that pixels are considered close only if they are close in both sensing modalities. The structure learned by this random walk is combined with density estimation to label all pixels. Spatial information may also be used to regularize the resulting clusterings. We compare the proposed method with several spectral methods for image fusion on both synthetic and real data.

TI  - Color and temperature of the crater lakes at Kelimutu volcano through time
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the color and temperature of three volcanic crater lakes that co-exist at Kelimutu volcano (Indonesia) using similar to 30 years of Landsat data. These satellite data were obtained through Google Earth Engine. Time series of surface reflectance (visible wavelengths) and brightness temperature above background (thermal infrared wavelengths) were calculated. Color was defined in the RGB (red-green-blue) and HSV (hue-saturation-value) color spaces, and we introduce a visualization concept called "hue stretch" to consistently represent hue through time. These parameters display long-term trends, seasonal cycles and short duration bursts of activity at the lakes. We demonstrate that the color of the lakes are related over a period of months to years and discovered a previously unreported but significant episode around 1997, which included large agglomerations of floating elemental sulfur. Globally speaking, these techniques could reveal trends at any of the similar to 100 crater lakes on active volcanoes. Furthermore, they could apply to any target whose color changes through time (e.g., forests, crops, and non-volcanic water bodies). We have open-sourced the code necessary to perform these analyses.

TI  - Physiology Is Destiny: The Fate of Eugenic Utopia in the Fiction of H. P. Lovecraft and Olaf Stapledon
T2  - UTOPIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lovecraft and Stapledon imagined alien societies as utopias whose order and destiny derive from their citizens' eugenically altered physiologies. Stapledon's focus on eugenics as a means for achieving utopia during the interwar period is well known, but Lovecraft's worldview is generally understood to be dysgenic and dystopian in its obsession with racial and cultural degeneration. Lovecraft's fullest depiction of an alien civilization, the Old Ones in At the Mountains of Madness, relies upon a eugenic prehistory that is never explicitly narrated. The Old Ones' implicitly eugenic origin accounts for the utopian features of their society but also foreshadows their fall to their genetically engineered slave species, the shoggoths, which supplant their creators through their superior adaptability. The failure of the Old Ones' eugenics of homogeneity contrasts with the triumph of the eugenic project of diversification pursued by the Symbiotic civilization, which leads the cosmos to utopia in Stapledon's Star Maker.

AB  - Due to the large number of total population and its high population growth, food needs become the most important issue in Indonesia. This study aims to (1) map the agro-ecosystem zones based on the analysis of remote sensing images; (2) estimate the food production (rice and cassava); and (3) analyze the food security in the study area based on the mapping of the agro-ecosystem zones. Gunung Kidul Regency was selected as the study area because it is one of areas with food insecurity in D. I. Yogyakarta. This research used Landsat 8 OLI recorded on 14 April 2014 and 27 June 2013 and assisted by other spatial data such as the RBI map, soil map and slope map using Geographic Information System (GIS). The data of population statistics was also used to calculate the amount of food needs in the study area. Field survey was conducted to determine the productivity of the land in each agroecosystem zone, and to test the accuracy of the results of remote sensing images processing. The results of this study are: (1) Gunung Kidul Regency can be divided into seven agroecosystem zones, each of which has a different productivity for rice and cassava; (2) Gunung Kidul Regency is included in areas experiencing food insecurity when only taking into account the production of rice, with a shortage of 13,134.05 t; and (3) If the production of rice and cassava are taken into account, Gunung Kidul Regency is not categorized as food-insecure areas because it has a food surplus of 435,192.20 t.

AB  - With the recent launch of Sentinel-1 constellations and frequent availability of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at no cost, there is an opportunity to monitor crops on regular basis, which is still not explored. Therefore, in this paper an approach has been proposed to monitor sugarcane harvest status using time series Sentinel-1 data. The proposed approach uses knowledge based classification and temporal profile for obtaining harvest status of crops. The approach is able to identify harvested and non-harvested sugarcane areas from other crops with an overall accuracy of 82.17%.

AB  - This study sought to determine the impact of urban growth on future micro-climate of Harare by predicting future distribution of land use and land cover (LULC), as well as land surface temperature. Landsat series data was used to map Land Use and Land Cover and land surface temperature distribution during the month of October for the year 1984, 1993, 2001 and 2015. The Cellular Automata Markov Chain analysis was used to determine long term landscape transformation at 10-year time steps from 2015 to 2045. The value of a range of vegetation and non-vegetation indices to predict land surface temperature were also tested. Results show that the Urban Index (UI), a non-vegetation index was the best predictor of surface temperature (R=0.9831). Based on 1984 and 2015 changes, results showed that high density built-up areas will increase monotonically from 470.02 in 2015 to 490.36km(2) in 2045, while green spaces would decrease from 57.42 to 27.85km(2) during the same period. Using UI as predictor of land surface temperature, the 18-28 degrees C class will decrease in coverage between 2015 and 2040, while the 36-45 degrees C category will increase in proportion covered from 42.5 to 58% of city. We concluded that continued urban growth will increase warming and result in higher future temperatures.

TI  - Determining extreme heat vulnerability of Harare Metropolitan City using multispectral remote sensing and socio-economic data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Urbanisation alters surface landscape characteristics through conversion of natural landscapes to impervious surfaces. Such changes alter the thermal properties of urban landscape mosaics, increasing the urban heat island intensity and the population's vulnerability to heat-related stress. This study aimed at deriving detailed area-specific spatial information on the distribution of heat vulnerability in Harare city, Zimbabwe, valuable for informed urban thermal mitigation, planning and decision-making. Using Landsat-8-derived bio-physical surface properties and socio-demographic factors, findings show that vulnerability to heat-related distress was high in over 40 percent of the city, mainly in densely built-up areas with low-income groups. Comparatively, low to moderate heat vulnerability was observed in the high-income northern suburbs with low physical exposure and population density. Results also showed a strong spatial correlation (=0.61) between heat vulnerability and observed surface temperatures in the hot season, signifying that land surface temperature is a good indicator of heat vulnerability in the area. Furthermore, the study showed that indices derived from moderate-resolution Landsat 8 data improve thermal risk assessment in areas of close proximity. These findings demonstrate the value of readily available multispectral data-sets in determining areas vulnerable to temperature extremes within a heterogeneous urban landscape. The findings are particularly valuable for designing heat-mitigation strategies as well as identifying highly vulnerable areas during heat waves.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the impact of seasonal land cover changes on human thermal comfort outdoors in Harare, Zimbabwe in Southern Africa. Multi-temporal thermal infrared and in situ air temperature data were used to develop simple linear regression model for retrieving air temperature from land surface temperature (r(2)=0.6897). Season specific simple linear regression models for deriving relative humidity from land surface temperature were also developed (r(2) greater than 0.78). When tested against in situ observations, the LST-based approach retrieved DI with high accuracy for each sub-season (mean percentage error less than 20%). The findings showed that vegetation fraction was higher (0.60) in the most comfortable post-rainy season than in the most thermally uncomfortable season (0.43), hot season. Outdoor thermal discomfort was high in hot season (mean DI of 31 degrees C), while the post-rainy season was the most thermally comfortable (mean DI of 19.9 degrees C). During the hot season, thermal discomfort was higher in densely built-up areas (DI greater than 27 degrees C) than in the northern areas where low-density residential areas, forests and most well maintained parks are located (DI less than 27 degrees C). It was concluded that Landsat 8 data detects seasonal land use/cover and thermal discomfort changes with high accuracy.

AB  - Tropospheric ozone is known as surface ozone and caused several health impact. The objective of this study was to analysis spatial distribution of tropospheric ozone over Indonesia case study forest fire event in 2015. Monthly observation measured by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) have been analysed from January - December 2015 to study spatial distribution of tropospheric ozone related to forest fire event 2015. The study discovered high level of tropospheric column ozone (TCO) from October to November 2015. The result shows increasing average of TCO from September to October almost 6 DU. Meanwhile, monthly number of hotspot is higher in September 2015 with total number 257 hotspot which is acquired by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Terra version 6.1 with confidence level same or more than 90%. The hotspot distribution compared with spatial TCO distribution and shows interesting time lag with respect to hotspot distribution, one month. Further study for daily comparison of TCO and forest fire event needed. This result suggested that the tropospheric ozone over the Indonesian region increases in 2015 were remarkable and corresponded to forest fire event.

AB  - Grass that follows a C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathway represents a fundamental component of grass species functional type, with outstanding services in grassland ecosystems. These grasses differ in morphology, phenology and physiological features, over time, due to varying environmental requirements. These features determine the success of their discrimination using remotely sensed data and their response in Aboveground Biomass (AGB) over time. For decades, the lack of appropriate remote sensing data sources compromised C3 and C4 grasses monitoring over space and time. This has resulted in uncertainties in understanding their potential and contribution to the provision of services. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal period to discriminate C3 and C4 grass species. The study additionally estimated species AGB over space and time. This was achieved, using Sentinel 2 satellite data with Discriminant Analysis (DA) and sparse partial least squares regression (SPLSR) algorithms. The winter peak was shown to present the best temporal window for discriminating C3 and C4 grasses. This period was also associated with higher species AGB ( 1.11kg/m2) for both species as they have reached their peak. Although summer period was associated with reasonably high classification accuracies, highest errors ( 20%) were encountered and this period had higher AGB, as both species were in their early stages of growth. The discrimination of C3 and C4 and AGB variations were significantly (a = 0.05) contributed by red edge, NIR and SWIR portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. These variables managed to capture species phenological, physiological and morphological contrasts as well as spatial variations over time.

AB  - In this paper, the results of radiothermal and radar remote sensing of several Arctic tundra test sites were investigated to establish the dependences of the reflectivity and backscattering coefficient on soil temperature. The brightness temperature and backscattering coefficient were measured by a SMAP radiometer (1.4GHz) and Sentinel-1 radar (5.4GHz) over areas near to Franklin Bluffs weather station in the North Slope of Alaska and Isachsen weather station on Ellef Ringnes Island respectively. It has been experimentally and theoretically shown that between the surface soil temperature measured by weather stations in the period 2015-2016 and the reflectivity or backscattering coefficient there is a strong correlation relationship no worse than 0.68. In addition, in the range of soil surface temperature changes from -30 degrees C to 0 degrees C, the variations in the backscattering coefficient and reflectivity are about 4 dB for both test sites. This study contributes to further understanding the processes of microwave emission and scattering of frozen Arctic soils that is pertinent to developing new remote sensing algorithms for the permafrost region.

M3  - Article
AB  - The language of learning and teaching (LoLT) poses a threat to the quality of teaching and learning of most learners who speak African languages in Africa and particularly in South Africa. In this study, I explore language attitudes and the lived experiences of 400 Grade Four teachers in Pinetown and UMgungundlovu districts teaching African learners using English as LoLT. The study challenges Anglonormative language ideologies (Mckinney, Carrim, Layton, & Marshall, 2015) and the coloniality of dominant discourses about LoLT in South Africa. Calling on the voices of the teachers, I argue for the use of African languages to teach African learners as a powerful measure to regain African identity and to delink education from Eurocentric knowledge and cultures. I compared results from quantitative and qualitative data to arrive at the overall finding that most Grade Four teacher participants prefer the use of African languages to teach African learners and that these teachers are experiencing difficulty in using English as LoLT to teach most of them. Drawing from teachers' responses, I conclude that the use of African languages in education connects learners' worldviews and ways of knowing to the curriculum and provides access to knowledge.

TI  - Estimating Live Fuel Moisture from MODIS Satellite Data for Wildfire Danger Assessment in Southern California USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the research reported here is to assess the capability of satellite vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard both Terra and Aqua satellites, in order to replicate live fuel moisture content of Southern California chaparral ecosystems. We compared seasonal and interannual characteristics of in-situ live fuel moisture with satellite vegetation indices that were averaged over different radial extents around each live fuel moisture observation site. The highest correlations are found using the Aqua Enhanced Vegetation Index for a radius of 10 km, independently verifying the validity of in-situ live fuel moisture measurements over a large extent around each in-situ site. With this optimally averaged Enhanced Vegetation Index, we developed an empirical model function of live fuel moisture. Trends in the wet-to-dry phase of vegetation are well captured by the empirical model function on interannual time-scales, indicating a promising method to monitor fire danger levels by combining satellite, in-situ, and model results during the transition before active fire seasons. An example map of Enhanced Vegetation Index-derived live fuel moisture for the Colby Fire shows a complex spatial pattern of significant live fuel moisture reduction along an extensive wildland-urban interface, and illustrates a key advantage in using satellites across the large extent of wildland areas in Southern California.

AB  - This paper examines the educational philosophy, curriculum, and teaching and learning principles of the Equinox Holistic Alternative School (EHAS) in Toronto based on the ideology and philosophy of holistic education and holistic education referred to as alternative education in the 21st century. In view of educational purpose, contents of education, methods of education, and evaluation of educational evaluation, we try to reconceptualize it as our previous education by introducing acceptable contents of education. It is necessary for us to look at the process of education: the purpose of education, contents of education, method of education, evaluation of education, and the core of these four areas. Holistic education is based on the balance, inclusion, and connection. Everything that exists is ecologically connected to each other on a deep and broad level. An individual's life and well-being are his inner world And the practice of fulfilling responsibility for the linkage consciousness and the linking consciousness with the living biodiversity surrounding myself. The problem of the educational purpose of our education is that the teachers, parents, and students are trend - oriented, unlike human education which is recorded in codified documents. The purpose of education has a great influence on the contents of education, methods of education and evaluation of education. EHAS formally teaches and educates the relationship between the curriculum and teaching and learning principles from the perspective of holistic education. In this paper, the re-conceptualization of the holistic education shows that the merits of holistic education and EHAS education can be applied to the reality of our education. It is the theoretical of our education to nurture 21st century talent It is intended to develop and promote.

AB  - Indonesian waters containing many small islands and shallow waters leads to a less accurate of sea surface height (SSH) estimation from satellite altimetry. Little efforts are also given for the validation of SSH estimation from the satellite in Indonesian waters. The purpose of this research was to identify and retrack waveforms of Jason-2 altimeter satellite data in southern Java island waters and Java Sea using several retrackers and performed improvement percentage analyses for new SSH estimation. The study used data of the Sensor Geophysical Data Record type D (SGDR-D) of Jason-2 satellite altimeter of the year 2010 in the southern Java island waters and 2012-2014 in Java Sea. Waveform retracking analyses were conducted using several retrackers (Offset Center of Gravity, Ice, Threshold, and Improved Threshold) and examined using a world reference undulation geoid of EGM08 and Oceanic retracker. Result showed that shape and pattern of waveforms were varied in all passes, seasons, and locations specifically along the coastal regions. In general, non-Brownish and complex waveforms were identified along coastal region specifically within the distance of 0-10 km from the shoreline. In contrary, generally Brownish waveforms were found in offshore. However, Brownish waveform can also be found within coastal region and non-Brownish waveforms within offshore region. The results were also showed that the four retrackers produced a better SSH estimation in coastal region. However, there was no dominant retracker to improve the accuracy of the SSH estimate.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of empirical research on ethnopsychological groups of people living in different regions of Ukraine in the context of intercultural ideological systems. In particular, residents of Ukraine and foreign students from Africa and Middle East, which study at Sumy State University, were invited to share their impressions from the listened dumas, performed by Canadian bandurist Victor Mishalow during his concert tour in Ukraine. They also watched and listened to video recordings of such folk dumas as "Cossack Golota", "Marusya Boguslavka" performed by kobzar Mykola Budnyk and bandura player Fedir Zharko. Students analyzed the characters' images, expressed their understanding and attitude to characters' actions and compared them with the national heroes of their own countries.The national peculiarities of the worldview of Ukrainians, representatives of Africa and the Middle East expressed in their language are defined. The language itself is the core of people's psyche, way of thinking, and identity of ethnic group's moral and ethical norms of life. The analysis of folk art helps to emphasize the peculiarity of foreign students' perception of words, rhythm, music, and the symbolic system of folk poetic works. Author notes that the psychological of figurative system of Ukrainian dumas and folk songs of the mentioned peoples has a purely national color: it is a category of national outlook and at the same time is a artistic and aesthetic category.The solution of these problems forms an understanding of the specific of national characters and the national world in folk poetic works of the peoples of Africa, the Middle East and Ukrainian folk dumas, which is the main purpose of the study and its novelty, because such typological comparisons are investigated for the first time.These experimental studies, the development of the ideas of dumas studies and studies on a national character, the peculiarities of a national world perception, world outlook and world expression have substantiated the need for a deeper study of Ukrainian dumas' role in the formation of the national personality during intercultural communication.

AB  - Cross-calibration between sensors is necessary to bring measurements to a common radiometric scale; it allows a more complete monitoring of land surface processes and enhances data continuity and harmonization. However, differences in the Relative Spectral Response (RSR) of sensors generate uncertainties in the process [1]. For this reason, compensating for these differences is of great importance and can be achieved by using a spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF), which establishes a relationship between two spectrally adjusted bands. Nonetheless, this relationship has been shown to depend greatly on the surface type [2] and therefore needs to be corrected. In this work, we compute the SBAF between the historical Landsat and Sentinel 2 sensors by using the RSRs of different passive optical sensors in the Green, Red and NIR bands and the surface reflectance spectral libraries (ASTER, AVIRIS, IGCP) with a wide variety of classes. We produce a quadratic fit of the SBAF vs the surface's NDVI (rho(nir) - rho(red))/(rho(nir) + rho(red)) and propose an exponential correction equation dependent on the NDVI value for both bands. A comparison between Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images using the HLS product shows that this method improves the red band and NDVI accuracy by 46.4% and 63.9% respectively when the difference between the Relative Spectral Responses (RSR) is significant, but is inaccurate for the green band, where the atmospheric correction is likely to introduce same order errors.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variations in surface ozone over Ushuaia and the Antarctic region: observations from in situ measurements, satellite data, and global models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic continent is known to be an unpopulated region due to its extreme weather and climate conditions. However, the air quality over this continent can be affected by long-lived anthropogenic pollutants from the mainland. The Argentinian region of Ushuaia is often the main source area of accumulated hazardous gases over the Antarctic Peninsula. The main objective of this study is to report the first in situ observations yet known of surface ozone (O-3) over Ushuaia, the Drake Passage, and Coastal Antarctic Peninsula (CAP) on board the RV Australis during the Malaysian Antarctic Scientific Expedition Cruise 2016 (MASEC'16). Hourly O-3 data was measured continuously for 23 days using an EcoTech O-3 analyzer. To understand more about the distribution of surface O-3 over the Antarctic, we present the spatial and temporal of surface O-3 of long-term data (2009-2015) obtained online from the World Meteorology Organization of World Data Centre for greenhouse gases (WMO WDCGG). Furthermore, surface O-3 satellite data from the free online NOAA-Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) database and online data assimilation from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)-Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) were used. The data from both online products are compared to document the data sets and to give an indication of its quality towards in situ data. Finally, we used past carbon monoxide (CO) data as a proxy of surface O-3 formation over Ushuaia and the Antarctic region. Our key findings were that the surface O-3 mixing ratio during MASEC'16 increased from a minimum of 5 ppb to similar to 10-13 ppb approaching the Drake Passage and the Coastal Antarctic Peninsula (CAP) region. The anthropogenic and biogenic O-3 precursors from Ushuaia and the marine region influenced the mixing ratio of surface O-3 over the Drake Passage and CAP region. The past data from WDCGG showed that the annual O-3 cycle has a maximum during the winter of 30 to 35 ppb between June and August and a minimum during the summer (January to February) of 10 to 20 ppb. The surface O-3 mixing ratio during the summer was controlled by photochemical processes in the presence of sunlight, leading to the depletion process. During the winter, the photochemical production of surface O-3 was more dominant. The NOAA-AIRS and ECMWF-MACC analysis agreed well with the MASEC'16 data but twice were higher during the expedition period. Finally, the CO past data showed the surface O-3 mixing ratio was influenced by the CO mixing ratio over both the Ushuaia and Antarctic regions. Peak surface O-3 and CO hourly mixing ratios reached up to similar to 38 ppb (O-3) and similar to 500 ppb (CO) over Ushuaia. High CO over Ushuaia led to the depletion process of surface O-3 over the region. Monthly CO mixing ratio over Antarctic (South Pole) were low, leading to the production of surface O-3 over the Antarctic region.

AB  - We discuss in this paper the enhancement of multilooks SAR images for the purpose of wave detection. The method is based on improving the contrast in the dual tree complex wavelet domain, while performing denoising simultaneously. We describe the particularities of Sentinel-1 Stripmap multilooks ground range detected images with high resolution and present the advantages of the proposed SAR image enhancement method. Simulation results and comparisons with state of the art contrast enhancement and denoising methods highlight the benefits of the proposed solution.

TI  - Deep Learning Technology for Predicting Solar Flares from (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar activity, particularly solar flares can have significant detrimental effects on both space-borne and grounds based systems and industries leading to subsequent impacts on our lives. As a consequence, there is much current interest in creating systems which can make accurate solar flare predictions. This paper aims to develop a novel framework to predict solar flares by making use of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-ray flux 1-minute time series data. This data is fed to three integrated neural networks to deliver these predictions. The first neural network (NN) is used to convert GOES X-ray flux 1-minute data to Markov Transition Field (MTF) images. The second neural network uses an unsupervised feature learning algorithm to learn the MTF image features. The third neural network uses both the learned features and the MTF images, which are then processed using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to generate the flares predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first flare prediction system that is based entirely on the analysis of pre-flare GOES X-ray flux data. The results are evaluated using several performance measurement criteria that are presented in this paper.

AB  - During the spring of 2014, 130 million m(3) of water were released from the United States' Morelos Dam on the lower Colorado River to Mexico, allowing water to reach the Gulf of California for the first time in 13 years. Our study assessed the effects of water transfer or ecological environmental flows from one nation to another, using remote sensing. Spatial applications for water resource evaluation are important for binational, integrated water resources management and planning for the Colorado River, which includes seven basin states in the US plus two states in Mexico. Our study examined the effects of the historic binational experiment (the Minute 319 agreement) on vegetative response along the riparian corridor. We used 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and 30 m Landsat 8 satellite imagery to track evapotranspiration (ET) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our analysis showed an overall increase in NDVI and evapotranspiration (ET) in the year following the 2014 pulse, which reversed a decline in those metrics since the last major flood in 2000. NDVI and ET levels decreased in 2015, but were still significantly higher (P < 0.001) than pre-pulse (2013) levels. Preliminary findings show that the decline in 2015 persisted into 2016 and 2017. We continue to analyse results for 2018 in comparison to short-term (2013-2018) and long-term (2000-2018) trends. Our results support the conclusion that these environmental flows from the US to Mexico via the Minute 319 "pulse" had a positive, but short-lived (1 year), impact on vegetation growth in the delta.

AB  - The Sentinel satellite missions of the European Copernicus programme provide comprehensive data for long-term routine observations of the global environment. A key parameter for climate monitoring, hydrology and water management is the seasonal snow cover. We developed, implemented and tested a novel approach for monitoring snow extent and snowmelt area, exploiting the synergy of imaging radar of the Sentinel-1 mission and multispectral optical imagery of the SLSTR sensor on Sentinel-3. We describe the processing steps and algorithms for generating the synergistic snow cover product and show examples for snow cover maps over Europe based on single mission data as well as the final synergistic product.

TI  - Isolating type-specific phenologies through spectral unmixing of satellite time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is commonly studied using time series of multi-spectral vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. Differences in reflectance among land-cover and/or plant functional types are obscured by sub-pixel mixing, and so phenological analyses have typically sought to maximize the compositional purity of input satellite data by increasing spatial resolution. We present an alternative method to mitigate this 'mixed-pixel problem' and extract the phenological behavior of individual land-cover types inferentially, by inverting the linear mixture model traditionally used for sub-pixel land-cover mapping. Parameterized using genetic algorithms, the method takes advantage of the discriminating capacity of calibrated surface reflectance measurements in red, near infrared, and short-wave infrared wavelengths, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index. In simulation, the unmixing procedure reproduced the reflectances and phenological signals of grass, crop, and deciduous forests with high fidelity (RMSE < 0.007 NDVI); and in empirical tests, the algorithm extracted the phenological characteristics of evergreen trees and seasonal grasses in a semi-arid savannah. The approach shows potential for a wide range of ecological applications, including detection of differential responses to climate, soil, or other factors among vegetation types.

AB  - Remote sensing technology has been widely used in the geographic information system in order to obtain data more quickly, accurately and affordably. One of the advantages of using remote sensing imagery (satellite imagery) is to analyze land cover and land use. Satellite image data used in this study were images from the Landsat 8 satellite combined with the data from the Municipality of Malang government. The satellite image was taken in July 2016. Furthermore, the method used in this study was unsupervised classification. Based on the analysis towards the satellite images and field observations, 29% of the land in the Municipality of Malang was plantation, 22% of the area was rice field, 12% was residential area, 10% was land with shrubs, and the remaining 2% was water (lake/reservoir). The shortcoming of the methods was 25% of the land in the area was unidentified because it was covered by cloud. It is expected that future researchers involve cloud removal processing to minimize unidentified area.

AB  - The present study comes in the context of tunnel excavation monitoring. To detect and explain the characteristics of ground displacements due to tunnel excavations, a PsInsar processing chain for Sentinel-1 images using SlTBX and StaMPS tools is set up. Then, it is applied to study surface displacements over the line b of Rennes city metro. This study exploits 20 Sentinel-1 images covering Rennes City, France, over a period of 2.5 years. Mean displacement velocity map and displacement time series show that the detected deformations are correlated in space and in time with the excavation works. Although we did not had the possibility to validate PsInsar results by ground truth data (levelling, GNSS), we demonstrate, through this blind experiment, that we can detect a dense PS cover, the feasibility of small displacement scale and rate monitoring using a small set of Sentinel-1 images. To improve these results, we forecast to use a bigger set of images and to compare the result to ground data. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Remotely sensed data using aerial video is gaining vast popularity in traffic surveillance. Traditional monitoring devices are usually kept at fixed locations to achieve a fixed surveillance coverage range. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are receiving much attention from researchers in traffic monitoring due to their low cost, high flexibility, and wide view range. Unlike stationary surveillance, the camera platform of UAVs is in constant motion and makes it difficult to process for data extraction. To address this problem, a novel framework for traffic flow parameter estimation with enhanced vehicle detection from aerial videos is proposed. The frames initially undergo Adaptive Gamma Correction for contrast enhancement. The proposed method incorporates steps that make use of the Kanade Lucas Tomasi (KLT) tracker, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and connected graphs. Interest-point-based motion analysis is done using KLT tracker. The SVM classification is used to identify vehicles from other moving objects. Contourlet transform coefficients and Gray Level Co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are among the seven features extracted from the frames. Finally the number of vehicles, average speed and densities of bi-directional flow are found. The method shows high detection rate and low false positive alarms.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy by ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy for patients with suspicious node positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of preoperative diagnostic tools for axillary lymph nodes (LNs) staging of breast cancer.A total of 2464 consecutive patients with operable breast cancer were prospectively identified at our institution between April 2012 and March 2017. Patients with suspicious axillary LN of breast cancer were assessed using preoperative ultrasound(US) or computed tomography (CT), underwent fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB). The inclusion criteria for both FNA and CNB were a cortical thickness > 3 mm or abnormal morphological characteristics. Patients with biopsy-proven metastasis underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and those with a negative FNA or CNB underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). If the SNB was positive, ALND was performed. Diagnostic accuracy for SNB was calculated for both FNA and CNB. In addition, the patients in this study were divided into two groups as follows: the cN0-FNA group (suspicious LN but negative FNA) and cN0-CNB group (suspicious LN but negative CNB).A number of patients with negative US/CT findings of LNs were 1406, with 744 undergoing FNA and 272 undergoing CNB for suspicious LNs. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were 65, 99, 99, 80, and 85% in FNA, and 87, 100, 100, 93 and 95% in CNB, respectively. SNB was performed in 172 (cN0-CNB group) of 272 CNB and 487 (cN0-FNA group) of 744 FNA patients. One hundred and seventy-two patients from the cN0-CNB group (Tis 6, T1 97, T2 66, T3 3 patients) treated with SNB were compared to 487 from the cN0-FNA group (Tis 21, T1 225, T2 233, T3 8 patients) in terms of number of LN metastasis. A number of patients with more than 3 positive SNB and positive LNs were 9 (5%) and 0 (0%) in cN0-CNB group, and 78 (16%) and 24 (5%) in cN0-FNA group, respectively. A number of patients who had complications such as haematoma and pain at the time of 7 to 14 days after CNB and FNA were 1 (0.5%) and 1 (0.5%) in cN0-CNB group, and were 0% and 0.2% in cN0-FNA group (p = 0.44), respectively.The preoperative diagnosis of axillary LNs was influenced by the diagnostic tool used. CNB is a reliable method for the preoperative diagnosis of LN metastasis.

AB  - BackgroundLifestyle interventions can substantially improve obesity and cardiometabolic risks. However, evidence of long-term benefits of national intervention is sparse. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a nationwide program for abdominal obesity.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was performed using a longitudinal nationwide individual data in subjects aged 40-74 years who underwent checkups in fiscal year (FY) 2008. Lifestyle interventions were provided via interview in subjects with abdominal obesity and at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Subjects who attended the lifestyle intervention (participants) were compared to those who did not attend (non-participants). Outcomes were waist circumferences (WC) and body mass index (BMI) reduction, reversal of metabolic syndrome (MetS), and changes in cardiometabolic risks. We used a three-step process with robust analytic approaches to account for selection bias that included traditional multivariate analysis, propensity-score matching and instrumental variable (IV) analyses.ResultsOf 19,969,722 subjects, 4,370,042 were eligible for analyses; 111,779 participants and 907,909 non-participants. A higher percentage of participants had ≥5% reductions in obesity profiles at year 3, compared to non-participants (WC, 21.4% vs 16.1%; BMI, 17.6% vs 13.6%; pConclusionsIn the nationwide lifestyle intervention for abdominal obesity, the at-risk population achieved significant reductions in WC, BMI, and cardiometabolic risks in 3 years. This study provides evidence that the nationwide program effectively achieved long-term improvement in abdominal obesity and cardiometabolic risks. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Changes in column aerosol optical depth and ground-level particulate matter concentration over East Asia
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Different spatio-temporal variations and trends in column aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface particulate matter (PM10; diameter < 10 mu m) mass concentration were found for selected regions of East Asia. Enhanced AOD over North China and its downwind regions (Yellow Sea, Korea) occurred in June, compared with March-April over South China. Increased PM10 concentration in both North and South China was observed from late fall to spring. In Northeast China, a peak in AOD appeared during March, but high PM10 concentrations occurred in December-January. A significantly increasing trend in AOD was found in North and Northeast China, whereas surface PM10 concentrations over most megacities in these two regions declined almost linearly. This contradictory trend between AOD and PM10 concentration can be attributed to large emissions reductions in near-surface coarse particles, mainly accredited to a series of strict control measures. In other words, there has been no meaningful reduction in fine-mode particles including secondary aerosols. On the other hand, space-based CALIOP measurements revealed that approximately 60 similar to 70% (40 similar to 50%) of AOD was contributed by the aerosols present above 1 km (above 2 km) altitude. Our findings suggest that stronger emission controls for precursor gaseous emissions as well as submicron particles are required to decrease particulate air pollution, so as to further reduce their radiative forcing.

TI  - Developing the vegetation drought response index for South Korea (VegDRI-SKorea) to assess the vegetation condition during drought events
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - South Korea has experienced severe droughts and water scarcity problems that have influenced agriculture, food prices, and crop production in recent years. Traditionally, climate-based drought indices using point-based meteorological observations have been used to help quantify drought impacts on the vegetation in South Korea. However, these approaches have a limited spatial precision when mapping detailed vegetation stress caused by drought. For these reasons, the development of a drought index that provides detailed spatial-resolution information on drought-affected vegetation conditions is essential to improve the country's drought monitoring capabilities, which are needed to help develop more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. The objective of this study was to develop a satellite-based hybrid drought index called the vegetation drought response index for South Korea (VegDRI-SKorea) that could improve the spatial resolution of agricultural drought monitoring on a national scale. The VegDRI-SKorea was developed for South Korea, modifying the original VegDRI methodology (developed for the USA) by tailoring it to the available local data resources. The VegDRI-SKorea utilizes a classification and regression tree (CART) modelling approach that collectively analyses remote-sensing data (e.g. normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), climate-based drought indices (e.g. self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI)), and biophysical variables (e.g. elevation and land cover) that influence the drought-related vegetation stress. This study evaluates the performance of the recently developed VegDRI-SKorea for severe and extreme drought events that occurred in South Korea in 2001, 2008, and 2012. The results demonstrated that the hybrid drought index improved the more spatially detailed drought patterns compared to the station-based drought indices and resulted in a better understanding of drought impacts on the vegetation conditions. The VegDRI-SKorea model is expected to contribute to the monitoring of drought conditions nationally. In addition, it will provide the necessary information on the spatial variations of those conditions to evaluate local and regional drought risk assessment across South Korea and assist local decision-makers in drought risk management.

TI  - Impacts of climate and synoptic fluctuations on dust storm activity over the Middle East
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust events in the Middle East are becoming more frequent and intense in recent years with impacts on air quality, climate, and public health. In this study, the relationship between dust, as determined from Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and meteorological parameters (precipitation, temperature, pressure and wind field) are examined using monthly data from 2000 to 2015 for desert areas in two areas, Iraq-Syria and Saudi Arabia. Bivariate regression analysis between monthly temperature data and AOD reveals a high correlation for Saudi Arabia (R = 0.72) and Iraq-Syria (R = 0.64). Although AOD and precipitation are correlated in February, March and April, the relationship is more pronounced on annual timescales. The opposite is true for the relationship between temperature and AOD, which is evident more clearly on monthly time scales, with the highest temperatures and AOD typically between August and September. Precipitation data suggest that long-term reductions in rainfall promoted lower soil moisture and vegetative cover, leading to more intense dust emissions. Superimposed on the latter effect are more short term variations in temperature exacerbating the influence on the dust storm genesis in hot periods such as the late warm season of the year. Case study analysis of March 2012 and March 2014 shows the impact of synoptic systems on dust emissions and transport in the study region. Dust storm activity was more intense in March 2012 as compared to March 2014 due to enhanced atmospheric turbulence intensifying surface winds.

AB  - Lake Baikal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and holds 20% of the world's freshwater reserves. On July 26, 2016, a cyanobacterial bloom of a green colour a few kilometers in size with a bad odor was discovered by local people in the Barguzinsky Bay on the eastern shore of Lake Baikal. Our study showed very high concentration of chlorophyll a (41.7 g/m(3)) in the sample of bloom. We found that the bloom was dominated by a nitrogen-fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria of the genus Dolichospermum. The mass accumulation of cyanobacteria in the lake water with an extremely high chlorophyll a concentration can be explained by a combination of several factors: the discharge of biologicaly-available nutrients, including phosphorus, into the water of Lake Baikal; low wind speed and weak water mixing; buoyant cyanobacterial cells on the lake surface, which drifted towards the eastern coast, where the maximum concentration of chlorophyll a was recorded. In the center of the Barguzinsky Bay and in the open part of Lake Baikal, according to satellite data, the chlorophyll a concentration is several orders of magnitude lower than at the shoreline.

AB  - People effected due to air pollution in India rose by almost 150% during 1990 to 2015. Diwali event is one of the major anthropogenic source contributing to the air pollution. The study focuses on spatial and temporal distribution of trace gases emitted during pre, on and post diwali days and identify areas with high concentration using station measured and satellite derived data during 2008-2017. The ground measured data shows that during diwali days, NO2, SO2, CO & O-3 concentration is almost 1.5 to 7 times the NAAQ safety limits over major cities particularly in northern, western and eastern India. Central and southern India experience low to moderate increase in pollution concentration. Spatial distribution over diwali days using satellite data reveal that NO2 values over India are mostly below NAAQ standards, however high range are observed (27-48 mu g/m(3)) over Delhi, Punjab, Haryana region (Northern zones), Western, central and Eastern Indo-Gangetic plain and this concentration is seen denser on diwali days compared to pre and post diwali. The observation reveal that SO2 concentration is below safety levels over almost entire country except few cities like Delhi region, part of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Kolkata region. CO concentration is at higher level than NAAQ standards over Western, central and Eastern Indo-gangetic plain. The regression shows that the satellite derived values are in close agreement with the ground measured over the diwali days. The analysis conclude that the peak of the pollutants during diwali may not be increasing quite drastically over many parts of the cities but the overall spatial distribution of the pollutants is increasing from 'moderate' to 'moderately high' range.

TI  - Morphodynamics of Coastal Lagoons: An Analysis of Multitemporal Landsat Images of Segara Anakan Lagoon Area
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagoons are shallow coastal bodies of water separated from the ocean by a series of barrier islands which lie parallel to the shoreline. Sediment supplied to enclosed lagoons will influence the distribution and morphodynamics of coastal lagoons. Lagoons are re-shaped by erosion and deposition by the accumulation of material washed or blown over the enclosing barriers, and by the accretion of in-flowing river sediment. The purposes of this study is to describe the methodology and attain results for identification of multitemporal Landsat image data of the Segara Anakan Lagoon for the years 1978, 1994, 2003, and 2013. The method used in this study is a visual interpretation of Landsat by using GIS and remote sensing methods to produce maps of morphodynamics of a lagoon and multitemporal of a coastline change. The overall results for the identification of morphodynamics of coastal lagoons are the decrease of areas of water bodies, increase of areas of a land accretion, and coastline changes. The results are used to examine ecological management of coastal lagoons.

AB  - The goal of OpenAltimetry is to provide altimetry-specific data discovery and access with a focus on ease-of-use and quick response times. OpenAltimetry currently supports NASA's laser altimeter missions: ICESat (2003 similar to 2009) and ICESat-2 (scheduled for launch in 2018) with a powerful, web-based interactive interface that provides data discovery, processing and visualization capabilities targeting both novice and expert users across different science specializations. OpenAltimetry is modelled after NASA's highly popular EOSDIS Worldview application and uses a unique solution to allow users to efficiently interact with altimetry data. For data management, we are using a hybrid solution with highly optimized tiered storage databases and object storage. The OpenAltimetry application was built cloud-ready, with its highly scalable design and serviceoriented architecture. We have developed an efficient data ingestion pipeline that streamlines processing and ingestion of altimetry datasets into the OpenAltimetry system. The waveform energy (for ICESat) and photon (for ICESat-2) data are stored in their original HDF5 format for efficiency. This will be critical for getting large volumes of altimetry data (e. g. ICESat-2) into the system rapidly for access by the wider community.

CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - Motion detection and estimation is an important task in several applications of image analysis, including scenarios such as satellite cross-cueing or detecting small shifts in terrain. One widely employed technique for estimating the amount of motion between two images is Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), although its computational cost is often prohibitively high for time-sensitive applications. In this work, a previously developed algorithm that uses sum tables to calculate the NCC efficiently for 1-D ultrasound traces is adapted to work for 2-D radar images. The performance of the sum tables algorithm is quantified both theoretically as well as with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the RADARSAT-2 satellite, and is shown to provide time savings of 97% or more compared to the direct method. The algorithm described herein could be used to provide more timely intelligence in situations where it is desirable to detect and estimate the motion of targets using remote sensing.

TI  - Persistent Scatter Identification and Look-Angle Error Estimation Using Similar Time-Series Interferometric Pixels
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer (PS) pixels contain highly coherent information, which is used in the estimation of geophysical parameters of interest. Conventionally, PS pixels are selected on the basis of the estimated noise present in the spatially uncorrelated phase component along with look-angle error. The phase history of selected PS pixels is corrected for the look-angle error followed by phase unwrapping and extraction of spatially correlated nuisance phase component leading to displacement estimation. In this letter, a novel PS selection method, which is based on a new index called the similar time-series interferometric pixels (STIPs) representing the number of neighborhood pixels with similar phase history, is proposed. In this approach, apart from PS selection, corresponding set of STIP is also used in refining look-angle error estimation. The efficiency of the proposed InSAR processing chain is demonstrated for the Sentinel-1A single look complex images of Rajmahal, Jharkhand, India, predominantly a coal mines area. Results, when compared with the conventional PS processing technique, reveal substantial improvement in terms of extracting more number of reliable PS with enhanced density.

AB  - The article presents the results of a three-year study conducted by the Sociology Chair of the RUDN University in cooperation with foreign colleagues to compare the worldview priorities of the today's student youth. Due to the article size limitations the authors divided the data into two parts: in the first part, they focus on the identification of the values that serve as reference points specifying the social action limits and criteria for assessing events and situations. The data does not allow for broad generalizations due to the non-equivalence of the questionnaires used in three countries, but points to a number of characteristics that make the Russian youth look more similar to their Czech or Kazakhstan peers than to themselves a decade ago. Such a conclusion is based on the analysis conducted according to the thematic structure of the questionnaire. Thus, the article presents the educational values of students (pragmatic-instrumental perception of the higher education), labor values (a mixture of optimism and pessimism when assessing chances to find a job after graduation, and different attitudes to the combination of study and work), interpersonal interaction features (a high credit of trust in parents, especially in a difficult situation, does not depend on the self-perception and the circle of personal responsibility), political values (the ratio of the lack of political activity and interest in politics, and the level of social trust differ despite the same leaders of national pride), general value priorities (attitudes towards religion, interpretations of the life success and qualities necessary for achieving it, the horizons of planning) and problems (assessing one's generation in terms of actual threats).

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is the second part of the publication presenting the empirical results of the three-year study conducted by the Sociology Chair of the RUDN University in cooperation with foreign colleagues to compare the worldview priorities of the today's student youth. Due to the article size limitations the authors divided the data into two parts: in the first part, they focused on identifying values of three groups of students, which serve as reference points specifying the social action limits and criteria for assessing events and situations. In the second part, the authors continue to characterize values of the younger generations of the post-socialist countries relying on the empirical data collected with another questionnaire focusing on the students' fears and hopes. In recent decades, the catastrophic/crisis consciousness has been widely studied and social fears were institutionalized as an important subject of sociological analysis. However, value orientations and mass fears are still rarely recognized as interrelated in empirical studies, although real and 'normal' fears (total and routinized in the contemporary risk society in U. Beck's terms) are a key indicator of value orientations even if they are not real but presented as such by the media. Serious modifications of the Russian questionnaire in the Czech and Kazakhstan surveys do not allow for broad comparisons or generalizations; however, the empirical results reveal key life priorities and fears of the students (considering employment, incomes, personal relationship, health, education, etc.), general level of the youth's anxiety, main strategies to overcome uncomfortable situations, and factors that determine anxiety. The authors conclude that (a) the social well-being of the student youth is very ambiguous in all three countries; (b) in general, fears and hopes of the Russian youth are more similar to their Kazakhstan peers; (c) the Czech students are more certain on a number of issues, which proves their stereotypical western individualism as compared to the Russian 'traditionalism'.

AB  - The concept of women entrepreneurship and its relation to broader issues such as social innovation, wealth accumulation, and community building has been a popular arena for research. This research aims to explore Turkey (regional) representative women's expectations of future, values, attitudes and beliefs about finance, knowledge of financial instruments, saving and financial instrument utilization. A sample of 1574 urban women aged between 25-46, from 12 major cities has been interviewed with a CATI technique. The research points out to a crucial finding about the necessity of economic awareness and empowerment of women in utilizing financial instruments for the development of women entrepreneurship within the Turkish context. Regional analysis of the data shows that women in the East Turkey and Black sea region of Turkey are less privileged about financial literacy awareness and financial instruments utilization. Savings are primarily investments for future security followed by money for house purchase and children's education plans rather than business setting plans. Results comply with OECD findings in the sense that financial knowledge among women is low and In terms of values and future expectations, the sample shows that women have a fatalistic worldview in terms of business set ups. As call for action, this fatalistic belief of Turkish women about money has to be changed to initiate initiative and risk taking behaviors of women to encourage women entrepreneurship coupled with more knowledge acquisition on financial instruments and literacy. Thus, basic financial education plan has to be set in motion to increase level of financial literacy among women.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st Global Colloquium on GeoSciences and Engineering (GCGE)
CL  - Bandung, INDONESIA
AB  - Indonesia is very vulnerable to flood disaster because it has high rainfall events throughout the year. Flood is categorized as the most important hazard disaster because it is causing social, economic and human losses. The purpose of this study is to analyze extreme flood event based on satellite rainfall dataset to understand the rainfall characteristic (rainfall intensity, rainfall pattern, etc.) that happened before flood disaster in the area for monsoonal, equatorial and local rainfall types. Recharge capacity will be analyzed using land cover and soil distribution. The data used in this study are CHIRPS rainfall satellite data on 0.05 0 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution, and GSMap satellite rainfall dataset operated by JAXA on 1-hour temporal resolution and 0.1 0 spatial resolution, land use and soil distribution map for recharge capacity analysis. The rainfall characteristic before flooding, and recharge capacity analysis are expected to become the important information for flood mitigation in Indonesia.

TI  - Optimal Compact Polarimetric Parameters and Texture Features for Discriminating Sea Ice Types during Winter and Advanced Melt
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is widely used for sea ice monitoring and operational activities. The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), with its anticipated launch in 2018, will provide hybrid compact polarimetric (CP) C-band SAR data offering near-polarimetric capabilities at large image acquisition widths suitable for achieving operational and scientific objectives in the Arctic. Although C-band SAR is effective for sea ice monitoring, it is difficult to implement during advanced melt, when the sea ice cover is melting and covered by melt ponds. Ice type separability during winter (pre-melt) and advanced melt conditions was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical separability analyses and Support Vector Machine supervised classifications of RCM parameters simulated from 2 winter and 2 advanced melt RADARSAT-2 scenes. Through a detailed analysis of the 2 advanced melt scenes, it was found that the steep incidence angle (22.3-24.2 degrees) simulated RCM CP parameters provide improved ice type separability during the advanced melt period compared with shallow incidence angles (39.6-42.2 degrees). With respect to classification, an overall accuracy of 77.06% was found for a scene comprising first-year and multiyear ice types, and a higher overall accuracy of 85.91% was achieved by including gray level co-occurrence matrix parameters in the classification.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) shares its radio frequency with the other systems and thus, inevitably receives their signals. Such cross-talk, radio frequency interference (RFI) has been traditionally eliminated by spectrum filters. However, a latest L-band SAR, ALOS-2, receives frequency modulated wideband signals that cannot be detected by traditional spectrum filters. These RFIs have the same or wider bandwidth than SAR and thus, appears in SAR images. They also interrupt interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) analysis because it appears in every observations and in full-polarimetric mode images. We report the investigation results of the profiles of such RFI in Tokyo bay, Japan.

TI  - The Ob Ugrians-Muslims: Historical and Psychological Factors of the Islam Penetration in the Traditional Culture
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the process of penetration of Islam into the life of Ob Ugrians from the point of view of their cultural and historical psychology. The authors rely on the theory of "poor living environment", proving that in the most difficult climatic conditions the human resource of Ob Ugrians was spent exclusively on survival, and it did not allow them to dynamically develop the existing elements of culture and create new ones in accordance with the level of their spiritual needs. Development proceeded on the "principle of complementarity", when the components of other cultures were borrowed, assimilated and accepted as their own. The authors believe that Islam became one of such important donor cultures due to the coincidence of a number of worldview with the Ob-Ugric culture and active missionary activity of the medieval Muslim States. In the XVII - early XX centuries, the process of the spread of Islam continued through the contacts of the Ob Ugrians with the Siberian Tatars, including through the conclusion of marriages. In the context of the Christianization of the XVIII - XIX centuries, the characteristics of Islam in the culture of the Islamized groups of Ob Ugric peoples began to die out, but partially preserved to the present time. However, the centuries-old influence of Muslims was so strong that some groups of Ob Ugrians disappeared, merged with the Muslim population of the region. The authors project the historical experience on the current situation, paying attention to the numerous facts of the marriage of Khanty and Mansi with Muslims who migrate to Ugra from the CIS countries and seek to gain a foothold in a new place, using social protection and the system of benefits provided to the families of indigenous small peoples of the North. This facilitates ethnic assimilation processes and poses a threat to the Ob-Ugric culture and identity.

AB  - Full automatic change detection is a great challenge for many institutions, and many teams are involved in it: teams in charge of monitoring designated sites, teams in charge of imagery acquisition, and teams producing maps. The large availability and repetitiveness of free Sentinel-1 imagery appears like an opportunity to monitor change detection on designated sites or on larger areas. This paper presents a change detection workflow built on SNAP and Sentinel-1 time series answering operational needs: automation, scalability and usable information. It also details the tests drove on various sites and changing contexts (refugee camps, airport infrastructures, earth wall, etc.). The robustness of the process is discussed, the way to move from site monitoring to a whole regional area change detection and how external data and post-processing on a change detection image can strengthen the process in order to provide an operational full automatic alert service.

AB  - Horticulture crops play an important commercial and economic role, providing employment and food security. A sustainable horticulture production requires updated and accurate statistics in terms of area and production. High temporal resolution remote sensing can be used to identify horticulture crops, especially vegetables that have shorter production cycles. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) bands generated from Sentinel-2A data are used to define the growth cycle of different vegetable types. NDVI time series allow the identification of several parameters, such as planting and maturation dates and crop cycle duration, that enable the characterization of each crop. A curve-matching algorithm, based on a set of NDVI curve parameters, were used to identify horticulture parcels. Two approaches were considered, one considering the total overlapping area and other considering a minimum of 1 pixel of overlap with the ancillary parcels delimitation. Results show that the latter approach allows the identification of possible horticulture crops with an accuracy higher than 80% while the former returns a lower accuracy of around 50%.

AB  - Future sea level rise change scenarios for Honduras were derivate from 10 General Circulation Models (GCMs) of the CMIP5 projections for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP 4.5 and 8.5; IPCC, 2013) and the time-series 2006-2100. We resample the projections at 4-km and aggregated into the three future periods named as 2030s (Climatic normal -CN- for 2026 to 2045), 2050s (CN for 2046-2065) and 2080s (CN for 2076 to 2095) as well. The future periods were selected by PNUD and MiAmbiente in Honduras in order to get climatic information for the decision making processes around the climate change in the short, medium and large terms. We used the variable Sea Surface Height bove geoid (zos). We make available two types of data: _ts: Sea level height changes between the reference period 1996-2015 and the historical/future yearly GCMs projections. _avg: Sea level height changes between the reference period 1996-2015 and the future climate normal (2030s, 2050s, 2080s) GCMs projections. The baseline conditions came from the Global Ocean - Multimission altimeter satellite gridded sea surface heights and derived variables, distributed by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. Specifically, we use the Sealevel-Glo-Phy-L4-Rep-Observations-008-047 dataset. It processes data from all altimeter missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO, ERS1/2. Resolution is 0.25X0.25 degrees and has an irregular temporal resolution. The data starts in 1993 and it's ongoing. We use the 20-yr average and the time-series from 1996-2015. We re-distributed the processed data for: _ts: Sea level height changes between the reference period 1996-2015 and the historical gridded satellite data. _avg: Sea level height climate normal 1996-2015 of the historical gridded satellite data. The data is part of work carried out by CIAT in the generation of the climate change scenarios for Honduras for the Third National Communication to the UNFCCC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought threatens food and water security around the world, and this threat is likely to become more severe under climate change. High-resolution predictive information can help farmers, water managers, and others to manage the effects of drought. We have created an open-source tool to produce short-term forecasts of vegetation health at high spatial resolution, using data that are global in coverage. The tool automates downloading and processing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data sets and training gradient-boosted machine models on hundreds of millions of observations to predict future values of the enhanced vegetation index. We compared the predictive power of different sets of variables (MODIS surface reflectance data and Level-3 MODIS products) in two regions with distinct agro-ecological systems, climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and California. Performance in California is higher because of more cloud-free days and less missing data. In both regions, the correlation between the actual and model predicted vegetation health values in agricultural areas is above 0.75. Predictive power more than doubles in agricultural areas compared to a baseline model.

TI  - Deciphering the Symbols of Rumi's Spiritual Couplets
T2  - REVISTA PUBLICANDO
M3  - Article
AB  - Symbol is a means for recognition and presentation of subjective and objective extensions for fast retrieval of an object or a concept in human relations. Any change in linguistic symbols will result in the formation of such concepts as interpretation, allegory, symbol, metaphor and so on and so forth. If the total arrangement of the symbols is in a way that it brings about a covered narrative or text that contains various meanings we can describe that text as allegory. Then exemplification in Persian is something between allegory and irony. In the current research we will analyze the allegories of Rumi's Spiritual Couplets (better known as Masnavi) based on the ideas of formalist researchers and an approach grounded in the modern morphology focusing on the theories of great scholars of Persian literature. This essay seeks to demonstrate that all parables of the Spiritual Couplets are related with Rumi's Song of the Reed (Spiritual Couplets Exordium) and by deciphering these narratives we can near ourselves to the truth of Rumi's worldview.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL MALAYSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the safety and efficacy of non-viral gene transfer in cartilage tissue engineering (TE) from the worldview of Islam. The first clinical trial treating adenosine deaminase deficient patients conducted in 1990 has triggered the development of gene transfer technology. The potential of gene transfer is further explored in TE field with the hope that it could prosper the regenerative medicine application. However, ethical issues become important when it comes to application of new treatment modalities, primarily in gene transfer because of genetic modification influences the basis of life - the DNA. Besides ethical issue, the application of gene transfer in treating diseases also attract views from religious context. The questions on the techniques to administer the gene in human, social acceptance of genetically modified cell and adverse effects from it are still debatable and unresolved. Apart from that dilemma, both safety and efficacy issues are raised due to the scientific uncertainty and social perception of the technology. Despite countless number of encouraging findings and recommendations by the proponents of the technology, gene transfer is currently available only in the research setting. The established guidelines are used to complement and provide the necessary foundations in discussing the aspects involved in the incorporation of gene transfer with cartilage TE. Relevant Islamic input are identified and aligned to those particular guidelines. It is hoped that the integration of Islamic inputs in the existing guidelines could suggest the safest approach in treating cartilage degenerative disease through gene transfer and TE.

AB  - In recent years, newly launched satellite sensors have provided data enabling qualitatively higher level of remote sensing of oceanic processes. Better spatial resolution of the data allows examining finer scales down to a few meters; it is now possible to compare radar and optical data obtained almost simultaneously over the same region at close high spatial resolutions; smaller time intervals between data acquisitions allow observing pollution drift and transformation and water dynamics. In this paper presents an example of using three consecutive satellite images captured over the Gulf of Lion in the Mediterranean Sea on the 19th of June 2017 with time intervals of 5 and 7 hours to analyze propagation of oil film occurred on the sea surface due to the discharge of waters contaminated with petroleum products from a ship. The images acquired on the same day presented a unique opportunity to study the spreading and drift of the film in great detail. The effects of wind on the pollution propagation were investigated. It was found that the wind had no effect on the propagation in the immediate region surrounding the source of the spill, near the coastline. The pollutants in this region propagated only by spreading. It was suggested that the effects of wind were partially negated by the coast- al counter current. Further out from the coast, the spill patches drifted towards the northwest at an average speed of 15-19 cm/sec, under the influence of a south-southeasterly wind.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of potentialities of the new Sentinel-1 radar images for mapping the different crops in the Camargue region in the South France. The originality relies on deep learning techniques. The analysis is carried out on multitemporal Sentinel-1 data over an area in Camargue, France. 50 Sentinel-1 images processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from May 2017 to September 2017. We revealed that even with classical machine learning approaches (K nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine), good performance classification could be achieved with F-measure/Accuracy greater than 86 % and Kappa coefficient better than 0.82. We found that the results of the two deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifiers clearly outperformed the classical approaches. Finally, our analyses of Camargue area results show that the same performance was obtained with two different RNN-based classifiers on the Rice class, which is the most dominant crop of this region, with a F-measure metric of 96 %. These results thus highlight that in the near future, these RNN-based techniques will play an important role in the analysis of remote sensing time series.

AB  - The research and improvement of methods to be used for crop monitoring are currently major challenges, especially for radar images due to their speckle noise nature. The European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-1 constellation provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coverage with a 6 days revisit period at a high spatial resolution of pixel spacing 20 m. Sentinel-1 data are considerable useful, as they provide valuable information of the vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for rice height and dry biomass retrievals. To do this, we train Sentinel-1 data against ground measurements with classical machine learning techniques (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)) to estimate rice height and dry biomass. The study is carried out on a multi-temporal Sentinel-1 dataset acquired from May 2017 to September 2017 over the Camargue region, southern France. The ground in-situ measurements were made in the same period to collect rice height and dry biomass over 11 rice fields. The images were processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack in C-band including dual-polarization VV (Vertical receive and Vertical transmit) and VH (Vertical receive and Horizontal transmit) data. We found that non-parametric methods (SVR and RF) had a better performance over the parametric MLR method for rice biophysical parameter retrievals. The accuracy of rice height estimation showed that rice height retrieval was strongly correlated to the in-situ rice height from dual-polarization, in which Random Forest yielded the best performance with correlation coefficient R-2 = 0:92 and the root mean square error (RMSE) 16% (7.9 cm). In addition, we demonstrated that the correlation of Sentinel-1 signal to the biomass was also very high in VH polarization with R-2 = 0.9 and RMSE = 18% (162 g.m(-2) (with Random Forest method). Such results indicate that the highly qualified Sentinel-1 radar data could be well exploited for rice biomass and height retrieval and they could be used for operational tasks.

Analysis was done for 1986-2014 period using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System. The analysis techniques used included object based image segmentation and classification, accuracy assessment and land cover change detection. Land cover types in Eastern Mau Forest consisted of indigenous forest, shrubland, grassland, plantation forest, cultivated fields, bare ground and built-up area. The analysis results depicted that cultivated fields coverage increased from 1% to 47%. Indigenous and plantation forests decreased from 43% to 36% and 34% to 7% respectively. Grassland and shrubland decreased from 16% to 8% and 6% to 2% respectively. Bare ground and built up area had a change of less than 1% each. Causes of pressure that lead to forest degradation included crop cultivation, settlement construction, livestock grazing, charcoal burning, firewood collection, logging, bee keeping and medicinal herbs extraction. Land cover change was more on the eastern side than on the western side. Indigenous and plantation forests were likely to disappear if cropland and built up area expansions were to remain unchecked. The study recommendations were: resettlement activities be eliminated in the Eastern Mau Forest; excision of forest land for crop cultivation should be discouraged; and scientific research should be carried out on sustainable plantation forest activities.

AB  - Exploratory visual analysis is often required to assist human operator to understand and interpret Earth Observation (EO) images. Optimal image representation offers cognitive support in discovering relevant facts about the scene with respect to a particular application. This is of crucial importance for training data sets selection in all Machine Learning tasks, particularly in the design of active learning tools for multispectral (MS) EO data. This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN) based method to compress, learn and reveal the most significant information included in the spectral bands of EO data in support of relevant visualization for image content analysis. The advanced method uses a DNN to discover the most suggestive pseudo-color representation able to highlight the entire MS image content better than the particular 3 bands selection (R, G, B). We propose the use of information theory and the concept of mutual information to rank the spectral bands based on the amount of information contained, by applying the minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance (mRMR) criterion on a the image so that we obtain the ranked bands. A DNN stacked autoencoder based paradigm is developed in order to extract and compress in three bands the overall information from the MS EO data. The developed method is demonstrated and validated for Sentinel 2 dataset.

AB  - This paper presents a new method to improve accuracy of supervised change detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The model is based on the idea to apply a low size labeled dataset to the input of an Ensemble of Self-Organizing Maps (ESOM) for training data generation (TDG). The resulted synthetic data set produced by ESOM substitutes the initial authentically labeled sample set and it is used to train a supervised change detection classifier. The proposed method is evaluated using a TerraSAR-X image of 400x400 pixels acquired in the Fukushima region, Japan, before and after tsunami. As change detection classifiers we have comparatively considered Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Neighbor (NN), the three-Nearest Neighbors (3-NN), and Likelihood Bayes classifier. The experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach using only 100 authentic labeled pixels.

AB  - This paper proposes a new neural approach for supervised change detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Training Data Generation based on Concurrent Self-Organizing Maps (TDG-CSOM). The proposed model is based on the idea to substitute the authentically labeled sample set with the virtual training data generated by the CSOM system. The proposed change detection algorithm has the following processing stages: (a) TDG-CSOM; (b) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier training using the virtual dataset obtained by TDG-CSOM; (c) concatenation of the corresponding pixels belonging to the SAR bi-temporal image; (d) MLP classification to obtain the change map. The proposed method is implemented and evaluated using a TerraSAR-X image acquired in the Fukushima region, Japan, before and after tsunami. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) approach for supervised classification of remote sensing images. One proposes to apply an ABC algorithm to optimize the coefficients of the set of polynomial discriminant functions. We have experimented the proposed ABC-based classifier algorithm for a Landsat 7 ETM+ image database, evaluating the influence of the ABC model parameters on the classifier performances. Such ABC model parameters are: numbers of employed/onlooker/scout bees, number of epochs, and polynomial degree. One has compared the best ABC classifier Overall Accuracy (OA) with the performances obtained using a set of benchmark classifiers (NN, NP, RBF, and SVM). The results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

CL  - Montreal, CANADA
AB  - Geocoding of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential preprocessing step in multi-source data integration, management and analysis for many geomatics applications. The Range-Doppler (RD) approach is a rigorous physical sensor model, which achieves the highest geometric accuracy and has been widely used in terrain-geocoding of satellite SAR data. However the main drawback is that it is not computationally efficient. The Rational-Function (RF) model has been successfully used for processing of optical images (push broom sensors IKONOS and QuickBird), and is of considerable interest in processing of SAR datasets as an alternative to the RD method because of its high computational efficiency and fitting accuracy (e.g. RADARSAT-2). Two SAR terrain-geocoding methods, based on the RD and the RF models, have been implemented at Canada Center for Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO). In this paper we briefly describe the well-known RD mathematical model and the RF mathematical model in more detail. The relative geometric accuracy for the two methods is analysed and compared. Finally, some major advantages of the RF method over the RD method are presented.

AB  - The aim of the current work is a quantitative assessment of forest vegetation degradation as a result of the instance of fire. The quantitative assessment is performed based on Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI). The latter is calculated using orthogonal transformation of Sentinel-2 satellite images. Time series were used from the MSI sensor of Sentinel-2 satellite, which occur in the time interval prior to the fire, at the end of the fire, and after the fire. The obtained results are from an actual fire from Bulgaria, Kresna region, which occurred at the end of August 2017. The obtained results quantitatively present the forest vegetation degradation in percentages.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Forest fires continue to burn large territories, both within and outside Europe. It is suitably to assess fire-induced changes in the vegetation, which in turn affects infiltration, runoff, and erosion potential. Therefore it is important to identify potential areas of concern and prioritize field reconnaissance. The development of a burn severity map will facilitate quantifying of the post-fire assessment phase. In this study the potential of Normalized Burn Index (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and normalized difference greenness indices (NDGI) derived from remote sensing methods (satellite data from different sensors Sentinel and Landsat) and Geographical Information System (GIS) have been analyzed for forest fire severity assessment. For more accurate assessment of the fire severity, a hybrid model was developed, using satellite data from different sensors - Sentinel and Landsat. For this purpose, the area, affected by fires occurred in august 2017 on the northwest slopes of the Ajtovska Mountain (East part of the Stara planina mountain) in the Eastern part of Bulgaria was studied. The forest fire events were spread on the area of (508.5 ha) and the affected vegetation was composed by deciduous forests (309.4ha), coniferous (62.4ha), mixed forests (61.4 ha) and grass and shrubs (75.3ha). Through the model developed, results applicable to the actual forest ecosystem conditions for different time intervals have been obtained. These results provide quantitative information about fire severity for distinct forest types, thus allowing for designing relevant fire severity maps.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores dialect's features of the village of Verkhnjaya Toyda of the Voronezh region. Its phonetic and morphological aspects are examined in detail. As a language source, the author draws on the speech of the long-liver of this settlement, which preserved the features of the dialect almost in its primordial state. The purpose of the study was to describe the distinctive modern features of the phonetics and morphology of the Upper-Toyda dialect. As a result of the analysis, it becomes evident that the local speech represents not only a very interesting linguistic phenomenon in itself, but also contains information allowing for better understanding of the dialectal worldview and development of the dialect as a constituent national language of the Russian people. Presented features give solid grounds to consider the Upper-Toydian dialect as original. It serves as a means of communication between the villagers among themselves and inhabitants of nearby settlements. The richness and uniqueness of popular speech is proven unquestionable, considering it contains those diverse features, absent in the literary language. As the research showed the typical features of the South-Russian dialect appear in the lexical units under study. As author concludes by getting acquainted and analyzing various units of speech, we can get a fairly clear idea of the modern features on two levels of the language of dialect: phonetics and morphology.

AB  - Water scarcity and destruction of natural resources are two most important environmental challenges in Zayanderood basin and proper use of water is important in the management of the basin. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the non-expert decision of managers on the environment and water in the Zayanderud basin. So, land cover changes were investigated using Landsat images in the basin from 2008 to 2015. Then, the cost of the destruction of rangeland for agricultural development was estimated using some of the indicators of measuring the economic values of ecosystems. Results showed that the change cover land is increasing quickly in some parts of the basin, while water scarcity of Zayanderood basin has remained in critical condition. Also, an economic value of at least US$1455.49per hectare was delivered to people in 2015 by the rangeland and the cost of destruction rangelands was USS10559.6per hectare over the last decade. Considering the impact of natural resource services destruction on person's welfare, proposed to the decision makers to determine the high social value of rangeland for assessment of agricultural development projects.

AB  - Water is the important limitations of management in Zayanderood basin. Adoption and implementation of basin water management bill as provincial in the parliament in 2006. Zayanderood basin management became a dual management and increased the environmental degradation for agricultural production in the west of the basin. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the non-expert decision of managers on the environment and water in the west of the Zayanderud basin. So, land cover changes were investigated using Landsat images in the basin from 1993 to 2015. Then, the cost of the destruction of rangeland was estimated in this area for agricultural development. In this study, some of the indicators for measuring the economic values of ecosystems have improved compared to previous studies. Results showed that the change cover land is increasing quickly, while water scarcity of Zayanderood basin has remained in critical condition. Also, an economic value of at least US$1179.77 per hectare was delivered to people in 2015 by the rangeland and the cost of destruction rangelands was $10,247.3 per hectare over the last decade. The total cost of the destruction of rangelands was calculated around US$21,341,342.5 from 2008 to 2015 in this area. The result showed the impact of natural resource services destruction on person's welfare. So, proposed to the decision makers to consider the economic value of rangeland for assessment of agricultural development projects, because the projects with high social costs is not adopted in this area.

AB  - Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) is the process of differencing two Interferograms for measuring surface movement with an accuracy of millimeter range. The DInSAR process can be applied to observe glacier movement, earthquake deformations, volcanic activities and rate of subsidence or uplift caused due to the extraction of groundwater or coal. By using single pass interferometry technique we can also generate accurate DEM. In this paper, we are presenting the movement of a Chhota Shigri glacier with the help two pass DInSAR technique and mainly we concentrated on the optimum conditions for estimating glacier movement using DInSAR. We got good coherence and Interferogram fringes for L-band sensor with less temporal baseline. Therefore, we generated glacier velocity using ALOS-2 data with 14 days temporal baseline. Initially, we generated Interferogram (defo-pair) by taking 10th March 2015 image as a master and 24 th March 2015 image as a slave. But this generated Interferogram also having topographic information and atmospheric errors with the displacement component. Therefore, we used SRTM DEM for removing topographic information from the Interferogram. Because we are using L-band data, results may not be affected by troposphere. Maximum glacier velocity we observed in the accumulation zone as 7.285 cm/day in the month of March and while it's moving towards ablation zone the glacier velocity is decreasing.

AB  - This paper examines the metaphorical structure of the 'liver' in Mongolian, within the framework of the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), formulated by Lakoff and Jonhson (1980). This study presents a case in which an abstract concept (soul) is understood in part via a conceptual metaphor grounded in the body, but shaped by a culture-specific metaphorical understanding of an internal organ (liver) inside the body. Although the human body is a potentially universal source domain for metaphors structuring abstract concepts, cultural models set up specific perspectives from which certain aspects of bodily experience or certain parts of the body are viewed as salient and meaningful in the understanding of those abstract concepts.The cultural experience and knowledge we gain while submerged in our culture inevitably shape our worldview, making our mind enculturated. The interaction between common bodily experiences and varied cultural experiences determines the extent to which conceptual metaphors are universal, widespread, or culture-specific. At the same time, the same basic embodied experiences, in which many conceptual metaphors are grounded, may be defined differently by different cultural beliefs and values (Gibbs, 1999).In the same sense in Mongolian the selection of this source domain depends on a culture-specific metaphorical understanding of an internal organ, the liver, inside the body, namely “THE LIVER AS A CONTAINER OF EMOTIONS, THE LIVER AS AN OBJECT”. Mongolian cultural models set up specific perspectives from which certain aspect of bodily experience or certain parts of the body is viewed as especially salient and meaningful in the understanding of that abstract concept.Linguistic evidence suggests that both of these conceptual metaphors exist in the core of the Mongolian cultural model for the concept of LIVER.

TI  - Comparative ozone responses of cutleaf coneflowers (<i>Rudbeckia laciniata</i> var. <i>digitata</i>, var. <i>ampla</i>) from Rocky Mountain and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks, USA.
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutleaf coneflower (Rudbeckia laciniata L. var. digitata) is native to Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) and an ozone bioindicator species. Variety ampla, whose ozone sensitivity is less well known, is native to Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO). In the early 2000s, researchers found putative ozone symptoms on var. ampla and rhizomes were sent to Appalachian State University to verify that the symptoms were the result of ozone exposure. In 2011, potted plants were exposed to ambient ozone from May to August. These same plants were grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) in 2012 and 2013, and exposed to charcoal-filtered (CF), non-filtered (NF), elevated ozone (EO), NF + 50 ppb in 2012 for 47 days and NF + 30/NF + 50 ppb ozone in 2013 for 36 and 36 days, respectively. Ozone symptoms similar to those found in ROMO (blue-black adaxial stippling) were reproduced both in ambient air and in the OTCs. Both varieties exhibited foliar injury in the OTCs in an exposure-dependent manner, verifying that symptoms resulted from ozone exposure. In two of the three study years, var. digitata appeared more sensitive than var. ampla. Exposure to EO caused reductions in ambient photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) for both varieties. Light response curves indicated that ozone reduced A, g(s), and the apparent quantum yield while it increased the light compensation point. In CF air, var. ampla had higher light saturated A (18.2 +/- 1.04 vs 11.6 +/- 0.37 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), higher light saturation (1833 +/- 166.7 vs 1108 +/- 141.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), and lower Ci/Ca ratio (0.67 +/- 0.01 vs 0.77 +/- 0.01) than var. digitata. Coneflowers in both Parks are adversely affected by exposure to ambient ozone and if ozone concentrations increase in the Rocky Mountains, greater amounts of injury on var. ampla can be expected.

AB  - Remote sensing of Antarctic sea ice is required to characterize properties of the vast sea ice cover to understand its long-term increase in contrast to the decrease of Arctic sea ice. For this objective, the OIB/TanDEM-X Coordinated Science Campaign (OTASC) was successfully conducted in 2017 to obtain contemporaneous and collocated remote sensing data from NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) TanDEM-X Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system at X band together with Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 SARs at C band in conjunction with WorldView satellite spectral sensors, surface measurements, and field observations. The Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea were two primary regions while SAR data were also collected over six other regions in the Southern Ocean. Satellite SAR data included both polarimetric and interferometric capabilities to infer snow and sea ice information in three dimensions (3D), while OIB/P-3 aircraft data include snow radar together with altimeter data for snow and sea ice observations in 3D over the Weddell Sea. Across the Ross Sea, IcePOD and AntNZ/York-University flights were carried out together with satellite SAR data acquisitions.

TI  - Estimation of Maize grain yield using multispectral satellite data sets (SPOT 5) and the random forest algorithm
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation is a very important aspect in food production as it provides information to policy and decision makers that can guide food supply not only to a nation but also influence its import and export dynamics. Remote sensing has the ability to provide the given tool for crop yield predictions before harvesting. This study utilised canopy reflectance from a multispectral sensor to develop vegetation indices that serve as input variables into an empirical pre-harvest maize (Zea mays) yield prediction model in the north eastern section in Free State province of South Africa. Some fields in this region that were grown of maize under rain-fed conditions were monitored and the grain harvested after 7-8 months with actual yields measured. The acquisition of suitable medium resolution SPOT 5 images over this area was in March and June before the grains were harvested in July of 2014. A number of well known spectral indices were developed using the visible and near infrared bands. Through the random forest algorithm predictive models, maize grain yields were estimated successfully from the March images. The accuracies of these models were of an R-2 of 0.92 (RMSEP = 0.11, MBE = -0.08) for the Agnes field and for Cairo the R-2 was 0.9 (RMSEP = 0.03, MBE = 0.004). These results were produced by the SAVI and NDVI respectively for both fields. It was therefore evident that the predictive model applied in this study was site specific and would be interesting to be tested for an optimal period during the plant life cycle to predict grain yields of maize in South Africa.

TI  - Clinical and epidemiological characterization of influenza virus infections in children with severe acute respiratory infection in Maputo, Mozambique: Results from the implementation of sentinel surveillance, 2014 - 2016
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - In Sub-Saharan Africa, where burden, impact, and incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the highest in the world, conversely, the epidemiology of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is incompletely known. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza-associated SARI in hospitalized children in Maputo city, Mozambique. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children aged 0-14 years old who met the case definition for SARI in two hospitals in Maputo city after their parents or legal representative consented to participate. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and demographic data. Typing and subtyping of influenza were performed by real-time PCR. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 2,007 eligible children were recruited, of whom 1,997 (99.5%) were screened for influenza by real-time PCR. The median age of participants was 16.9 months (IQR: 7.0-38.9 months) and 53.9% (1076/1991) were male. A total of 77 were positive for influenza, yielding a frequency of 3.9% (77/1,991), with the highest frequency being reported in the age group 1-5 years old. Cases of influenza peaked twice each year, during which, its frequency reached up to 60%-80%. Among all influenza confirmed cases, 33.7% (26/77), 35.1% (27/77) and 28.6% (22/77) were typed as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B, respectively. This represents the first report of influenza in urban/sub urban setting in Mozambique and the first evidence of distribution of strains of influenza in the country. Our data showed that frequency of influenza was lower than reported in a rural setting in Mozambique and the frequency of seasonal (A/H1N1pdm09) and (A/H3N2) subtypes were similar in children with SARI.

TI  - Decomposition of Landsat 8 OLI Images by Simplified Spectral Patterns for Land Cover Mapping
T2  - 2018 10TH IAPR WORKSHOP ON PATTERN RECOGNITION IN REMOTE SENSING (PRRS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th IAPR Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing (PRRS)
CL  - Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Decomposition of multispectral image data has recently become the focus of remote sensing scientists because it improves efficiency of land cover mapping by data reduction. The three main traditional techniques used for decomposition are principal component analysis, linear spectral mixing, and pattern decomposition. This paper presents a new method of pattern decomposition using simplified spectral patterns. Spectral characteristics of land cover are analyzed using the shape of their spectral reflectance curves, leading to decomposition of an image into component images with pixels that are characterized by spectral reflectance curves of the same shape. The author proposes a method for converting a spectral reflectance curve from an analog to a simplified digital form consisted of 15 digits of zeros, ones, and twos. This form of the spectral reflectance curve is called simplified spectral pattern (SSP). One hundred Landsat 8 OLI scenes of 14 global biomes were collected for the research. The study found that 34 dominant simplified spectral patterns represent land cover types in selected scenes, covering 96.53% of the total 4,150,671,513 pixels. SSP correlates with single land cover types such as water, ice, and snow or with multiple land cover types such as vegetation, minerals, rock, and soil.

TI  - Expansion of major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009 using satellite scatterometer data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A consistent dataset delineating and characterizing changes in urban environments will be valuable for socio-economic and environmental research and for sustainable urban development. Remotely sensed data have been long used to map urban extent and infrastructure at various spatial and spectral resolutions. Although many datasets and approaches have been tried, there is not yet a universal way to map urban extents across the world. Here we combined a microwave scatterometer (QuikSCAT) dataset at similar to 1 km posting with percent impervious surface area (%ISA) data from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) that was generated from Landsat data, and ambient population data from the LandScan product to characterize and quantify growth in nine major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend tests on backscatter time series from urban areas show significant expanding trends in eight of nine urban areas with p-values ranging 0.032 to 0.001. The sole exception is Houston, which has a substantial non-urban backscatter at the northeastern edge of the urban core. Strong power law scaling relationships between ambient population and either urban area or backscatter power (r(2) of 0.96 in either model) with sub-linear exponents (beta of 0.911 and 0.866, respectively) indicate urban areas become more compact with more vertical built-up structure than lateral expansion to accommodate the increased population. Increases in backscatter and %ISA datasets between 2001 and 2006 show agreement in both magnitude and direction for all urban areas except Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP), likely due to the presence of many lakes and ponds throughout the MSP metropolitan area. We conclude discussing complexities in the backscatter data caused by large metal structures and rainfall.

AB  - Space Monitoring Data Center (SMDC) of SINP MSU is one of the several centers in the world that collects data on the radiational conditions in near-Earth orbit from various Russian (Lomonosov, Electro-L1, Electro-L2, Meteor-M1, Meteor-M2, etc.) and foreign (GOES 13, GOES 15, ACE, SDO, etc.) satellites. The primary purposes of SMDC are: aggregating heterogeneous data from different sources; providing a unified interface for data retrieval, visualization, analysis, as well as development and testing new space weather models; and controlling the correctness and completeness of data. Space weather models rely on data provided by SMDC to produce forecasts. Therefore, monitoring the whole data processing cycle is crucial for further success in the modeling of physical processes in near-Earth orbit based on the collected data. To solve the problem described above, we have developed a framework called Live Monitor at SMDC. Live Monitor allows watching all stages and program components involved in each data processing cycle. All activities of each stage are logged by Live Monitor and shown in real-time on a web interface. When an error occurs, a notification message will be sent to satellite operators via email and the Telegram messenger service so that they could take measures in time. The Live Monitor's API can be used to create a customized monitoring service with minimum coding.

TI  - Land Cover Classification at the Wildland Urban Interface using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - Seattle, WA
AB  - Land cover classification analysis from satellite imagery is important for monitoring change in ecosystems and urban growth over time. However, the land cover classifications that are widely available in the United States are generated at a low spatial and temporal resolution, so that the spatial distribution between vegetation and urban areas in the wildland urban interface is difficult to measure. High spatial and temporal resolution analysis is essential for understanding and managing changing environments in these regions. This paper describes an end to end satellite data ingestion and analysis pipeline using deep learning on high resolution satellite imagery for generating pixel-based land cover classification.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-1A data for rice crop classification using random forests and support vector machines
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed an approach to map rice-cropping systems in An Giang and Dong Thap provinces, South Vietnam using multi-temporal Sentinel-1A (S1A) data. The data were processed through four steps: (1) data pre-processing, (2) constructing smooth time series VH backscatter data, (3) rice crop classification using random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) and (4) accuracy assessment. The results indicated that the smooth VH backscatter profiles reflected the temporal characteristics of rice-cropping patterns in the study region. The comparisons between the classification results and the ground reference data indicated that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient achieved from RF were 86.1% and 0.72, respectively, which were slightly more accurate than SVM (overall accuracy of 83.4% and Kappa coefficient of 0.67). These results were reaffirmed by the government's rice area statistics with the relative error in area (REA) values of 0.2 and 2.2% for RF and SVM, respectively.

TI  - Decadal assessment of urban sprawl and its effects on local temperature using Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has increasingly become a prevailing issue confronting scientists worldwide due to its effects on temperature and environment. This study explored effects of decadal urbanization on local temperature from Landsat data in Cantho city, Vietnam from 1996 to 2016. The mapping results of built-up areas achieved from the random forests (RFs) indicated the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients higher than 89.5% and 0.79. Cantho city had been drastically expanded with the built-up areas increasing from 1,274.0 ha in 1996 to 2,932.7 ha in 2006, and 3,428.8 ha in 2016, respectively. The urbanization by transforming opened lands to artificial surfaces had led to effects on the city temperature. The results of temperature retrieved from Landsat data revealed the temperature obtained for 1996 in range of 25.7-37.1 degrees C, while the values for 2006 and 2016 falling between 26.3-37.3 degrees C and 24.1-40.2 degrees C, respectively. The average temperature of urban areas had increased 0.8 degrees C from 31.7 degrees C in 1996 to 32.5 degrees C in 2016. Considering 32 degrees C as an uncomfortably hot threshold that may affect the human health and environment, only 637.7 ha was observed for 1996, while those for 2006 and 2016 increased to 1,131.9 ha and 2,155.4 ha, respectively.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimation and prediction for oasis transect in middle reach of Heihe river basin based on METRIC and CA_Markov model

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) over different land surfaces is not only a key parameter for regional ecosystem simulation, but also an important component in basin water cycle research and water resources management. With the population continuously growing, the area of cropland in the middle reach of Heihe River basin has soared and now makes up about 95% of the total arable land. The water used in the region accounts for 68% of the total water resources consumed in the entire basin, of which the main expenditure is evapotranspiration of farmland. The large amount of agricultural water consumption has led to a series of ecological and social conflicts, which highlight the great importance in understanding the evolution of oasis ecosystem and rational allocation of regional water resources. Quantifying regional evapotranspiration and predicting evapotranspiration fluctuation reasonably in a certain period may offer a new method to resolve the conflicts. We select a representative oasis transect as the study area, using Landsat data and meteorological data during the middle crop growth stage in the summer from 2001 to 2016 as the main source data. A one-source model named Mapping evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) is selected to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of the ET in the study area. Based on derived ET with METRIC, the development trend of ET in 2022 is predicted by a simulation method with CA_Markov model. The experimental results indicate the following results. 1) The regional distribution change of ET, processed by density slice, is closely related to the evolution of land types in the study area, and its development trend can reflect the change pattern of different land types. Statistical results show that the area of desert region notably decreases while the area of oasis region rises, which is consistent with the visual results. 2) From 2001 to 2007, the area of river region increased, suggesting that the past water-managing measures worked. However, between 2007 and 2016, the area of river region gradually shrank with the continuous increase of agricultural and urban water use. It is predicted that in 2022, the area of river region will decline further, the burden of water resources will be aggravated. 3) The prediction results obtained by combining METRIC model and CA_Markov model can get a preferable accuracy (kappa>0.4) in some conditions, but it is worth noting that they are affected by many factors, e.g., time span and parameter setting. 4) The method can achieve credible precision in short-term prediction. However, with the extension of the prediction span, the pixels with similar state characteristics will gradually aggregate and generate spots, which can result in some deviation.

TI  - Plastic ingestion in aquatic-associated bird species in southern Portugal
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive use of plastics in daily life and the inappropriate disposal of plastic products are severely affecting wildlife species in both coastal and aquatic environments. Birds are top-predators, exposed to all threats affecting their environments, making them ideal sentinel organisms for monitoring ecosystems change. We set a baseline assessment of the prevalence of marine plastic litter affecting multi-species populations of aquatic birds in southern Portugal. By examining 160 stomach contents from 8 species of aquatic birds, we show that 22.5% were affected by plastic debris. Plastic was found in Ciconia ciconia, Larus fuscus and L. michahellis. Ciconia ciconia ingested the highest amount (number of items and total mass) of plastic debris. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, silicones) was the most abundant polymer and was recorded only in C. ciconia. Plastic ingestion baseline data are of crucial importance to evaluate changes through time and among regions and to define management and conservation strategies.

TI  - Evaluation of the S-NPP VIIRS land surface temperature product using ground data acquired by an autonomous system at a rice paddy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The S-NPP VIIRS Land Surface Temperature (LST) product attained the stage V1 of validation maturity (provisional validated) at the end of 2014. This paper evaluates the current VIIRS V1 LST product versus concurrent ground data acquired at a rice paddy site from December 2014 to August 2016. The experimental site has three different seasonal and homogeneous land covers through the year, which makes the site interesting for validation activities. An autonomous and multiangular system was used to record continuous ground data at the site. The data acquired at zenith angles similar to the VIIRS viewing angles were used for the validation to avoid possible differences between satellite and ground views due to angular dependences of the LSTs. Concurrently to surface data, downwelling sky radiances were measured at different incidence angles by the system, which were used to improve the cloud screening of the validation dataset, since cloud leakage was identified in previous validation studies as an important issue for further improvement. The validation results show good performance for the VIIRS V1 LST product at zenith angles <= 40 degrees, with systematic uncertainties within +/- 0.5 K and accuracies around 1.2 K. These values are within the threshold requirements established for the VIIRS LST product, and they are better than the validation results published previously for the beta version of the product or using VIIRS data reprocessed with the calibrated algorithm coefficients implemented from April 2014. As the VIIRS LST algorithm has regression coefficients dependent on land cover type, the impact of land cover misclassifications on VIIRS LST data accuracy was also evaluated. It was expected that changing the surface type assigned by the VIIRS product to more appropriate types at the site pixels should improve the validation results. However, the improvement was limited, likely due to the reduced range of variability of the emissivities considered for the different land cover types in the regression process of the VIIRS LST algorithm coefficients. The results reveal the difficulties and uncertainties involved in the LST retrieval when using a LST algorithm with surface type dependent coefficients.

AB  - High and very-high resolution remote sensing data provided by the processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images via Differential Interferometry techniques (DInSAR) allow detecting ground surface displacements that can be used in monitoring/control of urban areas and integrated within procedures aimed at analyzing the vulnerability of affected facilities (e.g. structures and infrastructure). In this regard, this paper presents the results of a study that combines DInSAR data and information gathered from damage surveys to buildings interacting with slow-moving landslides. In particular, relationships between cause (DInSAR-derived differential settlements of buildings) and effect (recorded building damages) are retrieved and empirical fragility and vulnerability curves (to be used for damage forecasting purposes) are generated. Considering the encouraging outcomes, the adopted methodological approach can be successfully integrated within a more general framework for the management of slow-moving landslide risk to which urban areas are exposed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Nowadays, optical and radar remote sensing data are increasingly used for land-cover/vegetation mapping and monitoring. Their technical capabilities and tools are improving all the time and provide more accurate results. By the recent arrival of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 series, available free, processing and methods of analysis must be increased more and more in the field of cartography. This paper aims to present vegetation mapping method in the Pays de Brest area by using a time series stacking of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 satellites data using the algorithm Random Forest supervised classification. The types of vegetation mapping in first time are those belonging to the major vegetation types, but especially those that can be observed on the processed images that are the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 series and SPOT-6. The types of classes considered for this study are: no vegetation, forest and undergrowth, moors and lawns, summer crops, winter crops, grassland and water. Several time series stacking has been made on that series containing 140 images radar representing different dates (2017) and the best combination method is to use both the two polarizations VV and VH to the calculation of the matrix of confusion. On the other hand, combinations of SAR images with different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, S2rep, IRECI) calculated from the Images Sentinel-2 have been made. The series of times series stacking ends with combinations between SPOT-6 and Sentinel-1. The times series stacking Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 are satisfactory, with an overall accuracy that reaches 93%. Such precision is very good for data that are available free.

TI  - Lymph Node Radiotherapy Instead of Extended Axillary Surgery - the New Standard?
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer treatment has undergone major changes in the last 20 years. Specifically, the role of axillary lymph node dissection has changed from radical axillary dissection with excision of a high number of lymph nodes to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This paradigm shift is associated with a controversial debate regarding the significance of axillary staging, the need for surgery, and the role of radiotherapy. Looking ahead, lymph node staging and axillary treatment might shift from SLNB and/or axillary dissection to ultrasound-guided needle biopsy and irradiation of regional lymph nodes in order to reduce treatment-related sequelae in early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Development and Qualification Test of 1.2-Nm Torque Reaction Wheel Assembly with Low Induced Vibration
T2  - 2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference
CL  - Big Sky, MT
AB  - A reaction wheel assembly(RWA) that satisfies the requirement for high torque output and low induced vibration requirements is a critical equipment needed to realize agile maneuvering satellite missions for high-resolution observation. It also enables such missions with smaller size and mass compared to those using control moment gyros.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Mitsubishi Precision Co., Ltd. (MPC) have completed the development and qualification test campaign of such a high torque output RWA with low induced vibration. The specifications are as follows: maximum output torque of 1.2 Nm, induced vibration torque of 0.2 Nm (below 200 Hz), total nominal mass of 16.7 kg and electric power consumption of 40 W at steady state and 599 W at maximum acceleration. Flight-proven RWAs mounted on JAXA's ALOS-2 satellite with output torque of 0.9 Nm are the base models for this 1.2-Nm RWA. Moreover, there are plans to manufacture more than ten RWAs of this 1.2-Nm version for JAXA's upcoming satellite missions, such as the Advanced Optical/Radar Satellite Program.This paper describes the successful completion of RWA development and the qualification test campaign in detail.

T2  - Trudy VNIRO
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of oceanological conditions in the Japan Sea was carried out by satellite and ship information in May-June 2000-2017. Satellite data is represented by the sea surface images in the infrared and optical bands, and the ship information is represented by deep-sea measurements of temperature and salinity at standard oceanographic cross sections. According to altimetric data, maps of the sea level anomalies were constructed with the aim to identify geostrophic circulation in the springs of the years under study. The joint use of satellite and oceanographic information allowed to execute a three-dimensional analysis of oceanological structures (currents, fronts and their sections, anticyclones and water masses). As a result of this work, the typification of the spring seasons 2000-2017 to three groups - the water thermodynamics, the position of oceanographic structures on satellite maps and on the oceanographic sections was performed. The dominant feature of typification is the water thermal state. It is shown that the water temperature fluctuations can influence the survival rate of walleye pollock in the early stages of ontogeny and the formation of annual classes abundance only indirectly, primarily through biota.

AB  - The large Zeya hydropower dam is located on the Zeya River, the largest left-bank tributary of the Amur-Heilong River in Russia. The dam had been constructed by 1980 and its operation has significantly transformed the flow regime of the Zeya River. The flow regulation has reduced the magnitude of periodic flooding of the floodplain areas located downstream from the Zeya dam and disrupted habitats of flora and fauna. An estimation of the transformation of the freshwater ecosystems is required to develop measures necessary either to maintain or restore disrupted ecosystems. Application of remote sensing methods allows measuring characteristics of the ecosystem's components. Two sections of a floodplain below the Zeya dam were considered for analysis in order to detect changes in objects at each site during the comparison of remote data from 1969/ 1971 and 2016.

AB  - The problem of the trinity in the world as the focus of the Universe, in particular, in the context of epic works, often touched upon in research, in the center of which is the text of the Olonkho - one of the oldest genres of the oral creativity of the Sakha people.The article is discussed the traditional clothing of the Sakha based on the text of the heroic epic Olonkho. The authors focuses on identifying and describing the Olonkho characters, representatives of the three worlds - Upper, Middle and Lower. According to the Yakut mythology, the Universe consisted of three worlds - the Upper, Middle and Lower, located one above the other or floors above one another.In the Middle World, defined implied as the center of the Universe, but it does not have its own, there living people. Here live animals and a variety of supernatural beings. In other worlds live supernatural nature-spirits.As the researchers write, any description of clothes in Olonkho is no accidental, that the clothes of the epic Olonkho can be regarded as a kind of ethnic sign, based on the traditional worldview and conduct of the Yakut people, that common genetic traits with the vast Turkic-Mongolian world have survived, the Yakut ethnos developed many common mythological ideas, rituals, developed a unique, characteristic only to the Yakuts, ways of symbolizing the world, that clothing carries a special sacral ritual function, that form, decoration and symbol of the products of traditional Yakut folk art show a significant influence on the formation of the foundations of the Yakut material and spiritual culture of both local and North American Paleoasians and ancient culture of the nomads of Eurasia.It is established that the text of this Olonkho contains a detailed description of the headdress and its details, types of outerwear (fur coats, coats, etc.) and shoes, which reflects the idea of the inhabitants of the three worlds. In this regard, the epic text serves as a kind of source of reconstruction of the coded informative material. The function of clothing as an indicator of the social status, financial position of its owner is identified.The problem of description considered in this article as part of the traditional Sakha culture in the context of the epic text correlates with the study of the question of who and how works in the simulated space.

AB  - The algorithm for estimation of the quantum yield of phytoplankton fluorescence from the remote sensing satellite of the MODIS tool is discussed in the paper. There is an example of manifestation of the iron limitation in the Amundsen Sea. Amundsen Sea encloses two polynyas: Fe-limited ASP (Amundsen Sea Polynya) and Fe-replete PIP (Pine Island Polynya). We present a procedure for comparing the mean values of the quantum yield of phytoplankton fluorescence in these regions and the requirements for it. To meet these requirements, the data of two satellite systems were analyzed and compared: MODIS and AVHRR. Analysis of the data made it possible to observe the differences in the mean values of the quantum yield of phytoplankton fluorescence in these two regions during the bloom period of the Amundsen Sea phytoplankton in 2012.

TI  - A Q-methodological study of personal worldviews.
T2  - Journal for person-oriented research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Psychological research on personal worldviews has relied almost exclusively on a quantitative approach that is ill-equipped to fully capture human subjectivity. Using Q-methodology, this study revealed the multiplicity of meanings and internal structures of the worldviews of eighty Swedish adults across the domains of metaphysics, epistemology, human nature, morality, and values. Four coherent worldview Q-factors were extracted and interpreted qualitatively. Ontological and epistemological beliefs proved to be the highest in terms of subjective significance and divergence between worldviews, although they have been largely ignored in past research. The results were in part supportive of polarity theory, which describes the structure of worldviews in terms of the opposition between humanistic and normativistic positions, while also suggesting amendments to this theory, by illuminating the differences between hedonistic and openness-focused forms of humanism and between empiricist and rationalist, as well as religious and atheistic, forms of normativism, and the ways in which elements of both positions are combined or rejected. The findings illustrate how Q-methodology can be used to elaborate and correct the understandings of personal worldviews that are produced by traditional quantitative forms of inquiry.

TI  - Meanings of 'The Local' in a Swedish Rural Development Organization All Sweden Shall Live!
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Organized rural development in Sweden can be described at two levels; a local level with a large number of local actors organized in a so-called village-action movement, and a national level where political parties and the government present different suggestions on how to develop rural areas. However, characteristic for Sweden is also a close relationship between these two levels and a bottom-up perspective encouraging local initiatives, which is exemplified by All Sweden Shall Live (ASSL); a general rural development organization characterized by both policy-making ambitions and support of local development projects.A central but also ambiguous concept in the organization ASSL's campaigns and ideology is 'the local,' and with discourse theory, as a point of departure, this case-study examines how different meanings of 'the local' are used to advocate investments in local perspectives and local measures. Special attention is directed towards how meanings of 'the local' form a 'fantasy,' an emotional and ideological worldview, and how this worldview is of importance in the organization's self-legitimization and for its potential as an agent of political mobilization. While ASSL is a Swedish organization, the subject is of general relevance because ideological investments in both 'the local' and 'the regional' are common, for example, in processes of relocalization-local responses to globalization-and in arguments about the importance of localities and regions in a global economy. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how such investments can have unexpected effects such as the transfer of responsibility for rural development from the government to local actors.

TI  - Optimal Band Configuration for the Roof Surface Characterization Using Hyperspectral and LiDAR Imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging spectroscopy in the remote sensing is an ever emerging platform that has offered the hyperspectral imaging (HSI) which delivers the Earth's object information in hundreds of bands. HSI integrates conventional imaging with spectroscopy to get rich spectral and spatial features of the object. However, the challenges associated with HSI are its huge dimensionality and data redundancy that requests huge space, complex computations, and lengthier processing time. Therefore, this study aims to find the optimal bands to characterize the roof surfaces using supervised classifiers. To deal with high dimensionality of hyperspectral data, this study assesses the band selection method over data transformation methods. This study provides the comparison between data reduction methods and used classifiers. The height information from LiDAR was used to characterize urban roofs above the height of 2.5 meters. The optimal bands were investigated using supervised classifiers such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and spectral angle mapper (SAM) by comparing accuracies. The classification result shows that ANN and SVM classifiers outperform whereas SAM performed poorly in roof characterization. The band selection method worked efficiently than the transformation methods. The classification algorithm successfully identifies the optimum bands with significant accuracy.

AB  - IntroductionWe report the first case in Albania of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using isotope mapping and nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM), with immediate breast reconstruction with prosthesis and biological mesh (ADM).Case presentationA 49-year-old woman presented at the Ambulatory of Breast Surgery of the Hygeia Hospital Tirana, Albania, (private hospital), on 10th October 2014, for a nodule in her breast. At palpation of the right breast, it was evident one mass of 2 cm on the upper outer quadrant, without skin retracing, and a mobile nodule of 1 cm in the right axillary region. Fine needle aspiration shows C5 (mammary carcinoma). This case was diagnosed as right breast cancer T2 N1 Mx clinically.All the laboratory examinations were normal. This case was selected to be submitted to surgical procedures: right nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) and immediate breast reconstruction using prosthesis and biological mesh and sentinel lymph node biopsy, during a live surgical course on 25 October 2014 at Hygeia Hospital Tirana. Lymphoscintigraphy with technetium was performed. Surgery started with sentinel lymph node biopsy, that revealed isolated tumour cells (ITS), followed by nipple sparing mastectomy, with immediate reconstruction using prosthesis and biological mesh (ADM). The definitive biopsy of the brest nodule resulted: infiltrative carcinomatous subtype medullar, pTlc N0(i+) Mx; IHC: ER 0%, PR 0%, Her-2/neu 0, Ki67 60%.The post operatory period was normal, without incidents, and the patient left the hospital 3 days after surgery. The patient started chemotherapy: doxorubicin 50 mg 2 fl and endoxan 500 mg 2fl per day therapy, 4 cycles, every 3 weeks, followed by doxetaxel 80 mg 2 fl per day, every 3 weeks, 4 cycles. The patient has done the periodic clinical visits, with no problems related to the aesthetical situation. She was satisfied with booth results: treatment of the oncological problem and avoidance of breast disfigurement. She has a very good psychosocial situation, as evaluated by the psychosocial service, made during patient's interview.ConclusionsThis case had high importance in our experience of surgical breast cancer treatment. For the first time, it was possible to perform the sentinel lymph node biopsy using isotope mapping and immediate reconstruction of the breast with prosthesis and biological mesh, avoiding unnecessary axillary dissection and disfigurement of the body image. All was solved timely through only one surgical procedure.

AB  - Particulate matter(PM) is one of the main pollutants in the atmosphere, which is harmful to human. PM10 and PM2.5 became the main subject attracting more and more interest. To compensate the weakness of conventional observation method, application of remote sensing tools have been widely used in environmental monitoring. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data has a high temporal resolution, which, at present, is an ideal data source in simulative monitoring of regional-scale environment changes. In this study, we focused on PM2.5 and AOD(Aerosol Optical Depth) in coastal areas. Correlation between each two of them was analyzed. From the daily average value year of two sites PM2.5, the concentration of air particulate pollutants is low before and after summer, and the heating season is higher in winter and spring. The average PM2.5 concentration value of 2014 and 2015 is 50.11 mu g/m(3) and 41.11 mu g/m(3) respectively in Fushan station, and that of the Laishan station is 45.63 mu g/m(3)and 38.73 mu g/m(3) respectively. From the interannual variation, the concentration of air particulate pollutants in the two regions has a tendency to decrease. According to the new standard of air quality of the PM2.5 monitoring network, the air quality of the vast majority of dates belongs to the excellent grade. In light of the policy of air pollution, the PM2.5 concentration in 2015 was lower than that in 2014. Due to the complexity of atmospheric components and their interactions, and the spatial and temporal constraints of PM2.5 detection resulted in a low correlation between the AOT and PM2.5.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneities of substrate type, water-surface roughness and also inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the water column can pose substantial challenges to optical remote sensing of fluvial bathymetry. Development of robust techniques with respect to the optical complexities of riverine environments is then central to produce accurate bathymetry maps over large spatial extents. The empirical (regression-based) techniques (e.g., Lyzenga's model) have widely been applied for estimation of bathymetry from optical imagery in inland/coastal waters. The models in the literature are built upon only magnitude-related predictors derived from spectral radiances/reflectances at different bands. However, optically complicating factors such as variations in bottom type and water column constituents can change not only the magnitude but also the shape of water-leaving spectra. This research incorporates spectral derivatives as shape-related predictors in order to enhance the description of spectra through the regression-based depth retrieval. A stepwise regression is utilized to select the optimal predictors among all the possible Lyzenga (i.e., magnitude-related) and derivative (i.e., shape-related) predictors. Radiative transfer simulations are used to examine the bathymetry models in optically-complex shallow rivers by considering variable bottom-types and IOPs. The methods are also applied to a WorldView-3 image of the Sarca River located in Italian Alps and resultant bathymetry estimates are assessed using in-situ measurements. The results indicate the effectiveness of spectral derivatives in improving the accuracies of depth retrievals particularly for optically-complex waters.

AB  - In this present world, due to the increasing adverse effect of anthropological activities on the natural environment causes a large scale environmental degradation which directly reduces the suitable natural environment for human habitation. As a consequence, in recent years, human realised the need for a favourable natural environment which is adoptable for habitation. In this present study, some of the following five criterions such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), vegetation coverage, impervious surface, wetness and water condition derived from the remotely sensed data were used to evaluate the Natural Human habitation Environment Suitability Index (NHESI) along the coastal taluks of Tamil Nadu. Landsat-7 (ETM+) images and Landsat-8 (OLI/TIRS) images with a spatial resolution of 30m have been used to derive the evaluation factors of NHESI for the year of 2000 and 2018. Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) based Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and fuzzy linear membership has been used in this study to evaluate the weighs and ratings of each criterion and its classes. The best NHESI is seen in 2000 where a total area of about 13902.9 km (2) comes under the habitable region, against an area of 7726.9 km(2) in 2018. The study area is further classified into moderately habitable, marginally habitable and uninhabitable regions. This study clearly indicates the degradation of the natural environmental conditions for human habitation. This kind of habitability study will help the researchers, decision makers and government agencies in creating awareness and adopting policies in the spatial planning of human land utilization for habitability.

AB  - The need for comprehensive prognostic meteorological models is paramount in various applications related to environmental assessment. The inclusion of urban land cover in the computational domain in mesoscale models introduces new challenges for accurately incorporating the complex interactions related to the dynamical and thermal effects of the urban canopy. Aiming to address these requirements, a new urban surface scheme was introduced in a mesoscale meteorological model incorporating parameterisations of the area-averaged effects of drag and turbulence production as well as an improved representation of the surface heat and moisture fluxes. In addition, an advanced data assimilation module was implemented for enabling the self-consistent estimation of anthropogenic heat fluxes on the basis of representative satellite data, as well as the introduction of resulting forcing in the surface energy budget. The enhanced version of the model was evaluated in two mesoscale applications covering the greater urban areas of Paris, France and Athens, Greece. The model was evaluated over the course of three periods of strong anticyclonic conditions, enabling a better assessment of the influence of urban effects. The results confirmed that the urban surface module enhancements led to a significant improvement of model performance. Finally, the assimilation of anthropogenic heat data in the model provided an improved capability of reproducing the observed spatial and temporal variation of surface temperature.

AB  - This paper presents a study on a new problem: applying machine learning approaches to translate remote sensing images between high-resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. To this end, conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been explored. Efficiency of the conditional GAN have been verified with different SAR parameters on three regions from the world: Toronto, Vancouver in Canada and Shanghai in China. The generated SAR images have been evaluated by pixel-based image classification with detailed land cover types including: low and high density residential area, industry area, construction site, golf course, water, forest, pasture and crops. In comparison with an unsupervised GAN translation approach, the proposed conditional GAN could effectively keep many land cover types with compatible classification accuracy to the ground truth SAR data. This is one of first study on multi-source remote sensing data translation by machine learning.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Rapid increase of population and urban sprawl have an immense impact on local climatic conditions. Urban heat island, increased surface roughness and enhanced aerosol are some of the prominent factors affecting precipitation in such highly populated urban areas. Among these, the complex interaction of aerosol particles with solar radiation have acknowledged their importance in radiation budget and hence climate dynamics Being cloud condensation nuclei they also influence cloud lifetime and microphysics in turn influencing precipitation. Present investigation emphases on understanding rainfall and aerosol trends and its spatial occurrence pattern with respect to urbanization. An approach where population as an indicator for urbanization is used in this study rather than a profound investigation on the individual factors of urban induced precipitation anomalies. Mann Kendall trend test is carried out at grid level on a 0.25 degree gridded rainfall data and the trends are then related with the distribution of population in the study area. Areas of significant rainfall trends are identified and are analyzed for spatial patterns around urban areas. These identified urban zones are then further analyzed for aerosol variability. Being a monsoon region, a seasonal variation of aerosols are performed. The results shows that during the monsoon season there is a significant increase in rainfall along the Western Ghats, whereas certain grids along the western coast located at the downwind of populated areas such a Mangalore shows a significant decreasing trend. The overall spatial pattern of rainfall trend during pre-monsoon season is indicative of the influence of urban areas on rainfall. This observation during the pre-monsoon season is quantified which shows that 61% of the trends are included within urban influence zones which are only 36% of the size of Karnataka. Further various cloud characteristics and its association with aerosol loading in these urban areas were investigated. The results are indicative of higher aerosol events suppressing rainfall in these urban areas.

AB  - Land degradation poses daunting challenges to Niger and the country has designed several policies and strategies for combatting it. Building on work past studies, this study uses new satellite data which have higher resolution and run for longer time - thus capturing the longterm land management dynamics. This study also uses an improved cost of land degradation model which nets out benefits from land improvement as well analysing the impacts of land degradation on food and nutrition security. Results show that in the past 25 years, Niger has rehabilitated over 10 million ha of bare land - or 2.6% of lands south of the desert - home to more than 90% of population. The annual total economic value of degradation was 2015 US$3.535 billion or 19% of the 2015 purchasing power parity gross domestic product. Rehabilitation of degraded land will have large impacts on household food and nutrition security. Yet, adoption rates of key land management practices are very low. The results suggest the need to Niger to find other incentives for increasing adoption of improved land management - such as payment for ecosystem services and improvement of road infrastructure, education and extension services.

AB  - Poor data quality impacts negatively on various classification approaches. Classification is part of an important aspect of research, and often there are missing values found in data, which poses a problem in critical decision-making in terms of accuracy. Often selecting the best approach to handle missing data can be a difficult task, as there are several conditions to consider. Remote sensing as a discipline is quite susceptible to missing data. The objective of this study is to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of four classifiers when dealing with the incomplete remote sensing data problem. Two remote sensing data sets are utilised for this task with a four-way repeated-measures design employed to analyse the results. Simulation results suggest k-nearest neighbour as a superior approach to handling missing data, especially when regression imputation is used. Most classifiers achieve lower accuracy when listwise deletion is used. Nonetheless, RF is much less robust to missing data compared to other classifiers such as ANN and SVM.

AB  - Collecting statistics from agricultural areas is a significant challenge. The mapping of land covers by using satellite images reaches very good accuracy indexes, nevertheless its dependence of reference field data limits the generation of maps in suitable time. The objective of this work was to explore the identification of areas cultivated with soybeans and corn, using reference data from other campaigns. To this end, we used Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images, the Meanshift segmentation algorithm, and the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm. As a result, we obtained a very well supported classification product, evidencing the convenience of considering the phenological stages in the determination of the classes to be used in the classification process. The contrasting morphological characteristics between soybean and corn plants, determined a key relationship between the canopy and the radiation in the near infrared spectrum, which possibly contributed to improve their discrimination.

AB  - This study estimated phase noise of interferogram by single-pass SAR interferometry using several pairs of TerraSAR-X series (TerraSAR-X and Tandem-X) datasets. Compared to the repeat-pass, the single-pass acquires data pairs simultaneously by utilizing dual-receive antenna mode. As a result, DEM errors for fixed ground objects were reduced due to the lack of temporal decorrelation of objects and atmospheric disturbance. This study also compared estimated DEM errors by ground object for each acquisition date in the Tsukuba study site, and discussed the features of the spike noise and offset noise. Quantitative analysis shows that the noise is around 2-4% at most.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Rice is the world's major staple food crop occupying over 12% of global cropland area which produces around 800 million tons. Nearly 90% of the world's rice is produced and consumed in Asian countries. Therefore, information on agricultural plantation area, yield, and production are essential to ensure food security of nearly 3 billion people. At the moment this information is either lacking in many countries or only available post-harvest, this is too late to input into any effecting policy in a specific year. Therefore, there is a pressing need to provide accurate and reliable yield estimation well ahead of harvest. In this project we explore potential of multi source remote sensing data coupled with crop model to provide country scale yield estimation in Thailand.For optical sensor, the study utilised Landsat8 OLI/TIRS satellite data to develop common vegetation indexes (VIs) approach to derive essential crop biophysical variables such as Leaf Area Index. This is supplemented with information from microwave sensor such as Sentinel 1 to overcome issues with cloud. At the end, we produced a regular time series of crop biophysical variable across the growing season. These satellite-based estimates were validated with dedicated field campaign in three provinces covering the entire growing season. Initial results suggest a good agreement between the optical/microwave derived crop biophysical variables and ground data. Finally, these will be used as an input to the ORYZA 2000 crop model to adjust the model parameters and develop a high resolution yield prediction.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article a critical reflexive model is described and applied to life stories of tertiary education students doing a masters in health promotion. At the heart of the process is the dialogical space where relational reflexivity is facilitated and around which the narrative story is developed. Examples from tertiary education are given to illustrate how working reflexively with life stories increases critical thinking and a sense of identity, belonging and agency. The approach is holistic in that it connects new knowledge to lived experience. It is based on a social constructionist worldview that uses a narrative lens which recognises that our knowledge is continuously constructed in context and in interaction with others. One way to understand ourselves and others is to understand our own and each other's stories. The model which facilitates this process involves four iterative loops: deconstructing power in the collective; mapping values and identity; negotiating agency; and rendering accountable performance.

AB  - SPOT 1 -> 5 satellites have collected more than 30 million images all over the word during the last 30 years which represents a unique historical dataset.SWH (SPOT World Heritage) is the CNES initiative to preserve and valorize this SPOT archive by providing new enhanced products in order to allow the use of past data to extend current temporal analyses. Indeed, this archive, hosted in CNES, is composed of raw binary data only accessible through commercial partner Airbus processing.A first step has begun in 2015 with a major update of this archive by repatriating as much data as possible from remote SPOT stations. Since 2016, SWH has become a dedicated CNES project including first developments. CNES has then started the data extraction from the current archive in order to build a new more useable archive at L1A image level. Meanwhile, data processing chains are being set-up to provide L1A, L1B and L1C products. L1A is the current SPOT 1A format including basic radiometric corrections due to instruments distortions. L1B and L1C will include additional radiometric and geometric corrections in line with Sentinel-2 references (L1C being the orthorectified product in Top Of Atmosphere reflectance). Specific SPOT 5 THR products will also be provided with a new optimized denoising algorithm. Finally, the last part of valorization will consist of providing freely these products to users (licensed).SWH processing will take place on CNES High Performance Computing Centre and will use Big Data technologies such as Elastic Stack for production monitoring.

T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines genre's specificity of J. Winterson's "Christmas Days: 12 Stories and 12 Feasts for 12 Days" (2016). The aim is to assess possibilities of the Christmas story in modern literary process. In these stories Winterson follows to the genre canon which Dickens had founded out. The ideal model of life with the happy home where loving each other people unite becomes the genre content. Social themes are distinctly traced in the most of this stories. The poverty of spirit is generated by the postindustrial society; the poverty of daily life is generated by the poverty of spirit. It is the main problem of J. Winterson's "Christmas Days stories".Winterson's worldview is generous and optimistic, stemming at least in part from the chief survival skill she learned early on - using her imagination The author shows the romantic side of familiar things. The didactic modus is expressed in training of the reader to art to find a miracle in an everyday life. In between the stories, Winterson grounds us in what she calls the "everyday ordinary miracle" of cooking The analysis of stories proves that they can be considered in an English context of "magic realism" in which we find the transformation of the common and everyday life into the awesome and unreal, the unreal happens to be the part of reality.The writers of the Great Britain managed to keep the great tradition of the English literature during the postmodernist period. This aspiration promotes an education of socially responsible person, formation of certain moral qualities in the reader. So, Winter son's short stories can be recommended in our school teaching, at home reading lessons.

Our study comprised 1284 invasive breast cancer patients in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was carried out. SLN intra-operative histopathological assessment was routinely performed in patients treated within the first period (07.2013-06.2014). However, the decision regarding intra-operative assessment was made by the surgeon for the patients who underwent this evaluation in the later period 07.2014-06.2015 and were submitted for BCT. BCT was performed in 72.4% of patients. In total, 316 patients (24.6%) developed SLN-metastasis. Within the period 07.2014-06.2015, SLN intra-operative microscopic evaluation was performed in 20.8% of patients submitted for BCT. ALND was omitted in 27.5% of patients demonstrating SLN metastasis, in comparison with 15.5% of the group from the previous period (p=0.0094). The proportion of patients demonstrating macrometastasis in SLN who received conservative treatment to the axilla increased from 5.4% to 23.1% (p=0.0007). The choice of SLN final histopathological assessment may allow for deferral of decision on more extensive surgery of the axilla in patients submitted for SLNB. The omission of routinely-performed SLN intra-operative histopathological evaluation has led to a statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients in whom complete ALND was avoided.

TI  - Analysis of the causes of false negative and false positive results of preoperative axillary ultrasound in patients with early breast cancer - a single-centre study
T2  - WSPOLCZESNA ONKOLOGIA-CONTEMPORARY ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Properly planned and performed diagnostic tests allow the optimal treatment option to be chosen for the patient. They also allow qualification for the correct surgical procedure.Aim of the study: In this study we evaluated the clinical value of preoperative ultrasound scan (USS) testing performed during primary disease staging in patients with early breast cancer qualified to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Material and methods: The group of breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB from March 2012 to May 2013. As well as the standard procedure of the preoperative diagnostics model, in each patient the USS of axillary lymph nodes was performed additionally. The results were compared with the data from postoperative pathological reports. We attempted to define the factors influencing the possibility of obtaining false positive and false negative USS results.Results: The analysis comprised 172 patients. In 14.4% of cases with normal USS result the pathological result was different from the expected one (pN1). In 42.3% of patients with suspicious axillary lymph nodes the result of the pathological report was positive. The sensitivity of the USS testing was 89.3%, and the specificity was 34.4%, PPV - 85.6%, NPV - 42.3%.Conclusions: Ultrasonographic assessment of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients qualified for SLNB is a test with high sensitivity and high predictive value of the positive test result. The possibility of a result contrary to the actual nodal status may result primarily from the technical limitations of USS testing.

TI  - Approaches for land cover monitoring over Europe based on backscatter and coherence properties of Envisat and ERS SAR data
T2  - AUC GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is the exploitation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data for land cover monitoring. The properties of the recorded radar data heavily depend on the type of land cover, season and weather conditions. Therefore, it is possible to utilize the variability of these factors, in order to develop various techniques and methodologies that can be used for classifying land surfaces. In this context, this paper proposes approaches, which include the application of mathematical expressions and application of thresholds on multi-temporal data, for recognizing and classifying various types of land cover, on the basis of ERS and Envisat C-band SAR backscatter and coherence properties. These can be useful for any kind of contemporary SAR data, such as those of the current two Sentinel-1 satellites. Although this study focuses on four main land cover types (urban, mountainous, agricultural-low vegetation and forested areas) over specific areas in Europe, the same principles can be extended worldwide, leading to useful insights for designing future SAR satellite missions or for establishing guidelines for in-depth studies of specific land cover types.

TI  - RECONSTRUCTING THE TOWER OF BABEL: MIND AND WORLD, CONSCIOUSNESS AND EXPERIENCE
T2  - COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks an exit from the miasma enveloping science of the subjective. First, it unpacks the various meanings of the word "consciousness". It agrees with contemporary literature that attention admits of two modes; involuntary attention and voluntary attention. It goes on to argue that the former is best modeled by "interrupts" in computer operating systems and often reflect "chunked" learned skill behaviour. Voluntary attention, on the other hand, always reflects a processing thread globally broadcast through the nervous system and is thus inevitably conscious.It is this process of selecting something to observe and moving back and forth from superposition (see my 2013 paper) that AI systems cannot yet come close to mastering; from it emerge not only humans' trans-Turing computational capacities but very possibly the furthest reaches of human creativity, exemplified by the reveries of geniuses like Mozart and Einstein. In particular, it is arguable that the strong AI positions gained traction only because of the attenuation of psychology's domain from the mid 19th century.To clear the ground, several distinctions should be made. In terms of epistemological domain, humans function at sensorimotor, cognitive and noetic levels. The last, a distinction we adapt from Aristotle, occurs when "the unreasonable effectiveness of math" gives us insight into a level of reality that our evolutionary heritage should not allow.Secondly, the term "noumenal" is adapted to refer to instances in which the subject, trying to get a veridical purchase on a situation, considers itself as an object. So we can move from egocentric/coupled sensorimotion to allocentric/decoupled such. The Roomba vacuum needs only coupled knowledge; if I'm here, I do this. Allocentric knowledge is a representation of the room. In a final wrinkle, we term "relativistic" the attested phenomenon of egocentric sensorimotion in an allocentric context. This is an artifact of intentionality.That analysis extends also to cognition and noesis. The former was best characterized by Piaget as the result of internalization of processes that originally occurred midway between subject and world. For him, the royal road to epistemology was study of the development of children's minds - another sense of the "foundations of mind".Normative ie necessary facts about knowledge could be elicited from the contingent facts of its development. Moreover, the necessity of logic itself derived from universal restrictions on physical interaction with the world. The project reached its limits not just empirically, with many results being unreplicated, but epistemologically as we seem to know a lot more than Piaget's "Naive physics" warrants (see my 2003 book)."Naive physics" which does not use pi, i,e and other "Platonic" entities is a cognitive undertaking. And so Archimedes in his bath has a noumenal moment of subject/object differentiation. Rather famously, Einstein extended this analysis, using only cognitive concepts/naive physics, to argue that physics required that space and time had to be "relative" to the observer - paradoxically in order to maintain the universality of physical law.Quantum mechanics (QM) is a fortiori noetic; indeed, it is a moot point whether reality at this level is cognitively penetrable. What is not controversial is Von Neumann's attested proof that the boundary of subject and object in QM is moveable. Much work was done by researchers like Stapp to ensure Von Neumann's breakthrough is compatible with special relativity.Yet that is not the full story. Quantum observation seems to change the external world; indeed, Stapp follows Dirac in arguing that the wave function of the universe changes during observation. Moreover, unless one (like Milne and Stapp) argues for two kinds of time, the observer can also change the past. The act of observation seems to be more akin to incantation/invocation in ancient religions.That is clearly disturbing. Yet "the unreasonable effectiveness of math" has led to this conclusion. Math is capable of the most elliptical and veridical description of reality that can reliably be communicated. In short, we are doing something in QM that possibly is part of humanity's heritage, even for the 99.9999..% of humanity which never knew QM.This type of capacity has famously been claimed by Shamans and often has been rolled into a totalizing theocratic ordering of society that should be resisted by every rational person. The response from fundamentalists is twofold. For their base, they insist on incessant repetitions of prayers of incantation and invocation. These often remind God that he is omnipotent and should do something about the situation. If it doesn't work, the prayer has been insincere and should.. well, it should be repeated more sincerely.The fundamentalists take a different strategy in their debate with the forces of "reason". They argue that, on an individual level, "reason" has led only to moral and epistemological relativism. On a social level, the extension of "rights" can only go so far until the facts of biology create the kind of backlash that allowed an opportunist like Trump become President.It is at this point that we will introduce "consciousness". Obviously, if everything is relative to "consciousness", the only reality, it contains the only value. However, if we grain our epistemology more finely, we find that there indeed are processes that are relative to individual "consciousness" which has a sampling speed of about 0.1 sec, and others that are biological, occurring indeed in the picoseconds, or transcendent to "consciousness" in that they exemplify forces that in exigent fashion integrate us into the social group,The history of psychology, and of the public university, constrains the response to this in interesting ways. Arguably, academic psychologists are the people least qualified to tackle the issue of exigent forces as their entire career has been based on a notion of mind which accepts only externals that are relative to consciousness. Conversely, to accept the social forces - which today includes a surveillance state fully as pervasive as a theocracy - into the mix is to take a perhaps unwelcome step into the real world.This final point will delineate that step. The activists who today take part in rallies knowing that their texts to each other are being swept up by the police are themselves involved in delineating the boundary of subject and object. For example, "Occupy" activists recently had perhaps a rather Lakoff/maternal view of the state shaken by the knowledge that a la Cointelpro, the state was bugging them. Of course, their erstwhile pre-FBI state was described by Marx as false "Bewusstsein", false consciousness. Their passage into the real world no doubt has birthed many support groups who know that something sacred needs to be preserved,As indeed, in the individual case, is the sensorimotor passage from being blocked to flow, and the individual's passage from intersubjective to authentic. None of these processes is the focus of academic psychology. They may, however, form the basis for religious practices that yearn for the betterment of humanity, rather than the retrenchment of a Neolithic worldview. Ironically, the facts of QM are on the side of the activists, self-authenticators, artists, and dancers. What we so far lack are authentic spiritual leaders, and we discuss below what they might do if extant.

AB  - Simultaneous observation of transportable weather radar LAPAN-GMR25SP and rain-scanner SANTANU were conducted in Bandung and vicinity. The objective is to observe and analyse the weather condition in this area during rainy and transition season from March until April 2017. From the observation result reported some heavy rainfall with hail and strong winds occurred on March 17th and April 19th 2017. This events were lasted within 1 to 2 hours damaged some properties and trees in Bandung. Mesoscale convective system (MCS) are assumed to be the cause of this heavy rainfall. From two radar data analysis showed a more local convective activity in around 11.00 until 13.00 LT. This local convective activity are showed from the SANTANU observation supported by the VSECT and CMAX of the Transportable radar data that signify the convective activity within those area. MCS activity were observed one hour after that. This event are confirm by the classification of convective-stratiform echoes from radar data and also from the high convective index from T-bb Himawari 8 satellite data. The different MCS activity from this two case study is that April 19 have much more MCS activity than in March 17, 2017.

AB  - In this study, multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by the C-band Radarsat-2 SAR mission in Antarctica are exploited to observe the Terra Nova Bay (TNB). The latter represent a complex coastal scenario where open ocean, sea ice, polynyas, ice sheets and tongues are present. Single-polarization (SP) features, including co-and cross-polarized backscattering intensities, and dual-polarimetric (DP) features, including eigenvaluebased decomposition features and the polarization ratio, are used to identify the signatures of the different environments that characterize the TNB and to perform an unsupervised classification. Experimental results, obtained using Markov Random Fields and polarimetric decompositions, show that: i) SP and DP features allow estimating the extent of polynya; ii) DP approach allows inferring useful information on the different scenarios; iii) clear signatures can be identified according to the considered multi-polarization feature set.

AB  - Javan Hawk-Eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi; JHE) is a law-protected endemic raptor which currently faced the decreased in number and size of habitat patches that will lead to patch isolation and species extinction. This study assessed the degree of connectivity between remnant habitat patches in central part of Java by utilizing Conefor Sensinode software as an additional tool for ArcGIS. The connectivity index was determined by three fractions which are infra, flux and connector. Using connectivity indices successfully identified 4 patches as core habitat, 9 patches as stepping-stone habitat and 6 patches as isolated habitat were derived from those connectivity indices. Those patches then being validated with land cover map derived from Landsat 8 of August 2014. 36% of core habitat covered by natural forest, meanwhile stepping stone habitat has 55% natural forest and isolated habitat covered by 59% natural forest. Isolated patches were caused by zero connectivity (PCcon = 0) and the patch size which too small to support viable JHE population. Yet, the condition of natural forest and the surrounding matrix landscape in isolated patches actually support the habitat need. Thus, it is very important to conduct the right conservation management system based on the condition of each patches.

CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Bogor is a satellite city of Jakarta Metropolitan that experience rapid population growth and urban development. Urban landscape change for urban development affects the city expansion, development of urban heat island (UHI), and the increasing of land surface temperature (LST). The objectives of this study are to analyze the urban landscape changein1990 and 2017, to analyze the LST change caused by city expansion, and to analyze the development of the UHI phenomenon. We used Local Climate Zone (LCZ) which is a classification system of urban surfaces. In LCZ classification, we used three categories in built-up area, three categories in vegetated area, bare soil, and water. Landsat 5 TM in 1990and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS in 2017 were used in this study. In 1990, the urbanized area was 9.38% and the vegetated area was 83.98%. The urbanized area continuously increased and become 27.24% in 2017 and the vegetated area decreased to 58.85% in 2017. By the comparison of LST in 1990 and2017, the areas that show high LST is increased. As the result of the analysis, the changes from non-urban to urban surface highly affected the UHI in Bogor City through the rise of LST.

TI  - HIV/AIDS KNOWLEDGE AND RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOURS AMONG YOUTHS AT A UNIVERSITY IN ENUGU, NIGERIA
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF NURSING AND MIDWIFERY
M3  - Article
AB  - A national sentinel survey of 2006 shows that Enugu State in south-eastern Nigeria is the worst hit by HIV infections. Despite numerous control strategies having been implemented, the state was still reported by another national HIV sentinel survey in 2010 as the worst hit by HIV/AIDS within the zone, and that youths are the most affected. The researchers conducted a cross-sectional descriptive survey to assess the HIV/AIDS knowledge and risk-taking behaviours of youths at a federal university in Enugu, south-eastern Nigeria. They adopted a multistage sampling method to recruit 460 unmarried, consenting students between 15 and 30 years of age, from three faculties of the university. Almost 90 per cent of the university youths had a sound knowledge of key concepts related to HIV/AIDS; despite this, a subset (7.39%) still engaged in risk-taking behaviours. The major risky behaviours identified include having premarital sex, having multiple sexual partners, the sharing of shaving or razor blades, the use of public clippers and tribal marking. Although an analysis of variance demonstrated no significant relationship (t = -0.036) between university youths' knowledge of HIV/AIDS and their related risk-taking behaviour, risky behaviours were found to be more (13%) among respondents who had insufficient or incorrect knowledge of the disease. An analysis of covariance, however, showed that gender and socio-economic backgrounds were not determinants of the HIV/AIDS risk-taking behaviours of these youths. Therefore, factors such as attitude or culture are areas that should be focused on, and should then, along with educational awareness campaigns, help to reduce the spread and prevalence of the disease.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEstimates of influenza-associated hospitalization are severely limited in low- and middle-income countries, especially in Africa.ObjectivesTo estimate the national number of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalization in Rwanda.MethodsWe multiplied the influenza virus detection rate from influenza surveillance conducted at 6 sentinel hospitals by the national number of respiratory hospitalization obtained from passive surveillance after adjusting for underreporting and reclassification of any respiratory hospitalizations as SARI during 2012-2014. The population at risk was obtained from projections of the 2012 census. Bootstrapping was used for the calculation of confidence intervals (CI) to account for the uncertainty associated with all levels of adjustment. Rates were expressed per 100000 population. A sensitivity analysis using a different estimation approach was also conducted.ResultsSARI cases accounted for 70.6% (9759/13813) of respiratory admissions at selected hospitals: 77.2% (6783/8786) and 59.2% (2976/5028) among individuals aged <5 and 5years, respectively. Overall, among SARI cases tested, the influenza virus detection rate was 6.3% (190/3022): 5.7% (127/2220) and 7.8% (63/802) among individuals aged <5 and 5years, respectively. The estimated mean annual national number of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations was 3663 (95% CI: 2930-4395rate: 34.7; 95% CI: 25.4-47.7): 2637 (95% CI: 2110-3164rate: 168.7; 95% CI: 135.0-202.4) among children aged <5years and 1026 (95% CI: 821-1231rate: 11.3; 95% CI: 9.0-13.6) among individuals aged 5years. The estimates obtained from both approaches were not statistically different (overlapping CIs).ConclusionsThe burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations was substantial and was highest among children aged <5years.

TI  - Adult literacy organisers in Ireland resisting neoliberalism
T2  - EDUCATION AND TRAINING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the experiences and responses of ten adult literacy organisers (ALOs) from Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare to the growing influence of neoliberalism and the commodification of adult literacy as a skill and function of the economy. The research argues for a greater focus on literacy as a social practice concerned with equality and social justice, rooted in emancipatory and transformative adult education.Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research methodology using in-depth unstructured interviews, underpinned by critical realism.Findings - While the ALOs sampled have developed strategies to resist the impact of neoliberalism, they are also struggling to sustain their resistance and nurture access to emancipatory and transformative adult literacy practices.Research limitations/implications - The research is limited in size, being a small sample study of ten ALOs.Practical implications - The research will inform policy discussions in advance of the new further education and training strategy, where adult literacy policy is situated.Originality/value - The paper gives unique and independent access to the voices of ALOs in Ireland and provides a small example of empirical evidence of the commodification and marketisation of adult literacy under neoliberalism.

TI  - The Post-Pastoral Elements in Michael Longley's Poetics
T2  - ESTUDIOS IRLANDESES
M3  - Article
AB  - When discussing the internal contradictions and issues of ideology and representation posed by the literary pastoral, Lawrence Buell suggests the need for "a more mature environmental aesthetics" than the pastoral provides (32). Terry Gifford insists that "'A mature environmental aesthetics' would need to recognise that some literature has gone beyond the closed circuit of pastoral and anti-pastoral to achieve a vision of an integrated natural world that includes the human" (148). The Irish poet Michael Longley has increasingly avoided pastoral's anthropocentric worldview that the universe centres on humans; he reassigns preference to the concerns of the biosphere, including its human participants. He seamlessly integrates social systems and ecosystems, proposing what Donna Potts terms a "more radical reordering of cultural values" (79). This article analyses the ecocritical value of Longley's poetry in light of Terry Gifford's suggested requisites for post-pastoral literature.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING MISSIONS AND SENSORS: DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION V
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Missions and Sensors: Development, Implementation, and Characterization V
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - On-orbit radiometric calibration of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) visible and near-infrared (VNIR) band involves vicarious calibration using reflectance-based method, onboard lamp calibration, and cross-calibration with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra. The ASTER calibration was evaluated with reference to MODIS using an improved cross-calibration algorithm in the previous study (Obata et al., Sensors, 2017). In the present study, the evaluation is expanded by using other sensors that are highly calibrated, including the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The objective of the present study is to evaluate radiometric calibration of ASTER VNIR band using MODIS, ETM+, and OLI counterparts over Railroad Valley Playa for the period from 2000 to 2018. Results indicate that ASTER bands 1 and 2 are in average 4.2-4.5% and 1.8-3.3% greater than MODIS/ETM+ and that ASTER band 3N agrees well with MODIS/ETM+. The behavior of ASTER surface reflectances along time shows similar trend to that of OLI. The number of sample data for ASTER and OLI comparison should be, however, increased for accurate analysis of statistics. Nevertheless, insights obtained by cross-comparisons provide beneficial information for evaluating ASTER radiometric calibration. The consistency among radiometric calibrations of multiple sensors is of significance importance in the context of data continuity and sensor fusion studies.

AB  - In the publication of the correspondence of Semyon Ludvigovich Frank and Albert Einstein, that is stored in the physician's archive at the Jewish University of Jerusalem, find their coverage the political events in Soviet Russia in the late 1920's - early 1930's. Letters keep their relevance for modern philosophers and humanitarians, as long as they expand the contextual field of our notions about the communication of Russian and European intellectuals of the first half of the XXth century, as well as their ideological shifts under the influence of what was happening. Frank analyzed the official sources (Soviet newspapers) of the time and tried to show Einstein their political and ideological bias, especially by covering high-profile judicial proceedings. It is exactly the worldview on Soviet Russia that Frank hold to during the years of emigrant life in Germany. The philosopher drew Einstein's attention to the abuses and law violations, that took place in Soviet Russia at that time. In letters to Einstein, Frank sought to get him to publicly condemn the actions of the Soviet government, in hope that it would contribute to stop the repressions. In the end, Frank managed to convince Einstein of the rightfulness of his position and to overcome his excessive caution and distrustfulness. The archive material published with the permission of the right holders has not been put into scientific circulation before and is printed for the first time.

TI  - Testing the spectral resolutions of the new multispectral sensors for detecting <i>Phaeosphaeria</i> leaf spot (PLS) infestations in maize crop
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is one of the most important subsistence and commercial crops in the world. In Africa, it is regarded as one of the most popular food crops. Recently however, significant losses due to Phaeosphaeria leaf spot (PLS) infestation have been reported. Therefore, techniques for early detection of PLS infestation are valuable for mitigating maize yield losses. Recently, remotely sensed datasets have become valuable in crop assessment. In this study, we sought to detect early PLS infestation by comparing the performance of commonly used higher spatial resolution sensors (WorldView, Quickbird, Sentinel series 2, RapidEye and SPOT 6) based on their spectrally resampled field spectra. Canopy training spectra were collected on leaves with signs of early infestation and healthy leaves spectral characteristics used for comparison. Training data was collected in 2013 growing season while test data was collected under similar conditions in 2014. The Random Forest algorithm was used to establish the Kappa and overall, user and producer's accuracies. Results showed that the RapidEye sensor with an overall classification accuracy of 86.96% and Kappa value of 0.76 performed better than the rest of the sensors while the Red, Yellow and Red-Edge bands were most useful for detecting early PLS infestation. The value of the RapidEye sensor in detecting early PLS infestation can be attributed to the optimally centred Red Red-Edge bands sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content, a consequent of PLS infestation on maize leaves. The study provides valuable insight on the value of existing sensors, based on their sensor characteristics in detecting early PLS infestation.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy for axillary management after neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer: a single-center retrospective analysis with long follow-up
T2  - SURGERY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for breast cancer remains controversial. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent SNB after NAT to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure.A consecutive 105 women with locally advanced breast cancer (cT1-4, cN0-3, M0) were treated with NAT between 2006 and 2015. The subjects were 80 of these patients who became or remained clinically node-negative after NAT, 53 of whom had axillary management determined by SNB (group A) and the other 27 underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) without SNB (group B). SNB was performed using a modified dye method.The sentinel node (SN) identification rate was 94.3% and the mean number of removed SNs was 2.4. ALND was avoided in 33 patients, who were confirmed as SN-negative. There was no difference in recurrence-free and overall survival rates between groups A and B (p = 0.71 and p = 0.46, respectively) during the median follow-up time of 63 months. Of the 33 patients who did not undergo ALND, 10 suffered recurrence (33%). One patient (3%) had recurrence in an axillary lymph node and four had recurrence in a supraclavicular lymph node.Axillary SNB after NAT did not affect the axillary failure rate or the prognosis. SNB may be a reliable procedure, even after NAT.

TI  - Ozone climatology and its variability from ground based and satellite observations over Irene, South Africa (25.5° S; 28.1° E) - Part 2: Total column ozone variations
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, the climatological characteristics of total column ozone (ToZ) over Irene, South Africa (25.5 degrees S, 28.1 degrees E), are studied using both ground-based and satellite observations. Satellite data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) from November 1978 to May 1993; the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-1 (GOME-1) from August 1995 to June 2003; the Earth Probe Total Ozone Monitoring Spectrometer (EP-TOMS) from January 1997 to December 2005; the Microwave Limb Sounder from October 2004 to April 2013; the Ozone Monitoring Interferometer (OMI) from October 2004 to December 2013; the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) from January 2007 to December 2013; and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) from June 2008 to December 2011, were used in this study together with ground-based measurement from a Dobson instrument (August 1989 to December 2011). The seven satellite and ground-based instruments used for this study were selected as they provide long term ozone monitoring data. Satellite observations were collected when they overpass Irene and showed that ToZ replicated the expected behavior of spring maximum and autumn minimum. When compared with other satellite data sets, TOMS ToZ data displayed values approximately 8 DU higher overall but showed good general agreement with measurements from the ground-based Dobson instrument. The OMI instrument had the best agreement with the Dobson instrument as the measurements are within 5 DU for all seasons. The result of trend trend analysis of ozone over Irene shows a significant decrease of similar to 8 DU in total ozone from 1978 to 1993 with a gradual recovery and increase of similar to 2 DU in total ozone from 1995 to 2005 as measured by both GOME-1 and EPTOMS. An increase of approximately 7-9 DU is observed in measurements from OMI and IASI thereby illustrating the gradual recovery of the ozone layer. EPTOMS also showed good agreement with the Dobson instrument. GOME-1 and GOME-2 reveal underestimation of ozone while IASI overestimated ozone for the first half of the year. Between 1995 and 2005, both EPTOMS and GOME-1 data showed a gradual increase in column ozone of approximately 2 DU which has increased to approximately 7 DU in the last decade as measured by OMI, GOME-2 and IASI satellites. The result obtained showed a very strong correlation (similar to 97%) between the variation in OMI-Dobson and GOME-2-Dobson and (similar to 85%) between the variation in EPTOMS-Dobson and GOME-1-Dobson.

TI  - 북한 정권 수립기의 검열 문제에 대하여 -'『응향』 사건'을 중심으로-
T2  - Korean Language
T2  - 배달말
M3  - research-article
AB  - This article focuses on the scandal sparked by Eunghyang, a collection of poems published right after Korea’s independence, and on the censorship that was imposed in the early years of the North Korean regime. In North Korea, it is hard to trace official records of censorship. Therefore, it is better to look at how the party defines and frames the imagination and at how a work that deviates from those prescribed notions is policed (in)visibly.The mission of North Korean literature was to serve the people. More than anything else, the function of literature was to help grow and transform “the people” into “new” beings. To this end, literature had to portray archetypes that the people could easily understand and follow. A case in point is the portrayal of so-called positive protagonists and their heroic will and passion. The reason Eunghyang was considered so scandalous is that it departed from the norms of literature for the people. The poems were criticized for being decadent, sentimental, individualist, and escapist, and their publication was banned. In addition, the language was harshly criticized for its obscurity, making the poems inaccessible and incomprehensible. The underlying reason for the ban, however, was that these poems undermined the willpower and passion that were considered vital to building the new society.However, it seems that the underlying worldview or class background of the poets was not of central concern in these criticisms because the poets who were targeted in this incident soon returned to their desks without undergoing specific measures of “ideological training.” Moreover, the regime’s lax attitude toward Koo-sang’s Yeomyeongdo also bolsters the point that the criticism was less oriented toward fundamental issues such as ideology and worldview. If we follow Koo-sang’s description of the work, the poem is reactionary, with its outright denial of the post-independent North Korean revolution and “the total spiritual mobilization campaign for nation-building”. However, there is hardly any criticism against this poem, suggesting two possibilities: Either censorship at the time was loose, or the version of Yeomyeongdo that Ku-sang describes is different from the one published in Eunghyang. It is likely that the poem has been revised or even rewritten.The Eunghyang scandal revealed what is intended to be banned in North Korean literature and reconfirmed what the literature should aim for. The biting criticism against the language and expressions had a decisive impact on the development of the North Korean literature that followed, especially the poetry. The new direction pointed to plain, prosaic statements and poetry with no possibility of misinterpretation. In addition, with self-censoring of the creative process, reading by turn before publication, and peer review sessions, which functioned as a de facto censorship organization, North Korean poetry gradually adhered to the content and form that party doctrine demanded. In this regard, Eunghyang proved to be an incident that confirmed the existence of two Koreas in the literary arenaand in particular, poetry.

TI  - Seasonal and annual variability of coastal sulphur plumes in the northern Benguela upwelling system
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - We investigated the seasonal and annual variability of surface sulphur plumes in the northern Benguela upwelling system off Namibia because of their significant impacts on the marine ecosystem, fishing industry, aquaculture farming and tourism due to their toxic properties. We identified the sulphur plumes in ocean colour satellite data of the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) for the 2002-2012 time period using the differences in the spectral properties of Namibian Benguela optical water types. The sulphur events have a strong seasonal cycle with pronounced main and off-seasons forced by local and remote-driven processes. The main peak season is in late austral summer and early austral autumn at the beginning of the annual upwelling cycle caused by increasing equatorwards alongshore winds. The sulphur plume activity is high between February and April during the seasonal oxygen minimum associated with the seasonal reduction of cross-shore ventilation of the bottom waters, the seasonal southernmost position of the Angola Benguela Frontal Zone, the seasonal maximum of water mass fractions of South Atlantic and Angola Gyre Central Waters as well as the seasonal arrival of the downwelling coastal trapped waves. The off-season is in austral spring and early austral summer during increased upwelling intensity and enhanced oxygen supply. The annual variability of sulphur events is characterized by very high activities in years 2004, 2005 and 2010 interrupted by periods of lower activity in years 2002 to 2003, 2006 to 2009 and 2011 to 2012. This result can be explained by the relative contributions or adding effects of local and remote-driven forces (from the equatorial area). The probability for the occurrence of sulphur plumes is enhanced in years with a lower annual mean of upwelling intensity, decreased oxygen supply associated with decreased lateral ventilation of bottom waters, more southern position of the Angola Benguela Frontal Zone, increased mass fraction of South Atlantic Central Water and stronger downwelling coastal trapped waves. Understanding of the variability and forcing processes of the toxic sulphur events will help in the future to monitor and forecast them as well as to manage their social and economic consequences in the northern Benguela upwelling system off Namibia.

AB  - Rapid and all-weather detection of flood areas is needed for monitoring and mitigating flood disasters. In this paper, we investigated flood area detection using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data acquired during the 2015 heavy rainfall disaster in the Kanto and Tohoku areas. Japan. We detected flood areas by thresholding amplitude images from PALSAR-2 and then evaluated their accuracies against inundation maps based on aerial photographs. The highest accuracy was a 0.583 kappa coefficient in flood/non-flood discrimination. Our comparative study results indicate that lower off-nadir angles (around 30 degrees or less) are effective in the detection of flood areas. We also found polarimetric analysis and speckle filtering to be effective in improving accuracy. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using PALSAR-2 data for rapid flood monitoring and as a reference for future flood disasters.

TI  - BIOCULTURAL INTERACTIONS OF THE YAGHAN PEOPLE WITH SEAWEEDS AND MOLLUSKS: FIELD ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY APPROACH
T2  - MAGALLANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal areas of the Magellan ecoregion host considerable diversity of macroalgae and mollusks. Indigenous peoples, such as the Yaghan, have developed biocultural interactions with austral coastal ecosystems. This study is an interdisciplinary ecological, ethnoecological and philosophical analysis. It applies the conceptual framework of biocultural ethics to characterize the intertidal habitat within the biocultural context of the Yaghan people. This is done through the composition of inhabitants, such as macroalgae and mollusks, linked to seasonal habits of abundance. Based on this account, we suggest methods and activities of biocultural conservations. We applied the Field Environmental Philosophy approach, which was carried out in Robalo bay, Navarino island (55 degrees S). Ecological results showed that biomass and macroalgae diversity increased in summer and decreased over the winter. Mollusks Mytilus edulis chilensis and Perumytilus purpuratus showed no seasonal variability abundance. Ethnographic results based on the literature and observant participation showed that low seasonal variability in mollusk abundance has been crucial to the subsistence of the Yaghan people. From the perspective of contemporary environmental ethics, we identified several values in the Yaghan worldview. For example, there are instrumental values in mollusks: they have been a source of food, aesthetic decoration, development of tools and building huts. We found references to the intrinsic values in mollusks, particularly in narratives and other ethnographic sources. These Yaghan values are rooted in a profound sense of empathy for biodiversity. As a result of the combined ecological, ethnographic, and philosophical issues, we suggest communication through metaphor (the submerged forest of Cape Horn) and field activities (open your eyes, dive with an open mind) for biocultural conservation.

AB  - The disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (DISPATCH) algorithm was developed to improve the spatial resolution of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture (SM) using 1 km resolution Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The main objective of this paper is firstly, to adapt the DISPATCH algorithm to the 100 m resolution Landsat data and secondly, to determine an optimal intermediate spatial resolution (ISR) between the original (40 km) SMOS resolution and the targeted 100 m resolution. It is found that the ISR (set to 1 km, 3 km and 5 km) impacts the accuracy in the sequentially downscaled 100 m resolution SM depending on both the SM heterogeneity present within the spatial extent considered, and the gap between the low to high resolution ratio.

TI  - Feasibility Study for Future Space-Borne Coherent Doppler Wind Lidar, Part 3: Impact Assessment Using Sensitivity Observing System Simulation Experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the impact of a future space-borne Doppler wind lidar (DWL) on a super-low-altitude orbit by using an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) based on a sensitivity observing system experiment (SOSE) approach. Realistic atmospheric data, including wind and temperature, was provided as "pseudo-truth" (PT) to simulate DWL observations. Hourly aerosols and clouds that are consistent with PT winds were also created for the simulation. A full-scale lidar simulator, which is described in detail in the companion paper, simulated realistic line-of-sight wind measurements and observation quality information, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and measurement error. Quality control (QC) procedures in the data assimilation system were developed to select high-quality DWL observations on the basis of the averaged SNR from strong backscattering in the presence of aerosols or clouds. Furthermore, DWL observation errors used in the assimilation were calculated using the measurement error estimated by the lidar simulator.The forecast impacts of DWL onboard polar- and tropical-orbiting satellites were assessed using the operational global data assimilation system. Data assimilation experiments were conducted in January and August in 2010 to assess overall impact and seasonal dependence. It is found that DWL on either polar-or tropical-orbiting satellites is overall beneficial for wind and temperature forecasts, with greater impacts for the January experiments. The relative forecast error reduction reaches almost 2 % in the tropics. An exception is degradation in the southern hemisphere in August, thus suggesting a need to further refine observation error assignment and QC. A decisive conclusion cannot be drawn with regard to the superiority of polar-or tropical-orbiting satellites because of their mixed impacts. This is probably related to the characteristics of error growth in the tropics. The limitations and possible underestimation of the DWL impacts, for example, due to a simple observation error inflation setting, in the SOSE-OSSE are also discussed.

T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the problems of interpretation of Platon Alekseyevich Oyunsky's (1893-1939) personality, the Yakut classic writer, in terms of his self-identification, finding his place in literature, society and, in general, history, his struggle for truth and universal human values. The article uses a set of such traditional methods as historical-functional, typological and comparative.Interpretation of P. Oyunsky's contextual levels of creativity will allow to delve into the creative core of the writer, and reveal both his tasks and achievements in fiction. In the end of the analysis of the writer's creativity contexts, the integrity of his personality will be revealed.The artistic concept of Oyunsky's reality is realized in his philosophical works - "Nyukuus the Madman", "The Red Shaman", "Kudangsa the Great", "Alexander the Great", which become the starting point for the evolution of his worldview. The writer was looking for answers not only to hot-button issues of society, but he also talked about universal and eternal problems of existence. Particular attention was paid to the creation of heroic characters, fighting for the happiness of the people and changing the world. Oyunsky created Yakut literature of a new type, he became a writer of romanticism.The study of the literary context in the writer's work presupposes insight into the semantic depths of works to comprehend the author's concept of reality. Oyunsky, as a writer-philosopher, reflected on the universal problems of life and death, the appointment of man and his fate, the role of great people in history, the struggle between Good and Evil, Mind and Force. Oyunsky showed the triumph of Mind in his works, the eternal truths of mankind and foresaw that thanks to creativity, his name will not be forgotten by the people.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The new geostationary (GEO) meteorological satellite of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Himawari-8, entered operation on 7 July 2015. Himawari-8 features the new 16-band Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), whose spatial resolution and observation frequency are improved over those of its predecessor MTSAT-series satellites. These improvements will bring about unprecedented levels of performance in nowcasting services and short-range weather forecasting systems. In view of the essential nature of navigation and radiometric calibration in fully leveraging the imager's potential, this study reports on the current status of calibration for the AIR Image navigation is accurate to within 1 km, and band-to-band coregistration has also been validated. Infrared (IR) band calibration is accurate to within 0.2 K with no significant diurnal variation and is being validated using an approach developed under the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) framework. Validation approaches are currently being tested for the visible and near-IR (NTR) bands. Two such approaches were compared and found to produce largely consistent results.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze the main steps of creation and outline the prospects of the art research in the creative way of M. Zhvanetsky. The methodology of the study is based on an interdisciplinary combination of art criticism and bibliographic approaches. General scientific methods of analysis, descriptiveness and underneath are used. Scientific novelty. Publication is the first attempt to analyze the work of M. Zhvanetsky in Ukrainian art history. Conclusions. M. Zhvanetsky is a vivid representative of the conversational genre on the stage for more than half a century, and, unfortunately, little attention has been devoted to the study of his work. Today M. Zhvanetsky can be considered not only a classic of the typical genre on the stage, in particular, speaking but also a master of standup-comedy. And all of this is due to the wit of statements, the acuteness and paradox of worldview, observation, profound insight and the wisdom of life of their author. The main secret of his creative laboratory in improvisation and live dialogue with the viewer.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) can be mapped using thermal infrared and spectral reflectance data. Various ET models have been developed but there was no competitive evaluation of them over a large range of situations. Ensemble model averaging is a tool that can be used for deriving ET from multi-model simulations. In this study, we used bayesian model averaging, which consists in weighting each model according to their performances when deriving the ensemble average. It was applied to the monitoring of ET over a saltmarsh scrub area in South France from MODIS data. ET monitoring was improved (RMSE = 0.57 mm d(-1)) when using a weighted averaging procedure as compared to the performances of a simple average or to the performances of each individual model.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEstimating the national burden of influenza disease is challenging. We aimed to estimate the disease burden of seasonal influenza in Spain, at the primary care and hospital level, over the 6 influenza seasons after 2009 pandemic.MethodsWe used data from the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System to estimate weekly influenza rates and the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) and mild confirmed influenza cases (MCIC). From the surveillance of severe hospitalized confirmed influenza cases (SHCIC), we obtained hospitalization rates and total number of SHCIC, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths in influenza hospitalized patients. We estimated both mild and severe influenza cases, overall, and by age-group (<5, 5-14, 15-64, and 65years).ResultsThe highest cumulative rates of MCIC were observed in <15years (1395-3155 cases/100000 population in 5-14years) and the lowest in 65years (141-608 cases/100000 population). SHCIC rates revealed a characteristic U-shaped distribution, with annual average hospitalization rates of 16.5 and 18.9 SHCIC/100, 000 p in 0-4years, and 65years, respectively. We estimated an annual average of 866868 cases of ILI attended in primary care (55% were MCIC), 3616 SHCIC, 1232 ICU admissions, and 437 deaths in SHCIC. The percentage of ICU admission among SHCIC was highest at 15-64years (42%), while the hospitalization fatality rate ranged from 1% in 0-4years to 18% in 65years.ConclusionsThe ongoing Spanish Influenza Surveillance System allowed obtaining crucial information regarding the impact of mild and severe influenza in Spain.

AB  - An accurate global map of current cropland is needed to tackle the agricultural challenges of the next decades. Several remote sensing products have provided with global cropland maps. To create the GEOGLAM best available global crop-specific maps, we integrated the SPAM 2005 with regional maps developed by different countries and international organisms. The comparison with other available global cropland products showed a clear linear agreement between products and a tendency towards overestimation of GEOGLAM best available global crop-specific maps. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the forecast production model for winter wheat developed in previous studies. It showed how at constant values of adjusted NDVI small variations of cultivated area (5000 ha) produced a 17% rate of variation in the estimated production values.

TI  - HUMAN ECOLOGY: THE NATURE AS AN ARCHETYPAL DIVINITY
T2  - REVISTA ARTEMIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The term nature, in a broad sense, refers to the phenomena of the physical world and life in general. Complex are their definitions, involving qualities of essentiality, origin, spontaneity, and everything that was not directly manipulated or produced by human action, including the universe itself. Taking into account that the sciences in their entirety have developed through their observation, the objective of this study is to promote the worldview of nature as a foundation for human self-knowledge, since according to the conception of human ecology, humans are conceived as an indivisible part of their environment. Faced with the current ecological constraints, the proposal is justified, above all, by the need to reconnect man with nature in a superficial and deep sense. For that, we used the theoretical revision method (especially conceptual contributions of Arne Naess and Carl Gustav Jung) and Aristotelian deductive thinking to reach the proposed reflections. The results suggest man as being indivisible from nature, reigned by forces, tendencies, instincts, and cycles similar to those of the natural environment. From natural contemplation it is believed possible to formulate deep understandings of human nature, be they biological, psychological or spiritual.

AB  - Yield forecast is essential to agriculture stakeholders and can be obtained with the use of machine learning models and data coming from multiple sources. Most solutions for yield forecast rely on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data which, besides being time-consuming to acquire and process, only allows forecasting once crop season has already started. To bring scalability for yield forecast, in the present paper we describe a system that incorporates satellite-derived precipitation and soil properties datasets, seasonal climate forecasting data from physical models and other sources to produce a pre-season prediction of soybean/maize yield with no need of NDVI data. This system provides significantly useful results by the exempting the need for high-resolution remote-sensing data and allowing farmers to prepare for adverse climate influence on the crop cycle. In our studies, we forecast the soybean and maize yields for Brazil and USA, which corresponded to 44% of the world's grain production in 2016. Results show the error metrics for soybean and maize yield forecasts are comparable to similar systems that only provide yield forecast information in the first weeks to months of the crop cycle.

T2  - REVISTA PUBLICANDO
M3  - Article
AB  - Domain analysis considers that the evaluation of science must take into account the knowledge of the social practices of scientists. In this way, knowledge domains can be found as discursive communities consisting of a set of social actors, who share a worldview and are highly identified. The bibliometric approach has proved useful as a method and tool for domain analysis. In particular, institutional domain analysis has been defined as a type of bibliometric study that allows the representation of the researcher of a particular institution. The present research aims to study, from this perspective, some of the entities that develop scientific activity in Camaguey: University of Camaguey (UC), Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB), Provincial Meteorological Center (CMP). For this purpose, the scientific production of each one of these organizations registered in the databases Web of Science and Scopus in the period 2001-2013 was analyzed through indicators of production, impact and collaboration. The study showed the predominance of co-authorship in the work of the three institutions, which shows the influence of collaboration in the analyzed discursive communities. Among the results highlight the UC's research plurality with scientific publications belonging to 10 thematic categories. The CMP also stands out when presenting the highest index of internationalization.

AB  - This chapter describes a compact (9 week, 18 hour) evidence-based course on religious/spiritual (R/S) factors and public health that has been offered with success for nearly a decade at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. We describe a logical sequence of topics and readings that convey the public health importance and key ideas of the R/S-health field, while maintaining respectful stance toward diverse student beliefs. Weekly readings initially focus on (1) conceptual introductions; (2) examples of empirical health research on religious involvement; and (3) examples of empirical health research on spiritual practices. Attention then turns to (4) mechanisms underlying R/S-health effects, (5) weighing the evidence through meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and in other ways, (6) clinical applications, (7) public health applications, and finally (8) worldviews and science/religion dialogue. Pedagogy, assignments, grading, and student reactions are discussed, along with the role that similar courses might play in school-level strategies for teaching about religious/spiritual factors and public health.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the 2010-2015 financial performance (FP) of the national non-profit USA Triathlon (UST) using financial effectiveness (FE) indicators and financial efficiency (FY) ratios.Design/methodology/approach Archival data were used together with a case study method. FP was evaluated by net income; FE was indicated by total assets and total revenues, while FY was examined by program services ratios and support services ratios.Findings On average, the FP of the organization was positive ($2,100,591 net income per year), FE was moderate (66 percent increases in assets and revenues) and the FY was mixed (80 percent revenues spent on program services with an impressive return on asset of 14 percent).Research limitations/implications By using case study method, the results may not be generalizable to other national non-profit sports organizations with non-financial objectives.Practical implications The results revealed that overall FP is a product of both FE and FY, making the study valuable to managers who are often faced with unreliable financial resources.Originality/value The study utilized both FE and FY measures to evaluate the FPs of UST - a major shortfall in similar studies.

AB  - Earth Observation (EO) satellite data are the single most important and richest source of environmental information for Australia. Data from operational missions, such as the USA Landsat and the EU Copernicus missions, are important data sources underpinning a range of research and operational uses across the continent.To provide confidence in the data from these active EO missions, work is currently underway in Australia to develop a national framework for the validation of these data. Specifically, data that has been reduced to surface reflectance (SR) will be comprehensively validated to provide a standardised well-calibrated dataset for the Australian EO user community.This paper reports on an approach for continental-scale validation of the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) SR product using field-based measurements that will be acquired near-synchronous to satellite observations over multiple sites across Australia.

TI  - Rice crop phenology mapping at high spatial and temporal resolution using downscaled MODIS time-series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data holds considerable potential as a source of information on rice crop growth which can be used to inform agronomy. However, given the typical field sizes in many rice-growing countries such as China, data from coarse spatial resolution satellite systems such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are inadequate for resolving crop growth variability at the field scale. Nevertheless, systems such as MODIS do provide images with sufficient frequency to be able to capture the detail of rice crop growth trajectories throughout a growing season. In order to generate high spatial and temporal resolution data suitable for mapping rice crop phenology, this study fused MODIS data with lower frequency, higher spatial resolution Landsat data. An overall workflow was developed which began with image preprocessing, calculation of multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images, and spatiotemporal fusion of data from the two sensors. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model was used to effectively downscale the MODIS data to deliver a time-series of 30m spatial resolution NDVI data at 8-day intervals throughout the rice-growing season. Zonal statistical analysis was used to extract NDVI time-series for individual fields and signal filtering was applied to the time-series to generate rice phenology curves. The downscaled MODIS NDVI products were able to characterize the development of paddy rice at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, across wide spatial extents over multiple growing seasons. These data permitted the extraction of key crop seasonality parameters that quantified inter-annual growth variability for a whole agricultural region and enabled mapping of the variability in crop performance between and within fields. Hence, this approach can provide rice crop growth data that is suitable for informing agronomic policy and practice across a wide range of scales.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice fields by applying machine learning algorithms to multi-temporal Sentinel-1A and Landsat data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data present an opportunity for acquiring crop information without restrictions caused by weather and illumination conditions, at a spatial resolution appropriate for individual rice fields and a temporal resolution sufficient to capture the growth profiles of different crop species. This study investigated the use of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data and Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to map the spatial distribution of paddy rice fields across parts of the Sanjiang plain, in northeast China. The satellite sensor data were acquired throughout the rice crop-growing season (May-October). A co-registered set of 10 dual polarization (VH/VV) SAR and NDVI images depicting crop phenological development were used as inputs to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithms in order to map paddy rice fields. The results showed a significant increase in overall classification when the NDVI time-series data were integrated with the various combinations of multi-temporal polarization channels (i.e. VH, VV, and VH/VV). The highest classification accuracies overall (95.2%) and for paddy rice (96.7%) were generated using the RF algorithm applied to combined multi-temporal VH polarization and NDVI data. The SVM classifier was most effective when applied to the dual polarization (i.e. VH and VV) SAR data alone and this generated overall and paddy rice classification accuracies of 91.6% and 82.5%, respectively. The results demonstrate the practicality of implementing RF or SVM machine learning algorithms to produce 10 m spatial resolution maps of paddy rice fields with limited ground data using a combination of multi-temporal SAR and NDVI data, where available, or SAR data alone. The methodological framework developed in this study is apposite for large-scale implementation across China and other major rice-growing regions of the world.

AB  - Vegetation reflectance from polluted and control transects was extracted from hyperspectral image acquired on 23rd November 2015. Band depths of absorption maxima for chlorophyll (Chl), anthocyanins (AnC) and carotenoids (CaR) were determined using the continuum removal. Results from polluted transects depict increased reflectance at the Chl absorption features (around 445 and between 650-700 nm) and decreased at the CaR and AnC absorption features, both commonly associated with stressed vegetation. Strong relationship was observed between total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) levels in soil and field measured Chl data, suggesting that oil pollution altered pigment content in vegetation growing on impacted transects. This study appears to be a first of its kind in that the variables tested were measured in the 'real' world, thus asserting the ecological validity of the research. In addition, integrating remote sensing data with field measurements provide a novel alternative to field based post-impact assessment studies.

AB  - Oil spills pose a major threat of the oceanic and coastal environments, hence, an automatic detection and a continuous monitoring system comprises an appealing option for minimizing the response time of relevant operations. Numerous efforts have been conducted towards such solutions by exploiting a variety of sensing systems such as satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which can identify oil spills over sea surfaces in any environmental conditions and operational time. Such approaches include the use of artificial neural networks which effectively identify the polluted areas. Considering their remarkable abilities in many applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) could surpass limitations and performances of previously proposed methods. This paper describes the application of an approach that combines the merits of a DCNN with SAR imagery in order to provide a fully automated oil spill identification system. The model semantically segments the input SAR images into multiple areas of interest. The deployed DCNN was trained using multiple SAR images acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellite provided by ESA and based on EMSA records for maritime pollution events. Experiments on such challenging benchmark datasets for such an abstract problem demonstrate that the algorithm can accurately identify oil spills leading to an effective detection solution.

AB  - The archipelago of the Aeolian Islands is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea, to North of the Sicilian coast. Since 2000 the Aeolian Islands are an UNESCO World Heritage Site. The human presence in the archipelago is attested since very ancient times (Bernabo Brea, 1958). The prehistoric people were in fact attracted by the presence of large quantities of obsidian, glassy substance of volcanic origin through which the Aeolian Islands were the center of flourishing trade routes (Tusa, 1999).In this paper we analyze the positioning of the prehistoric villages of the Eolian Islands taking into account archaeoastronomy and the aspects of landscape archeology. In particular, the study is aimed at understanding if in the choice of the site used for the construction of the various villages, the profile of eastern or western horizons may have played a determining role or not. Here we present preliminary results of the study made with the satellite data (Google Earth) and data measured by the first measurement campaigns in the field (april 2017). The in situ measurement campaign will be completed in autumn 2018.

AB  - The importance to monitor surface UVA solar radiation is mainly associated with its consequences over the human health as well as plants growth. High-quality ground-based measurements of UVA present better accuracy with respect to satellite retrievals. On the other hand, satellite data allows a better spatial coverage, something of great importance on areas with lack of ground-based monitoring points as in Argentina. Thus, the use of satellite products validated with ground-based measurements allows to geographically extending the analysis to regions without terrain instruments. The aim of this work is to evaluate the monthly mean of daily UVA product from CERES (CERES_SYN1deg) by mean of comparisons with ground-based measurements from UVA radiometers in four sites of the SAVER-net along Argentina for different periods, depending on the available ground-based dataset. The CERES monthly mean daily UVA presents very good correlation with respect to ground-based instruments for all sites with correlation coefficients higher than 0.98. The maximum mean bias error reaches similar to 21% in the worst case. Although it is needed longer ground-based datasets to validate satellite data, we can conclude that the monthly daily mean UVA from CERES presents good agreement with respect to ground-based measurements. Finally, monthly climatology was calculated and maps of these parameters were developed to analyse the seasonal variability along Argentina.

CL  - Los Angeles, CA
AB  - Machine learning (ML) models based on RGB images are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, representing a potential cyber threat to the user. Adversarial examples are inputs maliciously constructed to induce errors by ML systems at test time. Recently, researchers also showed that such attacks can be successfully applied at test time to ML models based on multispectral imagery, suggesting this threat is likely to extend to the hyperspectral data space as well. Military communities across the world continue to grow their investment portfolios in multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing, while expressing their interest in machine learning based systems. This paper aims at increasing the military community's awareness of the adversarial threat and also in proposing ML training strategies and resilient solutions for state of the art artificial neural networks. Specifically, the paper introduces an adversarial detection network that explores domain specific knowledge of material response in the shortwave infrared spectrum, and a framework that jointly integrates an automatic band selection method for multispectral imagery with adversarial training and adversarial spectral rule-based detection. Experiment results show the effectiveness of the approach in an automatic semantic segmentation task using Digital Globe's WorldView-3 satellite 16-band imagery.

TI  - A preliminary evaluation of next-generation sequencing as a screening tool for targeted genotyping of erythrocyte and platelet antigens in blood donors
T2  - BLOOD TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Matching the compatibility of donor blood with the recipient's antigens prevents alloimmunisation. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is a promising method for extensive blood group and platelet antigen genotyping of blood donors. It circumvents the limitations of detecting known alleles based on predefined polymorphisms and enables targeted sequencing on a massive scale. The aim of this study was to evaluate the NGS AmpliSeq application on the Ion Torrent platform as a screening tool for genotyping blood donors' erythrocyte/platelet antigens.Materials and methods. Primers for regions encoding antigens RhD (exons 5, 7), Rhc, RhE/e, Fya/b, Jka/b, M/N, S/s, HPA-1, 2, 3, 5, 15 were designed with Ion AmpliSeq Designer with manual inclusion of RHCE*C primers. DNA libraries of 57 regular blood donors with determined phenotype/genotype (prepared using the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit and 14 primer pairs) were sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM using 316v2 chips and 200 bp chemistry.Results. Sequencing was successful in all but the MN and HPA-5 regions. Mean sequencing coverage in one experiment was 4,606 reads, except for the RHCE*C region (mean 568 reads). NGS results agreed with the known phenotype/genotype of donors except in one phenotypically Fy(a+b-) case in whom FY*A/FY*B alleles were found. Reading rates for homozygotes were 97-100%, while they were around 50% for heterozygotes. NGS of RHD regions led to identification of mutations in two RhD negative donors.Discussion. NGS can be performed as a screening test to determine erythrocyte/platelet antigens in blood donors. This method allowed testing of 48 donors for 14 features (200 bp long) with the depth of a few thousand reads simultaneously, and the estimation of natural chimerism or hemi/homozygotic status. NGS screening can be adjusted to the genetic background of a given tested population.

AB  - The study was aimed at comparing the estimation of the burden and trends (2012-2016) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Syphilis infections by the national Sentinel Survey vis-a-vis the use of population-based studies at a single urban site (Municipal Hospital) in Ho, the Volta Region of Ghana. Using blood donors as a proxy of the asymptomatic adult population, a retrospective analysis of secondary data on HIV and Syphilis testing was conducted using Ho Municipal Hospital's archives comprising 4,180 prospective blood donors. Published reports from the National Sentinel Survey for the Ho Sentinel Site comprising 2,452 pregnant women from 2012 to 2016 were used. The cumulative prevalence of HIV and Syphilis infections in the population-based survey was 4.78% and 2.58% while the epidemiology was estimated at 2.75% and 0.24% by the Sentinel Survey for the five-year under review. The new HIV and Syphilis infections were 3.78% and 2.46% in the population-based survey compared to 2.64% and 0.23% in the Sentinel Survey. Gender cumulative prevalence and the yearly trend was found to be higher in the general population compared to the pregnant women. The use of pregnant women to estimate the HIV and Syphilis epidemiology might not be representative of the general population.

AB  - The UN Sustainable Development Goals allude to the importance of infrastructure quality in three of its seventeen goals. However, monitoring infrastructure quality in developing regions remains prohibitively expensive and impedes efforts to measure progress toward these goals. To this end, we investigate the use of widely available remote sensing data for the prediction of infrastructure quality in Africa. We train a convolutional neural network to predict ground truth labels from the Afrobarometer Round 6 survey using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 satellite imagery.Our best models predict infrastructure quality with AUROC scores of 0.881 on Electricity, 0.862 on Sewerage, 0.739 on Piped Water, and 0.786 on Roads using Landsat 8. These performances are significantly better than models that leverage OpenStreetMap or nighttime light intensity on the same tasks. We also demonstrate that our trained model can accurately make predictions in an unseen country after fine-tuning on a small sample of images. Furthermore, the model can be deployed in regions with limited samples to predict infrastructure outcomes with higher performance than nearest neighbor spatial interpolation.

AB  - Cervical staging by head and neck surgeon-performed ultrasound and FNAC in N+ head and neck cancer. Problem/ objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of ultrasound (US) combined with US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) when performed by head and neck surgeons in N-positive (N+) head and neck cancer patients.Methodology: Eighty-five head and neck cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed for malignant lymph node detection by preoperative cervical US and computed tomography (CT) and the results were compared to the gold standard, postoperative histopathology of neck dissection specimens. US alone, US combined with ENAC and CT were compared in a subgroup of 55 patients who were histologically N+.Results: Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for nodal metastasis detection were 92%, 74%, and 86% for US compared to 83%, 82% and 83% for CT, respectively. In patients who were N+, sensitivity was 100% for US, 84%> for US-guided FNAC, and 88% for CT. The correct N staging rate compared to histopathology was 60%> for US, 60% for CT, and 50% for US-guided FNAC.Conclusion: US performed by head and neck surgeons is a feasible and sensitive diagnostic tool for detecting cervical metastasis, with superior efficacy versus CT. In patients who were N+, combined US-guided FNAC of suspect lymph nodes considerably lowers the value of US because of the risk of false negative cytology. In patients who were clinically NO, however, a review of literature shows that the value of US is enhanced by combined US-guided FNAC of sentinel lymph nodes. Anprotocol for the clinical use of cervical US and US-guided FNAC for cervical staging is proposed.

TI  - Spatio-temporal monitoring of vegetation phenology in the dry sub-humid region of Nigeria using time series of AVHRR NDVI and TAMSAT datasets
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series data are of great importance for monitoring vegetation phenology in the dry sub-humid regions where change in land cover has influence on biomass productivity. However few studies have inquired into examining the impact of rainfall and land cover change on vegetation phenology. This study explores Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA) approach in order to investigate overall greenness, peak of annual greenness and timing of annual greenness in the seasonal NDVI cycle. Phenological pattern for the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) was also examined across different land cover types in four selected locations. A significant increase in over-all greenness (amplitude 0) and a significant decrease in other greenness trend maps (amplitude 1 and phase 1) was observed over the study period. Moreover significant positive trends in overall annual rainfall (amplitude 0) was found which follows similar pattern with vegetation trend. Variation in the timing of peak of greenness (phase 1) was seen in the four selected locations, this indicate a change in phenological trend. Additionally, strong relationship was revealed by the result of the pixel-wise regression between NDVI and rainfall. Change in vegetation phenology in the study area is attributed to climatic variability than anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Nonlinear Bias Correction for Satellite Data Assimilation Using Taylor Series Polynomials
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Output from a high-resolution ensemble data assimilation system is used to assess the ability of an innovative nonlinear bias correction (BC) method that uses a Taylor series polynomial expansion of the observation-minus-background departures to remove linear and nonlinear conditional biases from all-sky satellite infrared brightness temperatures. Univariate and multivariate experiments were performed in which the satellite zenith angle and variables sensitive to clouds and water vapor were used as the BC predictors. The results showed that even though the bias of the entire observation departure distribution is equal to zero regardless of the order of the Taylor series expansion, there are often large conditional biases that vary as a nonlinear function of the BC predictor. The linear first-order term had the largest impact on the entire distribution as measured by reductions in variance; however, large conditional biases often remained in the distribution when plotted as a function of the predictor. These conditional biases were typically reduced to near zero when the nonlinear second-and third-order terms were used. The univariate results showed that variables sensitive to the cloud-top height are effective BC predictors especially when higher-order Taylor series terms are used. Comparison of the statistics for clear-sky and cloudy-sky observations revealed that nonlinear departures are more important for cloudy-sky observations as signified by the much larger impact of the second-and third-order terms on the conditional biases. Together, these results indicate that the nonlinear BC method is able to effectively remove the bias from all-sky infrared observation departures.

AB  - The article presents the results of a study of spectral signatures of the main three types of plant communities: Saline lands, Salty steppes, Pine grass forests from the Altai region (Russia). Earth remote sensing data from the spacecraft Kanopus-B and data from the unmanned aerial vehicle were used. The results of the experimental study showed partial effectiveness of satellite data for decoding selected vegetation types. As a result of the carried out researches the technique of joint use of satellite data and data from the unmanned aerial vehicle for regional mapping of vegetation was tested. The results of the experiments have shown the possibility of efficient allocation of certain types of communities according to the data obtained from the satellite. The data obtained from the unmanned aerial vehicle is well used to identify local anthropogenic disturbances.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - After the recent outbreak of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) was observed in 2016, we attempted to estimate the damage severity in Catalonia, Spain. In this study pre-outbreak and post-outbreak images were obtained from Landsat 8 to capture the maximum defoliation period over winter. The difference in vegetation index (dVI) was used as a change detection indicator and was further calibrated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. Linear regression models between predicted dVI and observed defoliation % by UAV were compared among five selected dVIs for the coefficient of determination. Our results found that the goodness of fit was highest at 0.787 (R-2) using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which may be promising for estimating the severity of defoliation in affected areas where ground-truth data is limited. We concluded with the high potential of using UAVs as an alternative method to ground-truth data for cost-effective forest monitoring.

TI  - Harmonisation of optical product types in relation to geometric corrections
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus data Quality Control (CQC) is a service supporting the quality and harmonisation of satellite data offered to the Copernicus community. The CQC Team has recognised that there is variability of technical terms and definitions in the Earth Observation (EO) products in the context of the applied geometric corrections. A comparison among products from different missions suggests the need for a strong, co-ordinated harmonisation effort. This paper describes an activity of the CQC Team to encourage harmonisation among Copernicus data providers. For the time being this activity addresses only Optical imagery. Firstly, the paper clarifies a set of terms and relevant definitions for use within the paper itself and the published documentation at large. The choice of each term is driven by the fact that it is more broadly accepted by the scientific community than others. Then the paper describes the grouping (harmonization) of the products which have undergone the same (or similar) corrections into broad harmonised categories. Five classes are defined, i.e., Raw, Basic, Georeferenced, Georectified and Orthorectified: these can be considered as harmonised product types for all optical products offered on the EO market.

TI  - Voices from Behind the Bars: Kidnappers' Natural Self-Accounting Views, Perceptions, and Feelings on Kidnapping in the Southeastern States of Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assumptions and debates on the trend, causes or motives, implications, and appropriate sanctions on kidnapping dominate literature, are largely speculative, and come mainly from the media or academic and nonacademic writers. The aim of this article is to explore the perspectives, perceptions, feelings, and thinking of kidnappers, in their raw form, on these sub-areas of kidnapping. This paper engages a naturalistic methodological approach, whereby sampled kidnappers in Abakaliki and Umuahia prisons provided self-account narratives of the criminal activities and worldview based on their social construction and interpretative meanings. Cross-sectional survey design, and a nonprobability sampling technique of respondent-driven sampling type, were utilized to select a sample of 86 from a total population of 123 convicted and nonconvicted inmates. Findings confirmed public concerns on the epidemiological rise in kidnapping in Nigeria, the dominance of economic motive as the driving force, significant negative sociopsychological and economic-cum-political implications, but moderate, smart, and balanced sanctions versus the punitive policy were generally favored. The policy implication calls for social inclusion and job opportunities (especially among the productive population), value reorientation, and mental sea-change, and a smart but cool, dispassionate, nonpanicked, and nonhurried penal policy.

AB  - The forecasting and reconstruction of ocean and atmosphere dynamics from satellite observation time series are key challenges. While model-driven representations remain the classic approaches, data-driven representations become more and more appealing to benefit from available large-scale observation and simulation datasets. In this work we investigate the relevance of recently introduced bilinear residual neural network representations, which mimic numerical integration schemes such as Runge-Kutta, for the forecasting and assimilation of geophysical fields from satellite-derived remote sensing data. As a case-study, we consider satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature time series off South Africa, which involves intense and complex upper ocean dynamics. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed patch-level neural-network-based representations outperform other data-driven models, including analog schemes, both in terms of forecasting and missing data interpolation.

T2  - REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To examine the impact of the dissemination of guidelines to physicians and of a population-level health communication intervention on the percentage of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) receiving preventive care through primary care.Methods. Noninstitutionalized adults with IDD in the province of Ontario, Canada, aged 40 to 64 years were matched to Ontarians without such disabilities each fiscal year (FY) from 2003 to 2016. Health administrative data were used to create a composite measure of receipt of recommended preventive primary care. Age-adjusted rates were used to assess trends, and average two-year rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.Results. The number of adults with IDD identified ranged from 20 030 in FY 2003 to 28 080 in FY 2016. The percentage of adults with IDD receiving recommended preventive primary care ranged from 43.4% in 2003 to 55.7% in 2015. Men with IDD had a 53.7% increase across the 13 years, while women with IDD only had a 30.9% increase. When evaluating the impact of the interventions, men with IDD were 4% more likely (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05) to receive recommended primary care in FY 2015 and FY 2016 as compared to FY 2009 and FY 2010; in contrast, women with IUD were 5% less likely (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93-0.98). A comparable drop was observed among women without IDD.Conclusions. Nearly 45% of adults with IDD in Ontario still do not receive recommended preventive care through primary care. Long-term impacts of the interventions introduced in the province may still occur over time, so ongoing monitoring is warranted. Special attention should be given to the preventive care needs of women with IDD.

TI  - Estimation of Reservoir Bio-Optical Water Quality Parameters Using Smartphone Sensor Apps and Landsat ETM plus : Review and Comparative Experimental Results
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - This study presents a comparative evaluation of three real-time imaging-based approaches for the prediction of optically active water constituents as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), turbidity, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and reservoir water colour. The imaging models comprise of Landsat ETM+-visible and NIR (VNIR) data and EyeOnWater and HydroColor Smartphone sensor apps. To estimate the selected water quality parameters (WQP) from Landsat ETM+-VNIR, predictive models based on empirical relationships were developed. From the in situ measurements and the Landsat regression models, the results from the remote reflectances of ETM+ green, blue, and NIR independently yielded the best fits for the respective predictions of Chl-a, turbidity, and SPM. The concentration of Chl-a was derived from the Landsat ETM+ and HydroColor with respective Pearson correlation coefficients r of 0.8977 and 0.8310. The degree of turbidity was determined from Landsat, EyeOnWater, and HydroColor with respective r values of 0.9628, 0.819, and 0.8405. From the same models, the retrieved SPM was regressed with the laboratory measurements with r value results of 0.6808, 0.7315, and 0.8637, respectively, from Landsat ETM+, EyeOnWater, and HydroColor. The empirical study results showed that the imaging models can be effectively applied in the estimation of the physical WQP.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Recent developments of remote sensing methods for Earth satellite data analysis contributes to our understanding of earthquake-related thermal anomalies. It was realized that the thermal heat fluxes over areas of earthquake preparation are a result of air ionization by radon (and other gases) and consequent water vapor condensation on newly formed ions. Latent heat (LH) is released as a result of this process and leads to the formation of local thermal radiation anomalies (TRA) known as outgoing longwave radiation. We compare the LH energy, obtained by integrating surface latent heat flux over the area and time with released energies associated with these events. Extended studies of the TRA using the data from the most recent major earthquakes allowed us to establish the main morphological features. It was also established that the TRA are part of a more complex chain of the short-term pre-earthquake generation, which is explained within the framework of a lithosphere-atmosphere coupling processes.

AB  - The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important indicator of vegetation development which can be used as an input parameter in hydrological and biochemical models (e.g. crop models for yield prediction and forecast) and is, thus, relevant information to monitor food production and to feed an early warning system for famine crisis. Satellite LAI data is available on a regular basis (high temporal resolution) with maps at regional or global scales (low spatial resolution). This study aimed at enhancing the spatial resolution of the MODIS LAI product to bring it to the Landsat resolution. The proposed method was applied in four sites with different climate and vegetation conditions. Regression analysis between MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and LAI data was applied across time and the estimated regression equations were input in a downscaling model using Landsat EVI images and land cover maps. Comparison between the downscaled LAI values and LAI field measurements showed high correlation, with correlation coefficient values ranging from moderate (0.5 - 0.7 in two cases) to high (0.7 - 0.96 in five cases). The results show that it is possible to use this methodology to reliably estimate LAI at a 30m spatial resolution across various climates and ecosystems, thus supporting a food security early warning system.

T2  - VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Formulation of the problem. National Natural Parks (NNP) - protected areas where anthropogenic and natural landscapes are combined in the same territory. In addition, the main functions of such objects are significantly competitive, which requires monitoring of changes in existing landscapes. It is necessary to define the local objects which, being the most sensitive, at the same time have small plasticity, therefore, are capable to react quickly and adequately to any changes. That is what we call indicative.Analysis of recent research and publications. Many researchers of the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Australia conduct landscape monitoring using remote sensing data and GIS technologies. For example, D. Keith, S. Rodoreda, L. Holman, R. Noss, U. Walz, and others. The National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden studies development of modern landscape monitoring in countries of Europe. Landscape Monitoring of Terrestrial Ecosystems, studied by researches R. Kennedy, J. Jons, K. Jones and others allow using data of satellite for selection of plant contours using Gis-technology. Landscape monitoring of the territory of NNP "Slobozhanskiy" has never been carried out.The aim of the study is to choose satellite images, taking into account the area of the study, the choice of optimal methods of their processing for the compilation of a database of landscape structure facies for landscape monitoring based on long-term observations on the ground, comparing their results with geodata. We have determined wetlands, as landscape indicators.Presentation of the main material of the study. Comprehensive analysis of remote sensing data carried out by the authors, allowed us to make sure that vegetation cover is the most indicative, except for the contours of wetlands, which are clearly identified and easily compared in multi-spectral images. It is reliably determined by the characteristic features combine with the corresponding spectral ranges and the image structure. In addition, changes in vegetation allows you to visually determine changes in landscape groupings and the speed of these changes.Summary. The indicative features of landscape monitoring are wetlands, and there are two direct indicators: the contours of wetlands and the change in the aspect of vegetation. The monitoring method is a multi-spectral analysis of images obtained by processing combinations of spectral channels, which showed the ability to determine the changes in the selection, taking into account reflectivity of the surface. Limitations of the method are the following: there is no established method of meticulous analysis of changes in the structure of vegetation, which is observed visually, but is not reflected instrumentally; inability to take into account random features of the territory conditions and space scanning at a certain point, which is interesting for the study. Finally, the types of monitoring objects, indicative signs of changes and ways to track them according to high-precision and generally available satellite information are determined.

TI  - Managing HIV-positive sero-status in Ghana's most HIV concentrated district: self-perceived explanations and theoretical discourse
T2  - AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As of December 2015 there were 37 million persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs), 70% of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana, which contributes a relatively small number to Africa's HIV burden, has a generalised HIV epidemic. The current national prevalence is 1.47%. Agormanya, one of the HIV sentinel sites in the county and where this study was conducted, has current prevalence of 11.6%. This makes it critical to explore how persons infected with HIV manage their lives, especially in the midst of entrenched stigma and discrimination. However, available information on how PLWHAs in sub-Saharan Africa handle their day-to-day lives mostly dwell on food and nutrition. Thus, there is dearth of information on how PLWHAs in Ghana particularly handle the circumstances of their daily lives which are mostly coloured by their HIV-positive statuses, given their stigmatised identity. We explore how PLWHAs respond to the experiences and challenges of living with HIV/AIDS in Lower Manya Krobo, consistently most HIV-infected district in Ghana. Data were collected from 38 combined purposive and randomly selected HIV-positive persons in two leading hospitals (St Martins Depores Agormanya and Atua Government hospitals which provide specialised HIV care in the district. Using in-depth interviews, we studied how PLWHAs managed their routine livelihoods in the midst of extreme stigma. We combined the social capital and resilience theoretical frameworks to show that our respondents were mostly resilient and strategically mostly drew upon extended family social support to cope with their livelihood challenges. We recommend that community opinion leaders and other stakeholders sensitise community members in Lower Manya Krobo to better understand the mode of HIV infection and encourage/strengthen family and community cohesion and social support.

TI  - Prediction of nonsentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between non sentinel lymph node metastasis (NSLNM) and clinicopathological factors, particularly in the case of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in one or two, in clinically node negative patients with breast cancer.Methods: Between 10/2010 and 10/2014, 350 sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were performed in patients with histologically proven primary breast cancer in our clinic. The data collection includes the following characteristics: age, pathological tumor size, histological type, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), number of positive SLN, size of the SLN metastasis (macrometastasis, micrometastasis, isolated tumor cells), multifocality (MF), extracapsuler invasion (ECI) of the SLN, the estrogen receptor (ER) status, the progesterone receptor (PR) status and the Her 2 receptor status, Ki 67 reseptor status. Data were collected retrospectively and then analyzed.Results: A successful SLN biopsy were performed in 345 (98.5%) cases. SLN metastases were detected in 110 (31.8%) cases. These patients then underwent axillary dissection; among these patients, 101 (91.8%) had only one to two positive SLNs. Of the 101 patients with positive SLN biopsies, 32 (31.6%) had metastases in the NSLNs. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular invasion (ECI), Her- 2 receptor positive, and Ki- 67 > 14% were related to NSLNM (p<. 0.05).Conclusion: The predicting factors of NSLNM were LVI, ECI, Ki-67 level, Her-2 reseptor positive and but should be further validated in our institutions, different institutions and different patient groups prospectively.

TI  - Ground filtering and DTM generation from DSM data using probabilistic voting and segmentation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated digital terrain model (DTM) generation from remotely sensed data has gained wide application areas due to increased sensor resolution. In this study, a novel ground filtering and segmentation method is proposed for digital surface model (DSM) data. The proposed method starts with extracting DSM feature points. These are used in a probabilistic framework to generate a non-ground object probability map in spatial domain. Modes of this map are used as seed points in a novel segmentation method based on morphological operations. This leads to ground filtering and DTM generation. The method is tested on three different data sets. Two of these originate from light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors, where resulting kappa coefficient (kappa) range mostly higher than 95% for differently structured urban areas. Also, the visual appearance of the generated DTM exhibits obvious improvements over all other investigated methods. The third data set is a DSM obtained from WorldView-2 stereo image pairs. Also here, we compare our results with three different methods in the literature. Although the DSM quality is much lower, more than 85% of kappa can be reached by the proposed method, showing its superiority over other methods. Overall experimental results show that the proposed method can be used reliably for DTM generation. The results also indicate that the method has prominent advantages in comparison to established methodologies in terms of robustness in handling urban areas of different properties. Moreover, there are only few parameters to adjust in the proposed method, and these are independent of the object size in DSM data.

TI  - Sentinel Lenf Node Biopsy Results Used in Early Stage Breast Cancer in a Practice in the Last Year
T2  - GAZI MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: In the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes in early stage breast cancer, routine axillary dissection has been left to the sentinel lymph node dissection. When sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed with high accuracy of the axillary region, complications due to axillary dissection do not develop. We also examined our sentinel lymph node biopsy in early stage breast cancer in our study.Material and Methods: Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 22 patients with early stage breast cancer diagnosed at Suleyman Demirel University Medical Faculty Hospital in 2014. The files of these patients were retrospectively reviewed.Results: A 81.2% of 22 patients who received sentinel lymph node biopsy underwent breast conserving surgery and 18.2% had simple mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed a median of 1.9 lymph nodes (min: 1-max: 3). As a result of the frozen examination, 81.8% of the lymph nodes were benign and 18.2% were malignant. In all of the axillary lymph node malignancies, the tumor showed upper external quadrant placement and 75% had lymphovascular invasion. This disease was supplemented by axillary dissection. Metastatic lymph nodes were not detected in one patient except sentinel lymph node.Conclusion: In our study, sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed for all early stage breast cancer negative for axilla diagnosed in our clinic.

TI  - PUSHKIN AND CHINA
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the actual problem of "Pushkin and China". For the first time it was designated in Russian studies of literature by M. P. Alekseev. This issue was discussed most actively in the 1970s, when two views on the Pushkin approach in the reception of the "Chinese theme" were formed. The first position was defended by D. I. Belkin, who proposed to consider not only China, but also, in general, the East as a "concept" in Pushldn's work. Special attention was paid to the conscious nature of Pushkin's perception of Chinese classical culture, which is why the study was subjected to both works of art by the poet and his political writings, diaries and travel records, also memoir prose. The second view belonged to the specialist in Iranian studies I. S. Braginsky, who continued to develop the ideas of academic N. I. Conrad of universal typology in the Russian material. From his point of view, Pushkin's reception of the East (including China) proceeded in a semi-conscious form, which does not reject the need to turn to conscious borrowing reflected in political essays or diary notes. It discussed that in the analysis of A S. Pushkin's poetic works the concept of "West-East synthesis" is of great importance. The East is not an inclusion of "Oriental motives", but a fragment of consciousness, a moment of aesthetic vision The authors of the proposed article synthesize these two approaches and by examples show what positive results can be obtained in this case. We record the facts of A. S. Pushkin's appeal to the Chinese tradition (at the biographical, historical and cultural levels). At the same time, we show how the "Chinese text" is presented in Pushkin's consciousness, if not to close it with "small time", according to M. Bakhtin, and to include in the "big time" which is a wider historical and cultural extent. In other words, we study Pushkin's poems (the poetic heritage of the late, mature years, mainly 1830s) in the context of the Chinese worldview, acting as a "matrix of analysis" due to the fact that A. S. Pushkin acts as a bright and extraordinary innovation in Ancient China has long been systematically developed into a whole structure, whether it is a motive, genre or a system of views.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Terrestrial Oil spills pose serious health risk to human lives from indirect ingestion of contaminated drinking water, aquatic products and on contaminated farmland produce. Spill impact mapping is essential in establishing the extent of damage by oil spills to inland vegetation. It also helps ascertaining the type of environmental remediation required for a particular landcover. Various detection methods have been reported in the literature's ranging from radiative transfer models, vegetation health indices, canopy water use efficiency and UAVSAR Polarimetric Backscatter Decomposition among several others. These approach in isolation cannot be effectively used in wide area mapping and discrimination of oil free from oil polluted landcover. Similarly, it is also necessary to develop transferable techniques that will leverage freely accessible space borne satellite data for consistent spill impact mapping in near real time. In this study, we integrated derivatives from the freely accessible sentinel 2 spectral reflectance and vegetation health indices, with sentinel 1 retrieved backscatter, alpha (alpha) and entropy (H) scatter to examine and map oil spill impacted areas within terrestrial habitat. The utility of machine learning random forest was explored to assess classification accuracies. Initial results suggest that the Red Edge and SWIR Bands of Sentinel 2 are vital discriminators of oil polluted and oil free landcover.

AB  - Detection of oil pollution have been evaluated and assessed by several authors adopting such techniques as field spectroscopy, vegetation health indices, canopy water use efficiency and UAVSAR Polarimetric Backscatter and Decomposition among several others. However, no published study at the moment have sought to utilize and assess the potential of Spaceborne Sentinel1 C - Band SAR Datasets in the characterization of vegetation affected by oil pollution. In this study, field work was conducted across 3 sites of a recent, old and a non- polluted site. The field plot center point was used to retrieve image information for the various sites. Effort was made to assess the underlying characteristics of Sentinel - 1 C Band derived Entropy and Alpha Plane Polarimetric scatterers and the field spectral responses. Result shows that the Alpha component of the dual polarization decomposition had stable scattering characteristics after the spill compared to the observed random scattering characteristics before the spill. This however indicates a feasible potential of the Alpha plane component scatterers for discerning stressed vegetation as a result of oil pollution.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF FOREST STAND PARAMETERS BY USING THE SPECTRAL AND TEXTURAL FEATURES DERIVED FROM DIGITAL AERIAL IMAGES
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are important data sources in the management and planning of forest ecosystems. In this study, we aimed to estimate forest stand parameters using the spectral (Average Brightness Value) and textural features (Standard Deviation of Gray Levels, Entropy, Contrast, Correlation, Homogeneity) derived from digital aerial images. Study was carried out in Adiyaman Forestry Operation Directorate in Turkey. Relationships between image features and stand parameters (diameter at breast height-DBH, mean height, stand volume, basal area, and number of trees) were tested by using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Image features exhibiting the highest correlation with stand parameters were modelled by a linear regression analysis. The validity of the models developed was then tested using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The 'Contrast' values derived from the infrared band showed the highest correlation with DBH and mean height, the 'Contrast' values from the red band showed the highest correlation with stand volume and basal area, and the 'Homogeneity' values from the infrared band showed the highest correlation with the number of trees. The adjusted coefficients of determination (R(2)adj) of the estimation models were calculated 0.48 for DBH, 0.38 for mean height, 0.41 for stand volume, 0.45 for basal area and 0.43 for tree number. The relative root mean square error (RMSE%) values were for each parameters 11.91%, 23.57%, 20.96%, 15.81% and 16.20%, respectively.

TI  - CULTURAL SEMANTICS IN SECOND LANGUAGE TEACHING: A CASE STUDY OF RUSSIAN <i>DRUG</i> AND ENGLISH <i>FRIEND</i>

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - Numerous semantic studies have shown that most words that at first glance seem to be equivalents and are given as such in dictionaries, at a deeper level are far from being full equivalents (e.g. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]). Almost every word has its cultural semantic components which hinder understanding and create difficulties in communication and translation, therefore they need a careful considering. We suggest that the words that carry information about the 'deep culture' [7:50], i.e. cultural values and attitudes, worldview, socio-cultural relations are of particular importance as they give new knowledge about the target language and culture, and therefore they deserve special attention in SL teaching. In our study we analyse the words dealing with interpersonal relations (friend vs drug and their derivatives) in English and Russian focusing on their similarities and differences. The data were taken from English and Russian bilingual dictionaries, definition dictionaries, British National Corpus (BNC), and Russian National Corpus (RNC). The study implemented contrastive semantic, definitive, context, functional and cultural analyses. The results show that semantics of these words contains cultural components that reflect types of culture and relations between people. The study confirms that language is a 'social semiotic system' (M. Halliday) [8] and it is increasingly important to consider the axiological and social aspects of language in an intercultural perspective both for theoretical and pedagogical purposes. It enables the students to arrive at the conclusion that language and culture are fundamentally interrelated and increase the level of their intercultural communicative competence.

AB  - As numerous studies have shown a lot of words which seem to be semantic equivalents and are given as such in bilingual dictionaries have certain semantic differences (Gladkova, 2010, Goddard and Wierzbicka, 1995, 2014; Karasik, 2012; Wierzbicka, 1992, 2014; Zaliznyak, Levontina and Shmelev 2012, to name but a few). This is not surprising, as language is an essential part of culture and reflects its values and attitudes. These partial equivalents may create difficulties in communication and translation since their similarities are deceptive, and their culture specific elements are not obvious. The cultural components can be revealed through meticulous semantic, functional, and discourse analysis which can give important information about the differences between cultures and societies. We believe that the lexemes that contain information about the 'deep culture' (Guirdham 1999: 50), i.e. cultural values and attitudes, worldview, and social organization are of particular importance for understanding contemporary societies. The study explores the words dealing with social relations, namely the words expressing (in) tolerance in English (BrE and AmE) and Russian focusing on their similarities and differences. The data were taken from English and Russian bilingual dictionaries, definition dictionaries, British National Corpus (BNC), and Russian National Corpus (RNC), as well as British, American and Russian newspapers. The study implemented contrastive semantic, definitive, discourse and cultural analyses. The results show that the semantics of these words contain cultural components which reflect different types of cultures that which vary in power and ideology. The study confirms that it is increasingly important to consider the axiological, psychological, and social aspects of language in an intercultural perspective as the results of such interdisciplinary linguistic studies supplement the data of the social and cultural sciences.

AB  - This paper focuses on the assessment of wind energy potential in the three climatic zones of Chad: the Saharan (north), the Sahel (center) and the Sudan (south) zones. For each zone, three representative meteorological locations were chosen and assessed based on satellite data provided by NASA. The data comes from MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) and covers the period 2005-2014. The wind speed frequency distribution of locations was found by using Weibull distribution function. From this statistical data analysis, we found that the wind regime is different in the three regions. It is higher in the Saharan region (with annual mean wind speed of 5.78 m/s) followed by the Sahel (4.32 m/s) and Sudanian (3.7 m/s) regions. There are two distinct seasons in Chad: the dry and the rainy seasons with varying periods, with respect to the regions (2 months of rain in the Saharan zone vs 7 months in the Sudanian zone). For all regions the mean wind speed is higher in the dry season. Diurnal variations of mean wind speed show two regimes characterized respectively by high values in the early morning and the night and low values during the day. The corresponding power density was 193 w/m(2), 76.15 w/m(2) and 29.0 w/m(2), resp. for the Saharan, Sahelian and Sudanian regions. The wind regimes are globally stable with dominant directions North-East (for Saharan region), East (Sahelian), South-Southwest (Sudanian).

AB  - L-band radiometry has been considered the preferred technique for global soil moisture (SM) remote sensing, as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions proved. Owing the limited spatial resolution of current L-band radiometers, several downscaling algorithms have been developed to enhance the SMOS and SMAP SM resolutions. In this regard, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) may be used for indirectly estimating SM, not only for disaggregation.In this study, 1-km ATI-derived SM was obtained from March 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as an alternative to L-band radiometry. The ATI-derived SM was validated over the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS). Comparisons with in situ SM showed slightly lower correlation (similar to 0.62), but similar error (similar to 0.043 m(3).m(-3)) and lower bias (similar to 0.027 m(3).m(-3)) than the existing SMOS and SMAP products, whilst improving the resolution.

AB  - Forest disturbances (i.e. deforestation and degradation) are a serious problem significantly contributing to greenhouse emissions and biodiversity loss. This study investigates the potential of integrating multi-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data: ALOS PalSAR-2, Sentinel-1B and TanDEM-X, in combination with field data to identify and classify different levels of forest disturbance in a secondary forest in Colombia. Disturbances were classified into three classes using a K-Means clustering of the field data. Hereafter, we used SAR data to retrieve those classes by means of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The accuracy assessment showed a Kappa coefficient of 0.72 and an overall accuracy of 66.2%, thus demonstrating the potential of multifrequency SAR data to assess differences in structure related to forest disturbances.

AB  - The potential of discrimination and grouping of digital levels of image classification methods based on machine learning algorithms allow obtaining good results in the classification of land coverages. The machine-learning algorithm Random Forest is considered a robust algorithm for classification and regression, presenting good performance for data of high dimensionality, as is the case of the satellite imagery stored in the Colombian Data Cube (CDCol). This paper aims to present the implementation of Radom Forest on the CDCol infrastructure for land cover classification, on the Orinoquia Natural Region in Colombia. We used Landsat 8 OLI imagery data for 2016 at surface reflectance level and seven thematic land cover classes for the supervised classification. The overall thematic accuracy assessment was 86% and Kappa index of agreement was 79%. The results suggest that this method produces an accurate sub-pixel characterization of the land cover classes that is acceptable for practical applications.

T2  - MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR REMOTE SENSING IMAGE PROCESSING: MODELS AND METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF 2D SATELLITE AND AERIAL IMAGES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter presents a selection of image representation methods for very high spatial resolution optical data acquired by agile satellite platforms. Each method aims at specific properties of the image information content and can be tailored to address unique features in spatial, temporal, and angular acquisitions. Techniques for the identification and characterization of surface structures and objects often employ spatial and spectral features best represented in panchromatic and multispectral images, respectively. In both cases, the vastness of the data space can only be addressed effectively by means of some data representation structure that organizes the image information content in meaningful ways. The latter suggest that a globally optimal representation of the object(s) of interest can be obtained through interactions with a scale space as opposed to single-scale information layer. Two examples, the Max-Tree and Alpha-Tree algorithms, are discussed in the context of interactive big data information mining. Optical and structural properties of the surface materials can be exploited by analyzing the tempo-angular domain by means of anisotropic decompositions, which rely on the availability of surface reflectance data and dense angular sampling. Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions of various materials are discussed in detail, showing that the temporal information should always be coupled to the corresponding angular component to make the best use of the available imagery.

AB  - Soil-moisture active passive (SMAP) satellite measures the water content in the top 5 cm (2 inches) of soil everywhere on the Earth's surface. SMAP launched in January 2015, and will collect observations for a three-year period (2015-2018), with a 2-3 day temporal resolution. It produces global soil moisture maps that can be used to improve the understanding of water and carbon cycle, improving weather forecasts, monitoring droughts, and predicting floods. These radar observations could also be superimposed on a map of transportation infrastructures to evaluate their resilience to extreme weather events. This project involved a multidisciplinary approach to managing flood risk to transportation infrastructures. The objectives of this study were to use remote sensing technology to improve the durability and lifespan of transportation infrastructures as well as improve flood predictions to prevent hazardous flooding.

TI  - Vineyard properties extraction combining UAS-based RGB imagery with elevation data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To differentiate between canopy and vegetation cover is particularly challenging. Nonetheless, it is pivotal in obtaining the exact crops' vegetation when using remote-sensing data. In this article, a method to automatically estimate and extract vineyards' canopy is proposed. It combines vegetation indices and digital elevation models - derived from high-resolution images, acquired using unmanned aerial vehicles - to differentiate between vines' canopy and inter-row vegetation cover. This enables the extraction of relevant information from a specific vineyard plot. The proposed method was applied to data acquired from some vineyards located in Portugal's north-eastern region, and the resulting parameters were validated. It proved to be an effective method when applied with consumer-grade sensors, carried by unmanned aerial vehicles. Moreover, it also proved to be a fast and efficient way to extract vineyard information, enabling vineyard plots mapping for precision viticulture management tasks.

TI  - Temporal association of rotavirus vaccination and genotype circulation in South Africa: Observations from 2002 to 2014.
T2  - Vaccine
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccination has reduced diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality globally. The monovalent rotavirus vaccine was introduced into the public immunization program in South Africa (SA) in 2009 and led to approximately 50% reduction in rotavirus hospitalization in young children. The aim of this study was to investigate the rotavirus genotype distribution in SA before and after vaccine introduction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In addition to pre-vaccine era surveillance conducted from 2002 to 2008 at Dr George Mukhari Hospital (DGM), rotavirus surveillance among children <5 years hospitalized for acute diarrhoea was established at seven sentinel sites in SA from April 2009 to December 2014. Stool specimens were screened by enzyme immunoassay and rotavirus positive specimens genotyped using standardised methods.RESULTS: At DGM, there was a significant decrease in G1 strains from pre-vaccine introduction (34%; 479/1418; 2002-2009) compared to post-vaccine introduction (22%; 37/170; 2010-2014; p for trend <.001). Similarly, there was a significant increase in non-G1P[8] strains at this site (p for trend <.001). In expanded sentinel surveillance, when adjusted for age and site, the odds of rotavirus detection in hospitalized children with diarrhoea declined significantly from 2009 (46%; 423/917) to 2014 (22%; 205/939; p<.001). The odds of G1 detection declined significantly from 2009 (53%; 224/421) to 2010-2011 (26%; 183/703; aOR=0.5; p<.001) and 2012-2014 (9%; 80/905; aOR=0.1; p<.001). Non-G1P[8] strains showed a significant increase from 2009 (33%; 139/421) to 2012-2014 (52%; 473/905; aOR=2.5; p<.001).CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus vaccination of children was associated with temporal changes in circulating genotypes. Despite these temporal changes in circulating genotypes, the overall reduction in rotavirus disease in South Africa remains significant.

AB  - Modern Earth Observation (EO) satellite missions provide valuable opportunities to support sustainable urban planning and management by delivering dedicated information on the spatiotemporal development of the built environment and its key morphological and physical characteristics such as imperviousness, greenness, built-up density, building volume, albedo - from global down to local scale. However, the transformation of the raw EO imagery into ready-to-use thematic data and indicators for scientist or planners on the one hand and actionable information for decision makers on the other hand requires detailed technical expert knowledge. Moreover, the imagery collected by satellite missions such as the US Landsat program or the European fleet of Sentinel satellites, but also by airborne systems or drones, rapidly adds up to a multiple of the data volume that can effectively be handled with standard work stations and software solutions.Hence, this contribution introduces the Urban Thematic Exploitation Platform (https://urban-tep.eo.esa.int) that utilizes modern information and communication technology to bridge the gap between the mass data collections of the technology-driven EO sector and the demand of science, planning, and policy for up-to-date information on the status, properties and dynamics of the urban system. Key components of the Urban Thematic Exploitation Platform (U-TEP) are an open, web-based portal that is connected to distributed high-level computing clusters and clouds and that also provides key functionalities for i) high-performance data access, analysis and visualization, ii) customized development and sharing of algorithms, products and services, and iii) networking, communication and exchange of data and information. The overarching objective here is to enable any interested (non-expert) user to easily generate actionable indicators and information for effective sustainable urban development based on a joint analysis of various data sources such as official survey data, EO mission data, socio-economic statistics, and data collected via social media or citizen science.So far more than 3.5 PB of data have been processed and analyzed by means of the U-TEP to finally provide a broad spectrum of urban information products and related services for visualization and analytics that have yet successfully been used by more than 240 institutions (science, planning, NGOs, policy) from 41 countries (i.a. World Bank Group, United Nations, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Food Programme, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Group on Earth Observation, Global Platform for Sustainable Cities).

AB  - Dust is a natural aerosol with an important influence over the Mediterranean basin from a climatic perspective. WRF-Chem simulations have been evaluated over Europe for an October 2010 dust episode. Three modeling scenarios differ in the inclusion or not of aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions. The evaluation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) indicates a slight improvement of simulations when evaluated against MODIS when including the aerosol radiative feedbacks (RF). For the and Angstrom exponent (AE), the model tends to underestimate the variability of this variable, and a much more limited improvement when including RF.

TI  - Evaluation of water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture supported by satellite images
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the water use efficiency is a necessary condition to improve water productivity. The overall water use efficiency is the product of conveyance efficiency in the largest and minor irrigation canal systems, multiplied by the application efficiency at the users' plots. Conveyance efficiency is achieved by measuring the water delivered at the irrigated plots between the amounts of water taken from the sources of supply. These measurements are generally carried out by the personnel operating the irrigation systems. In most of the districts, these measurements are usually carried mandatory to report to the National Water Commission, with a variable precision. However, the water application efficiency in the users' plots is much more difficult to be done, because the measurement of water consumption by plants is not easy to assess. Indeed, the efficiency in plot irrigation, is the ratio of crop water evapotranspiration between the amounts of water applied, both measurements are difficult to perform. However, in recent years it has been possible to estimate water consumption by crops using satellite imagery. Thus, in this paper, a methodology used in the Mayo River Irrigation District in Sonora, Mexico is shown for the last agricultural cycle 2015-2016 using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images, with acceptable results. This methodology is based on the PLEIADES project 2007 - 2010.

M3  - Article
AB  - This research work is focused on examining the turning behavior of Incoloy 800H superalloy by varying important cutting parameters. Incoloy 800H is an Iron- Nickel-Chromium based superalloy; it can withstand high temperature (810 degrees C), high oxidization and corrosion resistance. But, it is difficult to turn in conventional machines and hence the present work was carried out and investigated. Experiments were conducted based on the standard L-27 orthogonal array using uncoated tungsten inserts. The cutting force components, namely, feed force (Fx), thrust force (Fy) and cutting force (Fz); surface roughness (Ra) and specific cutting pressure (SCPR) were measured as responses and optimized using Taguchi-Grey approach. The main effects plots and analysis of mean (ANOM) were performed to check the effect of turning parameters and their significance on responses of cutting forces in all the direction (F-X, FY, FZ), the surface roughness (Ra) and specific cutting pressure (SCPR). The tool wear and machined surfaces were also investigated using white light interferometer and SEM.

AB  - Offering systematic global coverage for free (with observational continuity ensured for decades), the Copernicus satellites constellations might be a game-changer for many different applications, including cartography at 1:25 000 or larger scale. The challenge is no longer data availability, but rather the analysis and exploitation of these large datasets. The Research and User Support for Sentinel Core Products (RUS) Service is funded by the European Commission (EC) and managed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and aims to mitigate existing technological and knowledge gaps between the users and such free data, supporting Copernicus data uptake.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) offers an efficient and reliable means to map features on Earth. Crop type mapping using RS at various temporal and spatial resolutions plays an important role spanning from environmental to economical. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the significance of optical data in a multi-temporal crop type classification-based on very high spatial resolution and high spatial resolution imagery. With this aim, three images from WorldView-3 and Sentinel-2 were acquired over Coalville (UK) between April and July 2016. Three vegetation indices (VIs); the normalized difference vegetation index, the green normalized difference vegetation index and soil adjusted vegetation index were generated using red, green and near-infrared spectral bands; then a supervised classification was performed using ground reference data collected from field surveys, Random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Accuracy assessment was undertaken by comparing the classified output with the reference data. An overall accuracy of 91% and coefficient of 090 were estimated using the combination of RF and DT classification algorithms. Therefore, it can be concluded that integrating very high- and high-resolution imagery with different VIs can be implemented effectively to produce large-scale crop maps even with a limited temporal-dataset.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental sensitivity analysis of Sentinel-1 (S-1) backscatter to soil moisture (SM) content observed at low (i. e., 33 degrees) and high (i. e., 45 degrees) incidence angles over five agricultural fields of an experimental farm located in the Puglia region (Italy). The analysis focuses on the period from March to June 2017 during which 38 S-1 images along ascending orbits were acquired over the site. Results indicate a slight decrease in the radar sensitivity to SM going from low to high incidence with an impact on SM retrieval error that increases from 5.65 m3/ m3 % to 7.63 m3/ m3 %.

AB  - Recently deployed multispectral sensors can acquire multispectral images where different bands have different spatial resolution depending on wavelength. An example is the Sentinel-2 constellation which can acquire multispectral bands of 10 m, 20 m, and 60 m resolution, covering the visible, near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, a method to perform image fusion of the fine and coarse spatial resolution bands to increase the resolution of the coarser bands is proposed. The method is based on a so-called Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and uses a deep convolutional design for both the generator and the discriminator. In experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed method gives good results when compared to state-of-tile-art single sensor image fusion methods using both simulated and real Sentinel 2 datasets.

AB  - Single sensor fusion is the fusion of two or more spectrally disjoint reflectance bands that have different spatial resolution and have been acquired by the same sensor. An example is the Sentinel-2 constellation which can acquire multispectral bands of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m resolution from the visible to short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, we present a method based on a deep residual convolutional network to fuse the fine and coarse spatial resolution bands to obtain liner spatial resolution versions of the coarse bands. The benefits of the residual design are primarily that the network converges faster and it allows for deeper networks. Also, it improves the spectral consistency of the fused image. Using a real Sentinel-2 dataset, it is demonstrated that the proposed method gives good results when compared to state-of-the-art single sensor image fusion methods.

TI  - Glacier recession in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia in 1990-2016
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Relatively little is known about glaciers in the continental climates of North Asia and even less is known about the glaciers of the Mongolian Altai. In an attempt to fill this knowledge gap, we present a new satellite-derived glacier inventory for the Altai Mountains of Mongolia, using the recently launched Landat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI sensors to monitor glacier change from 1990 to 2016. We examine changes in climatic trends and glacier topomorphological parameters in conjunction with glacier fluctuations to determine governing controls over glacier recession in the Altai Mountains. Our glacier mapping results produced 627 debris-free glaciers with an area of 334.0 +/- 42.3km(2) as of 2016. These data were made available for download through the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) initiative. A subsample of 206 glaciers that were mapped in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2016 revealed that from 1990 to 2016, glacier area reduced by 43% at 6.4 +/- 0.4km(2)yr(-1). Glacier recession was greatest from 1990 to 2000 at a rate of 10.9 +/- 0.8km(2)yr(-1), followed by 2010-2016 at 4.4 +/- 0.3km(2)yr(-1). Rates of glacier recession were significantly correlated with intrinsic glacier parameters, including mean, minimum and range elevations, mean slope and aspect. Furthermore, climate records indicated the warmest summer temperatures occurred during periods of high glacier recession.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Airborne Hyperspectral Image Based on Fruit Fly-Powell Optimization Algorithm
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of airborne hyperspectral is the basis of quantitative retrieval of hyperspectral remote sensing. However, the comparison analysis of aerial and field synchronous data was relatively rare, and it was mainly studied in this paper that the different atmospheric correction methods are compared with the fieldwork spectral of Hyspex hyperspectral remote sensing data. Based on the existing several atmospheric correction methods, a novel atmospheric correction method was proposed in this paper: Firstly, we used Fruit fly-Powell optimization algorithm, spectral performance parameters, that is, shift at the center wavelength (sigma lambda) and Full Width of Half Maximum (sigma FWHM) are retrieved, so the original spectral is recalibrated. We used the spectral of recalibration, and MODerate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANsmittance algorithm (MODTRAN) was applied for atmospheric correction. Ground synchronous measured reflectance data of five types of typical objects was used, and it was then evaluated the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper and other five generally used atmospheric correction methods: QUick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), Empirical Line Correction (ELC), Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum(6S) atmospheric correction, Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) correction and MODTRAN atmospheric correction. Determination coefficient (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were introduced to evaluate the accuracy of the atmospheric correction results. Accuracy evaluation results showed that the proposed MODTRAN optimized based on Fruit fly-Powell algorithm in this paper was the best, with R-2 above 80%, and RMSE within 15%; the results of MODTRAN, FLAASH and 6S atmospheric correction methods were closer to the proposed new method, and also the accuracy of the three atmospheric correction results were relatively stable, with R-2 above 70%, RMSE around 20%. Moreover, QUAC and ELC methods were instable. It is concluded that Fruit fly-Powell algorithm is effective and feasible to estimate sigma lambda and sigma-FWHM, and thus the accuracy of the novel atmospheric correction method is better than the existing various atmospheric correction methods.

T2  - HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area incorporated the Shule River basin, located in northwest Gansu Province, an important water source and ecological division within the Hexi Corridor. We calculated NPP using MODIS images, meteorological data, vegetation type maps, and the improved CASA NPP model. We analyzed NPP spatio-temporal characteristics in the study area for 2001-2010 using linear trend analysis, coefficient of variation, and the Hurst index. The following general outcomes were found: NPP in the study area showed considerable regional differences. NPP gradually decreased from southeast to northwest, with significant linear longitudinal patterns. Inter-annual variability showed overall growth over the study period. Significant NPP increase occurred for 25.15% of the total study area, whereas 11.93% showed significant decrease. The Hurst index indicated that the majority of NPP changes followed the same trend, with 78.3% of the study area expected to continuously increase, and 21.7% expected to decrease in the future. There was a weak relationship between NPP and annual precipitation, but no significant relationship between NPP and annual average temperature, indicating that precipitation was the key annual influence. Temperature was the dominant climatic factor affecting NPP on a monthly scale, and precipitation and temperature annual correlations were lower than those for the monthly scale.

TI  - Assimilation of Radar Radial Velocity and Reflectivity, Satellite Cloud Water Path, and Total Precipitable Water for Convective-Scale NWP in OSSEs
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the ensemble of three-dimensional variational data assimilation (En3DVar) method for convective-scale weather is adopted and evaluated using an idealized supercell storm simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Synthetic radar radial velocity, reflectivity, satellite-derived cloud water path (CWP), and total precipitable water (TPW) data are produced from the simulated supercell storm and then these data are assimilated into another WRF Model run that starts with no convection. Two types of experiments are performed. The first assimilates radar and satellite CWP data using a perfect storm environment. The second assimilates additional TPW data using a storm environment with dry bias. The first set of experiments indicates that incorporating CWP and radar data into the assimilation leads to a much faster initiation of supercell storms than found using radar data alone. Assimilating CWP data primarily improves the analyses of nonprecipitating hydrometeor variables. The results from the second set of experiments demonstrate the critical importance of the storm environment. When using the biased storm environment, assimilation of CWP and radar data enhances the analyses, but the forecast skill rapidly decreases over the subsequent 1-h forecast. Further experiments show that assimilating the TPW data has a large impact on storm environment that is essential to the accuracy of the storm forecasts. In general, the combination of radar data and satellite data within the En3DVar results in better analyses and forecasts than when only radar data are used, especially for an imperfect storm environment.

AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared satellite images is a meaningful variable in many remote sensing applications. However, at present, the spatial resolution of the satellite thermal infrared remote sensing sensor is coarser, which cannot meet the needs. In this study, LST image was downscaled by a random forest model between LST and multiple predictors in an arid region with an oasis-desert ecotone. The proposed downscaling approach was evaluated using LST derived from the MODIS LST product of Zhangye City in Heihe Basin. The primary result of LST downscaling has been shown that the distribution of downscaled LST matched with that of the ecosystem of oasis and desert. By the way of sensitivity analysis, the most sensitive factors to LST downscaling were modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI)/normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)/shortwave infrared reflectance (SWIR)/normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference building index (NDBI)/SAVI and SWIR/NDBI/MNDWI/NDWI for the region of water, vegetation, building and desert, with LST variation (at most) of 0.20/-0.22 K, 0.92/0.62/0.46 K, 0.28/-0.29 K and 3.87/-1.53/-0.64/-0.25 K in the situation of +/- 0.02 predictor perturbances, respectively.

AB  - A salient seed extraction based target detection method is proposed in this paper, aiming to distinguish target points from background points in SAR images. Different from recent superpixel based method which generates super-pixels firstly, and for each superpixel decides whether it belongs to part of a target. The proposed method employs a salient point to region scheme. At first, salient seeds are extracted by mean-shift and region feature based approach. Then, pixels are assigned to the most similar seed and those assigned to the salient seeds are extracted to form the foreground region. Finally, constant false alarm rate (CFAR) operation is employed to detect the target points from the foreground region. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing with five state-of-the-art methods on TerraSAR-X images.

AB  - In this paper, a relaxation labelling based land masking method is proposed for separating sea and land in SAR images. Land masking, also known as sea-land segmentation, is a part of ship detection system for SAR images to avoid detecting false alarms in the land. Relaxation labeling is an iterative method, which can separate foreground pixels from background ones using the neighborhood information of pixels in the image. When relaxation labelling converges, the segmented result is often unsatisfactory, since it tends to label more foreground pixels. To overcome this issue, a loss composed of the background probability distribution diversity and the gradient magnitude of the result is introduced to indicate when to stop the iteration. Experimental results on several Gaofen-3 SAR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

He looked at two social groups; on the one side, for the manners and meager conditions of excavation workers who were landless sharecroppers and agricultural laborers; on the other hand, there were everyday encounters with the representatives of rather prosperous rural elite, who widely differ in their worldview and ways of income earning. The article also touches upon the Afghan village appearance and visible signs of rural poverty, a bloody conflict between the local Pashtuns and Turkmens, very strict segregation of sexes and the issuing modals for satisfaction of male sexual needs.

CP  - International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP)
CL  - Toulouse, FRANCE
AB  - This article presents a photonic circuit that achieves direct carrier QPSK modulation of an RF signal from an opto-electronic oscillator (OEO) suitable for satellite data transmitter. The circuit was implemented with three Mach-Zehnder optical modulators. One modulator was used to construct an OEO to generate a carrier with a frequency equal to 2.019 GHz. The others two modulators were used to compose the microwave photonic I/Q modulator. The setup initially achieved a data rate of 50 Mbps in a QPSK scheme with an EVM of 7.5%. Using a root-raised-cosine filter, it was possible to reduce the EVM to 5%. The diagrams of the optoelectronic circuit and the modulation measurements are displayed. After the EVM analysis, the modulated signal was demodulated through an actual satellite receiver. Using the demodulator, it was possible to measure the BER and consequently the degradation analysis. The degradation for a bit rate of 100 Mbps was 0.07 dB using the OEO as RF generator. In this case, the values of E-b/N-0 and BER were 11.37 dB and 10(-7), respectively.

T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the character system of Mansi folklore has not yet come into the focus of scientists' attention. However, understanding of it opens new frontiers for study of mythological representations, culture, and worldview of the Northern ethnos. Characters of folklore are people, animals, elements, fantastic (mythical) creatures. Sometimes a character is fixed with some attribute (a wonderful thing), which helps him. In the article, we will focus on one character - Menkw. In Mansi folklore it is presented as a forest giant, and its main function is to be the owner of the forest. Rich information about it is contained in fairy tales and bailichkas.Objective: a systematic analysis of the image of Menkw on the material of folklore texts and folk performances.Research materials: the texts of Mansi fairy tales published in various folklore collections, in periodicals; annalistic sources, as well as field material of the author. For details, we attract taboos occurring in Mansi culture.Results and novelty of the research: the research adds scientific knowledge about the folklore of the Mansi. The article reveals the image of Menkw on the materials of folklore, linguistics, literary and historical data. The folklore texts fix characteristics of Menkw and give its description. Anthropomorphism of the image, its tendency to socialization distinguishes the folklore image from the mythological one. Binarity of representation of Menkw in folklore texts is probably due to different time of plots' development.The complex of taboos, ritual acts, system of amulets of the Mansi people defines the boundaries and a degree of interaction of the people and Menkw. The material opens up prospects for further research of the character and plot structure of Mansi folklore.

TI  - Time series analysis of satellite data to characterize multiple land use transitions: a case study of urban growth and agricultural land loss in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use change is one of the most impactful land transitions on the biosphere, resulting in land conversion, habitat loss, and changes in biogeochemical cycling, climate, and hydrology. Thus, understanding it is essential for global change research. Most land change detection algorithms assume linear changes. However, urban land-use changes are often nonlinear, i.e., follow multiple transitions over time. We propose a new methodology to identify multiple transitions due to urbanization with high frequency remote sensing time series. We design, implement, and evaluate a time series approach to detect the timing of urban conversion of agricultural land in India. Results show an overall accuracy of 82.11% in detecting change timing when the algorithm is applied to MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. The proposed algorithm yields better results with raw time series than filtered time series. We discuss the usefulness of our algorithm to understand nonlinear land transitions.

TI  - Remote sensing for assessing soil erosion susceptibility of the lesser Himalayan watershed by Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) of morphometry, hypsometry and land cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the most implicit hazards as it degrades quality of water as well as soil in watershed. Lesser Himalayan region is highly susceptible to natural hazards particularly which are instigated by action and movement of water such as soil erosion, flood and mass movements. Hilly watersheds with diversified land uses and fragile ecosystem are responsible for accelerating soil erosion. Satellite based remote sensing data has been used in this study to demonstrate its utilisation in analysing soil erosion susceptible areas in Tons river watershed (India). In this study an attempt is made to understand interrelationship and role of morphometry, hypsometry and land cover together as coupled criteria in soil erosion. Remote sensing data and Multi-Criteria Analytical (MCA) framework has been used to estimate soil erosion susceptibility of sub watersheds of Tons river basin. The watershed was delineated using ArcGIS to generate the natural drainage network and stream orders were defined using Strahler's method in hydrology tool. Land cover was classified using Forest Survey of India (FSI) forest cover map and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (30m) for calculating morphometric parameters and hypsometric integral for further analysing geological stage with the help of ArcGIS 10.3. Soil erosion susceptibility maps were generated for sub watersheds for each criterion and also for coupled criteria. Outcomes indicated that sub watershed with more vegetation cover and mature geological stage is least prone to erosion. It can be inferred from results that morphometry, land cover and hypsometry all together as coupled criteria can be better indicator for assessing soil susceptibility rather than any single criteria. Also, the study suggested that remote sensing can be one of the most competent tools with lots of scopes to study watershed management and can help efficiently in decision making for formulation of conservation strategies, it is implementation and monitoring.

T2  - Journal of pathology informatics
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Almost 20 years have passed since the commercial introduction of whole-slide imaging (WSI) scanners. During this time, the creation of various WSI devices with the ability to digitize an entire glass slide has transformed the field of pathology. Parallel advances in computational technology and storage have permitted rapid processing of large-scale WSI datasets. This article provides an overview of important past and present efforts related to WSI. An account of how the virtual microscope evolved from the need to visualize and manage satellite data for earth science applications is provided. The article also discusses important milestones beginning from the first WSI scanner designed by Bacus to the Food and Drug Administration approval of the first digital pathology system for primary diagnosis in surgical pathology. As pathology laboratories commit to going fully digitalize, the need has emerged to include WSIs into an enterprise-level vendor-neutral archive (VNA). The different types of VNAs available are reviewed as well as how best to implement them and how pathology can benefit from participating in this effort. Differences between traditional image algorithms that extract pixel-, object-, and semantic-level features versus deep learning methods are highlighted. The need for large-scale data management, analysis, and visualization in computational pathology is also addressed.

AB  - Biomimetics, bioinspiration and functionalization of biological structures are disciplines of intense research. They are wide in scope but not easy to define - this is more a worldview, rather than a well defined research direction. Anyway, the research is voluminous measured by the number of scientific papers and very important by numerous citations. This is why specialized journals have appeared such as "Bioinspiration and Biomimetics" and "Robotics and Biomimetics", while renowned journals "Nature" and "Science" frequently publish papers in this area. Apart from this, the practical results have found the application in adhesives, displays, cosmetics, etc.Each and every technical research area can find its counterpart in the living world: machine engineering in the unusual properties of biological composites or mechanics of animals, computing in the complex neural networks or evolutionary principles, optics in the integument and compound eyes of insects, chemistry in the richness of biological substances, aeronautics in birds and flying insects, and, regrettably, military science has an excellent teacher in the living world too, inspired by the eternal battlefield of survival. There is no end of this list, which is one of the main appeals of biomimetics. In this area, biologists and specialists in other disciplines have a common task of finding interesting properties of living organisms and discovering ways to use their properties.Insects are the richest source of inspiration due to the number of several million species created during the evolutionary history, with the enormous diversity in both form and function. There is a great diversity of insect species in Serbia as well, but with a small amount of available information on the cuticular structures of interest for biomimetics. We think that it would be of practical interest to make an illustrated catalogue of the micro- and nano-structures of insects of Serbia, in particular for the orders of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. Catalogue would include morphological characteristic of the micro- and nano-structures of (cuticle, eyes, wings, antennas, legs, etc.), but also their optical and mechanical properties. This will significantly facilitate the future research in biomimetics.

TI  - Enhancing the temporal resolution of satellite-based flood extent generation using crowdsourced data for disaster monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing satellite data are routinely used during disasters for damage assessment and to coordinate relief operations. Although there is a plethora of satellite sensors able to provide actionable data about an event, their temporal resolution is limited by their revisit time, presence of clouds, and errors in the reception of data. These limitations do not allow for an uninterrupted monitoring, which is crucial during disasters and emergencies. This research presents an approach that leverages the increased temporal resolution of crowdsourced data to partially overcome the limitations of satellite data. The proposed approach focuses on the geostatistical analysis of a combined satellite and Twitter data to help delineate the flood extent on a daily basis. The crowdsourced data are used to augment satellite imagery from Advanced Land Imager instrument on Earth Observating One (EO-1) satellite, Landsat 8, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3. The proposed methodology was applied to estimate the daily flood extents in Charleston, South Carolina, caused by the October 2015 North American storm complex. The results of the proposed methodology indicate that the user-generated data can be utilized adequately to both bridge the temporal gaps in the satellite-based observations and also increase the spatial resolution of the flood extents.

AB  - Recent advances in electronic communication and information technology have led to the development of different remote sensing techniques in the field of precision agriculture. Retrieval of biochemical parameters using satellite data can prove to be a boon in terms of agricultural monitoring. Sentinel-2 data provide highly accurate spatial and temporal data, thus holds great potential for many agricultural related applications such as vegetation classification, identification of vegetation state, analysis of vegetation health, etc. But it is still a very challenging task for the researchers to identify different biochemical parameters of crop plants with the help of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, an attempt has been made to derive the relation between Sentinel-2 data and biochemical parameters of Sugarcane crop plants. For analyzing the relation between satellite data and biochemical parameters of crop plants, first we have calculated the reflectance values for band 2, band 3, band 4, and band 8 of Sentinel-2 images and then we have analyzed the biochemical parameters of sugarcane crop plants such as chlorophyll, carbohydrate, protein, hydrogen peroxide, phenol and proline using leaf samples. Finally, statistical analysis is done to find out the sensitivity of reflectance values for plant parameters. With the help of statistical analysis we have found out that reflectance values of band 2 (blue band) show sensitivity to phenol content in sugarcane crop plants and similarly reflectance value of band 8 (NIR band) show sensitivity for chlorophyll content.

AB  - Computational advances have allowed for the development of deep learning (DL) applied to remote sensing data and, particularly, to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Deeper architectures are able to establish a better separation of the characteristics of the data, allowing for a better and accurate performance. However, it is known that employing very deep architectures with many abstraction levels can result in a loss of information due to the fact that deep networks often normalize each data individually, without considering the set of adjacent data. To address this issue, this paper implements a self-normalizing neural network (SNN) in order to extract high-level abstract representations without losing information due to the data initialization. The selected activation function (scaled exponential linear units or SELU) normalizes the data considering their neighborhood's information and a special dropout technique (alpha-dropout), obtaining good classification performance while maintaining the data characteristics across the successive layers. Obtained results show that the proposal improves the performance with few training samples.
