AB  - Stemming from the social and political confusion of the sixteenth century, characterized by the decline of feudalism, the establishment of the absolute monarchy, and the outbreak of religious wars, Mannerism can be regarded as artistic movement which attempts to refuse the ideal of the High Renaissance, which tries to maintain stability in artistic presentations by displaying harmony and balance. Instead Mannerist painters usually depict exaggerated and elongated human bodies, unrealistic spatial compositions, and discordant perspectives in order to provide spectators with mysterious and unnatural effects.The German Expressionist films of the early twentieth century can be seen as reiterating the stylistic experiments that the Mannerists try to develop. Mannerism’s resistance to established traditions and criteria is a tendency that has been recovered in various artistic forms and genres. That is to say, Mannerism, like various other artistic styles, displays contextual characteristics related to its time through the coexistence of heterogeneous images, intentional unfamiliarity, and deviation from the existing norm; the mentality behind this Mannerist tendency visibly reappears in German Expressionist film. Like Mannerism in the sixteenth century, the aesthetics of German Expressionist film in the early twentieth century correspond to a sort of idealism that the material world should be recognized by spiritual and mental processing, and to a metaphysical worldview that pursues the relationship between human recognition and actual circumstances. Consequently, this paper compares practically mise-en-scene and the figures of characters in some images of the German Expressionist films with compositions and bodily figures depicted in the Mannerist paintings.

TI  - The Effect of Smoking on Progression from Ductal Carcinoma<i> In</i><i> Situ</i> to Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma: A Retrospective Study
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: If ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is diagnosed by needle biopsy, invasion is often found by removing the entire tumor and performing pathological examination. Smoking is a risk factor for carcinogenesis in breast cancer. We examined the correlation between the risk of invasion found by postoperative pathology and smoking history in patients diagnosed with DCIS by preoperative biopsy. Patients and Methods: We examined 128 patients who were diagnosed with DCIS by preoperative biopsy. Multivariate analysis was performed on the risk factors for invasion diagnosed by postoperative pathological examination in all cases diagnosed with DCIS by preoperative biopsy. Results: Multivariate analysis was performed on the risk factors for invasion diagnosed by postoperative pathological examination in all cases diagnosed with DCIS by preoperative biopsy. Number of pack-years was not an independent factor (p=0.349, OR=0.329), but current-smoker status (p=0.006, OR=not calculable) was an independent factor with VAB (p=0.018, OR=0.327). Conclusion: Tobacco components may have an influence on the progression from DCIS to invasive ductal carcinoma.

AB  - The "Advanced Land Observing Satellite-3 (ALOS-3)" is a follow-on satellite of the optical sensors onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) in the series of land observing satellites launched by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). It equips with panchromatic and six-band multispectral optical sensors that have ground resolutions of 0.8 m and 3.2 m respectively while keeping the wide swath of 70 km that is the same as their predecessors onboard the ALOS. The satellite can collect stereo imageries by using a function of large body-pointing up to 60 degrees from the nadir. The digital surface models (DSMs) are generated from stereo imageries as one of the high-level products. This paper reports on plans for the geometric calibration and its derived DSM processing for the ALOS-3 optical imageries.

AB  - In developing countries, dams and reservoirs' construction increases due to population growth and increased water demand. However, downstream stakeholders often know little about how upstream reservoirs operate when a river crosses a border. Satellite remote sensing such as radar, multi-sensor optical, and precipitation products can be used as a practical method to provide downstream stakeholders with fundamentally incomprehensible upstream information about reservoir runoff required to make essential and aggressive water management decisions. In this study, the storage change in the reservoir was estimated from purely satellite observation data on the month and annual time scales. The study area is one of the most historical reservoirs, the Thac Ba reservoir located in the second largest river in Vietnam, the Red River Basin. Using satellite-based measurement is to explain the functional features of the reservoir clearly. Further potential studies include using the water mass balance method to estimate the efficient monthly-to-seasonal outflow of the reservoir, derived from precipitation-induced inflow, evaporation, reservoir storage change, and estimated outflow volume into the reservoir.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents structural and geotectonic features of Iturup Island, the largest island in the Greater Kuril Ridge, a unique natural site, which can be considered as a geological reference. The structural and geotectonic analysis carried out on the basis of a comprehensive study of the new Earth remote sensing data, maps of anomalous geophysical geophysical fields, and other geological and geophysical materials using modern modelling methods made it possible for the first time to identify or clarify the location of previously discovered discontinuous faults, typify them and de-termine the kinematics, as well as to establish a more reliable spatial relationship of the identified structures with mag-matism with the stages of the geological development of the region. The constructed diagram of the density distribution of the zones with increased tectonic fracturing shows a significant correlation between the distribution of minerals and weakened areas of the Earth's crust and can be used as an alternative method for predicting minerals in the study region, especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas. The presented approach can be extended to the other islands of the Greater Kuril Ridge, thereby bringing research geologists closer to obtaining the answers to questions about the features of the geotectonic structure and evolution of the island arc. The use of customized software products significantly speeds up the process of interpreting a large array of geological and geophysical data.

T2  - JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - El-Horria/La Liberte was a bilingual, Judeo-Arabic and French, Jewish weekly newspaper published in Tangier, Morocco between 1914 and ca. 1924. This article offers a careful study of this newspaper in order to show the worldview it created for its consumers through discussion of issues its editor and authors deemed to be crucial for Jewish life in Morocco at the time. These ranged from the consequences of World War I to French colonialism, Jewish peoplehood, Zionism, or the reorganization and modernization of Jewish communities in Morocco. Through a comparison of writings in Judeo-Arabic and French, this article also unpacks the intersections between language, social hierarchy, socio-political commitments, and Jewish minority-Muslim majority relations in Morocco. Ultimately, this article demonstrates how El-Horria/La Liberte promoted the integration of French-speaking, intellectual, urban, Jewish elites into a Jewish world focused on eastern and central Europe, and how it tried to do the same for the larger group of Judeo-Arabic speaking Jews in the Moroccan interior, although it was sometimes challenged by the latter.

TI  - Accounting for Label Errors When Training a Convolutional Neural Network to Estimate Sea Ice Concentration Using Operational Ice Charts
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being increasingly investigated as a means to extract sea ice concentration from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in an automated manner. This is often done using ice charts as training data. However, in these charts, an ice concentration label is given to a large region, which may not have a spatially uniform sea ice concentration distribution at the prediction scale of the CNN. This leads to representativity errors, which can be more pronounced at intermediate sea ice concentrations. In this study, we first investigate ways to perturb the ice chart labels to obtain improved predictions to account for the label uncertainty for intermediate ice concentrations. We then propose a method to augment the ice chart data by rescaling the information in the SAR imagery. The method is found to lead to improved accuracy in comparison to using the ice chart labels alone, with accuracy improving from 0.919 to 0.966. The sea ice concentration maps with the augmented labels also have much finer detail than the other approaches evaluated. These details are visually in agreement with expected sea ice concentration from the SAR data.

AB  - The above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation monitoring provides a powerful tool for the assessment of carbon emission and sequestration. Using remote sensing technique is an environmentally friendly way of biomass estimation. Thus, this paper investigated optical (i.e. Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (global phased array type L-band SAR (PALSAR/PALSAR-2) and Sentinel-1), and their integration for AGB estimation of the Pack demonstration forest in Warrensburg, NY. Importantly, a LiDAR AGB raster of the study area was used as reference data for training/testing purposes. Then, an extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost) machine learning model was used to predict biomass values. The major goal of this study was to compare the performance of pixel-based and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for the AGB estimation. Results indicated that the object-based approach improved the RMSE of AGB prediction about 6.28 Mg/ha for optical + SAR, 6.17 Mg/ha for SAR, and 5.6 Mg/ha for optical data in comparison to the pixel-based approach. Moreover, the combination of optical and SAR data increased the prediction accuracy regardless of feature extraction approach.

AB  - Radiometric calibration of satellite imaging is important for image accuracy in environmental monitoring and applications. In this study, we performed vicarious radiometric calibrations relying on in situ data using Spectroradiometer for absolute surface reflectance and Sun photometer for atmospheric information at the satellite observation day. The field measurements have been used as input to MODTRAN6 for TOA radiance estimation and further conversion to TOA reflectance. Images from constellation satellites of GRUS (GRUS- 1A) and PlanetScope (PS2 and PSB.SD instruments) captured on 5 August 2021 were used in the study. The TOA reflectance estimated by MODTRAN6 and acquired by satellite instruments has been correlated to derive an equation for satellite data calibration. The calibration results have shown an improvement in harmonization of the different sensors data for multi-temporal application.

AB  - Accounting for relatively large seasonal and short term peatland surface vertical displacements with Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) poses a problem of possible propagation of ambiguity errors. Notwithstanding, the absence of continuous high temporal resolution peatland surface levelling measurements for validation has been something characteristic. Based on the ground levelling from a raised bog, we demonstrate the Sentinel-1 distributed scatterer (DS) time-series InSAR technique underestimates real surface displacements and hereby we question the accuracy of the approach over peatlands. When the relative surface change from 6-day interferograms is used instead of accounting for the absolute change, the estimation accuracy improves (Spearman's rho 0.82, p-value < 0.002) because 6-day in situ surface changes are usually small and do not need InSAR phase unwrapping. Despite a serious unwrapping problem in peatlands, DS time series contain useful signal and differential InSAR (DInSAR) might have potential for assessment of short term peatland surface displacements in favourable conditions.

AB  - As more humans settle in dense urban areas, the effect of natural or anthropogenically induced shocks at these locations has an increased potential to impact larger numbers of individuals. In particular, a disruption to the delivery of goods and services can leave large portions of the population in a vulnerable state. Research suggests that resilience to shocks is a function of physical fortifications and social processes, such as levees and critical infrastructure, the strength of social networks, or community efficacy, and trust. While physical fortifications are relatively easy to identify and catalog, the measurement of social processes is more difficult due to data limitations and geographic constraints. Recent work has shown that certain types of infrastructure may correlate with social processes that enhance community resilience; however, the ability to assess where and to what extent that infrastructure exists depends on a complete representation of the built environment. OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Places are two sources of data commonly used to identify the location and type of infrastructure but can display varying degrees of completeness depending on geographic location. We address this limitation by applying a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to remotely sensed data from Sentinel-2 to estimate the density and type of infrastructure. We compare the classification results to known infrastructure locations from OSM data. Our results show that the CNN classifier performs well and may be used to augment incomplete data sets for a deeper understanding of the prevalence of infrastructure associated with social processes that enhance community resilience.

TI  - Riparian Zone DEM Generation From Time-Series Sentinel-1 and Corresponding Water Level: A Novel Waterline Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography data are essential for land management, hydrology, and earth science applications. The topography in a riparian zone varies with time. Available global digital elevation models (GDEMs) do not satisfy the hydrological and environmental modeling requirements for riparian zones. In this study, a novel waterline method was proposed to acquire the digital elevation model (DEM) of riparian zones. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are used to extract waterlines and corresponding water level is applied to acquire the elevation. The uneven water surfaces are considered to acquire the elevation of waterlines and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM is used to interpolate the elevation of pixels without waterlines. The proposed method is applied in the riparian zone of Three Gorges Reservoir and Dongting Lake to test its feasibility. More than 80 Sentinel-1 SAR images at different water levels within three years are used to detect waterlines. Based on corresponding water level of hydrological stations, the elevation of waterlines are acquired via inverse distance weighting method. The distance layer and slope derived from the original SRTM DEM are used to interpolate the elevation of pixels between waterlines. The DEM generated by the proposed method is compared against the DEM derived in 2017, SRTM DEM, the DEM which does not include the uneven effects, and Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite -2 (ICESat-2) ATL08. The good performance of the proposed method implies its high efficiency in revealing riparian zone topography.

TI  - Evaluating Precipitable Water Vapor Products From Fengyun-4A Meteorological Satellite Using Radiosonde, GNSS, and ERA5 Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) products from the second generation of China's geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) have the advantage of high spatiotemporal resolution and can play an increasingly important role in the study of atmosphere and climate. Using the radiosonde, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ReAnalysis 5 (ERA5) reanalysis data, this study presented a comprehensive evaluation of PWV products from FY-4A for a one-year period from January 2019 to January 2020. Results indicated that FY-4A PWV data have a good agreement with radiosonde and GNSS measured ones with the same correlation coefficient of 0.976, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 3.95 and 3.73 mm, respectively. Compared with the radiosonde and GNSS, the FY-4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) was found to underestimate the water vapor during humid conditions when the PWV is greater than 50 mm. The magnitude of underestimation increases with the growth in water vapor content. In terms of spatial variability, the RMSE of FY-4A PWV decreases with the increase in latitude, while the relative RMSE (R-RMSE) displays an opposite pattern. RMSE from the comparison between FY-4A and ERA5 PWV varies from 0 to 6 mm depending upon the location. Statistics showed that 55.08%, 59.79%, and 83.13% RMSE values are less than 4 mm in the evaluation by radiosonde, GNSS, and ERA5, respectively. The seasonal and diurnal variations of RMSE showed that: 1) summer exhibited larger RMSE than winter and 2) daytime obtained slightly worse performance than nighttime.

TI  - The Environmental Story During the COVID-19 Lockdown: How Human Activities Affect PM2.5 Concentration in China?
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - At the end of 2019, the very first COVID-19 coronavirus infection was reported and then it spread across the world just like wildfires. From late January to March 2020, most cities and villages in China were locked down, and consequently, human activities decreased dramatically. This letter presents an "offline learning and online inference" approach to explore the variation of PM2.5 pollution during this period. In the experiments, a deep regression model was trained to establish the complex relationship between remote sensing data and in situ PM2.5 observations, and then the spatially continuous monthly PM2.5 distribution map was simulated using the Google Earth Engine platform. The results reveal that the COVID-19 lockdown truly decreased the PM2.5 pollution with certain hysteresis and the fine particle pollution begins to increase when advancing resumption of work and production gradually.

TI  - A Robust Model for MODIS and Landsat Image Fusion Considering Input Noise
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant progress has been made in spatiotemporal fusion for remote sensing images; however, most models require inputs to be free of clouds and without missing data, considerably confining their applications in practice. Due to recent advances in deep learning technologies, powerful modeling capabilities could be leveraged to bring potential solutions to this problem. This article proposes a novel architecture named the robust spatiotemporal fusion network (RSFN) based on the generative adversarial network and attention mechanism with dual temporal references to automatically handle input noise. The RSFN only needs one coarse-resolution image on the prediction date and two referential fine-resolution images before and after the prediction date as model inputs. Most notably, there is no special restriction attached on the data quality of referential images. The comparison with other models demonstrates the effectiveness of the RSFN model quantitatively and visually in four study areas using MODIS and Landsat images. Two main conclusions can draw from the experiments. First, the input data noise hardly affects the prediction results of the RSFN, and the RSFN can gain a comparable or even higher accuracy; conversely, the other methods only show limited resistance to input noise. Second, the RSFN with cloud-contaminated references outperforms the other models with cloud-free references after data filtering in the same study area during the same period. The satellite data quality usually varies significantly; the model robustness and fault tolerance are considered critical for actual applications. The RSFN is a simple end-to-end deep model with high accuracy and fault tolerance designed for spatiotemporal fusion with imperfect data inputs, showing promising prospects in practical applications.

TI  - A Flexible Reference-Insensitive Spatiotemporal Fusion Model for Remote Sensing Images Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing images, spatiotemporal fusion models were proposed to synthesize the high spatiotemporal image series. Currently, spatiotemporal fusion models usually employ one coarse-resolution image acquired on a prediction date and at least another pair of coarse-fine resolution images close to the prediction time as references to derive the fine-resolution image on the prediction date. After years of development, the model accuracy has gained a certain improvement, but nearly, all the models require at least three image inputs and rigid time constraints must be applied to the references to guarantee the fusion accuracy. However, it is not always that easy to collect adequate data pairs for fine-resolution image series simulation in practice because of the bad weather condition or the time inconsistency between the coarse-fine resolution data sources, which causes some difficulties in the actual application. This article introduces the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and switchable normalization technique into the spatiotemporal fusion problem and proposes a flexible deep network named the GAN-based SpatioTemporal Fusion Model (GAN-STFM) to reduce the number of model inputs and broke the time restriction on reference image selection. The GAN-STFM just needs a coarse-resolution image on the prediction date and another fine-resolution reference image at an arbitrary time in the same area for model inputs. As far as we know, this is the first spatiotemporal fusion model that requires only two images as model inputs and puts no restriction on the acquisition time of references. Even so, the GAN-STFM performs on par or better than other classical fusion models in the experiments. With this improvement, the data preparation for spatiotemporal fusion tends to be much easier than before, showing a promising perspective for practical applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We enhanced surveillance of hospitalizations of all ages for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) along with infectious aetiologies, including the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).METHODS: From October 2018 to September 2020, we screened neurological patients for AES in all age groups in Maharashtra and Telangana States. AES cases were enrolled at study hospitals along with other referrals and sampled with cerebrospinal fluid, acute and convalescent sera. We tested specimens for non-viral aetiologies viz. leptospirosis, typhoid, scrub typhus, malaria and acute bacterial meningitis, along with viruses - JEV, Dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Chandipura virus (CHPV) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV).RESULTS: Among 4977 neurological hospitalizations at three study site hospitals over two years period, 857 (17.2%) were AES. However, only 287 (33.5%) AES cases were eligible. Among 278 (96.9%) enrolled AES cases, infectious aetiologies were identified in 115 (41.4%) cases, including non-viral in 17 (6.1%) cases - leptospirosis (8), scrub-typhus (3) and typhoid (6); and viral in 98 (35.3%) cases - JEV (58, 20.9%), HSV (22, 7.9%), DENV (15, 5.4%) and CHPV (3, 1.1%). JEV confirmation was significantly higher in enrolled cases than referred cases (10.2%) (p<0.05). However, the contribution of JEV in AES cases was similar in both children and adults. JE was reported year-round and from adjacent non-endemic districts.CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese encephalitis virus continues to be the leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in central India despite vaccination among children. Surveillance needs to be strengthened along with advanced diagnostic testing for assessing the impact of vaccination.

TI  - Daytime and Nighttime Medium-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances to the June 2015 Geomagnetic Storm Detected by GEONET
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) to the June 22 and 23, 2015 geomagnetic storm over Japan are investigated by using the Global Navigation Satellite System Earth Observation Network of Japan (GEONET) in this letter. We have detected two groups of MSTIDs on June 22 and 23 and a negative ionospheric disturbance response on June 22 observed by the high-resolution detrended total electron content (TEC) maps from GPS observations. The negative ionospheric response (IR) performs a large-scale ionosphere depletion covering a wide range of areas (similar to 125 degrees E to similar to 140 degrees E and similar to 25 degrees N to similar to 40 degrees N) simultaneously, which starts at 1900 universal time (UT) [04:00 local time (LT)] with a period of similar to 30 min on June 22. Compared with typical MSTIDs, the nighttime and the daytime MSTIDs in this letter both have a southwestward propagated direction and a propagated velocity of similar to 87.8 and similar to 157.8 m/s, respectively. The physical sources of the IRs over Japan during this geomagnetic storm are possibly attributed to the prompt penetration electric field (PPEF) and lower atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) referring to the previous studies. We believe that these findings can contribute to the complement of ionospheric research on MSTIDs over Japan.

TI  - Multimodel Fusion Method for Cloud Detection in Satellite Laser Footprint Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Laser footprint images (LFIs) are auxiliary sensors of satellite laser altimeters, which are mainly used to determine whether the laser pulse is obscured by clouds, and establish a link between the laser and the high-resolution image, which requires an algorithm for achieving high-recognition accuracy while preserving the edge contour features of clouds. This study uses the AdaBoost algorithm to achieve the fusion of multiple semantic segmentation models and combines the dark channel prior (DCP) model to enhance the overall cloud detection effect, realize the removal of thin clouds, and improve the matching accuracy of footprint and altimeter images. The experimental results show that the model outperforms the basic cloud detection model by approximately 14.89% and that the contours of the extracted cloud-covered area are more consistent with subjective human perceptions. Furthermore, the matching accuracy of the optimized footprint and high-resolution altimeter images improved by approximately 17.67%.

TI  - Hyperspectral Classification of Two-Branch Joint Networks Based on Gaussian Pyramid Multiscale and Wavelet Transform
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its high spectral resolution, Hyperspectral remote sensing data can provide practically continuous spectral curves for target objects and fully reflect the detailed characteristics of ground objects. However, the data redundancy generated by a large number of bands poses challenges to the feature extraction of target objects. Hence, the spectral data are processed by wavelet transform to reduce the influence of intra-class spectral variation on classification. The multi-scale image data were collected by Gaussian pyramid multi-scale transformation. Then the multi-scale spatial information was captured through the feature extraction network to improve the classification accuracy. We propose a dual-branch feature extraction network. The first branch adopts Gaussian pyramid multi-scale transformation to obtain multi-scale images and then applies the feature extraction module to gain multi-scale spatial features. The second branch employs wavelet transform to process spectral data to reduce the impact of abnormal spectral data on classification and then applies a feature extraction module to acquire spectral features. Finally, the spectral and spatial features obtained by the two branches are fused in the full connection layer to achieve an accurate classification. This method can effectively capture the fine features of hyperspectral images by combining spectral features and spatial features of different scales. Simultaneously, it can capture the interaction between spectral and spatial features by combining spatial and spectral features through joint learning. Experimental results on hyperspectral image datasets indicate that the method outperforms other traditional deep learning-based and other advanced classifiers.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Deep-Learning-Based Algal Bloom Prediction for Lake Okeechobee Using Multisource Data Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on predicting harmful algal bloom (HAB) events in Lake Okeechobee, a shallow lake in Florida. A spatiotemporal deep learning model is employed to predict the levels of cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa present in the lake for a single-day and a 14-day prediction horizon. Datasets collected from remote sensing (i.e., satellite images from January 2018 to December 2020) and from a physics-based simulation model (i.e., daily simulation from January 2018 to December 2020) are available. Owing to the low quality of remote sensing data caused by various environmental and technical issues, the two available datasets are fused together to create a multisource hybrid dataset for deep learning model training. A convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) deep neural model is trained on the datasets, and the results of the predictions are compared to the true cyanobacterial index for that time period. Findings include the following: 1) the deep learning model, ConvLSTM, shows promising performance for short- and mid-term HAB forecasting; and 2) the hybrid dataset that fuses remote sensing with physics-based modeling (a.k.a. modeling based on fundamental physical and biogeochemical principles) speeds up the model learning and improves its performance significantly. The proposed methodologies are reliable and cost-effective and could be used to forecast algal bloom occurrences in shallow lakes with limited sparse observations.

TI  - Spectral Temporal Information for Missing Data Reconstruction (STIMDR) of Landsat Reflectance Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of Landsat time-series applications has grown substantially because of its approximately 50-year history and relatively high spatial resolution for observing long term changes in the Earth's surface. However, missing observations (i.e., gaps) caused by clouds and cloud shadows, orbit and sensing geometry, and sensor issues have broadly limited the development of Landsat time-series applications. Due to the large area and temporal and spatial irregularity of time-series gaps, it is difficult to find an efficient and highly precise method to fill them. The Missing Observation Prediction based on Spectral-Temporal Metrics (MOPSTM) method has been proposed and delivered good performance in filling large-area gaps of single-date Landsat images. However, it can be less practical for a time series longer than one year due to the lack of mechanics that exclude dissimilar data in time series (e.g., different phenology or changes in land cover). To solve this problem, this study proposes a new gap-filling method, Spectral Temporal Information for Missing Data Reconstruction (STIMDR), and examines its performance in Landsat reflectance time series. Two groups of experiments, including 2000 x 2000 pixel Landsat single-date images and Landsat time series acquired from four sites (Kenya, Finland, Germany, and China), were performed to test the new method. We simulated artificial gaps to evaluate predicted pixel values with real observations. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of gap-filled images through comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods confirmed the more robust and accurate performance of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method was also able to fill gaps contaminated by extreme cloud cover for a period (e.g., winter in high-latitude areas). A down-stream task of random forest supervised classification through both gap-filled simulated datasets and the original valid datasets verified that STIMDR-generated products are relevant to the user community for land cover applications.

AB  - Understanding long-term trends in water quality is essential for effective and sustainable management of waterbodies. Using remotely-sensed data, we generated and analyzed a 40-year history of estimated chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations on Utah Lake, which experiences intense algal blooms and is currently the subject of significant controversy over potential remediation strategies. To investigate the potential impacts of shoreline development and WWTP effluent streams on chl-a concentration, which is an indicator of algal biomass, we compared trends and average concentration estimates for different regions of the lake. For the majority of the lake, there is a very small, statistically significant decreasing trend in chl-a concentrations over the last 40 years, and regions receiving WWTP effluent show little difference from regions with undeveloped shoreline. One region (a shallow bay isolated from the rest of the lake) has both higher average concentrations and a significant positive trend over the 40 years, and appears to be influencing the areas of the lake connected to it. These results indicate that other factors besides nutrient inflows are likely driving algal blooms on Utah Lake, and further research is necessary to understand the lake processes and characteristics that influence these blooms.

TI  - Prediction of seroma after total mastectomy using an artificial neural network algorithm.
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Seroma is a common complication after mastectomy. To the best of our knowledge, no prediction models have been developed for this. Henceforth, medical records of total mastectomy patients were retrospectively reviewed. Data consisting of 120 subjects were divided into a training-validation data set (96 subjects) and a testing data set (24 subjects). Data was learned by using a 9-layer artificial neural network (ANN), and the model was validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The model performance was assessed by a confusion matrix in the validating data set. The receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated. Pathology type, presence of hypertension, presence of diabetes, receiving of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, body mass index, and axillary lymph node (LN) management (i.e., sentinel LN biopsy and axillary LN dissection) were selected as predictive factors in a model developed from the neural network algorithm. The model yielded an AUC of 0.760, which corresponded with a level of acceptable discrimination. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were 100%, 52.9%, 66.7%, 46.7%, and 100%, respectively. Our model, which was developed from the ANN algorithm can predict seroma after total mastectomy with high sensitivity. Nevertheless, external validation is still needed to confirm the performance of this model.

TI  - Lymph Node Involvement in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: Is Lymphangiogenesis a Risk Factor? Results from the MICROCOL Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The prognosis of cervical cancer is significantly influenced by lymph node involvement. The lymphatic system is the primary way of metastasis for cervical carcinoma, and lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI) is considered the most important risk factor for pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM). Previous studies have not clarified the correlation between lymphangiogenesis and an increased risk of metastasis and tumor recurrence. The evaluation and identification of several markers of lymphangiogenesis may identify patients with high risk of PLNM. Our findings suggest that the lymphatic spread does not required the proliferation of new lymphatic endothelial cells. These results emphasize the importance of pre-existing peritumoral lymphatic vessels in the metastatic process in early cervical cancer. Background: In patients with cervical cancer, the presence of tumoral lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI) is the main risk factor for pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM). The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of several markers of lymphangiogenesis in early-stage cervical cancer and their correlation with PLNM and tumoral recurrence. Materials and Methods: Seventy-five patients with early-stage cervical carcinoma underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling in association with complete pelvic lymph node dissection. Primary tumors were stained with the following markers: Ki67, D2-40, CD31 and VEGF-C. A 3-year follow-up was performed to evaluate the disease-free survival. Results: Overall, 14 patients (18.6%) had PLNM. Positive LVSI was seen in 29 patients (38.6%). There was a significant correlation between LVSI evidenced by H/E staining and PLNM (p < 0.001). There was no correlation between high Ki67, CD31, D2-40, and VEGF-C staining with PLNM or tumor recurrence. Conclusions: Our data support that lymphatic spread does not require the proliferation of new lymphatic endothelial cells in early-stage cervical cancer. These results emphasize the importance of pre-existing peritumoral lymphatic vessels in the metastatic process in early cervical cancer. None of the markers of lymphangiogenesis and proliferation assessed in this study were predictive of PLNM or recurrence.

TI  - Tradeoffs all the way down: Ethical abduction as a decision-making process for data-intensive technology development
T2  - BIG DATA & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ample scholarship demonstrates that data-intensive technologies have the capacity to cause serious harm and that their developers are obliged to address ethics in their work. This ethnographic paper tells the story of data scientists attempting to instantiate a carefully considered ethical vision into a data infrastructure while balancing competing priorities, negotiating divergent interests, and wrestling with contrasting values. I use their story to develop the concept of "ethical abduction," which I characterize as an exemplary process by which actors can intentionally and systematically address ethical issues that arise during their day-to-day actions by making decisions with consideration for a foundational ethical worldview. It entails tacking back and forth between divergent but complementary ways of thinking: between establishing ideals and making decisions given practical constraints; between understanding historical context and anticipating future consequences; between acknowledging structural dependencies and accepting responsibility for moral agency.

TI  - Thick Cloud Removal in Optical Remote Sensing Images Using a Texture Complexity Guided Self-Paced Learning Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thick clouds seriously impact the quality of optical remote sensing images (RSIs) and limit their application. For removing the cloud, some learning-based methods have been proposed and attracted considerable attention. However, these methods need to train paired multitemporal images with/without cloud, which are difficult and costly to collect. To solve this problem, we propose a novel texture complexity-guided self-paced learning (SPL) framework to remove the thick cloud from single RSIs. The framework does not need paired images and it exploits a texture complexity-guided mechanism to rank the self-generated cloud-corrupted training samples by texture complexity from low to high and then trains the generative adversarial cloud removal network using the SPL technique. In this way, the cloud removal network learns to restore the cloud-corrupted areas from easy to hard and thus to realize the image reconstruction for different difficulty levels. In addition, we introduce a structural similarity (SSIM) loss function to optimize the training network and improve the coherence of the image structure. Simulated and real experiments are performed on the single images acquired by Gao Fen-1 (GF-1) and Sentinel-2 satellites to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method has a better performance in cloud removal than other state-of-the-art methods, especially for the images of the areas with complex textures.

TI  - Radio Frequency Interference Signature Detection in Radar Remote Sensing Image Using Semantic Cognition Enhancement Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a significant threat to accurate microwave remote sensing. The RFI signals manifest themselves in unpredictable locations and patterns in the image, which will cause measurement distortion and image degradation or even lead to wrong retrievals of the geophysical parameters. Accurate detection of RFI artifacts is a prerequisite step to preserve the overall quality of remote sensing quality. In this article, a semantic cognitive enhancement network for RFI signature detection is proposed. It employs an encoder-decoder architecture, which incorporates the atrous spatial pyramid pooling, depthwise convolution, and self-attentional mechanism. Rather than detecting the existence of RFI artifacts for an entire image, the proposed scheme can realize RFI recognition in a pixelwise manner without setting predefined thresholds. Extensive experimental results on diverse scenarios in Sentinel-1 images with various RFI types are provided, which demonstrates robust detection performance for both strong and weak interference without requiring a large number of training samples.

TI  - Extraction and Mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference Artifacts Based on Time-Series Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a critical issue for accurate remote sensing by synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Existing literature mainly detects and mitigates RFI in the raw data domain, which is generally not accessible to the end-user. In this article, a novel RFI extraction and mitigation scheme in the image domain is proposed using multitemporal analysis of SAR images. By exploiting the coupling correlation and complementary information among the time-series images, the background landscape could be modeled as relatively stationary with the low-rank property. Meanwhile, the radiometric artifacts corresponding to RFI could be well extracted and characterized by the sparse components. Extraction and mitigation of RFI signatures could be achieved simultaneously via a joint iterative optimization process. Experimental results on typical real-measured Sentinel-1 datasets acquired in different regional areas with various RFI types demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

AB  - Forests play important roles in carbon cycle, adjust soil erosion, energy balance, and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, and provide a broad range of socioecological services to human. The knowledge of forest age information helps for effective forest management. This study estimates forest age from time serial Landsat observations for disturbed forests and undisturbed forests separately. Measurements of FIA ground plots serve as reference data and are used for training and validation of the model. Results show that the average forest age in North and South Carolina is approximately 60 years. Forests in North Carolina are about five years older than in South Carolina, due to fewer disturbances or lower disturbance intensity.

AB  - The existing NDVI products have problems in terms of low spatial resolution and inconsistent values at a large geographical scale. Based on medium and high-resolution multi-source remote sensing data (GF-1 and GF-2 data), this paper normalized NDVI by combining absolute radiation normalization with relative radiation normalization. And the existing relative radiation normalization method, single-scene global linear normalization (SGloLM) method, is improved to adapt to the production of large-range highresolution NDVI products. Aiming at the problem of obvious mosaic seams when the SGloLM method is applied to multi-scene images, it is mainly improved from two aspects. One is to improve the coefficient solution of the SGloLM algorithm and propose a new method considering the surrounding multi-scene data, the multi-scene global linear model (MGloLM). The other is to incorporate the Maximum Value Composite (MVC) method to synthesize the maximum value of NDVI at different times in a season, to represent the optimal situation of vegetation growth in the current season. In this study, combined experiments of different methods were performed, as well as qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The experimental results show that SGloLM+MVC and the MGloLM+MVC methods can better eliminate the mosaic seams, and their histogram is most similar to the histogram of standard data, and all quantitative evaluation indexes of SGloLM+MVC are optimal (CC=0.7804, MAD=0.0643, RMSE=0.1012).

AB  - In continuity with the investments made on SAR technologies in the last two decades by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), the "Multi-mission and multi-frequency SAR" program currently supports ten R&D projects aiming to design, develop and test innovative algorithms for exploitation of multi-mission/multi-frequency SAR data. Perspectives of engineering and pre-operational development are demonstrated with regard to various application domains (i.e. agriculture, urban areas, natural hazards, cryosphere, sea and coast). Access to COSMO-SkyMed and SAOCOM images is facilitated by ASI to allow the research consortia to achieve an effective multi-frequency SAR data integration. The program represents a foundational step in the ASI's roadmap towards "scientific downstream applications", i.e. applications enabled by the exploitation of mature and validated algorithms that have been originally developed to answer scientific questions and/or retrieve geophysical parameters, and have been brought to the stage that they can generate products that address specific user needs beyond scientific and academic purposes only.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Agriculture and Forestry (MetroAgriFor)
CL  - Perugia, ITALY
AB  - Farming systems are vulnerable and exposed to the extreme weather events such as drought, frost, and heat.Insurance schemes based on weather indexes provided by weather stations or satellite data may represent an innovative and suitable solution to cope with climate risks. However, their uptake remains low due to both high premiums that farmers are not willing to pay and basis risk issues.The literature is vast and growing, calling for a reflection on pros and cons of different indexes. The weather-index based schemes have been investigated more than the indemnity insurances, with prevalent emphasis on rainfall-based, temperature-based and vegetation indices.We review the literature on index-based insurance to animate the debate on the planning of risk management policies, with a focus on the Italian situation to discuss on current data availability and future needs.The challenge is to identify an effective weather index and calibrate the damage threshold depends on the availability of data and models, as well as on the (scarce) knowledge of the critical aspects driving the weather-yields relationships, a major driver of distrust in currently offered index-based insurance schemes.A large heterogeneity is observed on the methods dimension, the regressions and correlations methods are the most widely approaches to design weather insurances.Rainfall and temperature-based indices are the most widely used as they are arguably the most important factors that affect crop yields.The debate on the identification of the best climate econometrics models to assess variation in yields due to changes in weather conditions is still vivid.Clearly, the main limitation is the availability of highly disaggregated publicly data. The understanding of these dynamics allows to identify the best index and model that can explain the relationship between weather extremes and yield losses, i.e., the working principle of weather index-based insurances.

TI  - DYNAMICS OF CLIMATE CHANGES AND ITS EFFECT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF CEREALS ACCORDING TO SATELLITE DATA
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. To study the effect of climate changes on the performance of cereals. Methods. Remote, statistical, and analytic methods. Climate changes were determined by the sum of radiation temperatures of the earth's surface, calculated using the data of the infrared range (10.3-11.3; 11.4-12.4 mu m) of the high precision radiometer AVHRR of the meteorological satellites of the Earth, NOAA. The effect of climate changes on the state of vegetation, including the phenological parameters, such as the beginning, the end, and the length of the vegetation peri-od, was determined by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained using the data of infrared (0.72-1.1 mu m) and red (0.58-0.68 mu m) ranges of the abovementioned radiometer. The satellite data are openly accessed on the website of STAR NESDIS NOAA - Satellite Applications and Research of NOAA's National En-vironmental Satellite Data Information Services of the National Ocean and Atmosphere Research Department of the USA - http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/. The dynamics of CO2 concentration in the air was determined using the satellite data of AIRS/Aqua (https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/AIRS3C2M_005/summary), the precipitation dynamics - using the data of ERA5 ECMWF/Copernicus Climate Change Service (https://devel-opers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_MONTHLY#description). The association be-tween the performance of cereals and satellite data was found by the method of correlation and regression analysis. Results. Using the satellite data, it was found that in 1982-2021, the sum of radiation temperatures of the earth's surface reliably increased in the vegetation period (April-September), and the amount of precipitation tended to decrease in the zones of Polissia, Forest-Steppe, and Steppe. The highest tempo of warming was observed in the territory of the Steppe. In general, the warming had a positive effect on the state of vegetation, according to NDVI, and on the performance of cereals. However, in the recent decade (2010-2020), the positive effect of the warming on the vegetation state decreased, and according to the NDVI trend, there has been a tendency towards the negative effect of the further increase in the temperature, which is especially remarkable for the Steppe and Forest-Steppe. On the contrary, the warming in the Polissia zone created the conditions for the increase in the performance of agri-cultural cereals. Conclusions. From 1982 till 2021, there was a strong tendency towards the increase in the sum of radiation temperatures of the earth's surface in the vegetation period and the decrease in the precipitation amount in Polissia, Forest-Steppe, and Steppe. According to the NDVI data, due to the warming, the length of the vegeta-tion period increased by 14-21 days on average, which had a positive effect on the vegetation. Since 2010, the acceleration in the warming tempo has been observed. The average annual increase in the sum of the radiation tem-peratures of the earth's surface in the vegetation period is 15-16 degrees C - for Polissia, 14-18 degrees C for the Forest-Steppe, and 18-20 degrees C for the Steppe.According to this tendency, if the current regularity in the temperature increase in 1982-2021 is preserved in the nearest future, the temperature of the vegetation period will additionally increase, and the average sum of temperatures of the earth's surface will reach 4000 degrees C in Polissia, which was notable for the Forest-Steppe in 1982-2021, 4440-4600 degrees C - in the Forest-Steppe, and up to 5800-5900 degrees C in the Steppe. In 1982-2000, there was a strong regularity of the positive effect of the warming during the vegetation period both on the vegetation state according to the NDVI index, and the performance of cereals in all three natural climatic zones. However, after 2000, due to the negative effect of high summer temperatures on the crops, the effect of the warming on vegetation considerably decreased, which was especially notable for the Steppe where the increase in NDVI compared to the previous period was on average 9.41 % in 1992-2001, and in 2012-2021 - 1.78 %.

AB  - The recent advances in Earth observation and artificial intelligence allow us to improve the agricultural management practices through effectively exploiting the spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of the area of interest captured by satellite images. In this paper, we tackle the problem of extracting high-resolution (2.5-meter) cultivated land maps from Sentinel-2 multispectral images, and propose a machine learning algorithm for this task. It aggregates the spectral, spatial, and temporal features of the upsampled images, and is independent from the number of observations captured for a given scene. The experimental results, performed within the framework of the Enhanced Sentinel-2 Agriculture challenge show that our technique manifests high generalization abilities over the unseen data and elaborates high-quality cultivated land maps. Finally, utilizing this algorithm led us to taking the 6th place in the aforementioned challenge.

TI  - Context-Self Contrastive Pretraining for Crop Type Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a fully supervised pretraining scheme based on contrastive learning particularly tailored to dense classification tasks. The proposed context-self contrastive loss (CSCL) learns an embedding space that makes semantic boundaries pop-up by use of a similarity metric between every location in a training sample and its local context. For crop type semantic segmentation from satellite image time series (SITS), we find performance at parcel boundaries to be a critical bottleneck and explain how CSCL tackles the underlying cause of that problem, improving the state-of-the-art performance in this task. Additionally, using images from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite missions we compile the largest, to our knowledge, SITS dataset densely annotated by crop type and parcel identities, which we make publicly available together with the data generation pipeline. Using that data we find CSCL, even with minimal pretraining, to improve all respective baselines and present a process for semantic segmentation at greater resolution than that of the input images for obtaining crop classes at a more granular level. The code and instructions to download the data can be found in https://github.com/michaeltrs/DeepSatModels.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter focuses on the mapping of deforestation between 2008 and 2018 in a small region in Brazil through time series. Vegetation indices as variables that are strongly influenced by seasonality were used. Whereas to reduce seasonality in the time series, dense series of fraction indices obtained from the physical spectral mixture analysis (SMA) model were used. Both the indices were obtained from Landsat images. Then, changes were detected through a non-seasonal detection approach (called PVts-beta approach). To evaluate the detections obtained, true ground reference data of the study area were used. Results showed that the quantifications obtained with fraction indices had an overall accuracy (OA) of 90.00% higher than vegetation indices. Additionally, the different atmospheric correction algorithms strongly influenced the values of the fraction indices. This study focuses on the basis for future work to implement the PVts-beta approach on platforms such as Google Earth engine (GEE).

M3  - Article
AB  - Problem statement. The increased human pressure on natural geo-complexes is causing the revival of undesirable processes that create an extensive risk for the inhabitants of these regions. Alpine-type orogenic zones, which belong to the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus, are distinguished from many geomorphological systems by excessive activity of endo- and exogenous processes. Therefore, at this time, the task of diagnosing and assessing the ecological and geomorphological risk that the population faces in the development of new territories of the region seems to be important.Analysis of recent research and publications. After analyzing a number of techniques used to assess the landslide and mudflow hazards, the conclusion was made that most of them had their flaws.Research method. There are a large number of methods for assessing the risk of environmental management and predicting hazardous exodynamic processes. However, in modern conditions, these techniques are not sufficiently reliable. This, in turn, determines the relevance and the need to develop new or modernised methods of strategies for the prevention, protection, and elimination of the consequences of catastrophes and natural disasters.The purpose of this work is to reveal the geomorphological features and dynamics of the development of the most dangerous and often repeating landslide and mudflow processes based on field geomorphological studies, as well as fund literature, indicate the reasons for their formation and propose measures to combat them.Research results. The article discusses the results of ecological and geomorphological surveys on the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus, dedicated to the assessment of landslide and mudflow risk for the period from 1990 to 2020. To assess them in order to obtain morphometric characteristics (including the down gradient of slopes, the length and shape of slopes, areas of mudflow centers), large-scale (M 1:100000) topographic maps were used, as well as interpretation materials for different-scale and multi-temporal ASP. Based on the interpretation of the ASP within the studied region, in order to clarify the general picture of the dissection of the modern relief of the studied region, a map of morphometric tension was compiled, which includes the degree of vertical dissection of the territory, the down gradient of slopes, etc., and also maps of the risk of landslides and mudflows were compiled according to the degree of danger of landslide and mudflow processes, and the area of their distribution was calculated. Landslide and mudflow risk analysis mainly used high-resolution aerospace imagery (ASI) from CNES / Airbus, Maxar Technologies (GeoEye-1), and medium resolution Sentinel-2A and 2B. Thus visual and semi-automatic interpretation (classification with training) was performed in the ArcGIS environment. As a result, taking into account the morphometric tension, as well as the mudflow and landslide hazards, a map of the morphodynamic tension of the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus was compiled, which makes it possible to reveal the modern nature of the manifestation of exodynamic processes, to predict and assess the risk coming from them.Conclusion. The results of the research will make it possible to use the obtained data for the development of the Program for the safe and sustainable functioning and development for the purpose of recreational and tourist development of the difficult of access mountain geosystems of Azerbaijan.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of mudflow risk in the Greater Caucasus ofAzerbaijan (on the example of the northeastern slope)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recreational and tourist direction of Azerbaijan's development planned the development of hard-to-reach mountainous areas, where construction of various engineering structures will be carried out. Mudflows are the most destructive geological processes, since mountain geosystems are characterized by favourable conditions for their occurrence - high seismicity (8-9 points), increased moisture (700 mm or more), intense weathering of rocks and accumulation of loose clastic material, etc. Thus, the territory of the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus is classified as a mudflow hazardous area. This takes into account the areas of mudflow basins, the intensity of the passage of diverse mudflows, their quantitative characteristics, the conditions of formation, as well as the amount of damage caused to both the infrastructure and the residential complex. The purpose of article. The article considers the results of field ecogeomorphological studies on the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus, dedicated to the quantitative assessment of mudflow risk for the period from 1990 to 2020. The research methods. Large-scale topographic maps (Scale 1:100000) were used to assess the degree of mudflow risk on the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus in order to obtain morphometric characteristics (including about the incline of the slopes, the length and shape of the slopes, the areas of mudflow cen-ters), as well as materials of interpretation of different-scale and different-time ASI. On the example of the basins of the mudflow-prone rivers Gusarchay and Velvelichay, ASI M 1: 60000 1996-2020 from the Landsat satellite were used to determine the quantitative indi-cators of the areas of mudflow centers. The results of research: Based on the interpretation of the ASP within the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus, according to the degree of danger of mudflow processes (the amount of removed material, the erosive effect of the flow on the valley, taking into account the occurrence of mudflows in tributaries and the basin as a whole, as well as the prevailing types and classes of mudflows, geomorphological conditions of formation, forming and the passage of mudflows and the statistical data on past mudflows), and on the actual and possible damage to the population from mudflows, a mudflow risk map was compiled on a 5-point scale. Conclusions. The reasons for the acceleration of the frequency of passage of destructive mudflows made up of dirt, stones and mud on the northeastern slope of the Greater Caucasus are related to the degradation of high-mountain meadow and moun-tain forest landscapes of the Gudyalchay-Velvelichay, Davachichay-Atachay and other interfluves. Based on the decoding of the ASI from 1996-2020 from the Landsat satellite (M 1:60000) mudflow sources in the basins of the most mudflow-bearing rivers Gusarchay and Velvelichay for the period 1990-2020 were calculated. The research results will make it possible to use the obtained data for the development of a program for the safe and sustainable functioning and development of the hard-to-reach mountainous geosystems of Azerbaijan for recreation and tourism development.

TI  - The validity and clinical utility of axillary ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in detection of nodal metastasis in early-stage breast cancer patients: a retrospective single-center experience
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/aim: Assessing the validity and clinical utility of axillary ultrasonography (AUS)-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in detection of nodal metastasis during preoperative axillary investigation in comparison to the histopathologic diagnosis in early-stage breast cancer.Materials and methods: A total of 279 operated primary breast cancer patients (age: 55.3 +/- 12.8, ranged 17-90 years) were included. Data on AUS findings at the time of initial diagnosis (first look AUS), second-look AUS findings performed by the breast radiologist during breast biopsy procedure and the AUS-guided FNAB findings were evaluated with respect to the final histopathology report obtained through axillary surgery via sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The diagnostic performance of each method in detecting metastatic ALNs were compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the first look AUS in detecting nodal metastasis were 64.56%, 86.78%, and 74.19% while the PPV and NPV were 86.44% and 65.22%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the second-look AUS were 70.25%, 87.60%, and 77.78%, while PPV and NPV were 88.10% and 69.28%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the second-look AUS guided FNAB were 89.19%, 73.33%, and 87.30%, while the PPV and NPV were 96.12% and 47.83%, respectively. The consideration of second-look AUS and finding of nodal metastasis in FNAB was associated with significantly higher likelihood of ALND (55.4% vs. 44.6%, p < 0.001) and lower likelihood of SLNB (34.7% vs. 65.3%, p < 0.001) compared to consideration of nonmetastatic ALN status. In 23 (22.3%) patients with positive findings on AUS-guided FNAB, SLNB was applied; 21 had positive results after surgical dissection, indicating that nearly 20% of patients had unnecessary SLNB.Conclusion: US-guided FNAB of suspicious ALNs is a simple, minimally invasive, and highly effective method for preoperative axillary staging in patients with invasive breast cancer avoiding the more invasive method SLNB and it enables the surgeon to proceed directly to ALND in positive cases.

AB  - Recent studies in remote sensing reveal that complex nonlinear learning models such as deep learning or ensemble-based learning are mostly preferred compared to shallow machine learning methods in solving many problems such as classification, image fusion, change detection, unmixing, and object recognition. The fact that much remote sensing data can be obtained quickly, abundantly, and free of charge, and the increasing computing power of computers with developing technology, are why such methods are preferred. With the emergence of big data, these methods provide more effective solutions than in past years, and they can outperform shallow machine learning methods in many remote sensing applications. Despite their high accuracy, such learning models have several limitations due to their black-box structure. Because of the high nonlinearity in predictive models, these models cannot explain why and how decisions are made. This paper presents a global model distillation approach to replace a black-box model with a fully explainable surrogate model utilizing polynomial chaos expansion. Preliminary results show that the proposed method can accurately replace a complex nonlinear model with a simpler one in hyperspectral image classification.

T2  - STRATUM PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the orthodox faith the Russian population of Siberia preserved and actively used pre-Christian customs and beliefs brought from Rus' in the traditional household ritual culture. Archaeological observations allow us to show attitudinal plots of spiritual culture that are not related to Christian practices.For the first time, the authors offer for the scientific discussion archaeological evidence of syncretism of the national worldview in a broad context, based on the study of urban and rural culture of the 17 th-18 th centuries. They examine images-amulets on women's and men's rings, symbols-amulets on objects, in dwellings, ceremonial dishes, the funerary rite of children, the belief in the replacement of baby teeth, customs in relation to domestic guardian spirits - domovoy and bannik. This complements and enhances the existing ethnographic knowledge.

TI  - Translational and transdisciplinary approach to the human papilloma virus - Preliminary evidence from the Italian "HPV board: a future without papilloma virus" project
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered to be one of the viral infections associated with cancers and other diseases. HPV is detected asymptomatically in the oral mucosa. The presence of human papillomavirus in the oral mucosa appears to be closely associated with a series of benign and malign oral lesions.The aim of this paper is to report the Italian experience in applying translational protocols, using new technologies and multidisciplinary strategies in Human Papilloma virus detection and treatment.The "HPV board: a future without papilloma virus" project was born, promoted by CNEL (Italian Council of Economics and Labor) with the collaboration of numerous scientific societies to commonly approach to public knowledge of HPV-related oral lesions and their clinical management.The preliminary results are related to the assessment of the proof-of-concept of this new project. More in details, "HPV Board" is a project that plans the presence of a working group, made up of otolaryngologists, dentists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, in close contact with gynecologists, oncologists and pediatricians; this working group manages to combine very transversal skills, in order to promote primary prevention projects, early diagnosis and adequate therapies.The "HPV BOARD" project will give the opportunity to increase the attention of patients and doctors on the early diagnosis of oncological diseases dependent on infection by the infectious agent HPV. In this panorama, dentists will have the role of " first sentinel" of public health because oral health is an indicator, too often overlooked, for the prevention of numerous diseases.

TI  - The contribution of african culture in Peru: a lost identity
T2  - CULTURA Y RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses the role played by the religion of African slaves in the fusion of two antagonistic cultures: Andalusian and Andean, which occurred in the period of cultural clashes during the Spanish conquest. Such an approach allowed the authors to re-evaluate the current situation of Afro-descendants, whose contribution to the identity of Peruvian society has been minimised and concealed, ignoring its influence as a cultural catalyst in a society that has not yet risen above its slave mentality. Within the framework of subalternity to which slaves were exposed, there was a significant level of self-reflection of consciousness achieved by African religious beliefs. In this respect, the authors identified the existence of fundamental elements in their worldview that served as a bridge between antagonistic religions. Without the capacity for political participation, the socialisation of these syncretic elements was empowered through an array of inconsistencies of slave and vice-royal systems.

AB  - The detection and monitoring of landslides in dam reservoirs are essential for the maintenance and sustainable use of the infrastructure. Sentinel-1 datasets, freely available from European Space Agency (ESA), and Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) processing methods provide multitemporal surface change information in terms of deformation and enable engineering geological analyses. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the deformations within the large landslides based on InSAR measurements in the reservoir of the Kalekoy dam, which was built in Bingol Province in the Eastern part of Tiirkiye and filled in 2018. The region is prone to landslides at various magnitudes. For this purpose, the Looking into Continents from Space with Synthetic Aperture Radar (LiCSAR) products were used to apply the Small-Baseline Subsets (SBAS) method for the deformation extraction from Sentinel-1 time series datasets. The activities within the landslides and their surroundings were detected from the deformation maps produced for three periods between December 2015- December 2017 (pre-dam), December 2018-January 2020 (post-dam) and within 2018 (December 2017 - December 2018). Based on the time series analysis results, it was observed that the slope movements increased significantly in 2018, the time of the filling of the reservoir, and in the post-dam periods; and their patterns have also altered.

AB  - The adverse effects of flood events have been increasing in the world due to the increasing occurrence frequency and their severity due to urbanization and the population growth. All weather sensors, such as satellite synthetic aperture radars (SAR) enable the extent detection and magnitude analysis of such events under cloudy atmospheric conditions. Sentinel-1 satellite from European Space Agency (ESA) facilitate such studies thanks to the free distribution, the regular data acquisition scheme and the availability of open source software. However, various difficulties in the visual interpretation and processing exist due to the size and the nature of the SAR data. The supervised machine learning algorithms have increasingly been used for automatic flood extent mapping. However, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this purpose is relatively new and requires further investigations. In this study, the U-Net architecture for multi-class segmentation of flooded areas and flooded vegetation was employed by using Sentinel-1 SAR data and altitude information as input. The training data was produced by an automatic thresholding approach using OTSU method in Sardoba, Uzbekistan and Sagaing, Myanmar. The results were validated in Ordu, Turkey and in Ca River, Vietnam by visual comparison with previously produced flood maps. The results show that CNNs have great potential in classifying flooded areas and flooded vegetation even when trained in areas with different geographical setting. The F1 scores obtained in the study for flood and flooded vegetation classes were 0.91 and 0.85, respectively.

AB  - The spatial distribution of trace metals and metalloids in surface water bodies and their sediments caused by natural processes and human activities is a complex problem, due to the water importance for drinking water, irrigation, and industry. For this reason, the accurate mapping of those water bodies is from great importance. In this work, we used optical Sentinel-2A image data from 2021 (Copernicus European Union's Earth observation programme) to extract water bodies in two case study areas - the Ogosta Reservoir (Ogosta River) and the Danube River (Archaro-Orsoyska Lowland) based on the following water indices: second normalized water body index (NDWI 2), modified Normalized Water Body Index (MNDWI), Re-NDWI, AWEI(sh) and AWEI(nsch), as well as object-based image classification (OBIA). One of the challenges were to define threshold values of the water indices layers for binary maps creation to generate realistic water bodies maps. The obtained results were compared to the obrained data from OBIA analysis and highresolution data.

AB  - Since 2010, the Centre for Monitoring of Vectors (CMV) of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA), has a surveillance programme in place to detect and control invasive mosquito species (IMS) at locations with increased risk of importation. At the premises of companies that import used tyres from risk areas, the CMV implements surveillance using adult mosquito traps. In case of an IMS finding at a used tyre company location, the monitoring is intensified here (weekly sampling, additional BG-Sentinel traps and larval sampling), as well as within a predefined area with a radius of 500 m from the limits of the used tyre company location. On September 6th, 2021, eight Aedes larvae were found in a sample taken from a water-containing bucket. These larvae were both morphologically and molecularly (Illumina sequencing) identified as Aedes koreicus. Additional sampling at this first finding site of Ae. koreicus in the Netherlands, which was followed by mosquito control using larvicides, did not lead to further findings of the species.

AB  - One of the important and high-level detailing contained within basemaps is the 'building feature'. Though pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models are available for Building Feature Extraction (BFE), they are not efficient in predicting the buildings in other locations. This study explores the need and the major issue of implementing DL models for BFE from Very High Resolution Remote Sensing (VHRS) satellite data for any given area. Though advanced DL models are invented, in order to implement them, huge amount of potential training data is demanded for feed in. the building typologies are highly subjected to the context of study area including soil characteristics, culture/lifestyle/economy, architectural style and the building byelaws. The study believes that availability of enough training data of contextual buildings as one of the concern for effective model training. The study aims to extract the buildings present in the study area from Pleiades 1A (2019) RGB VHRS data using simple Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model which is training on the native contextual buildings. Here, an automated method of generating the location-specific training data for a given area is followed using Google Maps API (2021). The generated training data when trained on a deep learning architecture and predicted by the input data yielded promising results. The prediction accuracy of about 98.41% specificity, 96.20% predictive accuracy and 0.89 F1 score are achieved. The methods adopted assist the planning/governing bodies to accelerate the qualitative urban map preparation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to study the memory of past events based on the use of oral history as a source and a method of research. The use of oral testimonies enables tracing the changes that have taken place in the worldview of a person who has suffered a trauma. The given research is based on biographical interviews with witnesses of the Holocaust, Chornobyl, and Fukushima disasters. What exactly do the witnesses of these events remember? What do they focus on in their interviews? What experiences remain the most painful? Does the type of injury, and the nature of the injury affect a person's future life? These and other questions can be answered not by official papers, orders, resolutions, reports, and appeals, but by the stories of direct witnesses and participants in the events that were at the epicenter of the catastrophe.Oral history, as a scientific discipline that focuses on one's own method of interview research, is designed to capture and reproduce the past based on the subjective knowledge of the person testifying. Biographical interviews do not claim to be the whole truth or a comprehensive reconstruction of events, they give these events a new sound, giving voice to more actors, detailing the past with the testimony of an individual, showing his own way of understanding the experience.The authors used general methods of historical research such as typological, structural, and functional, as well as analysis and synthesis. These methods allowed the authors to analyze the collected interviews, and published narratives and reveal the features of each story. The authors concluded that people who lived through extreme situations that traumatized them have experienced a dramatic change in their worldview, dividing their life into "before" and "after".

TI  - Multiphase Parallel Demodulation for Remote Sensing Satellite Data Transmission-Filter Bank Based on WOLA Structure
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid increase of data generated by remote sensing satellites, the demand of real-time demodulation of ultrahigh speed remote sensing data by digital receivers has become a research hotspot and difficulty. Aiming at the international research gap of parallel demodulation of remote sensing satellite data using multichannel channelization technology, a parallel matched filtering architecture of filter banks based on the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) structure is designed. This structure has the following advantages. First, the decimation factor is flexible and adjustable when the signal is channelized, which is not restricted by the number of channels. Second, the signal is divided into several sub-bands according to the frequency spectrum, which is beneficial to the parallel analysis and processing of the signal. This article completes the parallel matched filtering processing and provides ideas for the subsequent processing operation. Third, the structural channelization decomposition has strong expandability and can be flexibly applied to signal transmission of different systems. Aiming at the characteristics of high speed and wide bandwidth of remote sensing data transmission, this article designs the channelization method of filter bank based on WOLA structure and deduces and realizes the sub-band matching filtering operation. Taking QPSK modulation as an example, the simulation results show that parallel matched filtering has almost no loss in bit error performance. The research results of this article have great reference value for designing multiphase parallel receivers of high-speed remote sensing data in the future.

TI  - Evaluation of an ivermectin-based attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB) against Aedes aegypti in Tanzania.
T2  - Wellcome open research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background The control of vector borne arboviral diseases such as Dengue is mainly achieved by reducing human-vector contact and controlling the vectors through source reduction and environmental management. These measures are constrained by labour intensity, insecticide resistance and pro-active community participation. The current study intended to develop and test an ivermectin-based attractive-targeted sugar bait (ATSB) against Aedes aegypti. Methods The 48hour lethal concentration (LC90) of ivermectin against Ae. aegypti was determined through serial dilution experiment where five 30cm x 30cm x 30cm cages were set; into each, a 10% sugar solution treated with ivermectin were introduced. 40 Ae. aegypti were released into each cage and observed for mortality after 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours. The ivermectin-based ATSB was evaluated in a semi field system where ATSB and attractive sugar bait (ASB) were deployed into each compartment of the semi field and 100 female Ae. aegypti were released every day and recaptured the next day through human land catch and Bio-gent sentinel trap. The developed and semi-field tested ATSB was further tested in the field by deploying them in garages. Results The ivermectin 48hr LC90 of male and female Ae. aegypti was found to be 0.03% w/v. In the semi field system, the ATSB significantly reduced a free-flying population of Ae. aegypti within 24 hours (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.62; [95% confidence interval (95%CI); 0.54-0.70] and p-value < 0.001). However, in the field, the ATSBs required the addition of yeast as a carbon dioxide source to efficiently attract Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to feed. Conclusion Ivermectin is an active ingredient that can be used in an ATSB for Ae. aegypti depopulation. However, further research is needed to improve the developed and tested ATSB to compete with natural sources of sugar in a natural environment.

AB  - Spectral simulation technology is used to simulate new spectral bands from available observed bands. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of a spectral simulation using traditional four-band (i.e., blue, green, red and near-infrared) multispectral satellite images to new spectral bands such as the coastal and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands. In the proposed scheme, nonlinear support vector regression (SVR) is performed to simulate different reflectances from the spectral libraries, and the accuracy of spectral simulation is discussed. Two different spectral libraries (i.e., ECOSTRESS and USGS splib07a) are used to establish the SVR model. The experimental results indicate that the spectral library can be used to simulate the reflectances of satellite images, and the performance of ECOSTRESS is marginally superior to that of USGS in the spectral simulation between Formosat-2 (FS-2) multispectral images and Landsat-8 (LS-8) coastal and SWIR band images.

AB  - Automatic detection of objects from Earth Observation images is still a challenge for researchers. This paper aims at extracting automatically windmills on mid-resolution images (10-meter resolution), based on Sentinel satellite products. Sentinel-2 optical images are obvious candidates for our study. At 10-meter resolution, a windmill is represented with only a few pixels. We also start to consider Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 images but no particular windmill radar response on GRD (Ground Range Multi-look Detected) products seemed to be relevant.Considering the maturity of deep learning techniques for object detection in computer vision, we explore the use of deep neural networks for windmill detection on remote sensing images. For that purpose, we had to create the training data sets but we took advantage of the availability of many Sentinel images and of the use of automated labelling as the objects are georeferenced. The proposed approach relies on the U-Net framework, reformulating our problem of object detection in terms of semantic segmentation. We trained several neural networks on different data sets emanating from different countries. That enabled us to measure the performance of detection within a country but also across two countries (training on a country and predicting on another country). The results show the ability of detection of such small objects with respect to the resolution and we obtain various levels of performances depending on the trained and test data sets.

T2  - Uttar Pradesh Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is widespread in most developing countries while the nearby farmland area coverage is shrinking which in turn attracting the attention of many actors to manage the encroachment scientifically. This study aims to analyze the urban land use and land cover change in Hossana town using geospatial techniques. Three Landsat images were used and analyzed using ArcMap 10.5. The images were classified and reclassified into six land use classes. The result showed visible land cover change and a high rate of town expansion in the study area. The forest area surrounding the town and bareland decreased from 5702 (48.8 %) to 1515 ha (12.97 %) and from 2224.3 ha (19.1%) to 226.2 ha (1.94 %) from 1986 to 2019 whereas farmland and built-up areas increased rapidly from 3078 ha (26.4%) to 5599.5 ha (47.95%) and from 141.1 (1.2%) to 3581.4 ha (30.67%) in the study period, respectively. Thus, the land cover change result for the built-up area has eventually expanded through the study period. In contrary, the land cover under forest, water, bareland, open area (greenery) and farmland have shown tremendous decrease within the last three decades, respectively. The expansion of farmland and settlement areas implies high population inflow to the urban area from the rural and fringe areas. Thus, the settlement pattern and land use shall be governed by well-planned policies to manage rapid population growth and migration from rural areas which causes poor land management and illegal housing. The application of geospatial techniques are mandatory tools to analyze the spatio-temporal changes in urban areas.

TI  - THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIGURE OF THE DEVIL IN THOMAS HOBBES' <i>LEVIATHAN</i>
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a shift of research focus to theological problems in the works of Thomas Hobbes: eschatology, hell, the concept of the miracle, etc. Of particular interest is the figure of the devil. It occupied an important place in medieval consciousness and defined social life. The last third of the 17th century is marked by an active discussion among intellectuals about the status of the supernatural, especially the devil and his influence on social life. One of the initiators of this discussion was the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, the developer of the idea of the modern state. The devil is examined in terms of his role in Thomas Hobbes' political philosophy in Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of the Ecclesiastical and Civil State. First, Hobbes argues that the source of demonology was the worldview of the ancient Greeks, which influenced Jewish culture. Second, Hobbes' materialistic worldview rejects any argument about the immateriality of spirits and the devil. These definitions of the devil lead us to see the devil as a danger in terms of language: an ambiguous concept that can strip language of its performative properties, endanger the stability of the political order for fear of the devil but not of the Sovereign. Therefore, the Sovereign gets a monopoly on interpreting the devil through scripture. Third, the devil, according to Hobbes, does not designate a particular person, but only "an office, or quality". In other words, it is not a proper name, but an appellative. The devil as a proper name is a consequence of a mistranslation of the Bible. Fourth, Hobbes views the devil as the "earthly enemy of the church". This definition means that the figure is undergoing complete secularization and temporalization. It is now a nominal name used to refer to enemies of the state. If the kingdom of God is an extension of the earthly kingdom and all interpretations of sacred scripture are carried out by the state, the devil is any force that attacks the church and sacred scripture, challenging the state. As a result, Hobbes secularizes Early Modern period political discourse by trying to stop all the ambiguities of the Bible by securing the power of the Sovereign. The devil turns out to be a symbol of the expression of state disobedience and of the individual who has surrendered inalienable rights to a "man-made" god.

AB  - Himachal Pradesh is a state located in the Indian Himalayan Region, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, which assures its biodiversity richness and its ecological sensitivity. Due to the rapid rate of development, this Himalayan state has recently experienced many land use changes. To better understand the dynamics of land cover, the study's main objectives are to define the key LULC classes and compute and assess the size and rate of change for these classes during a 20-year period (2000 to 2020). For the purpose of this study, we processed and classified images using the Google Earth Engine Platform. The Landsat surface reflectance data products were selected for the years 2000, 2010 and 2020. Thereafter, the median of image collections was derived to get the final image to be classified for the study area. The Random Forest classifier was used to classify the images into seven landcover classes, i.e., agriculture, forest, water, glacier, built-up, grassland, and barren. The results revealed that the total area covered by agriculture has declined over time (0.26%), while forests (1.04%) and built-up areas (0.48%) in the state have expanded from the year 2000 to 2020. The main reason for the reduction in agriculture area is decrease in agricultural activities, while afforestation and continuous infrastructural development have resulted in an increase in forest cover and built-up areas, respectively. The result of this study gives a comprehensive picture of land cover changes in the state, which could further assist policymakers in strategizing for the state's long-term socioeconomic development.

TI  - Improvement of Flood Extent Representation With Remote Sensing Data and Data Assimilation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood simulation and forecast capability have been greatly improved, thanks to the advances in data assimilation (DA). Such an approach combines in situ gauge measurements with numerical hydrodynamic models to correct the hydraulic states and reduce the uncertainties in model parameters. However, these methods depend strongly on the availability and quality of observations, thus necessitating other data sources to improve the flood simulation and forecast performances. Using Sentinel-1 images, a flood extent mapping method was carried out by applying a Random Forest algorithm trained on past flood events using manually delineated flood maps. The study area concerns a 50-km reach of the Garonne Marmandaise catchment. Two recent flood events are simulated in analysis and forecast modes, with a +24-h lead time. This study demonstrates the merits of using synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived flood extent maps to validate and improve the forecast results based on hydrodynamic numerical models with Telemac2D-ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Quantitative 1-D and 2-D metrics were computed to assess water-level time-series and flood extents between the simulations and observations. It was shown that the free run experiment without DA underestimates flooding. On the other hand, the validation of DA results with respect to independent SAR-derived flood extent allows to diagnose a model-observation bias that leads to over-flooding. Once this bias is taken into account, DA provides a sequential correction of area-based friction coefficients and inflow discharge, yielding a better flood extent representation. This study paves the way toward a reliable solution for flood forecasting over poorly gauged catchments, thanks to the available remote sensing datasets.

M3  - Observational Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Context. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children. There is no epidemiological data on rates of pediatric NAFLD in Canada. Primary care physicians (PCPs) are often the first contact healthcare professionals to manage potential pediatric patients with NAFLD. Objective: Evaluate patterns of screening and identification of pediatric NAFLD in Canadian primary care using administrative health care database. Study Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Dataset: The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), a repository of clinical electronic medical record data drawn from primary care practices across Canada. Population Studied: Children aged 9-18 years old between July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Outcome Measures: The proportion of children eligible for screening (BMI≥95th percentile) as per NASPGHAN guidelines using ALT levels. Logistic Regression was used to evaluate the predictors for screening. Suspected NAFLD was defined as elevated ALT (>22 U/L for girls and > 26 U/L for boys) in the absence of viral hepatitis, metabolic conditions, alcohol use, hepatotoxic medications. Results: The study sample consisted of 66,872 children, of which 15.8% (n=10,539) had a BMI≥95th percentile and only 10.1% (n=1,067/10539) were screened in the last year using ALT. Children were more likely to get screened if they were a) older (13-18 year vs 9-12 year, OR=1.63, 95% CI 1.38-1.93); b) living in an urban setting (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.0-1.63); and c) had a higher BMI (≥99th percentile vs 95th-98th, OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.14, 1.56). We identified 855 cases of suspected NAFLD, most children (78.5%) were older (13-18 years), male (55.0%), and lived in an urban setting (71.5%). A significant proportion (40.4%) had a BMI in the 99th percentile and 60.3% had at least one comorbidity, and 35.9% were prescribed a psychotropic, antidiabetic or antihypertensive medications. Only 19.9% were referred to a specialist (pediatrician, gastroenterologist). Conclusions: This is the first study to estimate the screening patterns of pediatric NAFLD in primary care in Canada at a national level. The study revealed low screening rates in primary care, these results will help facilitate prioritization of care and future work that could evaluate successful implementation strategies while emphasizing the role of PCPs in screening and managing pediatric NAFLD in Canadian health care setting.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Heat island effect is usually present in urban areas that experience higher temperatures than rural areas. Materials used for buildings, roads and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the sun's heat more than green areas and water bodies. This effect results in discomfort to the residents of the affected areas and negatively impacts ecological and energetic variables. The most common way of detecting and analyzing Heat Island Effect using remote sensing is based on the use of evening and night surface satellite images.In this study, the Land-surface temperature (LST) products of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite were used to provide surface temperature from night images and produce heat maps of the urban area of Limassol, Cyprus. The affected areas were examined based on their dependence on green space, building density and population density. The study examined time-series data for the summer period, which is the hottest month of the year in Cyprus. Such information is vital to assist decision and policymakers to adopt effective mitigation strategies and improve urban planning.

AB  - Quy Nhon city is a grade 1 city situated in Binh Dinh province, in Viet Nam. Its populationwas 481.110 inhabitants and it had an urbanization rate of 60% in 2019, while Quy nhon population numbered just 260.000 in 2017. In order to evaluate the relationship between urban heat island and land cover, we used Landsat satellite imagery from 1990 to 2020 to classify the land cover by using the Support Vector Machine learning method (SVM). The classified results were evaluated with the test samples from the field survey. The accuracy is above 77%, which is reliable enough for use in research. To create the surface temperature layer, we used band 6 in the Landsat 5 ETM remote sensing imagery and bands 10, 11 in the Landsat 8 imagery. The results were calculated the surface temperature for the study area. The study carried out statistics of surface temperature value with land cover. The results show that Quy Nhon city has become warmer since 2005, which witnessed a significant increase, compared with roughly 4 degrees in 1996 and around 9 degrees in 1990. And the temperature in the urban land area is between 30 and 35 degrees. During this period, the classification results show that urban land has rapidly expanded. Especially from 2005 up to now, Quy Nhon city has witnessed a strong urban expansion, agricultural land, and water surface have been changed into urban land. To determine the area of urban heat islands we used the urban heat index (UHI). The results show that the heat island phenomenon increases with urbanization in the city and tends to increase over the years. This research result is a practical basis to propose suitable spatial and landscape planning solutions for the city, towards green and sustainable urban development.

TI  - A Purely Spaceborne Open Source Approach for Regional Bathymetry Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and up-to-date bathymetry maps over large geographical areas have been difficult to create, due to the cost and difficulty of collecting in situ calibration and validation data. Recently, combinations of spaceborne Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) lidar data and Landsat/sentinel-2 data have reduced these obstacles. However, to date, there have been no means of automatically extracting bathymetry photons from ICESat-2 tracks for model calibration/validation and no well-established open source workflows for generating regional scale bathymetric models. Here we provide an open source approach for generating bathymetry maps for the shallow water region around the island of Andros, Bahamas. We demonstrate an efficient means of processing 224 ICESat-2 tracks and 221 Landsat-8 scenes, using the classification of subaquatic height extracted photons (C-SHELPh) algorithm and Extra Trees Regression to provide 30 m pixel estimates of per-pixel depth and standard error. We map bathymetry with an RMSE of 0.32 m and RMSE% of 6.7%. Our workflow and results demonstrate a means of achieving accurate regional-scale bathymetry maps from purely spaceborne data.

AB  - GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite mission is further expanding the very high resolution 3D mapping application. Carrying the first civilian Chinese sub-meter resolution stereo satellite sensors, GF-7 satellite was launched on November 7, 2019. With 0.65 meter resolution on backward view and 0.8 meter resolution forward view, GF-7 has been designed to meet the demand of natural resource monitoring, land surveying, and other mapping applications in China. The use of GF-7 for 3D city reconstruction is unfortunately restricted by the fixed large stereo view angle of forward and backward cameras with +26 and -5 degrees respectively which is not optimal for dense stereo matching in urban regions. In this paper we intensively evaluate the quality of the GF-7 datasets by performing a series of urban monitoring applications, including road detection, building extraction and 3D reconstruction. In addition, we propose a 3D reconstruction workflow which uses the land cover classification result to refine the stereo matching result. Six sub-urban regions are selected from the available datasets in the middle of Germany. The results show that basic elements in urban scenes like buildings and roads could be detected from GF-7 datasets with high accuracy. With the proposed workflow, a 3D city model with a visually observed good quality can be delivered.

TI  - Estimation of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Synthetic Satellite Microwave Temperature Anomaly Structure and a Multifeature Distribution Learning Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate intensity estimation of tropical cyclone (TC) is important and challenging. Currently, no standardized method is available for estimating the TC intensity, usually in terms of the maximum surface wind speed, using satellite remote sensing data. This article proposes a multifeature distribution learning (MFDL) model that uses satellite microwave brightness temperatures to estimate the TC intensity. The MFDL model uses the brightness temperatures of Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) to generate the synthetic temperature anomaly fields of TCs at different pressure levels. These 3-D temperature anomaly data are trained by MFDL to establish the relationship between anomaly fields and TC intensity. MFDL treats the TC intensity estimation as a probability distribution of wind speed, instead of as a regression problem as in the conventional TC intensity estimation methods. In this study, 964 TCs occurred in North Atlantic (NA) and North Pacific (NP) from 2012 to 2019 are used for training and testing. The simulation results suggest that estimation accuracy is greatly improved using the preprocessed 3-D TC anomaly data. The MFDL network achieves the average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 4.37 m/s for NA TCs and 4.92 m/s for NP TCs in the years 2018 and 2019. The results show that the MFDL network and ATMS temperature-based anomaly can be a promising means for TC intensity estimation in operational weather forecast.

TI  - Retrieval of Atmospheric Aerosol Optical Depth From AVHRR Over Land With Global Coverage Using Machine Learning Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols play an important role in global climate change, which requires long-term data records. Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) provides continuous observations for up to 40 years since 1979, which makes it worthwhile to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) from AVHRR over land. A novel algorithm for retrieving AOD from AVHRR is developed based on the machine learning (ML) method. The AVHRR observations from pathfinder atmospheres-extended (PATMOS-x) Level-2 dataset and corresponding AOD products (0.55 mu m) from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in 2014 are used as training data. And AOD products in three years (2015, 2006, and 1998) named AVHRR XGB-AOD were generated for evaluation. Comparisons show that the AVHRR XGB-AOD is consistent with the MODIS AOD with correlation coefficients greater than 0.80 and RMSE less than 0.18 for most months in 2015 and 2006. The temporal and spatial characteristics from AVHRR XGB-AOD are similar to those from the MODIS AOD, but those from the previous AVHRR AOD with deep blue (DB) algorithm are significantly different. Validation with AERONET indicates that more than 68% of the matchups fall within expected error [EE, +/-(0.05 +/- 0.25 x AODAERONET)] in 2015 and 2006, while the fraction is 66% in 1998. Compared to the DB algorithm, the ML-based algorithm performs better in high-AOD conditions over vegetated regions, such as in Southeast Asia, where the DB algorithm significantly underestimates. In low-AOD conditions, the ML-based algorithm performs better over western North America and Australia, where the aerosol composition varies greatly.

TI  - Variational Pansharpening by Exploiting Cartoon-Texture Similarities
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening aims to fuse a multispectral (MS) image with low spatial resolution and a panchromatic (PAN) image with a high-spatial resolution to produce an image with both high spectral and high spatial resolution. In this study, we propose a variational pansharpening method by exploiting cartoon-texture similarities. After decomposition of the PAN image, the cartoon component always contains the global structure information, while the texture component includes the locally patterned information. This enables that the fused high-spatial resolution MS image can preserve the global and local spatial details (e.g., high-order information) well after leveraging the similarities of cartoon and texture components from PAN and MS images. To explore such cartoon-texture similarities, we describe cartoon similarity as gradient sparsity, formulated as a reweighted total variation term. Meanwhile, we use group low-rank constraint for texture similarity that is presented as repetitive texture patterns. By incorporating a data fidelity term for preserving the spectral information on the basis that the down-sampled fused MS image is consistent with the MS image, we further formulate pansharpening as an optimization problem and solve it efficiently using the alternative direction multiplier method. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a series of satellite data sets, and we also carry out a simulated vegetation coverage change experiment to verify the efficiency of the proposed method in remote sensing. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods in terms of both visual effect and objective metrics.

AB  - This study proposes a new method of cloud detection-the Fusion Network Cloud Detection Method (FNCDM). It can capture fine-grained details of foreground objects and highlight hierarchical features more effectively than U-Net, SegNet, and UNet++. To identify new classes of cloud pixels, the FNCDM method employs the hard voting strategy to reclassify pixels from the prediction results of three different network models. The result shows that the FNCDM is able to identify clouds on different underlying surfaces with a high degree of accuracy, and the overall accuracy can reach 96%. The method has higher recognition accuracy for thin clouds, broken clouds and cloud boundaries, and the false rate and miss rate are below 2.11% and 9.43%, respectively.

TI  - Innovative Method of Combing Multidecade Remote Sensing Data for Detecting Precollapse Elevation Changes of Glaciers in the Larsen B Region, Antarctica
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula has undergone dramatic changes in recent decades, including ice-shelf melting, disintegration, and retreat of the grounding line. The Larsen B ice shelf is of particular concern due to the unprecedented ice-shelf collapse in 2002. Since few observations on the Antarctic Peninsula were available before the 1970s, long-term investigation of the surface elevation change in the Larsen B region could not be pursued. In 1995, the United States administration declassified a collection of archived intelligence satellite photographs from the 1960s to the 1970s, including analogue satellite images from the ARGON program covering parts of the Larsen B region. We chose overlapping ARGON photos captured in the Larsen B region in 1963. These photos were all subjected to a tailored photogrammetric stereo-matching process, which overcomes those specific challenges related to the use of historical satellite images, such as poor image quality, low resolution, and a lack of high-precision validation data. We discovered that between 1963 and 2001, the surface elevations of the main tributary glaciers in the Larsen B embayment have undergone little change before the ice shelf collapse from 1963 to 2001 by comparing the reconstructed ARGON-derived digital elevation model (DEM) (1963) and ASTER-derived DEM (2001). In addition, the results demonstrated that the hierarchical image matching method can be modified and applied to reconstruct a historical Antarctic DEM using satellite images acquired & SIM;60 years ago through an innovative and rigorous ground control point selection procedure that guarantees no changes occurred at these points over the period. The new ARGON-derived DEM derived from ARGON (1963) can be used to build a long-term spatiotemporal record of observations for extended analyses of ice-surface dynamics and mass balance in the Larsen B region.

AB  - The Yongding New River flows into the Bohai Bay, which is an important area in the construction of Circum-Bohai Sea Economic Zone. The migration law and influencing factors of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) are the core issues of the estuary research. Remote sensing inversion can realize the dynamic, continuous and synchronous observation of a large area of water and quickly obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of suspended sediment. In this study, Sentinel-2 MSI data from 2017 to 2021 were used to invert SSC in the study area. Based on these data, spatio-temporal changes of the SSC in different seasons and their induced factors were analyzed. The results show that the SSC in the study area has obvious temporal and spatial distribution rules,which is higher in spring and summer, and lower in autumn and winter. The SSC gradually increases from the river to the sea, while perpendicular to the river, the SSC gradually decreases from south to north. The difference of temporal and spatial distribution of SSC may be mainly caused by river freshwater, wind speed and direction, terrain and human activities.

AB  - Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) is one of the most important payloads on the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellite, and it can realize simultaneous detection of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. At present, the measurement data from MWHTS is not yet assimilated in the Arctic region. It is helpful to improve the initial field of the assimilation system by evaluating the accuracy of MWHTS atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles retrieval parameters in the Arctic region. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles retrieval to evaluate the accuracy of MWHTS atmospheric parameters. The results show that the RMSE of temperature profile is less than 2K, and the RMSE of humidity profile is between 10-20%. And the retrieval accuracy of LSTM is slightly better than that of DNN.

T2  - AUSART
M3  - Article
AB  - William Blake's city of art and imagination, Golgonooza, is the origin of research that aims to understand his complex cosmogony. For contemporary artists it will also be a reference for replicating the visual imaginary of the English poet and engraver. In this sense, the article focuses on the analysis of Andrea McLean and Henry Eliot's artistic map as a vehicle for reconstructing the prototype of the celestial city. To achieve this, the authors trace Golgonooza's abstract ideas of London topography by using and distributing symbolic elements that, in turn, represent imaginary locations. Finally, we come to the conclusion that, in contrast to the supposed objectivity that topographers try to determine, artistic cartography is a useful way to come closer to understanding the mythical universe of William Blake and his archetypal city.

TI  - Consistency between Satellite Ocean Colour Products under High Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter Absorption in the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean colour (OC) remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring phytoplankton in the global ocean. In optically complex waters such as the Baltic Sea, relatively efficient light absorption by substances other than phytoplankton increases product uncertainty. Sentinel-3 OLCI-A, Suomi-NPP VIIRS and MODIS-Aqua OC radiometric products were assessed using Baltic Sea in situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from ferry tracks (Alg@line) and at two Aerosol Robotic Network for Ocean Colour (AERONET-OC) sites from April 2016 to September 2018. A range of atmospheric correction (AC) processors for OLCI-A were evaluated. POLYMER performed best with < 23 relative % difference at 443, 490 and 560 nm compared to in situ R(rs )and 28% at 665 nm, suggesting that using this AC for deriving Chl a will be the most accurate. Suomi-VIIRS and MODIS-Aqua underestimated Rrs by 35, 29, 22 and 39% and 34, 22, 17 and 33% at 442, 486, 560 and 671 nm, respectively. The consistency between different AC processors for OLCI-A and MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS products was relatively poor. Applying the POLYMER AC to OLCI-A, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS may produce the most accurate R-rs and Chl a products and OC time series for the Baltic Sea.

AB  - The paper reconstructs the influence of the semiotic studies of Yu. Lotman on the formation of the problems and the research apparatus of modern ("post-classical") multimedia narratology, associated with the names of J. Genette, P. Ricoeur, W. Schmid and others. In particular, the author discusses the emergence of scientific interest in the film narrative, which has also had a significant impact on literary narratology, enriching it with the constructive concept of the "narrative image". The article focuses on Lotman's storytelling research, especially the concept of "plot-driven texts" of culture in their opposition to "plotless texts". Particular importance is attached to the distinction between plot and myth, which continued O. M. Freidenberg's investigations into the origin of narration. Lotman's pioneering role in mastering the scientific categories of "narrative worldview" and "narrative event" is described. The author reveals the place of Lotman's research heritage in the comprehension of narrative practices as a tool for mental appropriation of life, accumulation and retranslation of event experience, as well as in the birth and development of the modern project of historical narratology.

AB  - In recent years, remote sensing has had a prominent place in mineral exploration programs given its potential to identify alteration minerals, such as clay and hydroxyl minerals. Those minerals represent significant guides to mineral deposits considering their potential to host valuable concentrations of base metal elements. This work focuses on Fe-Mn-Pb mineral deposits within the Jbel Skindis area as a case study to illustrate the application of remote sensing images and GIS systems to highlight prospective zones and to extract information on ore -controlling factors using image enhancement and integration methods. Field observations and XRD data showed that the main remotely sensed alteration anomalies are characterized by oxides and hydroxides. Based on those indicative minerals, a mapping using Aster L1T and Landsat 8 OLI data was done: the 5/4 ratio highlighted gossans zones and the RGB combination (4/6, 2/1, 3/2) accentuates the hydrothermally altered areas. The lineament map extracted from Sentinel 2A and Landsat imagery allowed the reconstitution of the megafracture network that affected the region. The multi-criteria analysis of these satellite-derived data along with available geological data outcomes to delineate prospective zones in the study area, were found to be in highly fractured areas developing gossans and Fe rich alteration. Verified via field survey, this approach was successfully applied to the Jbel Skindis area to rapidly delineate oxidized ore outcrops. This provides a remote sensing model for future prospecting efforts for similar mineral deposits both in the Eastern High-Atlas province and in other similar areas.

TI  - COMPARATIVE OF TWO SCHEHERAZADE FROM ARAB THEATER
T2  - BILIMNAME
M3  - Article
AB  - One Thousand and One Nights is a collection of fairy tales composed of a frame narrative and its surrounding tales. With their translation into Western languages, these tales, which represent Eastern literature in terms of their origin, became recognized in the West and occupied a prominent place in world literature. These tales have influenced and inspired numerous authors from both the East and West. It can be observed that a variety of literary works have directly or indirectly been nourished from this collection. Two famous and prolific Modern Arabic Literature authors, Tawfiq al-Hakim and Ali Ahmed Bakathir, also composed a play inspired by these tales. In this study, general information on the original One Thousand and One Nights was presented first, followed by a literary analysis of the aforementioned theater works by al-Hakim and Bakathir. Here, the original frame tale of One Thousand and One Nights is compared with the authors' works through analyzing the events and characters. In addition, the character of Scheherazade from both authors was compared under a separate title. al-Hakim wrote his work called Scheherazade, one of his over seventy theatrical works, in 1934. This work comprises of seven scenes and is one of the author's earliest writing endeavors. The conflict that began in the first scene continues until the fifth scene, and the sixth and seventh scenes unravel the event knot. In his work, he dramatized the events that took place after the one thousand and first night. According to the text, King Shahriar had a profound intellectual and spiritual transformation after hearing Scheherazade's stories. Once a ruthless, tyrannical, and bloodthirsty king, he had now become an entirely different person. He is constantly in thought. By eliminating matter, he hopes to discover the secrets of the cosmos and its knowledge. He seeks to discover the truth. Hence, he plans to travel and get away from the palace. Both his vizier and his wife attempt to discourage him from these insane ideas, but to no avail. This king, who had experienced all kinds of material pleasures in the past, now pursues knowledge and desires to transcend the limits of space. Scheherazade is responsible for his drastic transformation. Ali Ahmed Bakathir, who has approximately seventy works in poetry, theater, novel, and short story, holds an important place in the history of Arab theater with his theatrical works. He is the individual who produced the most works in this field after Tewfiq al-Hakim, and his plays emphasize national and religious sentiments as well as the spirit of unity and independence. The majority of his plays have been adapted for the screen. "Sirru 5ehrazad" is one of the author's over forty theatrical works. Before composing this piece, the author considers writing a play about the problem of women and their status in relation to men. He searches for a story from One Thousand and One Nights that he may reinterpret in accordance with his thinking. He concludes that it is appropriate to select the book's frame tale, which provides the reason for the other stories to be told, as the subject. In the central plot of One Thousand and One Nights, Bakathir senses an atmosphere in which the woman is guilty and the male, Shahriar, is in a sense innocent. After evaluating the story's events and characters, he confronted multiple scenarios that did not make sense to him, and he was unable to find independent answers to the concerns that persisted in his mind, particularly with Shahriar.Consequently, he decided to create his own story and composed the work of Sirru 5ehrazad. When al-Hakim's Scheherazade is compared with Bakathir's Scheherazade, it is evident that they have both similar and distinct aspects. Scheherazade's beauty, intelligence, shrewdness, patience, and tenacity are characteristics shared by both works. These features are also consistent with the character of Scheherazade in the main narrative. The stories he told transformed a king who had always been portrayed as ruthless. Thus, through the character of Scheherazade, both works emphasize the triumph of wisdom over force, humility over violence, and patience over impulsiveness. The message conveyed is that a woman has the ability to alter a man's-even if the subject is a king-feelings and thoughts, his worldview, and most importantly, his character, when she so desires. Comparing the two works, al-Hakim's Scheherazade produced a considerably more profound transformation in the king, and by the end, Shahriar had become an intellectually and spiritually different individual. Another common aspect in the two works is that both al-Hakim and Bakathir's Scheherazade re-enact the scene where the king murdered his first wife after a thousand and one nights, using a plan they devised to help him confront his past. When analyzing the character of Scheherazade in both texts, the most notable distinction is the depiction of Scheherazade as a woman by each author. al-Hakim's Scheherazade is not only portrayed as very beautiful and intelligent, but also mysterious in every way, sometimes sarcastic, implicit in every word that comes out of her mouth, deceptive, whose main purpose and thoughts are not fully understood by the intended audience in her actions and plans, and who gives the vizier hope. Therefore, both the first wife of the king and Scheherazade are portrayed in al-Hakim as a negative woman type with immoral tendencies. Contrary to the core plot, it is difficult to explain why al-Hakim attributes Scheherazade with the image of a terrible lady. In truth, the author of this and other works has been accused of having a negative attitude toward women. Regarding Bakathir's Scheherazade, it is evident that the author approaches the theme of women with sensitivity. Prior to Bakathir's composition of Scheherazade, there were arguments in the Arab world about the social role of women. Through this literary work, the author revealed his personal views on women to the reader and the literary world. According to the story he fictionalized in this theatrical production, Shahriar is a cheerful individual who enjoys spending time with the palace's concubines. This circumstance displeases his wife, who loves him deeply. So, she devises a plan to catch her husband's attention. Things go awry, and Shahriar murders him by fabricating the narrative that his wife betrayed him. This sick king is then healed by Scheherazade with the help of stories. As can be observed, the author has devised a modern interpretation and presented the reader with a new draft that exonerates her rather than the fiction based on the woman's infidelity in the central plot of One Thousand and One Nights.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article the authors reveals the peculiarities of human understanding and vision for the future of mankind in the ideology of globalism took shape and gained considerable influence on the minds of the people in the second half of the 20th century - early 21st century. Platforms and specialized institutes are organized to develop ideas and mechanisms for their implementation by transnational business elites and representatives of other social groups adjacent to them. Their worldview, formed in the context of a society of alienation, inevitably becomes part of the ideology. Turning to the analysis of the ideology of globalism from the point of view of the relationship to human and the humanity seems promising for an adequate understanding of the essence of globalism and its role in the formation of modern public consciousness, as well as the contours of the future society. Considering globalism as a sociocultural phenomenon, the authors identify the foundations for the formation of the globalist worldview and its ideological sources that lie in the liberal intellectual tradition. The key intellectual moves in the rhetoric of globalists are an appeal to economism, humanism, and the need to correct the world order in the spirit of liberal values. The authors of the article identify key milestones in the formation of the globalist worldview associated with socio-cultural transformations and changes in the configuration of the world socio-political structure, which are reflected in ideological constructions and scientific research. In the course of understanding texts and programs written in the spirit of globalism, the analysis of ideologies and terms, the system of arguments familiar to globalists, is carried out through the prism of understanding the role and place assigned by them to a human.

AB  - Mt. Etna is one of the world's most active volcanoes and its activity is characterized both by explosive eruptive episodes and by effusive activity. On 24 December 2018 a new lateral eruption of Etna began. The phenomenon was caused by the intrusion of a magmatic dike in the upper eastern flank of the volcano which produced an intense seismic swarm and strong gaseous emissions from the summit craters. In this work Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission were elaborated adopting the Small Baseline Subset technique (SBAS). This multi-temporal method of SAR Interferometry (InSAR) allowed us to obtain the ground displacement map of the area and the deformation evolution of some eruption-induced phenomena, i.e., we tracked the lava flows originated from the opening of eruptive fissures in the western flank of the Valle del Bove depression, and we monitored a paleo-landslide located about 5 kilometers West from the Paterno village, which reactivated during the volcanic unrest.

TI  - Learning a Joint Embedding of Multiple Satellite Sensors: A Case Study for Lake Ice Monitoring
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusing satellite imagery acquired with different sensors has been a long-standing challenge of Earth observation, particularly across different modalities such as optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Here, we explore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of representation learning: we propose to learn a joint embedding of multiple satellite sensors within a deep neural network. Our application problem is the monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the temporal resolution requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) office, we combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Suomi-NPP visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS). The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains and between the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the sensor fusion problem. Our approach can be classified as a late fusion that is learned in a data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has separate encoding branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single latent embedding, i.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs, such that subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of which sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice at a temporal resolution of <1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit lake ice maps with pixelwise accuracies >91% [respectively, mean per-class Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores >60%] and generalizes well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it sets a new state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off dates for the target lakes, in many cases meeting the GCOS requirement.

TI  - The Sixth Corridor: The Contextualization of the TV Series Cosmos "A Spacetime Odyssey"
T2  - ETNOANTROPOLOSKI PROBLEMI-ISSUES IN ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper provides a framework for understanding the role of popular science in the sphere of the culture war currently being waged in the USA, and also in other places in the West. It focuses on the instrumentalization of the TV series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey and a reading of the cultural political messages woven into this narrative. It first describes the development of popular science as a means of establishing a modernist worldview which, through popular literature, but above all through TV series, has become an integral part of the upbringing of numerous generations in the West. It points out a number of useful, but also deeply problematic aspects of using popular science in education, and underlines its inherent ambivalences. Particular attention has been paid to the mechanism by which popular science takes on the character of an instrument bringing audiences closer to relevant knowledge akin to truth. In this context the concepts of media, television, genre and formula are described, as means by which popular science is established as the vehicle for a very specific worldview. In this way, the deconstruction of the narrative pattern of the Cosmos series, created by Ann Druyan, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth MacFarlane, has been prepared. The key conventions of the series are highlighted, e.g. the specific way of presenting facts, the significant use of special effects, or the presence of speculations about the future, and the inventions of narratives such as the Ship of the Imagination, the Cosmic Calendar or the Halls of Extinction. All this has been done in order to show the utility value of popular science narratives in the context of the culture war that has been waged in the US for decades by, roughly speaking, proponents of liberal humanism versus conservative fundamentalists. Particular attention has been paid to defining the concepts of cultural war and hegemony, as key to understanding long-standing tensions and conflicts between creationists and humanists in the US. The paper shows how the authors and producers of the series consciously engaged in criticism of the creationist refusal to accept a series of facts relating to the process of global warming. At the same time, it looks at criticism of the series from the creationist perspective. An analysis of the culture war shows that scientific topics have been instrumentalized and suggests their profound value for every sociocultural context. The paper looks at the reading of political messages into a popular science narrative, and highlights the importance and value, but also the danger of such acts. The concluding section stresses the fact that the series Cosmos supports a certain way of thinking about the world around us, and emphasizes its utility value in promoting a specific liberal progressivist worldview.

TI  - ENGLISH OCCULT DISCOURSE AS A CULTURAL PHENOMENON
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper reveals structural and functional peculiarities of English occult discourse as a cultural phenomenon. The research is based on the material of English explanatory and etymological dictionaries and texts manifesting occult discourse on the Internet. The paper uses a comprehensive methodology involving general scientific and special linguistic methods. The paper identifies the institutional forms and types of English occult discourse and outlines ways to study them. The term "occult discourse" denotes the general direction of discourse, which studies the peculiarities of communication in all institutional activity areas beyond science and official religion. Based on the results of etymological and componential analyses, we conclude that occult discourse contains such primary genre varieties as astrological, magical, and alchemical. Regarding socio-cultural features, we note that the function of these types of discourse stem from the symbolic and social meanings that are added to the relevant practices. Thus, the acquisition of occult sciences is part of the general system of thinking and beliefs in a particular society, allowing us to study the relevant fragment of the English worldview in mythological and naive versions.

TI  - An Improved Method for Estimating Clumping Index by Digital Hemispheric Photography With Field Measurements
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clumping index (CI) field measurements based on the logarithmic gap fraction averaging (LX) method are widely used. However, some challenges regarding this method have been recognized; e.g., CI overestimation or underestimation occurs in the sampling units where there is no measurement gap, which creates major uncertainties in CI field measurements. To address this issue, we proposed an improved eight-connected LX method that replaces null gap units with the arithmetic mean of the gaps in the eight connected neighboring units, considering the neighboring connections of the natural foliage extension. To validate this method, we designed two controlled experimental schemes based on simulated digital hemispheric photography (DHP) images through the LargE-Scale Remote Sensing Data and Image Simulation Framework (LESS) model considering the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (LAD), respectively, together with collected field measurements. The results showed that our method could almost prevent overestimation and improve underestimated CIs by nearly 20%. In addition, CIs of our method had the smallest error compared to the "true" CIs (error < 0.1). In conclusion, our method can significantly improve the data quality of the simulation results relative to the existing methods and present potentials in the CI measurements of upcoming field campaigns.

CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Sentinel-5P (S5P) data provide information on atmospheric pollutants daily, and, for higher latitudes, consequent orbits partially overlap the same day. Provided clear atmospheric conditions, these data can provide insights on emission hotspots and on spatial distribution of critical air quality issues. The purpose of this work is to analyse several aspects of NO2 data from S5P over the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, in particular: (i) yearly average values between S5P data and 624 ground measurement stations were tested for correlation; (ii) 387 pairs of images from overlapping orbits on the same day were used to test for correlation on consecutive images with four different methods - simple linear regression over all valid cell values across the two images, over a subset with a low cloud fraction, and linear and tree-based methods using multiple predictors; (iii) local maxima values extracted from yearly NO2 emission maps were analysed to check potential hotspots of NO2 emissions.Results show that ground measurements correlate with S5P values, with r-squared values of 0.37 and 0.43 and RMSE of 7.4 and 8.6 mu mol/m(2) respectively for 2019 and 2020. Simple linear regression of overlapping consequent images returned average and standard deviation (sd) on r-squared respectively of 0.50(sd=0.21) and for RMSE of 11.3(sd=4.2) mu mol/m(2). Points from local maxima clearly detected 19 specific positions in large cities or nearby industrial areas, mostly in the north of Italy, with average NO2 values above 90 mu mol/m(2) in some cases consistently over the three years, proving that S5P imagery is a valid index for spatial distribution of NO2 concentration and air quality.

AB  - The pressure of human activities is particularly relevant on fluvial ecosystems, where activity such hydroelectric energy production can change natural dynamics. For this reason it is important to monitor, with a systematic approach, river geomorphic units distribution and their evolution over time. In particular this work consists of an application of different AI techniques to process Sentinel-2 optical data to acquire a multitemporal classification of fluvial geomorphic units (Channels, Pools, Bars, Island, Vegetation) on a study area of the river Isonzo in Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy). Results showed that all the AI methods tested allow to perform accurate classification, with best results obtained by Random Forest, that reach an overall accuracy of 0.986, and the most confusion between Bars and Island classes with F-measure of 0.931 and 0.961 respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to examine a different effort to understand the other in the Middle Ages, a period when political, social, cultural and religious conflicts were experienced both between different religions and especially within the great religions. This effort was put forward by Nicholas of Cusa, one of the important names of the early Renaissance. Cusa, who was influential both with her important duties within the papacy and with her academic studies during her lifetime, came to the fore as a humanist, reformist and reconciliation figure. This aspect of Cusa has been the subject of different studies in its theological and historical contexts. In this study, it will be evaluated in terms of its philosophical background. The main thesis of this study is that there is an intellectual accumulation behind the unifying attitude that emerged in Cusa's worldview. This accumulation takes its philosophical basis from Plato's philosophy and its dialectical method.

TI  - Building of the Neo-Calvinist Worldview Against Modernism, Abraham Kuyper's Modal of Sphere Sovereignty
T2  - HITIT THEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of religion in societies is an ongoing debate even for most of the Western countries, which have advanced in terms of modernity. Particularly, the studies show that the impact of Christianity moved from the public sphere to the private domain due to the Modernist worldview that evolved in the context of Reformation and French Revolution. At the end of the 19th century, religious groups have arised out of questioning the division between the individual and public spheres of religion in Europe. One of the foremost of these movements is the Neo-Calvinist tradition shaped by Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920). This study is to deal with the main intellectual resources of the Neo-Calvinist tradition, which Kuyper developed by reinterpreting Calvinism in the context of "worldview" and to explain its effects on Western societies.By opposing modern secular society, Kuyper tried to develop a social system that is pluralistic in religion. Calvinism, in contrast to the guiding principles of contemporary secular culture, has the qualities to permeate society as a whole, according to Kuyper, who builds a theological foundation for the entire truth. Kuyper developed a worldview based on the Christian belief systems through antitheses after critically reconsidering the underlying principles of modernity. In contrast, he asserts, there is a widespread perception in America that Calvinism is the most effective safeguard against the loss of liberties, but the idea that people's beliefs must be abandoned for freedom predominates in Europe.Kuyper developed a worldview based on Christian belief principles through antitheses by critically revising the fundamental ideas of modernism. He described the period he lived in as a crisis period and did not hold back while expressing the problematic aspects of Christianity. He contended that the church must acknowledge the reality of contemporary culture, have a theology that is relevant to the society in which it lives, and acknowledge its own cultural captivity, which it ignores. Kuyper viewed the conflict between the sacred and the secular as a war between good and evil in his mind, which is why he prefers military imagery when explaining the role of the church and compares the church to the army when discussing it in his works.According to Kuyper, who supports the understanding of cultural diversity and pluralism, the paradigm of "Sphere Sovereignty" also displays a variety of worldviews. Everyone has a worldview that affects how they live, and he claims that institutional manifestations of people's worldviews, such as Islamic schools and Jewish butchers, should exist in the open.After many years as a member of parliament, served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905. Through his "Sphere Sovereignty" model, he attempted to reshape the relationship between religion and politics as well as the role of religion in society. In a society where Modernism, which rejects religious values, is dominant, he battled for religious life and opposed the "neutral worldview" principles that Modernism developed. It is possible to say that with his studies and the practices he followed, he ignited the fuse of today's cultural conflicts and debates in Western societies.The purpose of this research is to examine how Neo-Calvinism came to be a comprehensive belief system within the framework of Abraham Kuyper's reinterpretation, and to clarify the core principles of the Neo-Calvinist worldview for social and religious life.It is also to explain the theological foundations of the long-standing struggle between modernism and Christian worldviews, and thus to increase the level of consciousness and awareness about the role of the Protestant Neo-Calvinist worldview in international politics in the new world order shaped by the USA. Therefore, we searched the literature on national and international sources using the descriptive method of the History of Religions. By doing so, the article will provide the theoretical framework of Neo-Calvinism, which shaped the state, religion, science, philosophy, education, politics, and social life. It also will demonstrate how significant the achievements in the struggle against secular, modern, and positivist living based on the Neo-Calvinist worldview have become in current Western society.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of Sentinel-2 Derived Vegetation Indices to Retrieve Phenological Stages of Mango in Ghana
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2020, mango (Mangifera indica) exports contributed over 40 million tons, worth around US$20 billion, to the global economy. Only 10% of this contribution was made from African countries including Ghana, largely due to lower investment in the sector and general paucity of research into the mango value chain, especially production, quality and volume. Considering the global economic importance of mango coupled with the gap in the use of the remote sensing technology in the sector, this study tested the hypothesis that phenological stages of mango can be retrieved from Sentinel-2 (S2) derived time series vegetation indices (VIs) data. The study was conducted on four mango farms in the Yilo Krobo Municipal Area of Ghana. Seasonal (temporal) growth curves using four VIs (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI and SAVI) for the period from 2017 to 2020 were derived for each of the selected orchards and then aligned with five known phenology stages: Flowering/Fruitset (F/FS), Fruit Development (FRD), Maturity/Harvesting (M/H), Flushing (FLU) and Dormancy (D). The significance of the variation "within" and "between" farms obtained from the VI metrics of the S2 data were tested using single-factor and two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Furthermore, to identify which specific variable pairs (phenology stages) were significantly different, a Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test was conducted, following the results of the ANOVA. Whilst it was possible to differentiate the phenological stages using all the four VIs, EVI was found to be the best related with p < 0.05 for most of the studied farms. A distinct annual trend was identified with a peak in June/July and troughs in December/January. The derivation of remote sensing based 'time series' growth profiles for commercial mango orchards supports the 'benchmarking' of annual and seasonal orchard performance and therefore offers a near 'real time' technology for identifying significant variations resulting from pest and disease incursions and the potential impacts of seasonal weather variations.

AB  - Various approaches were developed considering the need to increase agricultural productivity in cultivated areas without more deforestation, such as the Integrated Crop livestock systems (ICLS). The ICLS could be composed of annual crops followed by pastureland with the presence of cattle. Due to the high temporal dynamic of rotation between crops over the season, monitoring these areas is a big challenge. Also, agricultural organizations worldwide highlight the need for early-season maps for this kind of work. In this context, this study evaluated the potential of open data (Sentinel-2) data to map ICLS areas. The performance of two classifiers was evaluated: one of Machine Learning (random forest) and the other of Deep Learning (LSTM). Three different time windows of data were tested (Entire season, 180 days, and 120 days). Using the RF classifier, it was possible to achieve satisfactory results (Overall accuracy higher than 80%) for the early season (180 days). However, further studies are needed to explain better the lower(when compared to Random Forest) accuracy achieved by LSTM net (0.79 % for 180 days) and compare the results achieved here with results for a study area with different rates of cloud cover.

TI  - Intentionalities of the Algorithm: Historical Practices and Socio-Computing Infrastructures A Philosophical Account
T2  - SGUARDO-RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Computing does not only imply a logical interaction with and through machines, but also - maybe more poignantly - a way of thinking. As historians of technology acknowledge, computing meant in the past so much as counting, or even reasoning. But in this sense, the history of computing has a much earlier beginning than what is popularly thought. The first machines that we can recognize as abstract computers were imagined by Charles Babbage in the 19th Century, but the first algorithms were assembled centuries before, to be performed by social machineries. Drawing on an expanded understanding of Tomasello's hypothesis on the nature of collective thinking, this article argues that collective intentionalities - which can be thought of as pre-conceptual or non-conscious states of collective organization - are inherent settings embedded in social algorithms, and that they play an important role in the socio-computing infrastructure in which these algorithms perform. The article then investigates this path by exploring historical samples of social algorithms and collective intentionalities, from Antiquity and the Middle Ages to contemporary socio-algorithmic practices. It then attempts to reconstruct the functional patterns and the complex relations they afford, while it looks at some of the cognitive articulations they conform. In the end, the article explains an algorithm as a collective social technology that emerges as a cultural script, where we find recurring process of signifying, inscribing and interpreting, and in which a given form of social thinking, involving a characteristic worldview, is always mobilized.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper provides an analysis of the main ideas of the article by S.Yu Glazyev "Russia is fighting for the preservation of mankind" (newspaper Zavtra, April 6, 2022), in which an important, actually central place is occupied by reflections on the role and significance of social consciousness and state ideology. However, the article pays little attention to the questions of WHO embodies the struggle, WHO the bearer of social consciousness is, and WHOSE INTERESTS should be expressed by the state ideology in modem Russia. In accordance with this goal, an analysis of the role of social consciousness in the historical destinies of peoples, the place and role of state ideology is carried out. The characteristics of the main classes and communities (strata) in modern Russian society and their worldview attitudes and orientations are given. Particular attention is paid to the precariat, which, in the author's opinion, determines the face of modem Russian society. The conclusion is substantiated that worldview, ideological positions are not only a part of public life, but a certain penetrating component that concerns not only culture, but also all spheres of economic, social and political activity.

TI  - Monitoring land-cover changes in Mediterranean coastal dunes, northwest Tunisia, using remote sensing data
T2  - NOTULAE BOTANICAE HORTI AGROBOTANICI CLUJ-NAPOCA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dune landscapes are subject to morphological and ecological changes. In many parts of the world, coastal dunes are under severe pressure. The present study illustrates an integrated remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) approach, i.e., geospatial techniques for assessing land-cover dynamics in Zouaraa coastal dunes, located in northwest Tunisia. As a main result, the analysis of the situation in the past six decades indicates that the dune area showed a decreasing trend with up to 31% (i.e., 6198 ha) in favour of forest area, which has increased by up to 6485 ha. The geo-spatial analysis revealed that restoration works have positively contributed to stabilize coastal dune systems with a substantial increase in vegetation cover. An increase in drought frequency and intensity was detected during the 1952-2017 period using the SPEI index, which enhanced the vegetation activity and growth in the study area. The SPEI significantly correlated with vegetation greenness on the 12- and 24-months' time scales. The croplands, water and buildings in the study area have increased respectively by 6% (i.e., 1256 ha), 13% (i.e., 3073 ha) and 3% ( i.e., 719 ha). In contrast, land cover like shrub and bare soil has decreased respectively by 13% (i.e., 3073 ha) and 2% (i.e., 1831 ha) during the same period. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of the revegetation techniques undertaken for conserving coastal dune systems. The findings of this study allow land-use planning decision makers to manage and improve situations in similar coastal regions.

AB  - Over 25 million Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Europe face multiple challenges related to personal data protection (PDP), ranging from awareness of EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to a clear and practical roadmap to compliance. Many also cannot afford access to enterprise-grade cybersecurity technology. This paper presents the main objectives and innovations of the EU-funded SENTINEL project, which introduces the concept of Intelligence for Compliance; it integrates tried-and-tested modular cybersecurity and privacy technologies with fresh, ambitious ones, such as a novel Identity Management System (IdMS) for human-centric data portability, and an end-to-end PDP compliance self-assessment framework. Combined with machine learning powered recommendations, policy drafting and enforcement for compliance, and a set of plugins that contains cybersecurity, data privacy and simulations/training software tools, SENTINEL aims to help small enterprises feel considerably more secure by safeguarding their and their customers' assets.

TI  - Methods for sentinel lymph node mapping in oral cancer: a literature review
T2  - POSTEPY HIGIENY I MEDYCYNY DOSWIADCZALNEJ
M3  - Review
AB  - Oral cancers, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, are the most common cancers of the head and neck. Of these, 90% are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Surgery, which consists of dissection of the primary tumor and lymphadenectomy, is considered a radical method of treatment. There are several ranges of cervical lymphadenectomy: selective neck dissection (SND), modified radical neck dissection (MRND), and radical neck dissection (RND). The extension of surgery depends on the stage of clinical advancement, which can be determined by TNM classification, among other methods. The greatest controversy is related to SND in patients with cN0 (no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis), which is currently standard procedure. This approach is dictated by the possibility of hidden or subclinical metastases. The use of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept in patients with early stage of oral cancer and appropriate methods of its mapping may lead to a reduction in the extent of the lymphadenectomy procedure, thus reducing postoperative mortality and maintaining the patient's function and quality of life, with correct oncological results. So far, available methods for SLN mapping are based on use of markers: methylene blue dye (MBD), metastable radioactive isotope Technetium (99mTc), or the fluorescent substance indocyanine green (ICG).

AB  - This case study demonstrated how modern remote sensing data can contribute to the monitoring of flooding events. The study was carried out in an area of high environmental interest, the Axios river wetlands, Greece. The spatial resolution of satellite-image-based standardised metrics was increased with the use of UAV-obtained aerial images, equipped with an RGB camera. A strong relation (R-2 = 0.85) was observed between the NDWI and a linear combination of RGB intensities of the aerial image, after averaging within the lower-resolution satellite-image pixels. Application of the derived model directly on a separate aerial image taken on the same day over a nearby location was highly successful in separating land from sea, in high-resolution. A more extensive evaluation is needed, with simultaneous in-situ observations, to assess the suitability of the method for flooded versus dry ground segmentation.

AB  - The National River Ganga, home to the National aquatic animal, Gangetic dolphin along with species of critically endangered otters, gharial crocodile, turtles, waterbirds and numerous aquatic and semi aquatic life forms is of conservation importance to safeguard the biodiversity it harbors. Meanwhile, River Ganga is also the source of highly productive agricultural yield that satiates the nation's food demands. The last few years have echoed demands for 'e-flow' regulations to be formalized and regularized to maintain healthy river conditions with adequate amount of water retained in the rivers while meeting the populations demand for water supply. Though e flow estimations are a complex science in itself, the simplest way is visualization. In this context, there needs to be a transparent mechanism to picturise and depict the ground conditions of the river stretches. Remote sensing provides 'eyes in the sky'. The river receives water in the form of precipitation, snow melt and ground water recharge and the hydrological flux is evident in the surface water. Thus delineating the water spread area can provide a crude estimate of the water in the river. The Go ogle Earth Engine platform provides a collection of satellite imageries, server side data processing and algorithms. The Landsat and Sentinel data catalogue offers good coverage of the river and its basin. Though sentinel data provides high ground resolution of 10m, Landsat provides multi temporal historic coverage at a good 30 m resolution, that works well for the main stem river. From the various available data processing methods, spectral decomposition technique of Modified Normalised Differential Water Index MNDWI was found to be most effective in delineating surface water. Data was filtered for the three major seasons of Pre monsoon, Monsoon and Post monsoon periods and MNDWI for the same was visualized. While Middle Ganga region through Uttar Pradesh shows seasonal flooding during the monsoon period, the Lower Ganga after the confluence of major tributaries of Son, Ghaghra, Gandak and Kosi flows in full bank width in the Post monsoon period. During the pre monsoon period many stretches of Ganga particularly the Upper middle stretch showed thin shallow channel and intermittent deep pools disconnected by dry sand beds. These regions result in disruption in the river flow and are priority sites to implement e flow regulations. Another key factor is the regulation of flow in the river from barrages. Sudden release of water can cause flooding resulting in disturbance to the life cycle of species that are tuned to the natural annual hydrological pulse of the river. This is because different aquatic species have different river width and depth requirements. Thus monitoring the seasonal variations in the water spread area helps to note the longitudinal and lateral connectivity of the river which is a prime characteristic for the health of a river. This study intended to create an application that offers to visualize the seasonal water spread in the Ganga river for the past years that can assist decision makers to monitor the river and make informed regulatory measures.

AB  - In the scientific literature, there are accents that emphasize certain changes in the functioning of philosophy, which took place in connection with the establishment of the postulates of postmodernism as a new period in the development of culture, as a style of post non-classical scientific thinking, in fact, the content and hierarchy of values positions itself with a sophisticated departure from the classical and non-classical philosophical reflection.Philosophical and educational understanding of the methodology of research of dialogue and tolerance testified to the relevance of their research in the development of the potential of today's multicultural education and its growth in the cultural and educational space. Dialogue, dialogics and tolerance are represented by the mechanisms of meaning-making, axiology and praxeology: dialogical cognition of the interpersonal, social-group, societal, planetary world provides a certain "breakthrough" in the worldview-value coordinate system, in external-internal control of growth efficiency and its spiritual dimension.The axiological, ontological, educational-epistemological aspects of "fitting" a person into a new world content are precisely in the plane of philosophy, enriching the cultural fields of today's education through integration in goal-setting, content, organizational and managerial conditions for teaching and upbringing value ideals, principles, methods of holistic study of a person and those that are relevant today and provide Homo educandus with a meaning-making knowledge.

M3  - Article
AB  - A suite of satellite-derived data and high-resolution ocean model outputs were used to study the response of the upper ocean to Hurricane Dorian (2019), which impacted the Bahamas and the eastern coast of the United States in August and September of 2019. We observe enhanced upwelling that in conjunction with surface cooling from precipitation led to an approximate 4 degrees C drop in sea surface temperature (SST) along and slightly ahead of Dorian's path. The upwelling also increased the local coastal chlorophyll-a levels. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sea surface salinity (SSS) shows a clear eye and eye wall structure on September 4 (the day of peak intensity), which has never been seen due to the recency of the SMAP satellite's launch and the strength of Hurricane Dorian (2019). The initial forecast path of Hurricane Dorian was set to travel northward through central Florida; however, we can see from satellite observations that a high-pressure system in the north Atlantic redirects the path of the hurricane offshore. We show a clear upper ocean response to Hurricane Dorian using satellite observations and hope that this multiparameter approach can improve the current quantification of air-sea interactions during Category 5 conditions.

AB  - The rapid growth of the urban population across the globe over the last decades has been increasingly contributing to urban expansion and with that, increasing pressure on the surrounding natural and rural environments has been exerted. This study aims at developing an analysis framework focusing on land use and land cover (LULC) mapping along with an integration of urban expansion indicators to provide representative metrics. By applying machine learning classification methods on multitemporal remote sensing data, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), high accuracy LULC maps can be generated and employed as fundamental data for investigating urban sprawl patterns. Results of this investigation show that indicators such as the Abstract Achieved Population Density in Expansion Areas as well as the Shannon Entropy can be considered as a tool for cross-comparison and validation, and allow in particular to highlight changes between various land cover types derived by human development. This method has the potential to be transferable to other locations for quantitatively assessing urban expansion comprehensively.

TI  - Philosophical Dialogue between Russia and The West: Translation of Meanings and Hermeneutic "Failure" (On the Example of Dutch Translations of Semyon Frank's Creative Heritage of the 1930s)
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article addresses a number of hermeneutic difficulties faced by representatives of the Dutch philosophical community of the 1930s in the context of their comprehension of Frank's works. Semyon Frank was one of the famous Russian emigre thinkers. The article draws attention to important linguistic, cultural, and ideological features inherent in Russian religious philosophy, which might become obstacles to Western hermeneutic practices, implicitly emanating from other cultural and value-semantic foundations. The available examples of incomplete, distorted translation and interpretation by Dutch intellectuals of such a key concept for Russian religious philosophy as "collegiality" are analyzed. It is noted that this concept was perceived in a simplified way, only as a "feeling of connectedness", which far from fully reflects its content and makes it difficult to build a full- fledged philosophical dialogue. In the philosophy of Semyon Frank, this concept has a much deeper content. According to Semyon Frank the collegiality acts as a historically important construct on which the unity of history is based since this spiritual phenomenon presupposes a supertemporal primordial unity, built on the basis of the common fundamental values of those who lived, who is, living now, and those who are still going to live. Especially, it is emphasized that the analyzed example of an unsuccessful translation of meaning should not be absolutized. Additionally, examples of adequate perception of Semyon Frank by Western thinkers are provided in the article. It is concluded that the hermeneutic difficulties of Dutch intellectuals are caused primarily by their self-centered philosophical view of the world, which interfered with the adequate comprehension of semantic references present in the work of the Russian philosopher.

AB  - Based on Russian archival documents and hitherto poorly known primary sources, Nikolay Tsyrempilov's paper is a study of the Buryat Buddhist perception and interpretation of the Russian emperors' enthronement ceremonies. Buryat Buddhist hierarchs were among the many Central Asian elites invited to the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II in 1896. The paper argues that the Buddhists did not simply share their Orthodox counterparts' understanding of the ceremony, but also gave new meaning to it within the frames of their own religious worldview and Buddhist conceptions of kingship. In this understanding, Moscow and St. Petersburg became Pure Lands made holy thanks to the presence of an enlightened deity, the Tsar.

TI  - Multi-resolution Pyramid Enhanced Non-local Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) is applied to accurately distinguish ground objects in many fields, owing to its abundant structural and spectral information. To fully mine the spectral-spatial information, feature extraction methods are employed to further improve the classification performance in numerous research works. Among them, integrating contextual information into pixels is an active topic and achieved significant performance. However, it is inevitable to come with unwanted and superfluous distracting contents in the process of introducing contextual information. This article proposes a multi-resolution pyramid enhanced non-local feature extraction (MRPEN) method by exploiting non-local information from different resolutions to alleviate the effects of noise contents. The feature extraction task is implemented through by first constructing a multi-resolution feature pyramid via performing spectral-spatial reduction and resize operation on the HSI. With the feature pyramid, three kinds of feature extraction manners (i.e., short-range, long-range, and non-local) are utilized to extract specific features for each layers. In particular, the non-local feature is extracted by introducing adjacent superpixels from the upper layer into our feature extraction operation. After this, the extracted features of each layer are concatenated together and fed on a sparse autoencoders. Finally, a decision rule is introduced to blend the prediction results. Experiments on three public HSI datasets and a Gaofen-5 satellite dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art classification approaches.

TI  - Research on the Geometric Precision Correction Method for Three-Axis-Stabilized Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Images Based on Landmarks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the positioning accuracy of the three-axis-stabilized geostationary meteorological satellite (GSMS) images, we developed a geometric precision correction process based on landmarks. For the problem that GSMS images and binary landmark images are difficult to match accurately, we made full use of the local and global spatial information of the image pairs and proposed a dual-threshold matching algorithm based on the misalignment matrix to screen the initial matching results generated by the maximum normalized cross correlation. Under the premise of ensuring matching precision, the number of correctly matched point pairs is effectively increased to provide more sufficient samples for subsequent processing. Finally, we used a shallow neural network to establish the transformation relationship between the GSMS image and the reference image and resampled the GSMS image. We selected observations from five different periods of FY-4A/Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) on-orbit and conducted two verification experiments: 1) in the image matching, compared with several commonly used algorithms, we found that the proposed matching algorithm has obvious advantages in matching precision and relative recall; and 2) in the image correction, the positioning error corrected by our methods is about 1.26 pixels (3 sigma) in the central area and about 1.30 pixels (3 sigma) in the edge area, which is about 14.9% and 9.1% better than the weighted iterative cubic polynomial fitting algorithm, respectively, with better robustness. In conclusion, the landmark-based geometric precision correction process proposed effectively improves the geometric accuracy of GSMS images, which is an important foundation for subsequent quantitative applications.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Urban Polycentric Interaction Using Nighttime Light Data: A Case Study of Shanghai, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban polycentric structure is connected to the economy and enormously impacts socioeconomic development and policies. Unlike traffic data and big geographic data, remote sensing data have shown an accessible way to measure urban spatial interaction. However, most existing studies only focused on the interaction among cities rather than within cities. Meanwhile, the urban spatial interaction, which should be directional, was always expressed as an undirected graph. Therefore, this article developed a network-based radiation model using nighttime light remote sensing data and mapped a directed interaction network (inward and outward direction) among urban centers. Taking the region within the outer ring of Shanghai as an example, the taxi trajectory data were adopted to validate the result with the R-2 of 0.61. We discovered that: the urban polycentric interaction network is dumbbell-shaped with an east-west development corridor crossing the main center and connecting two main urban center clusters. The in-strength and out-strength interaction of each urban center have a similar distribution. The urban centers with higher in-strength and out-strength are mainly concentrated toward the main center, especially in the east-west direction. At the urban center level, the total inward interaction is slightly higher than the total outward interaction of most urban centers. Spatially, an unbalanced distribution was found. In summary, our proposed method effectively indicates the urban polycentric interaction and is applicable to other regions since it requires no arbitrary parameters and the input data (e.g., nighttime light data) is readily available.

TI  - Graph Neural Networks Extract High-Resolution Cultivated Land Maps From Sentinel-2 Image Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining farm sustainability through optimizing the agricultural management practices helps build more planet-friendly environment. The emerging satellite missions can acquire multispectral and hyperspectral imagery which captures more detailed spectral information concerning the scanned area, hence allows us to benefit from subtle spectral features during the analysis process in agricultural applications. We introduce an approach for extracting 2.5-m cultivated land maps from 10-m Sentinel-2 (S-2) multispectral image (MSI) series which benefits from a compact graph convolutional neural network. The experiments indicate that our models not only outperform classical and deep machine learning techniques through delivering higher quality segmentation maps, but also dramatically reduce the memory footprint when compared to U-Nets (almost 8k trainable parameters of our models, with up to 31-M parameters of U-Nets). Such memory frugality is pivotal in the missions which allow us to uplink a model to the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered satellite once it is in orbit, as sending large nets is impossible due to the time constraints.

TI  - Multiple PRI Technique for Concurrent Imaging Mode using TerraSAR-X
T2  - 2022 IEEE RADAR CONFERENCE (RADARCONF'22)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)
CL  - New York, NY
AB  - The concurrent imaging mode using TerraSAR-X is a technique that allows the acquisition of two images in a single flyover. It brings high versatility and can double the image output rate. These benefits are of great interest as there is a long revisit time for spaceborne SAR systems. One of the main drawbacks is the use of high pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs), which causes ambiguity issues and timing limitations. Therefore, knowing and improving the quality of the imaging mode is desired. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of its global availability. Moreover, a technique named multiple pulse repetition intervals (PRIs) is proposed to improve the coverage of the imaging mode while maintaining its ambiguity performance. Further simulations are presented, confirming the benefits of the technique, culminating in a vast global availability for the concurrent mode.

TI  - Spectral reflectance properties of minerals exposed to martian surface conditions: Implications for spectroscopy-based mineral detection on Mars
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral reflectance properties of eight hydrated minerals including zeolites, sulfates, and silica-rich sinter were investigated under simulated Mars surface conditions. The minerals were selected based on their past detection on Mars by remote sensing data and certain minerals merited further investigations based on previous spectral studies. Long duration 763-day (similar to 26-month) exposure (atmosphere of 5 Torr CO2 with two periods of UV radiation) and 6 weeks exposure to ambient temperatures after similar to 26 months was conducted to determine mineral stability on the surface of Mars by assessing changes to absorption band depths, widths, shape, center, and spectral slope. Changes in all of these spectral metrics were observed for at least one of the samples. We found longer-term changes of some spectral properties past the termination of previous published studies for certain samples and some which may extend beyond the duration of the experimental run. Some of the spectral changes were reversible when the samples were re-exposed to the ambient terrestrial environment. These spectral changes could be related to various processes, such as rapid loss and reaccumulation of adsorbed water, preferential loss of bound water versus structural OH, changes in Fe3+ bridging cations and structure, and decomposition of some phases. The changes in a wide range of spectral properties suggests that analysis of observational data for Mars should be approached with an appreciation for how exposure to Mars surface conditions can affect spectroscopybased interpretations of mineralogy. The results are also relevant to understanding spectral changes seen in roverexposed subsurface regolith, and for selecting samples for caching and return to Earth: i.e., stability before, during, and after sampling, caching, return to Earth, and subsequent analysis in terrestrial laboratories.

TI  - An FPGA-Based Solution for Computing a Local Stationarity Measure From Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of data variability from in-situ observations is essential for scientists and space mission controllers. Given the limited resources available on-board a spacecraft as well as the presence of the Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) devices in modern spacecraft architectures, an efficient real-time monitoring solution should be deployed on these devices to use minimal computational and energy resources, and to reduce the main on-board computer utilization, thus making it available for other tasks. This paper describes the implementation of an algorithm for computing a local stationarity measure (LSM) on FPGA devices. The algorithm tests weak stationarity from the convergence of the partial means of the signal computed on subsets of increasing length, compared to the overall mean of the signal over a fixed-length running window; the window spans the entire signal. The algorithm is designed for an on-board implementation which monitors and detects changes of variables measured in-situ by scientific instruments (e.g., magnetometers). The design was tested with synthetic and real-time signals and provides results in very good agreement with a dedicated data analysis library specifically designed for the analysis of satellite data.

AB  - Due to unprecedented growth in freely and easily available remote sensing data, it is being used in plenty of applications and creating opportunities to contribute in this field. At the same time at the educational perspectives, very few countries are paying attention to remote sensing education at wider scale. Many of the developing countries still do not have exposure to remote sensing education. Therefore, it is required to have a learning platform to reach out to the learners using simple and easily available technologies. We are proposing mobile based remote sensing learning platform which will focus understanding, training, and research in remote sensing domain and have maximum outreach to all interested learners.

TI  - Atrous cGAN for SAR to Optical Image Translation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conditional (cGAN)-based methods proposed so far for synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-to-optical image synthesis tend to produce noisy and unsharp optical outcomes. In this work, we propose the atrous-cGAN, a novel cGAN architecture that improves the SAR-to-optical image translation. The proposed generator and discriminator networks rely on atrous convolutions and incorporate an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module to enhance fine details in the generated optical image by exploiting spatial context at multiple scales. This letter reports experiments carried out to assess the performance of atrous-cGAN for the synthesis of Landsat-8 images from Sentinel-1A data based on three public data sets. The experimental analysis indicated that the atrous-cGAN consistently outperformed the classical pix2pix counterpart in terms of visual quality, similar to the true optical image, and as a feature learning tool for semantic segmentation.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIV Part of SPIE Remote Sensing Conferene

AB  - Contemporary climate change has induced an urge to monitor and manage the forest ecosystems to maintain the carbon and energy balance of the system. For understanding the behavior of a forest, its productivity is the key. Monitoring a forest in terms of its productivity provides a holistic understanding of the response of the forest to external stimuli in form of climate change as well as change in its physiological processes. Productivity depends on the effectiveness of the various interlinked physiological processes indicating the climatic, anthropogenic, and geochemical influence on the biosphere. Himalayan ecosystem, one the most fragile ecosystems with home to large biodiversity, requires a clear understating of forest and its response to climatic variability. For assessing these responses, we conducted a study to examine the trend of net primary productivity (NPP) from 2002-2021 across the Western Himalayan region. Remotely sensed (NPP) data for the last 20 years at 500m spatial resolution have been acquired from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using Google Earth Engine platform. All the analysis was carried out using R software and maps have been generated using ArcGIS software. The study area witnessed a positive trend throughout the study period. The annual average NPP increased from 3.18 Mg C ha(-1)yr(-1) to 4.98 Mg C ha(-1)yr(-1) from 2002-2021. Examining the spatial variations, we found NPP has increased in 88% of the total study area, whereas the rest of the area has experienced a decrease. Disintegrating the trend into different slope categories indicated that 88.22% of the area under 15 degrees-30 degrees slope show positive trend in NPP followed by 0-15 and 30-60 both having 86% area with a positive trend. Analysis revealed that a 15 degrees-30 degrees slope is most favorable for forest growth in terms of NPP.

TI  - Detector linearity assessment of MODIS reflective solar bands using on-board calibrators
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The detectors in the reflective solar bands (RSB) of Terra and Aqua MODIS use a linear relationship to relate the instrument response to the observed top-of-atmosphere radiance. Recently, we reported that Aqua MODIS bands 1 (645 nm) and 2 (858 nm) have deviations from gain linearity that change on-orbit, leading to errors in the NASA Level 1B radiance products for low radiance scenes. In this paper, we expand on these findings to assess the linearity of detector responses in both Aqua and Terra MODIS for all RSB using data from the on-board solar diffuser (SD) and spectro-radiometric calibration assembly (SRCA). We use comparisons of SD observations taken at two different radiance levels: with and without an attenuation screen. The SRCA, operated in radiometric mode, takes observations of RSB detector response at multiple radiance levels using a set of lamps and a neutral density filter. While the lamps do not provide a stable enough source for an accurate radiometric calibration, we can use the relative response with and without the neutral density filter to track changes in gain linearity. Unlike the SD, the SRCA results can be used for nearly all RSB of both instruments. We show that most RSB for both Terra and Aqua MODIS continue to have very linear responses throughout the missions. Some notable exceptions are bands 1 and 2 for both Aqua and Terra, which are used primarily for land imaging applications, and band 26 for Terra, which is used for cirrus cloud identification. The results from the SD and SRCA are in reasonably good agreement with each other.

TI  - Cervical versus Utero-Ovarian Ligament Injection of the Tracer for the Pelvic Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Gynecologic Oncology: A Prospective Observational Study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In gynecologic oncology, the consolidated injection site for the pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping is the cervix. However, in apparent early-stage ovarian cancer, current trials map the pelvic area injecting the tracers in the utero-ovarian ligament. A different injection site is proposed based on a possible different lymphatic ovarian drainage through the utero-ovarian ligament and uterus and consequently a different pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping than the cervix; however, this was never proven. On that basis, this study aimed to investigate whether injecting the tracer in the utero-ovarian ligament map the same or a different pelvic sentinel lymph node than the cervix. Design: A prospective observational study was conducted. Methods: All consecutive women undergoing primary surgery for gynecologic malignancy with planned pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping were enrolled.The cervical injection was performed at 3 and 9 o'clock injecting indocyanine green. Bilateral utero-ovarian ligament injection was performed by injecting methylene blue. The probability of detecting the same sentinel lymph node (concordance rate) and the probability of detecting a different sentinel lymph node (discordance rate) in each hemipelvis were compared using McNemar's exact test. Results: Out of 36 hemipelvis (18 patients), the overall detection rate with cervical indocyanine green injection was 86.1% (31/36) versus 52.8% (19/36) with utero-ovarian ligament methylene blue injection (p = 0.0004). Indocyanine green and methylene blue identified the same sentinel lymph node in all hemipelvis when sentinel lymph node mapping was obtained by both dyes (19/19; concordance rate 100%). No different or additional sentinel lymph nodes were identified by one of the two dyes (0/19; discordance rate 0%). The probability of detecting the same pelvic sentinel lymph node by the two injection sites was significantly higher than the probability of detecting a different pelvic sentinel lymph node (p < 0001). Limitations: The use of two different dyes with known different sentinel lymph node mapping performance impedes to evaluate differences in detection rate attributable to the two injection sites, limiting the comparison only in hemipelvis in which both dyes identified a sentinel lymph node. Conclusions: The cervix and utero-ovarian ligament are two sites for the tracer injection that have a higher probability of detecting the same than a different pelvic sentinel lymph node. Given the higher technical challenge in performing the utero-ovarian ligament injection, these results suggest that the injection of the tracer into the cervix could be a more reliable alternative for the pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping in ovarian cancer.

TI  - Lean-logistics in constructive geography: theoretical and methodological foundations
T2  - VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research problem introduction. The main research goal of this paper is to provide the lean-logistics geosystem research concept as a contemporary approach of constructive geography closely connected with industry as a part of the service sector based on leading scientific principles, GIS-technologies and remote sensing data processing software involvement, and to give some details about this concept applied implementation. All these arguments allow us to specify and to study in-depth the peculiarities, key types, and specificities of the lean-logistics.In this paper, Lean-logistics is understood as an environmental service that helps to improve biodiversity and a stable environment. Lean-logistics itself can be developed as a type of modelling land use and land management activities. This activity can be even thought of as educational innovation with nature-based solutions.The key geographic-centered ideas of the concept of Lean-logistics are integration, engineering, economization, ecologization, socialization, and humanization of modern human activities.The methodological basis of Lean-logistics is presented by three sections, such as Section I. Theory of logistics (for instance, such aspects as general characteristics of logistics and its key features, Varieties of logistics and its classification, Lean logistics as a science: its place in logistics, key distinct features, etc.), Section II. Applied logistics (with such aspects as Military logistics, Business logistics, Environmental logistics, Urban logistics, and Logistics services), and Section III. Logistical construction (Lean-construction of commodity flows and Lean-construction in the field of services).The practical basis of Lean-logistics is formed by logic modelling (studios). Logic modelling in Lean-logistics are called logistics studios and are understood as a form of active practical activities of researchers. Summarizing and generalizing key ideas discussed in the text, the authors underline that the conceptual framework of the lean-logistics geosystem research is based on the implementation of four cross-cutting lines such as environmental security and sustainable development, health and safety, civic responsibility, business undertaking, and financial literacy. All of them aimed at forming a conscious citizen, all areas of activity of which are permeated by logistics chains.Concluding the research, the authors emphasize that the lean-logistics concept may be quite useful within the proposed content of Lean-logistics as a page navigator E-collection in the form of a book trailer. Some pages of it contain examples of the multimedia scrapbook of interactive exercises (deal with some definite sections and/or topics) which are presented using the Print Screen-visualization of the logistics lotto. The use of such tools, forms, technologies, techniques in the study of the content of "Lean-logistics in geography", as E-collection, book-trailer, hotlist, multimedia scrapbook, mind mapping software, QR-coding, Print Screen-visualization, with active use of GIS, educational Internet services, modernizes the learning process and with systematic use in practice makes them necessary and appropriate in the knowledge about geography and constructive geography.

TI  - Classification Ensembles for Beach Cast and Drifting Vegetation Mapping with Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the Baltic coastline of Germany, drifting vegetation and beach cast create overlays at the otherwise sandy or stony beaches. These overlays influence the morphodynamics and structures of the beaches. To better understand the influence of these patchy habitats on coastal environments, regular monitoring is necessary. Most studies, however, have been conducted on spatially larger and temporally more stable occurrences of aquatic vegetation such as floating fields of Sargassum. Nevertheless, drifting vegetation and beach cast pose a particular challenge, as they exhibit high temporal dynamics and sometimes small spatial extent. Regular surveys and mappings are the traditional methods to record their habitats, but they are time-consuming and cost-intensive. Spaceborne remote sensing can provide frequent recordings of the coastal zone at lower cost. Our study therefore aims at the monitoring of drifting vegetation and beach cast on spatial scales between 3 and 10 m. We developed an automated coastline masking algorithm and tested six supervised classification methods and various classification ensembles for their suitability to detect small-scale assemblages of drifting vegetation and beach cast in a study area at the coastline of the Western Baltic Sea using multispectral data of the sensors Sentinel-2 MSI and PlanetScope. The shoreline masking algorithm shows high accuracies in masking the land area while preserving the sand-covered shoreline. We could achieve best classification results using PlanetScope data with an ensemble of a random forest classifier, cart classifier, support vector machine classifier, naive bayes classifier and stochastic gradient boosting classifier. This ensemble accomplished a combined f1-score of 0.95. The accuracy of the Sentinel-2 classifications was lower but still achieved a combined f1-score of 0.86 for the same ensemble. The results of this study can be considered as a starting point for the development of time series analysis of the vegetation dynamics along Baltic beaches.

TI  - Tengrianism in the history and culture of the nomads of Central Asia
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the issue of the role of Tengrianism in the history , culture of the nomads of Central Asia. The origin of Tengrianism is usually associated with the Hunnu (Xiongnu) people who created a large nomadic realm in this region. Tengri-anism gained further development already in the age of the great Turkic khaganates where the ancestors of contemporary Turkic and Mongolian peoples lived. The final formation of Tengrianism as an imperial religion is associated with the emergence of new nomadic empires. Ancient Turkic runic monuments testify to the close connection of the Tengrian cult of Heaven with authority and the state.During the formation of the Mongol Empire, the imperial cult of Heaven and the Tengrian ideology were again in demand, because they justified the legitimacy of the new government by the "will of Heaven" and united the diverse tribes and peoples of the Great Steppe with a common worldview. The cult of Heaven under Genghis Khan actually turned into an official religion which at the same time did not negate other confessions. Thereafter, Tengrianism as a politicized religious tradition gradually declined, giving way to Mahayana Buddhism, Islam , shamanism.An important element of the Tengrian teaching was the covenant to live in agreement and harmony with the natural world and its laws. Tengrianism, being a transitional stage from early religious forms to more advanced religions, had not yet developed a full-fledged system of theology and morality. Therefore, the nomads were focused primarily on the earthly life and not on the afterlife. With the help of cultural codes, Tengrianism was developing and maintaining specific mental characteristics in the nomadic society.The author notes the connection between Tengrianism and the white shamanism of the peoples of Siberia, pointing out that white shamans and Tengri priests performed preeminently social rituals, worshipped gods of the Upper world, wore the same white clothes and rode white horses. The cult of the White Old Man - popular among the Mongolian peoples and Tuvans - is probably connected with Tengrianism.The interaction of Tengrianism with Buddhism and shamanism is considered within the framework of the doctrine of the Apol-lonian and Dionysian principles that was developed by Friedrich Nietzsche. In this regard, Tengrianism, as well as Buddhism, can be defined as an Apollonian type of religion, while shamanism is a religious Dionysianism.

TI  - Changing the Paradigm of Education in Postmodern Times
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Education as a respectable social institution reflects the processes of changing the classical scientific paradigm in the modern world and forms a new, postmodern educational space, which leads to the construction of a postmodern paradigm of a decentralized pedagogical process, which provides for the coexistence of various autonomous "centers", paradigms, methods, approaches, etc., competing, complement each other and among which there are no dominant ones. Under these conditions, the pedagogical process acts as an open, temporal, indeterministic, pluralistic, emergent entity, forms an "environment of a free position" in which something constantly disappears and then appears, and is sensitive to minor influences.The philosophical analysis of education should be consistent with postmodern socio-cultural processes of a public, state and global nature and their reflection in the sphere of postmodern society. At the present stage of education, new philosophical and ideological prerequisites are needed.The purpose of our article is a philosophical analysis of the concepts of education in the postmodern era and the importance of education on the transformation of the worldview.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Spatiotemporal Simulation Using Convolutional LSTM for Flood Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been widely applied for flooding mapping based on change detection approaches. However, errors in the mapping result are expected since not all land-cover changes are flood-induced, and those changes are sensitive to SAR data, such as crop growth or harvest over agricultural lands, clearance of forested areas, and/or modifications on the urban landscape. This study, therefore, incorporated historical SAR images to boost the detection of flood-induced changes during extreme weather events, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Additionally, to incorporate the spatial signatures for the change detection, we applied a deep learning-based spatiotemporal simulation framework, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), for simulating a synthetic image using Sentinel One intensity time series. This synthetic image will be prepared in advance of flood events, and then it can be used to detect flood areas using change detection when the post-image is available. Practically, significant divergence between the synthetic image and post-image is expected over inundated zones, which can be mapped by applying thresholds to the Delta image (synthetic image minus post-image). We trained and tested our model on three events from Australia, Brazil, and Mozambique. The generated Flood Proxy Maps were compared against reference data derived from Sentinel Two and Planet Labs optical data. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we also generated Delta products for two baseline models (closest post-image minus pre-image and historical mean minus post-image) and two LSTM architectures: normal LSTM and ConvLSTM. Results show that thresholding of ConvLSTM Delta yielded the highest Cohen's Kappa coefficients in all study cases: 0.92 for Australia, 0.78 for Mozambique, and 0.68 for Brazil. Lower Kappa values obtained in the Mozambique case can be subject to the topographic effect on SAR imagery. These results still confirm the benefits in terms of classification accuracy that convolutional operations provide in time series analysis of satellite data employing spatially correlated information in a deep learning framework.

TI  - Legends about Fiery Horses: Succession of Funerary and Memorial Traditions in the Eurasian's Nomadic Peoples Cultures
T2  - STRATUM PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article proposes a cross-cultural analysis of the concept of continuity of burial traditions in the cultures of the proto-Turkic and Turkic peoples of northern Eurasia, based on archaeological and folklore sources and ethnographic data of the Kazakh and Yakut ethnicities. Researchers use materials from archaeological studies of known and new sites of the Early Iron Age and Turkic time in Kazakhstan (Berel, Kyrykungir, etc.). The study of the topic requires the use of methodological approaches and developments of cultural and social anthropology, structural and semiotic analysis, deciphering the general appearance of similar cases in the spiritual culture of asynchronical, but mono-ethnic societies for the reconstruction of worldview ideas. When characterizing burial sites, the authors use traditional methods of archaeological description, chronological determination, stratigraphy, typological analysis, etc. New data have been obtained on the connections of elements of the worldview of tribes from the early Iron Age - the Middle Ages, enshrined in the burial rite of the Saka and Turkic population of the Eurasian steppes and materials of modern folklore of Turkic peoples (Kazakhs and Sakha Yakuts).

TI  - Quantification of carbon sequestration by urban forest using Landsat 8 OLI and machine learning algorithms in Jodhpur, India
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests play a significant role in carbon cycling. Quantification of Aboveground Biomass (AGB) is critical to understand the role of urban forests in carbon sequestration. In the present study, Machine learning (ML) based regression algorithms (SVM, RF, kNN and XGBoost) have been taken into account for spatial mapping of AGB and carbon for the urban forests of Jodhpur city, Rajasthan, India, with the aid of field-based data and their correlations with spectra and textural variables derived from Landsat 8 OLI data. A total of 198 variables were retrieved from the satellite image, including bands, Vegetation Indices (VIs), linearly transformed variables, and Grey Level Co-occurrence textures (GLCM) taken as independent input variables further reduced to 29 variables using Boruta feature selection method. All the models have been compared where with RF algorithm, R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 16.22 t/ha and MAE = 11.86 t/ha. For kNN algorithm R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 28.04 t/ha and MAE = 24.24 t/ha and SVM where R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 89.21 t/ha and MAE = 74.22 t/ha and the best prediction accuracy has been noted with XGBoost algorithm (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 14.08 t/ha and MAE = 13.66 t/ha) with predicted AGB as 0.51-153.76 t/ha. The study indicates that ML-based regression algorithms have great potential over other linear and multiple regression techniques for spatial mapping of AGB and carbon of urban forests for arid regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing data and the geographic information system (GIS) to prepare flood risk maps has gained enormous popularity among researchers. In the present study, a flood risk zone map has been prepared for Jodhpur District, Rajasthan using remote sensing and GIS techniques. CartoDEM Version-3 having 30 m spatial resolution along with Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images with 30 m spatial resolution is used to prepare thematic layers for elevation, slope, drainage density and land use. Monthly precipitation data from climatic research unit at a grid size of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude is used to prepare rainfall map with 30 m spatial resolution. Soil map for the study area also at 30 m spatial resolution is extracted from FAO digital soil map of the world and then converted to raster data format using feature to raster converter tool in ArcGIS 10.3. Ranking and weight determined from multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique are assigned to the raster maps of the variables. The thematic layers were combined with the weighted overlay method in ArcGIS 10.3 software to determine categorised flood risk zone map of the study area.

AB  - Based on the analysis of fundamental worldview principles of the leading medieval philosophers - Aurelius Augustinus and Thomas Aquinas - the conceptual principles of the phenomenon of creativity in Medieval literature are established. It is concluded that human creativity in the medieval Christian paradigm is associated with the divine, manifesting as salvation through union with God. In medieval Christian philosophy, creativity is not just a person's action but also the appearance of a chance for a particular person to accept the new ontological status due to gravitating towards God and the Absolute.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the work of I.A. Bunin in a wide historical, cultural and moral-philosophical context, reveals its religious-ontological and axiological constants that define the artistic picture of the writer's world, formed under the powerful influence of precedent texts of the oldest civilizations of the Middle East, among which the books of the Old Testament, recognized as sacred to Judaism, have the greatest mytho-suggestive valence. The problem of the spiritual influence of Holy Scripture on I.A. Bunin's worldview and life attitude, which has long been raised in literary studies, receives a new analytical perspective of reflection, associated with the identification of specific forms and ways of representation of the biblical material in the writer's multigenre works, in which modernity is perceived through the identification of ideological and semantic analogies and parallels with antiquity. The images of the Old Testament prophets and spiritual teachers of mankind invariably attracted the attention of I.A. Bunin throughout his life. In Bunin's works the figure of the biblical psalmist king David is especially significant. In the artistic consciousness of the writer, King David acts as a seeker of truth, making moral ascents and falls in the process of his spiritual search. Projecting the heroes of his works onto the figure of David (and vice versa), I.A. Bunin determines the moral and ethical potential of a modern person. Allusions and reminiscences related to the life and service of Tsar David to God and the world form the cultural and philosophical background of the work of I.A. Bunin, which becomes an integral part of the spiritual and intellectual space of Russian literature of the twentieth century, integrating into it the facts and artifacts of biblical history.

TI  - THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE POETRY BY V. T. SHALAMOV: THE BIBLICAL TEXT AND CONTEXT
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article in the cultural, philosophical and religious-ontological context presents the Christological theme in the poetry of V. T. Shalamov, which, developing throughout the poet's career, underwent a peculiar evolution - from the atheistic-secularized understanding of Jesus Nazarene as a historical person, who revealed to the world the absolute value of the moral and ethical teachings of the New Testament, before penetrating the spiritual and metaphysical depth of the Gospels, evangelizing the victory of life over death, being over nothingness, freedom over necessity. The purpose of this work is to study the transformation of the gospel motifs and images, that make up the biblical realm of the world culture, in the lyrics of Shalamov in close connection with the ethical and aesthetic searches of the poet, which turned out to coincide with the aspiration of the Russian thinkers to the moral Absolute at the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries. The search for axiological constants of human existence, enriched by the tragic experience of the gulag Golgotha, brought Shalamov from the closed sociocultural space of Soviet reality to a spiritually boundless universe. The allusions and reminiscences related to the Holy Scriptures form in Shalamov's poetic heritage quite obvious biblical metatext, which has a motivational-shaped integrity, internal lyrical plot, and mytho-suggestive coloring of specific biographical facts and artifacts that constitute the author's worldview. Shalamov's apophatics of search for God under the conditions of Soviet reality determined the ways of artistic embodiment of the image of the Son of Man in all its existential complexity and multidimensionality. The object of this study covers the motivational layer of Shalamov's poetry, containing explicit and implicit references to the biblical text rethought by the author. The biblical motifs of the poetry by Shalamov are identified through historical-genetic, hermeneutic, structural-semantic and systemic-typological methods of studying a literary text. The image of Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, comprehended in the context of non-denominational Christianity, is central in Shalamov's poetry. The article presents an analysis of the poem "Treatise on Faith" that embodies the Christological vector of Russian poetry of the 20th century, which received creative development in Shalamov's works.

T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of the linguistic and cultural description of the conceptosphere of the Evenki language, which is relevant for research in modern Tungus studies. The conceptualization of the hunter in the linguistic picture of the Evenki is investigated. Hunting, which is an aboriginal occupation of the Tungus, played a key role in the formation of their linguistic picture of the world. The concept "Beyumekit/hunting" has a clearly structured system: 1) the subject of hunting (hunter); 2) the objects of hunting: hoofed and furred animals; 3) prey (meat, animal skin); 4) means and methods of hunting; 5) place of hunting; 6) road used for hunting; 7) hunting season; 8) animal traces; 9) dog - helper of hunter; 10) spirit - master of hunting. Being a basic element within the concept "Beyumekit/hunting", the conceptualization of the hunter is characterized by the following conceptual features: 1) a man; 2) hunting (hoofed and furred animals); 3) with bow or gun; 4) for the purpose of food and acquisition of hides for clothing. As a component of the concept "Beyumekit/hunting" the mental formation "Beyuktemni/hunter" contains conceptual, figurative and value components. These elements are investigated with the usage of lexicographic material and recordings of authentic texts from native speakers. The Evenki hunter is a recognizable image of the representatives of the Tungus culture, and he is the culture of his ethnos. The combination of lexical units denoting the hunter characterizes not only figurative, but also conceptual and value attributes of the concept in question. The presence of root bases denoting hunting and found in all the TungusManchzhurian languages testifies to its primordiality among the Tungus.

TI  - A Low-Power, Ambiguous Synthetic Aperture Radar Concept for Continuous Ship Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the design of a low-cost synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for a single dedicated application, namely illegal vessel detection, which can be implemented using a small satellite and is characterized by reduced transmit power and high resolution. Minimum requirements in terms of noise equivalent sigma zero and resolution that ensure acceptable detection performance are derived on the basis of ship statistics extracted from TerraSAR-X data. One peculiarity of the design is that a pulse repetition frequency much smaller than the nominal Doppler bandwidth is selected to increase the swath width beyond the classical SAR limitation without using digital beamforming, as the azimuth ambiguities can be tolerated for this specific application. Several design examples of SAR systems operating in X-band demonstrate the potential of this concept for small ship monitoring over swaths of 50-90 km with antennas smaller than 0.6 m(2) and very low average transmit powers comprised between 20 and 80 W.

AB  - Purpose. Using the satellite and ground-based monitoring, as well as the results of modeling the atmosphere dynamics, a long-range transport of smoke aerosol was comprehensively studied.Methods and Results. The period of multiple and intense fires recorded in Western Siberia near the Kazakhstan border in May, 2021 was considered. To analyze the scales and locations of the most active fires during the period under consideration, the satellite monitoring maps from the FIRMS system archives were used. Being analyzed, the satellite images showed the smoke transfer on May, 9 and 10 towards the Middle Urals that was confirmed by photometric measurements at the AERONET aerial ash monitoring station. The results of modeling the air mass back transfer performed due to the HYSPLIT software were represented to confirm smoke transport from the Urals. On May, 11 a cyclone was formed over the territory of the Volgograd region, its periphery just covered the Urals region. This fact contributed to the smoke aerosol transfer towards Finland at a distance exceeding 4000 km via the Black Sea region. The basic information on the stages of the cyclonic vorticity formation and the smoke aerosol transport was obtained from the MODIS Aqua, VIIRS and CALIPSO satellite platforms. Based on the VIIRS satellite data, the dynamics of the surface layer temperature variability and the chlorophyll a concentration in the zone of the maximum wind impact in the Black Sea region before and after the cyclone passage were analyzed. The main optical and microphysical characteristics of the atmosphere aerosol for the period under study were also analyzed using the data from a portable sun photometer and the AERONET stationary ones.Conclusions. A number of specific meteorological conditions which developed in May, 2021 promoted accumulation of the smoke aerosol in the atmosphere of the Middle Urals and its subsequent transport, first, to the Black Sea region and then - towards Finland.

M3  - Article
AB  - This issue on the image of plant in the traditional Mordovian culture illustrates its verbal representation in the Moksha and Erzya folklore of different genres, gives information about the peculiarities of its explication in Mordovian literature and applied and decorative arts, shows the place of the plant images in the Mordovian worldview. The image of plant in the folk arts influences the artistic principals of Mordvins, passed down from generation to generation.The image of a tree is one of the traditional symbols in Mordovian folk culture. This symbol is polysemantic. It is common for Mordovian songs about maidenhood, beauty and youth to use the images of plants and trees. Also, the images of fructiferous trees and their fruits are used to describe the people's appearance in oral tradition. Basically the cultivated trees, such as apple tree and bird cherry, are used. Evergreen trees are less popular than leafy ones. The form of a tree, its colour and other peculiarities are used to create a poetic image. The article pays a lot of attention to the sacral meaning of the plant image and the ways of its correlation with a person. Perception of folklore works through the plant images makes it possible to better understand the Mordovian worldview. As well as the semiotic system of other Finno-Ugrians of Russia, Mordovian semiotic system used to evolutionize without significant changes in the basic vision of the world. Mythological thinking, based on the pagan worldviews, facilitated developing of archetypes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite images presents an important data source for many applications related to remote sensing. An effective image restoration method is proposed to fill the missing information in the satellite images. The segmentation of satellite images to find the SLIC super pixels and then to find the image segments. The boundary reconstruction is performed using edge matching to find the area of the missing region. Peak signal to noise ratio and root mean square error are used with boundary reconstruction and without boundary reconstruction to evaluate the quality and the error rate of the satellite images. The results show the capability to predict the missing values accurately in terms of quality, time without need of external information. The values for PSNR has changed from 25 to 90, and RMSE has changed from 180 to 4 in Red Channel of an image. This indicates that the quality of the image is high, and the error rate is low.

TI  - Transformation of Decor from Pre-Scythian to Early Scythian Horse Harness: a Change in Worldview Images
T2  - STRATUM PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the transformation of ornament on the elements of horse equipment from the final stage of the pre-Scythian period to the beginning of the early Scythian. At the finale, classical Novocherkassk stage of the pre-Scythian period, some dramatic changes in art take place. In the traditional environment of pre-Scythian geometric art of southern Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 7th century BC, an absolutely alien system of zoomorphic images-signs is suddenly introduced. These changes occur against the background of the emergence of new types of bridle sets and some categories of weapons of Central Asian-Siberian origin, which form the "Zhabotin" military-horseman assemblage, fundamentally different from the previously existing "Novocherkassk". As a result, it launches the process of fundamental changes in the social code of various groups of the pre-Scythian population of southern Eastern Europe. "Novocherkassk-Zhabotin" syncretic assemblage appears, some elements of which can be traced in the archaeological sites of the Kelermes stage of the early Scythian period not earlier than the last quarter of the 7th century BC.

TI  - Using Landsat Imagery to Study Spatio-Temporal Relationship between Surface Temperature and Energy Consumption: A Case Study of a Public University Campus
T2  - COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (I3CE)
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - It is estimated that colleges and universities in the United States spend an average of more than a dollar per square foot on electricity annually that corresponds to large recurring expenditures. As university campuses continue to grow, it causes an increase in the energy demand impacting the land surface temperature. Energy audits of campuses are performed annually; however, they are mostly manual and require physical inspections that are time and resource-intensive. The technological advancement in satellite imagery provides an environment that can acquire rich, meaningful information in a time- and cost-effective manner. This study utilizes a medium-size urban campus in the United States with a hot and dry climate as a case study to evaluate the relationship between energy consumption intensity and land surface temperature using the remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) tools. The study aims to explore the variations in total energy and cooling energy demand on campus due to changes in land surface temperature over the past five years. The study will help in better understanding the micro-climate changes as well as the thermal behavior of the campus landscape to identify hotspots. The results of this study will provide the basis for decision-makers to better understand energy consumption patterns on campus and adopt effective mitigation measures to save energy and ultimately reduce the carbon footprint of the campus.

AB  - Multi-image super-resolution from multi-temporal satellite acquisitions of a scene has recently enjoyed great success thanks to new deep learning models. In this paper, we go beyond classic image reconstruction at a higher resolution by studying a super-resolved inference problem, namely semantic segmentation at a spatial resolution higher than the one of sensing platform. We expand upon recently proposed models exploiting temporal permutation invariance with a multi-resolution fusion module able to infer the rich semantic information needed by the segmentation task. The model presented in this paper has recently won the AI4EO challenge on Enhanced Sentinel 2 Agriculture.

TI  - Near-Surface Atmospheric Behavior over Complex Tropical Topography in Puerto Rico Dominated by Seasonal Patterns Despite Frequent Environmental Changes
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding near-surface atmospheric behavior in the tropics is imperative given the role of tropical energy fluxes in Earth's climate cycles, but this area is complicated by a land-atmosphere interaction that includes rugged topography, seasonal weather drivers, and frequent environmental disturbances. This study examines variation in near-surface atmospheric behaviors in northeastern Puerto Rico using a synthesis of data from lowland and montane locations under different land covers (forest, urban, and rural) during 2008-21, when a severe drought, large hurricanes (Irma and Maria), and the COVID-19 mobility-reducing lockdown occurred. Ceilometer, weather, air quality, radiosonde, and satellite data were analyzed for annual patterns and monthly time series of data and data correlations. The results showed a system that is strongly dominated by easterly trade winds transmitting regional oceanic patterns over terrain. Environmental disturbances affected land-atmosphere interaction for short time periods after events. Events that reduce the land signature (reducing greenness: e.g., drought and hurricanes, or reducing land pollution: e.g., COVID-19 lockdown) were evidenced to strengthen the transmission of the oceanic pattern. The most variation in near-surface atmospheric behavior was seen in the mountainous areas that were influenced by both factors: trade winds, and terrain-induced orographic lifting. As an exception to the rest of the near-surface atmospheric behavior, pollutants other than ozone did not correlate positively or negatively with stronger trade winds at all sites across the region. Instead, these pollutants were hypothesized to be more anthropogenically influenced. Once COVID-19 lockdown had persisted for 3 months, urban pollution decreased and cloud base may have increased.

AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node harvesting is an essential step in the surgical treatment of a growing number of malignancies. Various techniques are available to facilitate this purpose. The present study reports a new laparoscopic technique for lymph node harvesting using magnetic nanoparticles containing a superparamagnetic iron-oxide core and dextran coating. This study assesses the clinical relevance of the prototype and provides input for further technological development on the way to clinical implementation. Methods: A laparoscopic differential magnetometer prototype was built, utilizing a nonlinear detection principle (differential magnetometry) for magnetic identification of lymph nodes. The iron content sensitivity, depth & spatial sensitivity, and angular sensitivity were analyzed to investigate clinical options. Results: The minimum detectable amount of iron was 9.8 mu g at a distance of 1 mm. The detection depth was 5, 8, and 10 mm for samples containing 126, 252, and 504 mu g iron, respectively. The maximum lateral detection distance was 5, 7, and 8 mm for samples containing 126, 252, and 504 mu g iron, respectively. A sample containing 504 mu g iron was detectable at all angulations assessed (0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees). Conclusion: The laparoscopic differential magnetometer demonstrates promising results for further investigation and development towards laparoscopic lymph node harvesting using magnetic nanoparticles. Significance: The laparoscopic differential magnetometer facilitates a novel method for sentinel lymph node harvesting, which helps to determine prognosis and treatment of cancer patients.

AB  - For the study of recent military landscapes, remote sensing data hold great potential. Light Detecting And Ranging (LiDAR) is a relatively new technique for most archaeologists. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), derived from LiDAR-data, can be useful to map archaeological sites to get a better overview of what is left and how these remains should be protected and researched further. LiDAR-based DEMs can be extremely useful to conflict archaeologists, especially in the Netherlands, where the excavation of WWII-related remains is often problematic. DEMs help archaeologists come to an indication of both the archaeological and the heritage value of a conflict site. By means of LiDAR-based DEMs, sites or even entire landscapes of conflict can be perfectly identified.

TI  - Deriving the maximum extent and hydroperiod of open water from Sentinel-2 imagery for global sustainability and biodiversity reporting for wetlands
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of wetland extent is a global imperative, considering loss of ecosystem services and conservation value. To date, the understanding of the variation in the extent of lacustrine (inundated) wetlands has been limited, based on intermittently available, coarse-scale imagery. The aim of this study was to assess the capabilities of the freely available Sentinel-2 sensor in monitoring inundated wetlands. In particular, to demonstrate the ability to determine the maximum extent of inundation for reporting on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 15.1 (i.e., halting biodiversity loss), the functional diversity and the hydrological regime of depressions were explored in the Mpumalanga Lake District (MLD) of South Africa. Using the monthly inundation data derived from Sentinel-2 images between January 2016 and May 2018, the results showed that the maximum extent of open water can be successfully reported for SDG 6.6. Lacustrine wetlands constituted about 47 of the 416 (but 66% of the total areal extent of) depressions in the MLD, while others were predominantly palustrine (vegetated). The functional diversity varied from predominantly (61% of the extent of) inundated depressions to seasonally (3%) inundated depressions. The Sentinel-2 sensor was able to detect intra- and inter-annual variation of the extent of inundation, making it suitable to monitor these wetlands for global and climate change impacts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is a clinical program providing training, a monthly stipend, and other services to caregivers of qualifying post-9/11 veterans with service-related injuries. Veteran-caregiver discharge from the program occurs when veteran recovery is achieved, participation is no longer in the veteran's best interest, or caregiving ceases. Public scrutiny about potentially inappropriate discharges resulted in a nationwide freeze on all discharges. PCAFC expanded to pre-9/11 veterans in October 2020; thus, lessons learned can continue to inform the expanded program. We pursued 3 objectives: (1) describe the discharge rate, reasons for discharge, and veteran and caregiver characteristics by discharge status; (2) identify factors associated with discharge from PCAFC nationally; and (3) characterize network variation in discharge predictors.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using VA administrative data from fiscal year (FY) 2011 to FY 2017.METHODS: Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined factors associated with PCAFC discharge among veterans and caregivers enrolled in PCAFC during FY 2011 to FY 2016.RESULTS: A total of 40.5% of all participants were discharged. Nonspouse caregivers and those applying in later years had the highest rates of discharge; spouse caregivers and those applying in earlier years had the lowest rates of discharge. In 4 of 18 networks, caregivers of Black veterans faced higher rates of discharge compared with caregivers of White veterans, and in 1 network, they faced lower rates of discharge. Substantial variability in rates of discharge was also observed across Veterans Integrated Service Networks.CONCLUSIONS: Training on clinically appropriate discharge criteria could improve practice and increase equity.

TI  - Environmental heterogeneity explains contrasting plant species richness between the South African Cape and southwestern Australia
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Aim: To assess whether a difference in species richness per unit area between two mediterranean-type biodiversity hotspots is explained by differences in environmental heterogeneity. Location: The Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa (GCFR) and Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). Taxon: Vascular plants (tracheophytes). Methods: Comparable, geospatially explicit environmental and species occurrence data were obtained for both regions and used to generate environmental heterogeneity and species richness raster layers. Heterogeneity in multiple environmental variables and species richness per unit area were compared between the two regions at a range of spatial scales. At each scale, richness was also regressed against these individual axes and against a major axis of heterogeneity, derived by principal component analysis (PCA). Results: The GCFR is generally more environmentally heterogeneous and species-rich than the SWAFR. Species richness per unit area is significantly related to the major axis of heterogeneity across both regions, the latter describing ca. 38-50% of overall heterogeneity, the slope of this relationship differing between the two regions only at the finest spatial scale. Multivariate regressions, and regressions against the first axes of the PCAs (PC1), revealed variations in the dependence of species richness on environmental heterogeneity between the two regions. Main conclusions: Notwithstanding some region-specific effects, we present evidence of a common positive relationship between floristic richness and environmental heterogeneity across the GCFR and SWAFR. This is dependent on spatial scale, being strongest at the coarsest level of sampling. The generally greater richness per unit area of the GCFR compared to the SWAFR is thus explained by the former's generally greater environmental heterogeneity and is concordant with its greater levels of floristic turnover.

Heterogeneity in multiple environmental variables and species richness per unit area were compared between the two regions at a range of spatial scales. At each scale, richness was also regressed against these individual axes and against a major axis of heterogeneity, derived by principal component analysis (PCA). Species occurrence data cleaning [Taken from Supporting Information] Firstly, we retained only records identified to the species level, and ignored intraspecific taxa. This resulted in the retention of 14,147 and 8,912 unique species names for the GCFR and SWAFR, respectively. The R package "taxize"(Chamberlain et al., 2016)was then used to query each species name against two major taxonomic databases, the Global Name Resolver (GNR) and the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS;Boyle et al., 2013). Where either or both databases returned a match for a name, the name was retained; where not, it was excluded. Although the number of species thus excluded is high (GCFR: 692; SWAFR: 1,171), the geographically random distribution of the records associated with these names suggests that exclusion of these names will not significantly influence spatial patterns of species richness. In order to ensure that no species were listed under multiple synonyms, the retained names were then queried against the Tropicos and Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) for known synonyms, again using "taxize". We then removed all records of species identified as non-native, using lists of invasive plants for South Africa and Australia from the IUCN's Global Invasive Species Database (http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/). Finally, we removed species with fewer than five total collection records in total, in order to exclude collections with potentially low-confidence identifications. This, and the exclusion of occurrence data originating from coastal pixels at the 0.05° resolution,brought the total number of species in each region down to 9,419 and 6,696 in the GCFR and SWAFR respectively. Species richness data [Taken from main text] To compare vascular plant species richness between the GCFR and SWAFR, geospatially explicit occurrence records of tracheophytes from within the borders of each region were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; Table S1). Occurrence data were cleaned using the "taxize" package(Chamberlain et al., 2016)for R(R Core Team, 2019)that was also used for all other analyses (see Supporting Information). Despite spatial variability in collection effort in both regions, we used raw species counts to estimate QDS-scale species richness on the basis that the application of rarefaction techniques severely distorts known richness patterns when applied to the South African flora (Cramer and Verboom, 2016). The final numbers of unique species thus identified as occurring in the GCFR and SWAFR, respectively, were 9,419 and 6,696.To ensure that species richness was compared and decomposed (see below) across equally sized area units, we included only squares comprising four constituent sub-squares (e.g. four QDS in an HDS). While this resulted in the loss of several coastal squares, which is unfortunate because the coastal floras of both the GCFR and SWAFR are rich in endemic taxa, it is not expected to introduce any systematic biases. Overall, we retained 362 of ca. 449 QDS in the GCFR and 624 of ca. 737 in the SWAFR (ca. 81% and 85% sampling, respectively). The cleaned species occurrence record data were collated into QDS, HDS and DS (sensuLarsen et al., 2009). In addition, following the additive decomposition(Veech et al., 2002)of Whittaker's(1960)gamma-diversity, we decomposed the species richness of each HDS (SHDS) and DS (SDS)into itsalpha("plot" richness) andbeta(turnover) components, asthe average species richness of the four constituent squares in each HDS and DS, respectively, andTQDSandTHDSrepresent the residual (i.e. turnover-based)betarichness, determined asgammaalpha.

To compare environmental heterogeneity between the GCFR and SWAFR, we acquired a suite of nine geospatially-explicit environmental variables [table above]in the form of raster layers to represent topographic (elevation), climatic (surface temperature, T; mean annual precipitation, MAP; precipitation in the driest quarter, PDQ), edaphic (clay content; soil carbon, C; pH; cation exchange capacity, CEC) and vegetational gradients (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). Wherever possible, we made use of remote sensing derived layers that are comparable between the two regions. As far as possible (see Supporting Information), these variables were selected to represent environmental axes which are considered regionally important and independent (Figure S1-3). Soil variables were summarized as depth-interval weighted averages and climatic and spectral variables as annual means using the "raster" package for R(Hijmans, 2016). All layers were then projected to a common coordinate reference system (WGS84) using the "rgdal" package(Bivand et al., 2017)and resampled bilinearly to 0.05 resolution. In order to quantify heterogeneity in these environmental variables, we developed an index that would account for the spatial configuration of environmental conditions. Making use of raster data, this employs nested squares at various spatial scales(see Supporting Information). We quantified the environmental heterogeneity of a given square (i.e. 0.10°*0.10°-, QDS-, HDS- and DS-scale) as the variance of the environmental conditions of its four sub-squares (i.e. 0.05°*0.05°-, eighth-degree square-, QDS- and HDS-scale). Since our index measures within-square heterogeneity at each spatial scale, it can be related directly to species richness at the QDS-, HDS- and DS-scales. We used principal components analysis (PCA), applied to the nine environmental variables across both regions, to extract a major axis of environmental heterogeneity. For this purpose, the layers describing heterogeneity in the nine environmental variables at each spatial scale were first log10-transformed to ensure normality. A separate PCA was then run at the four spatial scales. The first axis (PC1) from each represents a major axis of heterogeneity across the nine environmental heterogeneity variables considered (see Figure S4). Copyright: MIT License Open Access

AB  - Aim: To assess whether a difference in species richness per unit area between two mediterranean-type biodiversity hotspots is explained by differences in environmental heterogeneity. Location: The Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa (GCFR) and Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). Taxon: Vascular plants (tracheophytes). Methods: Comparable, geospatially explicit environmental and species occurrence data were obtained for both regions and used to generate environmental heterogeneity and species richness raster layers. Heterogeneity in multiple environmental variables and species richness per unit area were compared between the two regions at a range of spatial scales.

Relying on the theories of the linguistic world mapping and the linguistic personality, as well as on many years of experience in teaching Russian as a foreign language, the authors draw conclusions about the need to rethink the teaching objectives and shift the focus to methods and techniques that open a new linguistic world view to the student, since the development of a secondary linguistic personality is based on it.The starting point is the idea that the native speaker acquires the national culture by means of their native language and the language specific world view, so that the key goal of the foreign language teaching methodology should be the search for methods and techniques for developing the student's perceptual ability to comprehend the specificity of world mapping in the language studied, with the purpose of attaining such a level in foreign language acquisition as thinking in this language. The authors see the main goal of any foreign language course, starting with the elementary one, to be the formation of a secondary linguistic personality which makes the student ready for the intercultural dialogue. Everything else should be subordinated to this goal as particular tasks and steps on the way up to it.The authors claim that the methods and techniques that are supposed, in accordance with the main goal of foreign language teaching, to teach how "to perform speech acts" in a new language, should be aimed at the formation of a secondary linguistic personality that can express themselves and comprehend the interlocutors' intentions in the intercultural dialogue; and create and perceive oral and written texts on different aspects of life and of varying degrees of complexity, depth, and accuracy without translation. A secondary linguistic personality is a dynamic, constantly evolving construct that is built on top of the already existing linguistic personality, embracing and using all the existing cognitive settings and expanding their potential.These structures are not parallel, but closely interrelated at the levels of Lexicon, Thesaurus, Pragmaticon, and discursive competence. The ability to fully participate in the intercultural dialogue is an indicator of the complete formation of the secondary linguistic

TI  - From Short to Longer Term Contracts: Factors Affecting Participation in Farmland Longer Rentals in Razan County, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although it has some benefits, short-term farmland rental transactions have had negative consequences such as excessive use of water, overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and farmland degradation. Why are landowners more engaged in short-term land rental contracts and less involved in longer rental contracts, that are more associated with incentives to invest and sustainably use farmland? Based on a post positivist worldview, the present study has chosen a quantitative approach and used a survey strategy to explore factors affecting the participation of landholders in longer farmland rental markets. Using multi-stage sampling, 250 landholders in Razan County who had rented their land, at least once in the past five years, were selected. The study indicated that the landholders' motivations to rent out their farmlands changed by their place of residence (rural/urban). The identified barriers and drivers that require policy attention broadly focus on the security of farmland property rights, competence of tenants and kinship contracts, high risk and profitability of farming activities, and capital constraints in rural areas.

TI  - THE ROMANTIC ORIGINS OF ODOEVSKY'S PEDAGOGICAL IDEAS: ON THE QUESTION OF SENSUAL AND RATIONAL COGNITION
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article I analyze the pedagogical ideas of V.F. Odoevsky in their connection with the Romantic ideas about the world and man. The main interest for me here is the connection between the sensual and rational aspects in the process of cognition. Despite the impossibility of a direct comparison of ideas, it is possible to draw parallels through the question of cognition and the concept of education as it was understood by the Romantics (Novalis in particular) and as it is presented and realized in the pedagogical works of V.F. Odoevsky.The influence of Romanticism on Odoevsky can be summarized in the following points:1) in the outlook, associated with the focus on the individual characteristics of man and child in the pedagogical process. Romanticism actualized in the history of thought the value of the individual. The concrete man and the phenomena of his being become more and more often a material for philosophical research. The focus on the human being increases its value, as well as the need to actualize the individual characteristics of each individual. In connection with this worldview approach, the view of education is also shifting.The goal of preschool education according to Odoevsky is related to the formation and preparation of the apparatus of thinking, which he calls the "spiritual apparatus". The formation of understanding in a child is the possibility of manifestation of the individual in him.2) in the understanding that education is self-education in the first place. Odoevsky appeals in many ways to the independence of the child. Indeed, if education is perceived as a transfer of knowledge, it will turn out that the child will always be in a dependent position on the teacher without the skill of forming ideas and the desire to analyze and compare facts independently. In Novalis this aspect is expressed in that "without perfect self-understanding a true understanding of others cannot be achieved".3) in the understanding of the correlation between the rational and the sensual in the process of cognition. Despite the lack of obvious continuity between Odoevsky's pedagogical ideas and the Romantics, one can trace the Romantic source of his reflections: following the Romanticists, he reflects on the theme of thinking and feeling. However, if Romanticism strove to overcome the Enlightenment dictate of thinking, putting sensibility in the foreground, Odoevsky goes further and does not try to think them in opposition. This is indicated by his pedagogical position on the development of thinking in the period of the prevalence of emphasized sensuality in human life, in the period of childhood.

AB  - Basal and superficial displacements of two landslides in overconsolidated clayey soils are being monitored by inclinometers and GPS since 2005, and in some parts of the slope since the 1990s. The mostly North-South (N-S) orientation of the landslide displacements makes monitoring by satellite interferometry a challenging problem. To solve it, COSMO-SkyMed Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) data were analyzed at the scale for which inclinometers and GPS provide clear indication of displacement directions, thus allowing a confident use also of ERS and Envisat data. The kinematic history of the last 20 years of the urbanized area of the landslides was thus reconstructed even where ground-based displacement series were available over short periods or not available at all. The effectiveness of the remedial measures adopted in the area on displacement rates was also evaluated.

AB  - The Yasuni National Park (YNP) is a protected area recognized by its biodiversity of flora and fauna. It corresponds to a territory that houses ancestral wealth, and in the last decades has been affected by the presence of anthropogenic activities that have altered the forest cover of the region. The present study proposes the exploration of the land cover inside the YNP during the year 2019. The study was processed in three stages. The first stage corresponds to the recollection and preparation of data using the Google Earth Engine platform, aiming to build a mosaic of Sentinel2 satellite images. The second stage was based on the land cover classification using the Random Forest algorithm. The third stage focused on the postprocessing of the classified raster using the ArcGIS-Pro Software. The results revealed human activity taking place inside the YNP, represented by the construction of new roads, settlements, and engineering constructions.

AB  - Measuring the predictability and complexity of time series using entropy is an essential tool for designing and controlling a nonlinear system in the remote sensing field. However, the existing methods have some drawbacks related to their strong dependence on method parameters. To overcome these difficulties, this study proposes a new method for estimating the two-dimensional neural network entropy (NNetEn2D) for evaluating the regularity or predictability of images using the LogNNet neural network model.

AB  - Recent advances in satellite technology and the introduction of the Space-Data-as-a-Service business models are attracting interest for using the platform in a wide range of applications that include earth observations, 5G integration, aeronautical and maritime tracking and communications, asset tracking, sensor data collection, among others. In this new scenario, it becomes of interest not only selecting a ground station provider based on the monetary cost, but also the download features with prevailing atmospheric conditions to achieve high reliability and low data delivery latency. To this end, the Cognitive Space Gateway approach is used to route data bundles in a Ground Station-as-a-Service context with multiple providers to find a suitable balance between data latency and the ground station monetary costs, exploiting as possible site-diversity when available. The approach is tested experimentally using NASA's High-Rate Delay-Tolerant Networking (HDTN).

TI  - Fauna in the Poetic Worldview of Gavrila Derzhavin
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal images are ubiquitous in Gavrila Derzhavin's poetry and can be found in works belonging to different stages of his career. This article studies issues connected with the functions that the world of fauna performs in his works and aims to find out whether it evolves over time. The image of the swan in his Horatian ode of the same name (1808) is considered a symbol of the poet's immortality, and unpublished poems on the death of a dog an expression of the burlesque direction in Derzhavin's work. With a view to determining the general typology of animals in Derzhavin's lyrical poetry (with the exception of fables and parables), the article proposes a general classification of animals in order to then turn to a detailed analysis of two little-studied works (The Magnitude of God (Rus. Velichestvo Bozhie) (1789) and Morning (Rus. Utro) (1800). Together with the poems, the author examines the illustrations that accompany them in the Grot edition of Derzhavin's works. His poetic bestiary is very rich in comparison with those of other poets of his time, becoming more and more an integral part of his poetic landscape. According to Derzhavin's aesthetic concept, poetry should depict "shining and lively pictures, with nature-like views", including its inhabitants from the world of fauna. However, this function changes at different stages of the poet's work and varies depending on the genre chosen. Derzhavin refers to animal images for different purposes, from symbolic to humorous; the range of animal images corresponds to the idea of the poem and expresses different approaches to language. Due to an archaisation of his later poetry, animal images become more and more symbolic and myth-like. The variety and range of animal images in Derzhavin's ode Morning connect this work with images of the creation of animals in Western European painting and graphics, primarily with the famous Vatican fresco The Creation of the Animals by Raphael.

TI  - A Sacred Marriage. Hierogamy in the Most Hermetic Art, from Alchemy to <i>The Sacrifice</i>, by Andrei Tarkovsky
T2  - EIKON IMAGO
M3  - Article
AB  - Many cosmogonies see the creation as a hierogamy, a non-dualist cosmogonic mytheme. It can also be found in alchemical engraving books, used in reference to one of the stages of the process, represented in iconography. In that phase, a woman and a man have sexual intercourse, like in the Rosarium Philosophorum. This iconographic type portrays a non-dual worldview, according to which the world needs to link both primary poles. This is achieved with resources inherent to visual art. Alchemy stands out as one of the few currents with a strong non-dual factor in Western schools. Subsequent artists were influenced by this iconography and the ideas represented in it, such as William Blake and surrealists like Leonora Carrington. It is also relevant as one of the most predominant motifs in the style of Andrei Tarkovsky, omnipresent in his work. It is in his last film, The Sacrifice, in which the alchemical universe is most present. In this film, the world is threatened by an apocalyptic Third World War, but a sexual ritual perhaps might reverse the crisis.

TI  - Lava Volume from Remote Sensing Data: Comparisons with Reverse Petrological Approaches for Two Types of Effusive Eruption
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Five effusive eruptions of Piton de la Fournaise (La Reunion) are analyzed to investigate temporal trends of erupted mass and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Daily SO2 emissions are acquired from three ultraviolet (UV) satellite instruments (the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)) and an array of ground-based UV spectrometers (Network for Observation of Volcanic and Atmospheric Change (NOVAC)). Time-averaged lava discharge rates (TADRs) are obtained from two automatic satellite-based hot spot detection systems: MIROVA and MODVOLC. Assuming that the lava volumes measured in the field are accurate, the MIROVA system gave the best estimation of erupted volume among the methods investigated. We use a reverse petrological method to constrain pre-eruptive magmatic sulfur contents based on observed SO2 emissions and lava volumes. We also show that a direct petrological approach using SO2 data might be a viable alternative for TADR estimation during cloudy weather that compromises hot spot detection. In several eruptions we observed a terminal increase in TADR and SO2 emissions after initial emission of evolved degassed magma. We ascribe this to input of deeper, volatile-rich magma into the plumbing system towards the end of these eruptions. Furthermore, we find no evidence of volatile excess in the five eruptions studied, which were thus mostly fed by shallow degassed magma.

AB  - Recently, Augmented Reality (AR) applications have emerged as a powerful tool to empower users in touristic use cases, for example, by recreating digital representations of lost or difficult accessible artifacts. More emphasis has been put on researching possible solutions for tourism with AR technology. As part of such a research project, an AR touristic experience was designed to enhance historical artifacts, promote surroundings exploration, and study how to improve the User Experience (UX). This resulted in developing an engaging and interactive cross-platform AR mobile application. The final application includes multiple gamified reward systems, such as collecting points for each artistic/historical spot visited. Users' available time while visiting or exploring was also considered in the design of the experience, so the option to choose between complete and short routes was offered. Following the intended route was supported by instructing the users to collect a sequence of AR coins placed based on GPS functionalities. Despite some limitations, especially given by the GPS feature used to support route navigation, the analysis showed that the developed AR application was evaluated as very good in terms of usability score. This technical limitation was more evident in users that played the experience with old-generation smartphones. The assessment of the developed application has concluded that the attention paid to features, content, and duration of the activity has a positive impact, succeeding both in terms of product results and users' satisfaction.

AB  - Built-up area (BA) mapping is vital for understanding the effect of the urban regions on the environment, thereby supporting sustainable development. This study proposes a new dual-pol radar built-up area index (DpRBI) to detect the BA using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The DpRBI formulation is based on the three Stokes vector elements of the scattered wave derived from the 2 x 2 covariance matrix C-2. This study uses the Sentinel-1 SAR data sets over Milan, Italy and Barcelona, Spain to map the BA using DpRBI. The overall accuracy of the BA extracted using the proposed technique was found to be 84.19% and 87.95% over Milan and Barcelona, respectively. It is noteworthy that even relatively small low-density BA is precisely classified using the proposed built-up index.

AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) classification is critical for management and monitoring of the land surface. Various classification methods, varying from pixel-based, object-based, supervised, unsupervised, machine learning algorithms, etc., are being used with the abundant availability of Sentinel-1 dualpolarized SAR data. However, most of these methods require ample feature space or are based on sophisticated classification methods, increasing computational complexity. Having this in mind, we propose two new parameters R1 and R2 derived from dual-polarized SAR data for LULC classification. It is interesting to note that various land cover clusters are distinctively separable in the R1 and R2 feature space. These two parameters are then used for land cover classification using the simple K-means unsupervised classifier. The classification results are qualitatively assessed with the Google Earth images.

T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the availability of high-resolution data due to sensor technology advancement, it is now easier for researchers and scientists to detect or view the spectral variability of different crops. For this study, Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and Leaf area index (LAI) of the crops Maize (Zea mays), Mustard (Brassica), and pink Lentils (Lens esculenta) under different irrigation and fertilizer treatments have been analyzed. In total, rigorous assessment of 25-hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) at both leaf and canopy level for chlorophyll content, whereas 7-hyperspectral VIs for LAI at canopy level were computed to investigate the robustness of these VIs for LCC and LAI assessment. Variable importance in projection (VIP) using Partial Least Square regression (PLSR) and coefficient of determination (R2) were computed for all the VIs to extract the most sensitive information for the retrieval of LCC and LAI. As a result, the VIs using the red-edge reflectance bands at 705 and 750 nm were found highly responsive to LAI compared to other wavebands. In contrast, the VIs indices made of green (550 nm), red (670, 690, and 700 nm), and red-edge (705, 750 nm) bands were found highly sensitive to the temporal LCC values of lentils and maize crop beds. In addition, the temporal LCC values of Mustard crop beds' were found sensitive to the VIs made of green (550 nm), red (670, 690, and 700 nm), and NIR (800 nm) wavebands. The three VIs having high VIP and R2 values were selected as optimum sets of input to build support vector regression models using radial (SVR-Rad), linear (SVR-Li), polynomial (SVR-Poly), Random Forrest Regression (RFR), Partial least square regression (PLSR), and Hybrid neural fuzzy inference system (HyFIS). The analysis showed that the SVR-Rad model outperformed the SVR-Li, SVR-Poly, RFR, PLSR, and HyFIS models in terms of robustness for biophysical and biochemical parameters retrieval using hyperspectral data.

AB  - The present study estimated mango (Mangifera Indica L.) crop area in two major mango producing districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP) State of India viz., Lucknow and Meerut by using Landsat 8 OLI satellite images. Satellite images covering both districts are classified for mango crop by using knowledge based decision tree classifier (DTC) and acreage is estimated by using DTC classified images. Furthermore, the mango crop area estimated by satellite images is further used to estimate the coefficient of variance (CV) and compound growth rates (CGR) in order to determine the instability and growth rate of area and production of mango crop of Lucknow and Meerut districts of Uttar Pradesh State covering the period from 2013-14 to 2020-21. The result revealed that the Meerut district recorded the highest instability of 6.39% and growth rate of 2.59% in the mango fruit crop area during 8 years period (i.e. 2013-14 to 2020-21). In future, this study may be extended to all main mango crop growing districts of the Uttar Pradesh, which will be useful for policymakers and the government in expansion planning of mango crop area.

TI  - Development of LR-PCA Based Fusion Approach to Detect the Changes in Mango Fruit Crop by Using Landsat 8 OLI Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) is the process of detecting changes from multi-temporal satellite images that have undergone spatial changes due to natural phenomena and/or human-induced activities. Mango is a major fruit crop in India, but detection of changes in mango crops remains a challenging task because the reason that many perennial crops have similar reflectance profiles. Therefore, a potent change detection technique is required for different applications such as the rate of deforestation, urban developments, damage evaluation, and resource monitoring. Compared to annual and seasonal crops, relatively few studies have been conducted on change detection in perennial fruit crops. In this study, a novel log ratio change detection technique (i.e., LR-PCA) is developed using the fusion of log-ratio (LR) and principal component analysis (PCA) images derived from bi-temporal soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) images to extract meaningful information and detect temporal changes in the mango fruit crop areas with high change detection accuracy. The proposed approach comprised two steps: (1) SAVI images from 2015 and 2019 were used to retrieve the log-ratio (LR) and principal component (PC) images, respectively, and both the images were fused by applying the pixel-by-pixel fusion approach. (2) Fused images were classified into three classes: "positive change", "no change", and "negative change" using a derived threshold value. The results show that the LR-PCA method of change detection yields a high change detection accuracy of 92% in comparison with the other change detection methods viz. vegetation image differencing, image ratioing, PCA, and log-ratio. To validate the adaptability of the proposed algorithm, experiments with two sets of bi-temporal SAVI indices images belonging to the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh State determine that the proposed change detection method performs well as compared to the existing individual methods for detection of changes in mango fruit crop. The proposed method is expected to be useful for detecting changes in the area of perennial crops. In the future, an accurate and efficient change detection analysis may be helpful for developing a real-time mango fruit crop monitoring system at the national level.

AB  - With the advancement in technology in recent years, the interest of researchers, policymakers, and authorities associated with the evaluation of disasters has increased tremendously. This has become a helping hand to those, who are directly or indirectly involved in the rescue and management process during the disaster. The tropical cyclone is one of the major natural disasters that may affect the 7516 km-long coastlines of India. It is accompanied by destructive wind, high waves, and torrential rain leading to severe storm surges and floods. The objective of this research is to determine the track of tropical cyclones. The challenge associated with this task is that various parameters such as wind speed and vertical wind shear affect the path of the tropical cyclone. Therefore, the motivation of this research is to determine the path of the tropical cyclone by computing the centroid of the relative cloud cluster and taking into account the other relevant parameters. It may help us in near future to predict the path of the cyclone in advance which gives an advantage to local authorities to trigger an early warning in order to minimize the loss in terms of economy and life.

AB  - We present the validation of surface reflectance from Sentinel-2 (S2) produced by LaSRC (Land Surface Reflectance Code) using an automated camera system (CAMSIS). The system is composed of four cameras (470, 550, 650, and 850nm wavelengths), and a motorized reference (50% reflectance) calibration target. CAMSIS is installed 120m above ground on a TV tower (WLEF) near Park Falls, Wisconsin, and captures data every 15 minutes. Surface reflectance and NDVI computed from CAMSIS calibrated data show good agreement when compared to observations from Sentinel-2. These results show good performance of LaSRC atmospheric correction.

TI  - Micropapillary Breast Carcinoma: From Molecular Pathogenesis to Prognosis
T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast is an infrequent type of breast cancer often discussed for its potency for lymphovascular invasion and difficulty in accurate imaging estimation. Micropapillary carcinomas are noted to be present as larger tumors, of higher histological grade and a notably higher percentage of disease-positive lymph nodes. Hormonal and HER-2 positivity in IMPC is also commoner when compared to other NST carcinomas. IMPC occurs either as a pure form or more often as a component of mixed Non-Specific Type (NST) carcinoma. The latest data suggest that despite having comparable survival rates to other histological subtypes of breast carcinoma, effective surgical treatment often requires extended surgical margins and vigilant preoperative axillary staging due to an increased incidence of lymph node invasion, and locoregional recurrence. Moreover, the presence of micropapillary in situ components within tumors also seems to alter tumor aggression and influence the nodal disease stage. In this review, we present an overview of the current literature of micropapillary carcinoma of the breast from biology to prognosis, focusing on biological differences and treatment.

TI  - A rare case of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast
T2  - MENOPAUSE REVIEW-PRZEGLAD MENOPAUZALNY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is a rare, distinct histological subtype of breast carcinoma. While micropapillary histological architecture is found in up to 2???8% of all breast cancers, pure micropapillary carcinoma is infrequent and comprises 0.9???2% of breast carcinomas. Invasive micropapillary carcinoma is emerging as an oncological and surgical challenge due to a plethora of characteristics that constitute this histological pattern ??? interestingly, both elusive and aggressive. We present the case of a woman presenting with IMPC, who was primarily treated with tumour and lymph node marking, followed by primary systemic therapy (PST), and consequent oncoplastic surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Our case report outlines the importance of awareness of histological subtypes in breast cancer by focusing on a case report of IMPC. The breast surgeon must be aware of the lymphotropic behaviour of this subtype and the high prevalence of lymph node involvement in such patients, and therefore focus on rigorous axillary assessment. One must not forget that, despite having a more aggressive biological profile, IMPC has demonstrated no difference in survival when compared to other histological subtypes, and treatment should conform to international guidelines with an emphasis on nodal staging.

TI  - Impact of the closure of a coal district on the environmental issue of long-term surface movements
T2  - AIMS GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental impact of deep underground coal mines using the longwall mining method is diverse, e.g., short- and long-term subsidence, damage to surface infrastructure, disturbance of the hydrogeological conditions, and the quality of groundwater and surface water. The study presented focusses on the long-term surface movements after the closure of an entire coal district. Due to the flooding of the underground infrastructure and rock mass, an upward surface movement or uplift is observed. For a specific site in the Campine coal district, Belgium results are presented of satellite data (radar-interferometry). However, the main aim of the study is to better understand the process of uplift and to determine the various mechanisms that are involved. For this purpose, an analytical framework was developed recently, and it was applied successfully in a relatively easy case. The case study of the paper is more challenging, but the usefulness of the analytical framework is clearly confirmed. The most important conclusions are that (i) the uplift is induced by an increase in water pressure after the closure, i.e., re-establishing the original hydraulic gradient, (ii) the expansion of both the goaf volumes and the volumes of the non-collapsed rock mass must be considered, and (iii) the assumption of a linear decrease of water pressure variation from the top to the bottom of the mined area at the end of the mining phase provides the most realistic results. However, the next step in the analysis should focus on a more advanced hydrogeological model of the complex underground environment.

AB  - One of the most significant obstacles of extracting information from satellite optical imagery is the presence of clouds. Reconstructing the original signal from the missing data is an essential task of a multi-temporal image analysis to monitor dynamic phenomena, e.g. crop growth and phenology, weather/climate changes, disaster evolution, land use/cover change, and others. Generally, two operations are performed: 1. identification of the cloudy pixels (generation of a cloud mask); 2. reconstruction with cloud-free pixels, derived or estimated from past/future cloud-free acquisitions (e.g. generation of a composite image). This article presents a review of the main cloud detection methods and discusses advantages and disadvantages of the replacement of cloudy pixels with cloud-free ones. We propose a new smoothing function; it performs the above two steps in one-pass operation thus simplifying the processing chain. A comparative analysis versus other methods and a sensitivity study are documented.

TI  - A New Modality For Breast Cancer Diagnosis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Report
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Organized screening for breast cancer (BC) was suspended in most countries of the world during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, frequently performed in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, may detect asymptomatic breast abnormalities. A 72-year-old patient, with a severe form of COVID-19 underwent a diagnostic CT scan. This led to the unexpected discovery, at an early stage, of a 12 mm, high grade, Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive BC, with a high proliferation index. After responding to chemotherapy, she was managed with conservative breast surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Delayed management of BC can be responsible for poor outcomes. Patients with severe forms of COVID-19 are also at risk for developing BC due to common risk factors. Thirty percent of incidental breast lesions discovered on CT scans are undiagnosed BC. Careful study of the mammary glands on CT scan of patients with COVID-19 may allow early diagnosis of a malignant tumor in a high-risk population for BC and deprived of routine screening mammography.

TI  - <i>Lumieres</i> in shade: Enlightened projects and communitarian conflict in the Basque Country (1748-1833)
T2  - REVISTA DE HISTORIA MODERNA-ANALES DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DE ALICANTE
M3  - Article
AB  - We will focus on the impact of the reformist projects linked to Enlightened and scientific ideas in the Basque country between the second half of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th. As an introduction, we will summarize the social profile of the local elites who shared those ideas and developed worldviews that were substantially different to the ones rooted in their communities. These elites belonged to a group of families taking part in the new Bourbon administrative State, in sheer contrast with other families of the privileged classes, as well as with the bulk of the popular sectors, who lived to a greater or lesser extent isolated from this reality. In this context, transformative initiatives provoked a rejection that we will try to study by means of three phenomena: the different attitudes towards variolic inoculation depending on the socio-professional milieu that we can detect in a case taking place in Fuenterrabia (Guipuzcoa) in 1791; the qualms found to the replacement of burials inside the churches by those in outside cemeteries as they are exposed in an anonymous letter at the beginning of the 19th century and, finally, the last trials concerning witchery in which the popular faith in the supra-natural clashes with the incredulous position of the magistrates in charge of judging them; we will see how, at the dawn of the 19th century witches and healers are persecuted as being considered a risk for public order and swindlers, and not because of their supposed links with evil. Lastly, we will reflect on the meaning of the Basque enlighteners in relation to the social reality where they lived and on how the impact of Enlightened ideas fuelled internal differences into the community to the point of producing an otherness perception between elites and popular groups.

TI  - THE IMMUTABILITY OF THE MOST ALMIGHTY GOD: A Comparative View of His Attribute in the Perspectives of the Writings of the Prophet Malachi and the Writer to the Letter to the Hebrews
T2  - REVELETEO-REVISTA ELECTRONICA ESPACO TEOLOGICO
M3  - Article
AB  - This study dealt with the immutability of the Most High God, through God the Father and God the Son, in a comparative view between the writings of the Book of the Prophet Malachi and the Epistles to the Hebrews. As a question was raised: Is there congruence in the worldviews about the immutability of God between the writings of the Prophet Malachi and the Writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews? In other words, are both authors in line with regard to the immutability of the Most High God? To solve the problem raised, the general objective was to identify whether there is agreement of the theological worldview on the immutability of God between the writings of the Prophet Malachi and the Writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The methodology used was that of a qualitative type of descriptive and bibliographic character. It is concluded that there is a biblical and theological basis to affirm that both writings agree about the immutability of God, but one in the perspective of God the Father and the other in the perspective of God the Son.

TI  - Epidemiological profile and follow-up of patients with pulmonary disease by non-tuberculous mycobacteria in Baixada Santista area, Sao Paulo
T2  - EINSTEIN-SAO PAULO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To present the frequency and species diversity of non-tuberculous mycobacteria, estimate the prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, describe the epidemiological profile, and determine the follow-up of patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease living in a region with a high burden of tuberculosis. Methods: This a retrospective cohort observational study using data records obtained from the Instituto Adolfo Lutz - Santos and from the Sao Paulo Sistema de Vigilancia de Tuberculose do Estado de Sao Paulo in the period between 2000 and 2009. The studied variables were: socio-demographic characteristics, current and past history of tuberculosis, aspects related to diagnosis, and treatment and associated diseases. Results: We included 319 non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolates in the study, corresponding to 257 patients. The species Mycobacterium kansasii (28.5%) and Mycobacterium fortuitum (16.6%) presented the higher occurrence. In 10.9% (24) of the patients, there was a criterion for confirming a case of pulmonary disease due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria. In relation to gender and age, male and individuals over 50 years old were the most frequent. Considering the confirmed cases, 47.8% had a past history of tuberculosis. Conclusion: The lack of information about the cases is evident, since pulmonary disease due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria is not mandatory. The therapeutic regimen according to the identified species is fundamental for success in combating the infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Besides that, information about the regional epidemiology of pulmonary disease caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria and the search for associations with other comorbidities are important to establish the correct treatment. In order to improve surveillance of pulmonary diseases by non-tuberculous mycobacteria, we suggest the implantation of a sentinel surveillance and of population-based studies.

TI  - AN ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IN A RANDOM FOREST TIME SERIES CLASSIFICATION TO MAP THE FOREST AND DEFORESTATION IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - Remote sensing has been an essential tool in combating deforestation. However, the ever-rising deforestation rates require new remote sensing techniques. This paper presents a study to determine the effects on the accuracy of the data analysis of varying the number of satellite observations, using a Random Forest classification algorithm. We carried out experiments on the Landsat-8 data cube with 22 images and developed an automatic sampling system based on PRODES to generate the labeled time series. We split the time series dataset to build data subsets with different number of observations. The results showed that a fewer number of observations negatively effects the accuracy of the RF algorithm when analyzing deforested areas, but not forest areas. The RF classifiers were compared using a random test data set, where all classifiers presented an Overall Accuracy (OA), Balanced Accuracy (BA), and f1 -score (F1) above 97%. In the first evaluation, the variation in the number of observations appears to cause little influence on the classification accuracy. The analysis used the reference map to contrast the RF classifier's results. The results showed that the best results in OA occurred with fewer observations. The best performance of 96% happened with four observations. We evaluated the performance of the classes, deforestation, and forest individually. The results showed that a fewer number of observations had negative effects on the accuracy of the RF algorithm when analyzing deforested areas, but not forest areas. Finally, we evaluated the visual quality of the land cover maps produced.

TI  - MODIS-Based AVHRR Cloud and Snow Separation Algorithm
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term data record (LTDR) has the goal of developing a quality and consistent Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) surface reflectance and albedo products dating back to 1982 at 0.05x00B0; spatial resolution. Distinguishing between cloud and snow is of critical importance when analyzing global albedo trends, for they influence the Earthx2019;s energy balance. However, this task is specially challenging when working with AVHRR given its limited spectral bands. Therefore, the current version of the LTDR does not distinguish between snow and clouds. To this end, we propose the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based AVHRR Class Separation Algorithm (MACSSA), whose goal is to identify clear land and snow pixels using AVHRR data. We make use of a combination of optical and thermal information from satellite and reanalysis data, along with monthly climatology information. These are used as inputs for two different support vector machine (SVM) models, which are then applied to AVHRR data to retrieve the MACSSA predicted tags. These are compared first against reference tags retrieved from the MYD10C1 product over pixels with less than 2-min overpass time difference between MODIS Aqua and NOAA16x2013;19, distributed all around the world, and second against the Climate Change Initiative Cloud (Cloudx005F;cci AVHRR) project. We found the product to be highly accurate in identifying clear land pixels, with a probability of detection of clear pixels (PODclear) of 97x0025;. The discrimination of snow and clouds shows a PODsnow of 89x0025;, which is encouraging given the spectral limitations of the AVHRR sensor.

T2  - Comprehensive R Archive Network
M3  - Software
AB  - With 'satin' functions, visualisation, data extraction and further analysis like producing climatologies from several images, and anomalies of satellite derived ocean data can be easily done. Reading functions can import a user defined geographical extent of data stored in netCDF files. Currently supported ocean data sources include NASA's Oceancolor web page , sensors VIIRS-SNPP; MODIS-Terra; MODIS-Aqua; and SeaWiFS. Available variables from this source includes chlorophyll concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), and several others. Data sources specific for SST that can be imported too includes Pathfinder AVHRR and GHRSST . In addition, ocean productivity data produced by Oregon State University can also be handled previous conversion from HDF4 to HDF5 format. Many other ocean variables can be processed by importing netCDF data files from two European Union's Copernicus Marine Service databases , namely Global Ocean Physical Reanalysis and Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Hindcast.

TI  - Enabling Efficient Distributed Spatial Join on Large Scale Vector-Raster Data Lakes
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Both the increasing number of GPS-enabled mobile devices and the geographic crowd-sourcing initiatives, such as Open Street Map, are determinants for the large amount of vector spatial data that is currently being produced. On the other hand, the automatic generation of raster data by remote sensing devices and environmental modeling processes was always leading to very large datasets. Currently, huge data generation rates are reached by improved sensor observation systems and data processing infrastructures. As an example, the Sentinel Data Access System of the Copernicus Program of the European Space Agency (ESA) was publishing 38.71 TB of data per day during 2020. This paper shows how the assumption of a new spatial data model that includes multi-resolution parametric spatial data types, enables achieving an efficient implementation of a large scale distributed spatial analysis system for integrated vector-raster data lakes. In particular, the proposed implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art Spark-based spatial analysis systems by more than one order of magnitude during vector-raster spatial join evaluation.

TI  - Predictive factors of invasion in ductal carcinoma<i> in</i><i> situ</i> diagnosed by core-needle biopsy
T2  - CIRUGIA Y CIRUJANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To identify clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics that could be predictive factors of microinvasive/ invasive breast carcinoma in patients with diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by core-needle biopsy. Material and methods: This is a retrospective study conducted from 2006-2017, which included women _18 years of age with initial DCIS, and who were treated with surgery. Final diagnosis was divided in DCIS and microinvasive/invasive carcinoma. Results: 334 patients were included: 193 (57.8%) with DCIS and 141 (42.2%) with microinvasive/invasive carcinoma (microinvasive 5.1%, invasive 37.1%). Lymph node metastasis occurred in 16.3%. Differences between DCIS and microinvasive/invasive groups included the presence of palpable nodule (36.7% vs. 63.2%), radiological nodule (29% vs. 51%), bigger radiological-tumor size (1.2 cm vs. 1.7 cm), and larger microcalcification extension (2.5 cm vs. 3.1 cm), all of these variables p <= 0.05. Hormonal receptors and HER2 expression were similar. After logistic regression analysis, predictive factor of invasion was the presence of palpable nodule (OR = 4.072, 95%CI = 2.520-6.582, p <0.001) and radiological multicentric disease (OR = 1.677, 95%CI = 1.036-2.716, p = 0.035). Conclusions: In patients with DCIS, palpable nodule, and radiological multicentric disease, upgrade to microinvasive/invasive is high, and sentinel lymph node is recommended.

TI  - L-Band Microwave Satellite Data and Model Simulations Over the Dry Chaco to Estimate Soil Moisture, Soil Temperature, Vegetation, and Soil Salinity
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dry Chaco in South America is a semi-arid ecoregion prone to dryland salinization. In this region, we investigated coarse-scale surface soil moisture (SM), soil temperature, soil salinity, and vegetation, using L-band microwave brightness temperature (T-B) observations and retrievals from the soil moisture ocean salinity (SMOS) and soil moisture active passive satellite missions, Catchment land surface model (CLSM) simulations, and in situ measurements within 26 sampled satellite pixels. Across these 26 sampled pixels, the satellite-based SM outperformed CLSM SM when evaluated against field data, and the forward L-band T-B simulations derived from in situ SM and soil temperature performed better than those derived from CLSM estimates when evaluated against SMOS T-B observations. The surface salinity for the sampled pixels was on average only 4 mg/g and only locally influenced the T-B simulations, when including salinity in the dielectric mixing model of the forward radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. To explore the potential of retrieving salinity together with other RTM parameters to optimize T-B simulations over the entire Dry Chaco, the RTM was inverted using 10 years of multiangular SMOS T-B data and constraints of CLSM SM and soil temperature. However, the latter modeled SM was not sufficiently accurate and factors such as open surface water were missing in the background constraints, so that the salinity retrievals effectively represented a bulk correction of the dielectric constant, rather than salinity per se. However, the retrieval of vegetation, scattering albedo, and surface roughness resulted in realistic values.

TI  - Opioid-Free Segmental Thoracic Spinal Anesthesia with Intrathecal Sedation for Breast and Axillary Surgery: Report of Four Cases
T2  - LOCAL AND REGIONAL ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Few studies have described segmental thoracic spinal anesthesia (STSA) as primary anesthesiologic method in breast and axillary surgery, documenting the association of intrathecal local anesthetics and opioids. This case series reports an opioid-free scheme of STSA in four elderly patients undergoing major breast and axillary oncological surgery.Patients and Methods: STSA was performed in three female patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy +/- axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node biopsy for invasive ductal carcinoma and in one male patient undergoing ALND for melanoma metastases. The level of needle insertion was included between T6-8, via a median or paramedian approach. Midazolam (2 mg) and ketamine (20 mg) were used as adjuvants for intrathecal sedation, followed by the administration of hypobaric ropivacaine 0.25% at a dose of 8 mg. The level of sensory blockade achieved was comprised between C2-3 and T11-12. Postoperative analgesia was maintained through continuous intravenous administration of Ketorolac by an elastomeric pump (90 mg over 24 hrs.).Results: Spinal anesthesia was completed without complications in all patients. Conversion to general anesthesia (GA) and perioperative intravenous sedation were not required. No major postoperative complications and no episodes of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were reported. No rescue analgesic was administered. All patients were discharged in postoperative day 2 and are alive at 30, 29, 27 and 13 months after surgery, respectively. High grade of satisfaction on the anesthesiologic method was expressed by all cases.Conclusion: STSA with local anesthetic plus midazolam and ketamine might be considered a safe and effective alternative to GA, even in surgeries involving the breast and axillary region, particularly in elderly and frail patients. Larger prospective studies are required to validate these findings.

TI  - Change in the trend of surgical treatment and staging of lymph nodes in endometrial cancer - results of the Oncogynecology Center, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Brno and Masaryk University in the years 2012-2021
T2  - CESKA GYNEKOLOGIE-CZECH GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In the last decade, the view of endometrial cancer has shifted enormously, and the surgical approach or lymph node staging has changed significantly. We are presenting these changes with the University Hospital Brno Oncogynecology center's results in the years 2012-2021 in the actual national and European guidelines context. Methods: The retrospective unicentric observational study, national and European guidelines review. Results: In the observation period, 715 endometrial cancer patients were treated in our clinic, and 636 of them underwent surgical treatment (89%). Concerning lymph node staging, fi rstly, there is a clear trend of expanding lymphadenectomy to the paraaortic area, followed by the sentinel node bio psy introduction in the years 2018-2019, and finally, the complete transition to this method as the main staging procedure in 2021, when this examination was performed in 73% of surgeries, even with high-risk cancers limited to the uterus. Within the sentinel node bio psy expansion, a gradual decrease in laparotomy approach (maximum 41% in 2016, 18% in 2021), and blood loss (2012-2019 median 100 mL, with a decrease to 50 mL in 2020-2021) was evident. A hospitalization length stabilized at a median of 5-6 days. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of endometrial cancer has become a minimally invasive procedure for the majority of patients, the average blood loss and hospitalization length have decreased. Sentinel node bio psy has become the preferred lymph node staging method.

TI  - N.V. GOGOL AND K.N. LEONTIEV: RECURRENCE OF WESTERNISM IN "CONSERVATIVE" CRITICISM
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article covers the problem of K.N. Leontiev's perception of the N.V. Gogol's heritage. They were close in worldview but divided by a misunderstanding based on the interpretation of Gogol's legacy in radical criticism. As the student Leontiev experienced the influence of Western ideology, which led to his negative attitude towards Gogol's satire. Decisive for him was the opinion of A.I. Herzen about Gogol as an "unconscious revolutionary," reported to Leontiev by I.S. Turgenev. After the ideological "breakthrough" that followed, when the critic began to adhere to conservative views, his understanding of Gogol's work remained unchanged. As in his youth, when the authorities for Leontiev were V.G. Belinsky, I.S. Turgenev, A.I. Herzen and N.G. Chernyshevsky, he continued to evaluate Gogol's heritage exclusively in the context of the accusatory literature of the "natural school."

TI  - The complicate role of violence in the interminable dissolution of multi-national territorial states. A comparison of Yugoslavia, the Soviet Empire and contempo-<i> rary</i><i> Russia</i>
T2  - DOCUMENTI GEOGRAFICI
M3  - Article
AB  - The collapse in different ways of some multinational states at the end of the twentieth century (empires or micro-empires and ap-parent federations) prompted questions about the role that violence played in their disintegration. While some states have experienced peace-ful separations (Czechoslovakia), others, such as the former Yugoslavia and only to a small extent the Soviet Union, have sought to violently hinder political-territorial disintegration, escalating violence and repres-sion to the extent of democides, genocides, ethnic cleansing, mass slaughter, and population displacement. This paper, developing personal reflections of the author and at the same time using a factual and theo-retical analysis, aims to compare three case studies of disintegration (Yu-goslavia, the Soviet Empire and contemporary Russia), seeking to identi-fy the main factors (ideal and material) that stimulated, or conversely re-strained, the use of violence in the course of disintegration. Indeed, these very factors may provide insight into whether those processes of disinte-gration have come to a halt or still underlie a long ongoing disintegrative phenomenon that former imperial centers are striving to stop with vio-lence. While the degree of the latter may be limited and "settling" in the former Yugoslavia, contemporary Russia's attempt to restrain the long post-imperial disintegration for years has been involving a shift to open violence -that could affect even the internal dimension -along the lines of what occurred in Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

AB  - A fast and precise detection of floating plastics debris is necessary for monitoring and saving the sea ecosystem. Recent studies have demonstrated how remote sensing (and in particular satellites) can be helpful in such detection. In particular, data provided by satellite sensors allow to continuously monitoring wide areas of our planet interested by plastic litters. In this work, the possibility of exploiting different optical remote sensing satellite methods is investigated: the analysis is conducted starting from multi-spectral data and moving tom hyperspectral one. Data acquired from Sentinel 2 and from PRISMA sensors are considered showing the added value of these systems in the detection of marine litter within marine areas.

AB  - Accurate and timely flood mapping is important in emergency management which can be greatly served by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Research on SAR flood detection is mostly based on thresholding that has low time complexity and seems ideal for emergency response, although human intervention is needed. Machine learning methods have fewer errors and minimize human intervention but their computational complexity is higher. This work aims to provide a lightweight convolutional neural network baseline for pixelwise time series flood classification in open land on SAR satellite data. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of results indicate that the approach is promising.

AB  - The paper analyzes the specifics of contemporary research on historicism in the humanities. The main discussion topics and targets of criticism, productive strategies, which are developed based on the discussion of the problem of historicism, are highlighted It is emphasized that the current situation of criticism of historicism can be described as a criticism of the foundations. It is shown that historical science turns from the generalization and statement of the crisis of historicism to the concretization of the concept and the clarification of the consequences, raises the problems of a historically rooted worldview. For each of the humanities, the establishment of a connection with history becomes significant, and the problem of historicism acts as a field for the exchange of methodological innovations.

TI  - A new look at the old fortress: Using remote sensing data in the study of fortified sites in Tuva
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the capabilities that remote sensing data can offer for the study of medieval fortifications in Tuva. Our case in point is the Shagonar III site in Ulug-Khem rayon. Previous measurings of the site were largely corrected and improved in 2020, when we aerosurveyed the area with the help of Phantom 4 Pro UAV.Comparing the processed data with the archeological description made by L. R. Kyzlasov shows that the overall size and square of the site and its internal citadel has not been measured correctly. The same is true for the number of its defensive towers and ditches, and similar mistakes have been made when measuring the neighboring site of Shagonar IV. A search for any counterpart of Shagonar III, a square-shaped fortress with an internal citadel, led us to considering Mongol forts of the Khitan Liao empire which existed from 907 to 1125 CE. The current dating of Shagonar III as built during the Uighur Khaganate thus can be wrong.The article brings up the issue of the prospects of future aerial surveying and 3D modeling of other fortresses in Tuva, since in their cases corrections of their sizes and architectural details can also be expected. We also conclude that new studies are needed in order to improve absolute chronology of Tuvan fortress sites.

AB  - With the availability of large amounts of satellite image time series (SITS), the identification of different materials of the Earth's surface is possible with a high temporal resolution. One of the basic tasks is the pixel-wise classification of land cover, i.e. the task of identifying the physical material of the Earth's surface in an image. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) are successfully used for this task. In this paper, we investigate different FCN variants, using different methods for the computation of spatial, spectral, and temporal features. We investigate the impact of 3D convolutions in the spatial-temporal as well as in the spatial-spectral dimensions in comparison to 2D convolutions in the spatial dimensions only. Additionally, we introduce a new method to generate multitemporal input patches by using time intervals instead of fixed acquisition dates. We then choose the image that is closest in time to the middle of the corresponding time interval, which makes our approach more flexible with respect to the requirements for the acquisition of new data. Using these multi-temporal input patches, generated from Sentinel-2 images, we improve the classification of land cover by 4% in the mean F1-score and 1.3% in the overall accuracy compared to a classification using mono-temporal input patches. Furthermore, the usage of 3D convolutions instead of 2D convolutions improves the classification performance by a small amount of 0.4% in the mean F1-score and 1.2% in the overall accuracy.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Saliva Mass Screening in Primary Schools: A 10-Week Sentinel Surveillance Study in Munich, Germany
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Representative, actively collected surveillance data on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in primary schoolchildren remain scarce. We evaluated the feasibility of a saliva mass screening concept and assessed infectious activity in primary schools. During a 10-week period from 3 March to 21 May 2021, schoolchildren and staff from 17 primary schools in Munich participated in the sentinel surveillance, cohort study. Participants were tested using the Salivette(R) system, testing was supervised by trained school staff, and samples were processed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We included 4433 participants: 3752 children (median age, 8 [range, 6-13] years; 1926 girls [51%]) and 681 staff members (median age, 41 [range, 14-71] years; 592 women [87%]). In total, 23,905 samples were processed (4640 from staff), with participants representing 8.3% of all primary schoolchildren in Munich. Only eight cases were detected: Five out of 3752 participating children (0.13%) and three out of 681 staff members (0.44%). There were no secondary cases. In conclusion, supervised Salivette(R) self-sampling was feasible, reliable, and safe and thus constituted an ideal method for SARS-CoV-2 mass screenings in primary schoolchildren. Our findings suggest that infectious activity among asymptomatic primary schoolchildren and staff was low. Primary schools appear to continue to play a minor role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 despite high community incidence rates.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Combining images from multiple Earth Observing (EO) satellites increases the temporal resolution of the data; overcoming the limitations imposed by low revisit time and cloud coverage. However, this requires an inter-calibration process, to ensure that there is no radiometric difference in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations and to quantify any offset in the respective instruments. In addition, combining vicarious calibration processes to the inter calibration of instruments can provide a useful mechanism to validate and compare data from multiple sensors. The Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) provides automated surface and top-of atmosphere reflectance data from multiple participating ground sites that can be used for instrument vicarious calibration. We present comparative analysis of the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Operational Land ImagerOLI) sensors and validate the data by comparing them to measurements from RadCalNet sites as a quantitative inter-calibration approach. The presented process provides SI-traceable inter calibration methodology and quantifies the offset and uncertainty in the OLI and MSI instruments to assess if the data can be reliably cross corelated and used by the scientific community.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on satellite data from the SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, and MODIS-Terra scanners, the long-term dynamics of coccolithophores in the Black Sea and their large-scale heterogeneity have been studied. During the twenty years in May and June, mass development of coccolithophores population of different intensities was recorded annually. Summer blooms of coccolithophores reached peak levels in 2006, 2012, and 2017, after abnormally cold winters. It was noted that in conditions of low summer temperatures, the blooming of coccolithophores could be significantly reduced or acquire a local character (2004). In the anomalous cold summer of 2001, coccolithophore blooms was replaced by the mass growth of diatoms. Over twenty years, numerous signs of coccolithophores mass development in the cold season have been revealed. Winter blooms develop mainly in warm winters with periods of low wind activity. The formation of a thermocline and the surface layer's stability are essential factors for initiating winter blooms of coccolithophores. It was noted that after the winter blooms of coccolithophores, their summer growth was poorly expressed. It is shown that during periods of rapid growth, the bulk of coccolithophores is concentrated in the upper mixed layer and thermocline. During the blooming period, the share of coccolithophores in phytoplankton biomass constituted 70-85%. The intensity of coccolithophore's blooms is associated with the previous diatoms' growth level. The effect of eddies circulation on the distribution and growth of coccolithophores is considered.

T2  - SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. Analysis of changes in quantitative and structural indicators of phytoplankton in the western and central part of the middle Caspian Sea over the past decades, including according to remote sensing data.Material and Methods. The data was obtained in 2004-2008 and 2019-2022 at different seasons of the year at 40 stations in the central and western part of the middle Caspian Sea. Phytoplankton samples were taken from 4-6 layers. A total of 300 samples of phytoplankton were analyzed. Determination of species and counting of the number of cells was carried out under the "Ergaval" light microscope. WORMS guided matters of nomenclature.Results. The spring phytoplankton is dominated by the species traditional for the Caspian Sea - Cyclotella caspia diatoms and Prorocetrum micans dinoflagellates. The maximum abundance of C. caspia (5.0 x 10(4) cell/l) was recorded at depths of 35-40 m. In summer, the maximum phytoplankton biomass (2.2 g/m(3)) was noted in the seasonal thermocline and was formed due to small flagellates and dinoflagellates. Phytoplankton biomass during winter blooms reached 4.5-5.0 g/m(3) and was determined by the development of diatoms (up to 96-99%). Winter blooms were formed by the diatom species traditional for the sea, as well as by the Pseudo-nitschia seriata and Cerataulina pelagica species.Conclusion. It is shown that in the middle Caspian Sea, the winter and autumn seasons are characterized by a highly productive status. in January-February, periodic blooms of diatoms are observed, as confirmed by satellite data and in situ observations. In summer, phytoplankton biomass is determined by the mass development of dinoflagellates in the seasonal thermocline layer, which has not been recorded by remote methods. In the autumn phytoplankton the main role is played by the diatom component, represented mainly by alien species.

AB  - In certain geographic locations like South Asia, the landscape changes dramatically between dry and wet seasons. The main factor responsible for this variation is the flora that transforms the landscape between seasons. These transformations can affect the performance of deep learning models trained to analyse satellite images, especially if there are domain shifts between training and testing data distributions. The current work shows that an architecture which employs a Gabor convolutional layer as the first layer of a deep network input focuses on more salient parts of the image than one which uses a standard convolutional layer meaning that removing colour information is less damaging than for the standard network. Further we show that the proposed architecture is robust in the presence of domain shifts due to seasonal data variations.

TI  - THE LIBERATING POWER OF HARMONY AND ORDER: ON THE NOTIONS OF LIBERTY AND MATHEMATICAL LOGIC IN ZHANG SHENFU'S PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT
T2  - ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the thought of Zhang Shenfu, one of the central figures behind the propagation of modern science and dialectical materialism in Republican China (1911 - 1949). In particular, it focuses on the notions of liberty, mathematical logic and humaneness (ren (sic)) in his writings in the period between the year of the May Fourth events (1919) and the late 1930s. The main aim of the analysis is to cast some light on the common conceptual and methodological features which underlay these interpretations, in order to reveal the essentially Chinese cultural "perception" or traditional worldview that served Zhang as the prism through which he viewed and understood the nature of and the relationships between all these "novel" concepts from the West. Consequently, an important aim of this paper will be to highlight a specific fragment of the intellectual mechanism that conditioned the so-called Chinese intellectual modernisation of the Republican period.

TI  - Estimating Water Content and Grain Size of Intertidal Flat Sediments Using Visible to Shortwave-Infrared Reflectance and Sentinel 2A Data: A Case Study of the Red River Delta, Vietnam
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment properties such as water content (WC) and grain size (GS) are essential to characterize the environmental conditions of tidal flats. This article aimed to develop appropriate models to estimate the WC and GS of surface sediments for an intertidal flat on the Red river delta (Vietnam) using Sentinel 2A (S2A) images. The spectral reflectance, WC, and GS of 96 sub-samples from 12 sediment samples collected on December 17, 2017 were measured to clarify their relationships. The WC was highly correlated with the reflectance ratio of two shortwave-infrared bands, R(2190)/R(1610) (R-2 = 0.93). The median GS (D-50) at 0%, 15%, and 20% of WC was significantly correlated with the reflectance ratio of the near-infrared band (842 nm) versus the visible-green band (560 nm) (R-2 > 0.78). Next, D-50 was estimated from a multivariate regression model using this band ratio, the visible-red band (665 nm), and WC. The accuracy of the models was verified by comparisons with WC and D-50 from 20 samples collected on March 12(th) 2019 (RMSE of both WC and D-50 < 15%). Then, the WC and sediment type distributions were mapped by applying these models to two S2A scenes. The maps showed high WC (>30%) in very fine sediments (silts), which is consistent with other intertidal flats with similar sediment types. This article was limited to fine sediment samples. Therefore, our next step is to incorporate coarse sediments into the models to provide more universal mapping of WC and sediment types.

AB  - Meeting Sustainable Development Goal 11 of making cities sustainable requires urban planning that reduces the impact of climate change and water scarcity on urban residents. Evapotranspiration (ET) in urban areas mitigates the urban heat island and controls the irrigation water demand of green spaces. In this study, we mapped the urban ET of Berlin, Germany using Sentinel-2 and open geodata, machine learning (ML), and footprint modeling in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution. Footprint modeling of two urban flux towers allowed us to incorporate various land covers in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used to model urban ET includes Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. Predictions were carried out using random forest regression. Daily ET was simulated for the entire city during and before a heat wave event in June 2019. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET in summertime, with a mean R-2 of 0.767 and 0.488 and a mean RMSE of 0.0409 mm and 0.0242 at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the relationship between Land Use and Land Cover classes and daily ET was analyzed to inform sustainable urban planning.

AB  - Although synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are often regarded as greyscale images, special care must be exercised when interpreting the images for land use and land cover (LULC). SAR has long been regarded as a viable alternative to optical images because it interacts with ground features in a variety of ways and is less influenced by weather conditions. Unlike optical images, SAR images suffer from speckle noise; therefore, accurate LULC mapping with SAR data is important. In this work, the recently proposed SAR2SAR denoise method has been employed. The self-supervision method is based on a deep learning model that can generate a speckle-free image with few references in a short amount of time. The proposed method has been applied to evaluate five categories of LULC in Malaysia with ground range detected (GRD) Sentinel-1 data: dense forests, paddy fields, urban areas, cleared lands, and water bodies. The results showed that the use of false-color-based denoised VV and VH composites from SAR2SAR denoise method significantly improved the visualizations of LULC classes as much as optical imagery.

Embedded in different ontologies and expressed by disparate means are similar intuitions about consciousness, coercion, and the transformative power of wisdom as well as deeply human concerns about what we can and cannot change and with whom we should or should not find fault. Ultimately, this study of cross-cultural conversations aims to demonstrate how careful attention to assumptions underlying the concepts of will, causation, selfhood, and desert can prove both edifying and liberating.

TI  - Spatial Evolution of Coastal Tourist City Using the Dyna-CLUE Model in Koh Chang of Thailand during 1990-2050
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial evolution can be traced by land-use change (LUC), which is a frontier issue in the field of geography. Using the limited areas of Koh Chang in Thailand as the research case, this study analyzed the simulation of its spatial evolution from a multi-scenario perspective on the basis of the 1900-2020 thematic mapper/operational land imager (TM/OLI) remote sensing data obtained through the transfer matrix model, and modified LUC and the dynamic land-use change model (Dyna-CLUE). Over the past 30 years, the expansion of recreation areas and urban and built-up land has been very high (2944.44% and 486.99%, respectively) along the western coast of Koh Chang, which replaced the original mangrove forests, orchards, and communities. Logistic regression analysis of important variables affecting LUC revealed that population density variables and coastal plain topography significantly affected LUC, which showed strong beta coefficients prominently in the context of a coastal tourist city. The results of the LUC and logistic regression analyses were used to predict future LUCs in the Dyna-CLUE model to simulate 2050 land-use in three scenarios: (1) natural evolution scenario, where a large patch expansion of agricultural land extends along the edge of the entire forest boundary around the island, particularly the southwestern areas of the island that should be monitored; (2) reserved area protection scenario, where the boundary of the conservation area is incorporated into the model, enabling forest preservation in conjunction with tourism development; and (3) recreation area growth scenario, where the southern area is the most susceptible to change at the new road crossing between Khlong Kloi village to Salak Phet village, and where land-use of the recreation area type is expanding. The model-projected LUC maps provide insights into possible changes under multiple pathways, which could help local communities, government agencies, and stakeholders jointly allocate resource planning in a systematic way, so that the development of various infrastructures to realize the potential impact on the environment is a sustainable coastal tourist city development.

AB  - This study investigates the characteristics of backscattering and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence for the flood damage area in Koriyama city caused by Typhoon Hagibis (No.19 in Japan, 2019). Nine sites, including built-up and paddy fields, were selected as flooded and non-flooded areas in Koriyama. Backscattering and InSAR analysis were applied to Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar(SAR) data. Both backscattering and coherence changes can detect flood-damaged areas in built-up areas. However, InSAR coherence could not detect the flooded paddy fields due to its low coherence. We also applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to multi-temporal backscattering images and found that the second component helped detect flooded areas in both built-up and paddy fields.

TI  - Satellite Retrievals of Probabilistic Freeze-Thaw Conditions From SMAP and AMSR Brightness Temperatures
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The freeze-thaw (FT) status of soil regulates ecological and hydrologic processes and is, therefore, a vital component of land surface models. This study utilizes a hidden Markov model (HMM) to retrieve surface FT status from L-band [Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)] and K-alpha-band [Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR)] satellite microwave brightness temperatures in cold-constrained lands north of 45 degrees N. The HMM, parameterized on a per-gridcell basis such that there are two passible states and emissions probabilities are assumed to be a two-component Gaussian Mixture, produces the posterior probability (a continuous variable between 0 and 1) that the surface is frozen given the radiometer input. HMM classification accuracy, averaged over five core validation networks, is acceptable (Ap > 80%) when judged against in situ air and soil temperature measurements from individual validation sites and is comparable to that of current FT products that produce a discrete state. Patterns in performance across variable land class, open water fraction, and elevation are assessed from 91 sparse network weather stations within 87 gridcells in the domain. The resulting satellite data record provides a continuous variable estimate of the daily probability of frozen conditions over northern land areas experiencing widespread thawing of permafrost and a shrinking frozen season due to global warming.

AB  - In this article, a novel approach to measuring in situ field uncertainties in surface reflectance is presented. This work is an outcome of a national campaign by Geoscience Australia to validate our analysis-ready Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 surface reflectance products. Various aspects of the field site methodology that were expected to contribute significantly to uncertainties were identified and tested. These aspects included the instrumental uncertainty, the use of a rest to stabilize the spectroradiometer fore-optic, the repositioning of the panel used for calibrating reflectance, and uncertainties introduced by the operator of the equipment, following a standard methodology. Results for two field sites are presented, which consistently show that approximately 95% of the overall uncertainty is a result of inherent variability in the ground surface reflectance. Typically, 5% of the uncertainty is introduced by a combination of the instrumentation and methodology.

TI  - A Joint Inversion Method of Wave and Wind Field Parameters Based on SAR SLC Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important method for observing the ocean wind field and waves on the sea surface. For most SAR wind field and wave parameter inversion methods, third-party data are required to provide initial information, such as reference wind direction and first guess spectrum. This makes it impossible for SAR to observe ocean wind fields and waves independently. To solve this problem, this letter proposes a joint inversion method based on Sentinel-1 SAR SLC data. In this method, the wind direction is inverted by the LG method, and the wave propagation direction extracted by the SAR image cross-spectrum is used to remove the 180 degrees ambiguity of the wind direction inversion result. The inverted wind direction is used as the reference wind direction in the CMOD5.N method to invert wind speed. Then, the first guess spectrum constructed using the inverted wind speed and inverted wind direction is input into the MPI method to invert the wave spectrum and wave parameters. The wind field and wave parameter inversion results are compared with the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis data. The wind field and wave parameter inversion results are in good agreement with the ERA5 data under medium or high sea conditions.

AB  - Deep learning based remote sensing scene classification methods have become a research hotspot, but they can not fully mine the image information due to the architecture comes directly from natural image. The automatic search method-based network architecture has then attracted a lot of attention benefits by its ability to independently learn the network structure suitable for remote sensing data. However, in the process of search and sorting, slightly larger models with better performance after full training are often eliminated due to insufficient training. Moreover, the methods often spend a lot of time searching. In this paper, a micro network architecture evolutionary search method is proposed (MAE-Net), the contributions are reflected in the slightly larger model retention mechanism by two-layer multi-objective functions and the super network mechanism used to reduce search time through weight sharing. The effectiveness is proved by comparison with human expert and search based networks on NWPU45 dataset.

CL  - Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL
AB  - The low earth orbit (LEO) satellite system is one of the promising solutions to provide broadband services to a wide-coverage area for future integrated LEO-6G networks, where users' demands vary with time and geographical locations. Conventional satellites with fixed beam pattern and footprint planning may not be capable of meeting such dynamic requests and irregular traffic distributions. As the development of flexible satellite payload with beamforming capabilities, spot beams with flexible size and shape are considered potential solutions to this issue. As an early investigation, in this paper, we consider the scenarios where satellite payloads are equipped with multiple beam patterns and study the optimal beam pattern selection. We exploit the potential synergies of joint resource optimization between adaptive beam patterns and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in a LEO satellite system, where NOMA is employed to reduce intra-beam interference and flexible beam pattern is adopted to mitigate inter-satellite interference. The formulated problem is to minimize the capacity-demand gap of terminals, which falls into mixed-integer nonconvex programming (MINCP). To tackle the discrete variables and non-convexity, we design a joint approach to allocate power and select beam patterns. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves capacity-demand gap reduction of 37.8% over conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and 42.5% over the fixed-beam-pattern scheme.

TI  - HIGH-RESOLUTION REMOTE SENSING MONITORING OF MARINE WATER QUALITY FACTORS IN THE COASTAL WATERS OF JIANGSU PROVINCE
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of agriculture, industry, aquaculture, shipping, and tourism in Jiangsu Province, more production and domestic sewage is directly or indirectly discharged into its coastal waters, which continuously increases the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and soluble organic matter in the sea and causes more and more people to pay attention to the marine environmental problems. The traditional monitoring methods of marine water quality factors generally use non-imaging spectrometer to measure the spectral reflectance, transmittance and other radiance of various features; although they can help understand the spectral characteristics of marine water factors, it cannot improve the accuracy of analysis and application of different types of remote sensing data, and cannot simulate and calibrate the performance of all imaging spectrometers before launch. The digital images and positioning data of high-resolution remote sensing can be equipped with single-band, multi-band, panchromatic band and other sensors for special monitoring targets, with the technical capabilities of area coverage, vertical or oblique imaging; the spatial resolution of the acquired image depends on the sensor and the highest can reach the centimeter level. Therefore, on the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous research works, this paper expounds the research status and significance of the monitoring of marine water quality factors in the coastal waters of Jiangsu Province, elaborates the development background, current status and future challenges of high-resolution remote sensing technology, introduces research objects, observation methods, data sources, remote sensing inversion algorithms and comprehensive evaluation methods, proposes a statistical model for evaluation factors of marine water quality, conducts the remote sensing inversion and comprehensive evaluation of marine water quality factors, implements the highre-solution remote sensing monitoring of water quality factors, analyzes the remote sensing inversion accuracy of marine water quality factors, and finally discusses the monitoring results of marine water quality factors in the coastal waters of Jiangsu Province. The research results show that high-resolution remote sensing monitoring can analyze the inter-correlations between water quality variables, remote sensing data bands, and remote sensing data band combinations, on which the multiple regression model for water quality variables with traditional statistical multiple regression methods is based. In addition, the high-resolution remote sensing technology can not only meet the measurement accuracy requirements of marine water quality monitoring, but also perform faster dynamic updates and handle different spatial distribution data, which can ensure that the dynamic information is monitored in real time, and promote the sustainable use of marine resources and the healthy development of the ocean economy. The research results of this paper provide a reference for the follow-up researches on high-resolution remote sensing monitoring of marine water quality factors in the coastal waters of Jiangsu Province.

TI  - An Adaptive PolSAR Trilateral Filter Based on the Mechanism of Scattering Consistency
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) can record the backscattering information of ground objects by capturing the phase difference of echo signal in different polarization combinations. Due to the characteristics of coherent imaging, there is a lot of coherent speckle noise in PolSAR images. However, most of the current PolSAR image despeckling algorithms are difficult to balance the ability in aspects of speckle suppression, polarization information retention, and edge structure preservation. This article proposes an adaptive PolSAR trilateral filter (PTF) based on the mechanism of scattering consistency, which consists of the following three steps: 1) the marker map of ground object scattering category is first obtained based on the dominant scattering mechanism determined by Freeman decomposition of the polarization covariance matrix; 2) next, the neighborhood pixels with the same scattering mechanism as the center pixel are screened out within an adaptive filtering window; and 3) a PTF is established through integration of the spatial proximity, polarization similarity, and local structural characteristics of the center pixel and the screened pixels to effectively suppress the speckle noises. Experimental results upon the data of Radarsat-2 and airborne synthetic aperture radar (AirSAR) demonstrate that PTF can not only suppress coherent speckle noise effectively without sacrificing the edge structure information but also retain the unique polarization information of PolSAR image. In particular, compared with the traditional six widely used PolSAR despeckling algorithms, PTF has been significantly improved in terms of equivalent number of looks (ENLs) and degree of difference (Dod) indexes by 2.49 times and 6 orders of magnitude, respectively.

AB  - The high spatial resolution land surface phenology (LSP) monitoring is often limited by the temporal discontinuity of high spatial resolution observations. Many gap-filling methods have been proposed for LSP monitoring, however, a thorough intercomparison and evaluation is still lacking. Four widely-used methods, including the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), Multi-year based model, and Spatiotemporal Shape Matching Model (SSMM) were selected to extract green-up date (GUD) based on the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset. The results of the four methods show consistency with those of PhenoCam sites (R-2>0.64) and there is a lag phenomenon. Compared within 3 x 3 VIIRS pixel window, the difference between mean VIIRS GUDs and aggregated 30m GUDs is small and the mean absolute difference is less than 7 days. Comprehensively, SSMM has high consistency (R-2=0.75) and smaller bias (Bias=7.3days), which shows more potential in LSP monitoring.

TI  - Optical satellite image MTF compensation for remote-sensing data production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) compensation had been widely used in Remote-Sensing (RS) imagery processing for texture feature enhancement and high-frequency details restoration. In this paper, we propose an optical satellite MTF Compensation (MTFC) method for engineering applications and RS data production. The framework mainly includes Point Spread Function (PSF) model estimation and non-blind image deconvolution. In PSF estimation, we used the iterative total variation algorithm and 2D Gaussian model fitting to reduce the dependence on slant-edge quality and improve the efficiency of PSF measurement. The PSF model estimation error is less than 3% using the results from standard commercial software as an evaluation benchmark. In image deconvolution, we adopted a regularisation-based non-blind deconvolution method using hyper-Laplacian prior. Compared with the widely used methods, the MTF has been improved more than double in high-frequency part. Its processing efficiency and image quality can meet the requirements of RS image products. These results can effectively prove the engineering application value of our proposed method.

AB  - The acquisition of information on land occupation in mining areas is important for ecological management and restoration of mining areas. The current work has the problem of low extraction accuracy due to the small number of typical land category samples and simple network structure. In order to improve the accuracy of extraction of land use information in mining areas, this paper uses the data from the Gaofen-2 satellite, combines the dense connected neural network (DenseNet) with object-oriented ideas to extract mining areas in Yuzhou City, Henan Province. The results are compared with convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the proposed DenseNet is 87.46% and 0.84, which are 0.06%, 2.63% and 0.004, 0.039 higher than that of the CNN and SVM respectively. The proposed DenseNet performs the best in the extraction of open-pit and wastedump area, which indicating that it can provide promising advantages in mine information extraction, and can provide technical support for environmental monitoring and scientific management of mining areas.

AB  - In this paper, based on the 24 scenes Sentinel-1A images covering the Beibu Gulf region from 2018 to 2020, we used the PSInSAR technique to obtain the surface subsidence information in the study area and analyzed the surface subsidence spatial-temporal characteristics. The results showed that (1) The subsidence rate of most subsidence areas in Beibu Gulf is from -10.0mm/year to - 1.1mm/year. And most of the subsidence areas are located in the coastal areas in the south of the study area. The distribution was obvious, and the maximum subsidence rate can reach -17.2 rim/a. However, the subsidence areas of villages and towns located in Qinzhou in the north and inland of the study area are relatively stable. (2) Subsidence was mainly concentrated in Yinhai District, Haicheng District, Tieshan Port District and Fangcheng District of Fangchenggang in Beihai City. The annual average Subsidence range from -10.0mm/year to -1.1mm/year. Among them, the Tieshan Port area and Fangcheng District had obvious subsidence trends, with the maximum cumulative subsidence reaching -35.9mm. (3) The spatial-temporal characteristics of wide-area surface subsidence and the relationship between surface subsidence and influencing factors in the Beibu Gulf region were determined.

TI  - Hyperspectral Image Stripe Removal Network With Cross-Frequency Feature Interaction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images, especially hyperspectral images (HSIs), are extremely vulnerable to random noise and stripe noise. As a key aspect of HSI data quality improvement, stripe noise removal has always been a pervasive issue in remote sensing image processing. Convolutional neural networks have been applied for HSI data destriping. However, the existing methods lose the stripe-free component of the original image to a certain extent. These models also ignore the global spatial context of images and the correlation between spatial information and spectral information. Therefore, we propose a novel destriping convolutional network to overcome the problems with the existing methods. Octave convolution is used to extract cross-frequency features, and separate and compress the low-frequency information of the images, while dilation convolution (Dila-Conv) is used to reduce the amount of required calculation and also preserve the key image information. In addition, Dila-Conv can expand the receptive field to obtain multiscale features. Finally, a cross-channel enhanced spatial-spectral feature fusion module is used to acquire and integrate spatial context information and interchannel dependencies on a global scale as auxiliary information so that the network model can learn and pay attention to key feature information, specifically, "what to look for" and "where to look at," which can facilitate the distinction between stripe and stripe-free components. Experimental results obtained using multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed method can outperform the existing comparable methods and can produce satisfactory results in terms of visual effects and quantitative evaluation.

AB  - The surface reflectance anisotropy is usually described by bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and the BRDF archetypes extracted based on the Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) have been used as the prior reflectance anisotropy knowledge of quantitative inversion. In this study, we introduce a new index, i.e., the Perpendicular Anisotropic Flat Index (PAFX), based on the AFX in a prior study, to refine the BRDF classification of the land surface. Based on the MODIS BRDF parameter products sampled at global intervals over multiple land cover types in 2015, we used AFX and PAFX as classification indicators to divide MODIS BRDF parameter space into some orthogonal clusters through use of the ISODATA (Iterative Self organizing data Analysis technique) Clustering Algorithm. As a case study, the MODIS BRDF parameters are divided into three classes by using the AFX and PAFX, respectively, in an orthogonal way, and therefore a total of nine cluster classes of BRDF parameters are generated, correspondingly generating nine BRDF archetypes. We use the average BRDF fitting error, algorithm complexity and classification accuracy to evaluate this classification method for classifying BRDF parameters, showing that the difference within the BRDF archetypes class is significantly reduced after the introduction of PAFX (RMSE = 0.0083) compared with only using AFX (RMSE = 0.0139), and the error for fitting all BRDF shapes with the average BRDF shape, i.e., the BRDF archetype presents a V-shaped trend as functions of AFX and PAFX, indicating an optimized minimum. In general, jointing the AFX and PAFX has improved the classification accuracy of the MODIS BRDF parameter space and is expected a further application in near future.

TI  - A New Likelihood Function for Consistent Phase Series Estimation in Distributed Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper use of distributed scatterer (DS) can improve both the density and quality of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) measurements. A critical step in DS interferometry (DSI) is the restoration of a consistent phase series from SAR interferogram stacks. Most state-of-the-art algorithms adopt an approximate likelihood function to calculate the likelihood by replacing the true coherence matrix with its estimation, more specifically, the sample coherence matrix (SCM). However, this approximation has a drawback in that the coherence estimates are greatly biased when the coherence is low. In this study, we derive a new likelihood function without such an approximation. Accordingly, a DSI framework using this function for phase estimation and point selection is provided. In this framework, the new likelihood function serves as a cost function for phase estimation and a quality measure for DS selection. Its performance is investigated by experiments in a simulation study and a real-world case study using Sentinel-1 data over Shenzhen airport in China. The results reveal that the proposed DSI framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in different scenarios, in terms of providing a more accurate estimation and improving DS density and coverage.

TI  - Assessment of the Performance of TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> Data Products in the North China Plain: Comparison, Correction and Application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite has been used to detect the atmospheric environment since 2017, and it is of great significance to investigate the accuracy of its products. In this work, we present comparisons between TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 and total SO2 products against ground-based MAX-DOAS at a single site (Xianghe) and OMI products over a seriously polluted region (North China Plain, NCP) in China. The results show that both NO2 and SO2 data from three datasets exhibit a similar tendency and seasonality. In addition, TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 columns are generally underestimated compared with collocated MAX-DOAS and OMI data by about 30-60%. In contrast to NO2, the monthly average SO2 retrieved from TROPOMI is larger than MAX-DOAS and OMI, with a mean bias of 2.41 (153.8%) and 2.17 x 10(16) molec cm(-2) (120.7%), respectively. All the results demonstrated that the TROPOMI NO2 as well as the SO2 algorithms need to be further improved. Thus, to ensure reliable analysis in NCP area, a correction method has been proposed and applied to TROPOMI Level 3 data. The revised datasets agree reasonably well with OMI observations (R > 0.95 for NO2, and R > 0.85 for SO2) over the NCP region and have smaller mean biases with MAX-DOAS. In the application during COVID-19 pandemic, it showed that the NO2 column in January-April 2020 decreased by almost 25-45% compared to the same period in 2019 due to the lockdown for COVID-19, and there was an apparent rebound of nearly 15-50% during 2021. In contrast, a marginal change of the corresponding SO2 is revealed in the NCP region. It signifies that short-term control measures are expected to have more effects on NO2 reduction than SO2; conversely, we need to recognize that although the COVID-19 lockdown measures improved air quality in the short term, the pollution status will rebound to its previous level once industrial and human activities return to normal.

TI  - Long Time Series Water Extent Analysis for SDG 6.6.1 Based on the GEE Platform: A Case Study of Dongting Lake
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the variation regularity of water extent can provide insights into lake conservation and management. In this study, inter- and inner-annual variations of water extent during the period of 1987-2020 were analyzed to understand the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of Dongting Lake. We applied the Multiple Index Water Detection Rule to extract the Dongting Lake water extent quickly and accurately based on Google Earth Engine platform, and then assessed the extraction accuracy. The water surface analysis results showed that (1) based on sustainable development goals (SDG) 6.6.1, the trend of water extent showed the downward fluctuating trend from 1987 to 2020, with the overall average water extent being 1894.48 km(2). (2) Among the monthly average water area, the largest extent was 2477.14km(2) (July) and the smallest was 848.14 km(2) (January). Among the seasonal mean water area, summer was the largest, with an area of 2438.06 km(2), and winter was the smallest at 967.34 km(2). (3) For the water inundation frequency, seasonal water bodies accounted for the largest proportion, with 1577.85 km(2); the nonwater area was the smallest, with the area of 573.02 km(2); and the permanent water area was 1086.21 km(2). Through the analysis of the historical water body extent of the long time series of Dongting Lake, this study reflected support for SDG, for which the research idea and design can help us understand the importance and feasibility of the SDG 6.6.1 indicator.

AB  - In order to map surface water accurately and timely for different multispectral images, adequate and high-quality training samples are particularly important. However, the reusability of samples between different multispectral satellites and across geographic distance and time on classifying water is underdeveloped, which indicates that water bodies recognition of different images needs to build the corresponding water sample database. This study we addressed the limitation by using hyperspectral images to obtain high-quality training samples that could be used for water detection on different multispectral sensors. Combination of 12 spectral variables were used to classify surface water bodies using Random Forest classifier. The results showed that the overall accuracies were 96.12% for Sentinel-2 and 94.76% for Landsat 8, respectively. To compare the results of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images had an overall similarity greater than 96%, these comparisons demonstrated that this algorithm had robustness to different multispectral sensors.

TI  - Multiple Effects of Topographic Factors on Spatio-Temporal Variations of Vegetation Patterns in the Three Parallel Rivers Region, Southeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic factors are critical for influencing vegetation distribution patterns, and studying the interactions between them can enhance our understanding of future vegetation dynamics. We used the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (MODIS NDVI) image dataset (2000-2019), combined with the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and vegetation type data for trend analysis, and explored NDVI variation and its relationship with topographic factors through an integrated geographically-weighted model in the Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) of southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) in the past 20 years. Our results indicated that there was no significant increase of NDVI in the entire basin between 2000-2019, except for the Lancang River basin. In the year 2004, abrupt changes in NDVI were observed across the entire basin and each sub-basin. During 2000-2019, the mean NDVI value of the whole basin increased initially and then decreased with the increasing elevation. However, it changed marginally with variations in slope and aspect. We observed a distinct spatial heterogeneity in vegetation patterns with elevation, with higher NDVI in the southern regions NDVI than those in the north as a whole. Most of the vegetation cover was concentrated in the slope range of 8~35 degrees, with no significant difference in distribution except flat land. Furthermore, from 2000 to 2019, the vegetation cover in the TPRR showed an improving trend with the changes of various topographic factors, with the largest improvement area (36.10%) in the slightly improved category. The improved region was mainly distributed in the source area of the Jinsha River basin and the southern part of the whole basin. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis showed that elevation was negatively correlated with NDVI trends in most areas, especially in the middle reaches of Nujiang River basin and Jinsha River basin, where the influence of slope and aspect on NDVI change was considerably much smaller than elevation. Our results confirmed the importance of topographic factors on vegetation growth processes and have implications for understanding the sustainable development of mountain ecosystems.

AB  - Accurate information regarding cultivated areas of medicinal plants is useful for taking macro-level decisions for medicinal plant management and contingency plans. In this study, the capabilities and limitations of mapping Astragalus mongholicus Bunge and Sophora fiavescens Aiton using GaoFen-6 (GF-6) and multitemporal Sentinel-2 (S-2) data were assessed through a case study in Naiman Banner, Inner Mongolia, China. First, an object-based approach was used to produce a cropland mask based on the GF-6 images. Then, different spectral indices were generated from multitemporal S-2 imagery acquired in 2019, and a temporal phonological pattern analysis was conducted. Subsequently, optimal feature selection was carried out for each of the crops (A. mongholicus Bunge, S. flavescens Aiton, and Zea mays L.). The selection was performed by sorting all features according to their global separability index and removing those whose contribution to the model accuracy was negligible. Finally, the medicinal crops were distinguished using the random forest classification algorithm. An overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 94.51% and 0.90 were achieved, respectively, demonstrating that the synergistic use of time-series GF-6 and S-2 data were more suitable for A. mongholicus Bunge and S. flavescens Aiton mapping.

TI  - Model functions for retrieving sea surface wind speed with wide-swath imaging altimeter
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite remote sensing technology to observe sea surface wind fields has become an important instrument. The successful launch of Tiangong-2, the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, and demonstrating GaoFen Project provides the future understanding for the generation of new wide-swath imaging altimeter. The constructed data sets and validated data sets of the model function were obtained by combining the observable conditions of imaging altimeter with the theoretical model of sea surface back-scattering coefficient. A model function for wind speed retrieval at incidence angles from 1 deg to 7 deg and from 7 deg to 11 deg was proposed, which is suitable for wide-swath imaging altimeter, model coefficients were calculated using the constructed data sets, model functions were validated using the validated data sets. The validated results of model function show that the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) ranged from 0.005 to 0.72 m/s. Wind speed was retrieved with China France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) L2 data for incidence angles from 3 deg to 10 deg with 0.5 interval, and wind speed was validated with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data. The results of wind speed validation show that the average of RMSE is 1.6 m/s. Therefore, the wind speed retrieval was validated with the wind speed from ECMWF, which showed good coincidence.

TI  - Malignant adenomyoepithelioma of the breast: cases report and literature review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Malignant adenomyoepithelioma (MAME) of the breast is an extremely rare breast malignancy, in which they arise from either luminal epithelial or myoepithelial components, or both. At present, there is very little clinical data of MAME. Case Report: We present two cases, one of them is a 34-year-old woman who underwent needle biopsy for a 3.2 cm-size mass in the right breast, and the pathology was MAME of breast. Another case is a 45-year-old woman who had a 3.0 cm-size mass in the right breast. We performed a breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy, both of which were negative. The histopathology of these two cases was invasive carcinoma; however, these cases were eligible for MAME of the breast through combining with immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: MAME of the breast is very rare, and has a diverse cell morphology, which must be combined with immunohistochemistry to make a clear diagnosis. Besides, it should be differentiated from adenoid cystic cancer, malignant leafy tumor, spindle cell carcinoma, etc. The clinical characteristics and treatment strategies were further discussed in combination with the literature.

TI  - Urban Thermal Anisotropy: A Comparison Among Observational and Modeling Approaches at Different Time Scales
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The directional variation in upwelling thermal radiance (referred to as "thermal anisotropy") is one of the important issues in retrieving representative urban land surface temperature (LST) from remote sensing data. Yet, there is a gap between urban thermal anisotropy assessed from different observational and modeling approaches at different time scales. Thermal anisotropy at the satellite observing scale (similar to 1 km) is usually derived from multiangular thermal observations that are a result of temporal aggregation over long time series. How well this type of anisotropy estimate represents the instantaneous thermal anisotropy (e.g., from airborne and some modeling techniques) at the satellite scale remains unclear. To close this knowledge gap, we comprehensively compare Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived anisotropy and quasi-simultaneous airborne observations in urban areas and assess the factors that control anisotropic features of LST at seasonal and diurnal scales. Furthermore, we use model simulations to separately assess the impacts of 1) weather variability on anisotropy and 2) solar angle variation on zenithal variation in anisotropy, both of which have been largely simplified in the MODIS-derived approach. The instantaneous model-derived or airborne-measured anisotropy in early morning (similar to 10:00) and late afternoon (similar to 14:00) is closer to the seasonally aggregated MODIS-derived anisotropy from Terra-Day (with a median overpass time of 11:00) and Aqua-Day (13:00), respectively, whereas it has a good representation during winter. The investigation of the diurnal and seasonal characteristic of MODIS-derived anisotropy is a critical step needed to understand its performance for global urban thermal anisotropy profiles.

TI  - A Benchmark Sentinel-1 SAR Dataset for Airport Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airports are important targets in both military and civilian tasks. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based airport detection has received increasing attention in recent years. However, due to the high cost of the SAR imaging and annotation process, there is no publicly available SAR dataset for airport detection, which leads to the fact that deep learning methods have not been applied to airport detection and no unified evaluation benchmark for traditional methods. To provide a benchmark for airport detection studies in SAR images, a large SAR airport dataset is presented in this article. It contains 624 SAR images from Sentinel 1B, covering 104 instances of airports with different scales, orientations, and shapes, which can realistically reflect the real world. Experiments with four deep learning-based methods and three traditional methods on this dataset demonstrate its effectiveness and challenge. It serves for the development of state-of-the-art airport detection algorithms or other related tasks. In addition, we found that airport runways in SAR images always have some parallel line segments. Inspired by this, the fusion of deep features and line segments is achieved by designing a line segment detector branch, which further improves the accuracy of airport detection.

TI  - BO-DRNet: An Improved Deep Learning Model for Oil Spill Detection by Polarimetric Features from SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill pollution at sea causes significant damage to marine ecosystems. Quad-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has become an essential technology since it can provide polarization features for marine oil spill detection. Using deep learning models based on polarimetric features, oil spill detection can be achieved. However, there is insufficient feature extraction due to model depth, small reception field lend due to loss of target information, and fixed hyperparameter for models. The effect of oil spill detection is still incomplete or misclassified. To solve the above problems, we propose an improved deep learning model named BO-DRNet. The model can obtain a more sufficiently and fuller feature by ResNet-18 as the backbone in encoder of DeepLabv3+, and Bayesian Optimization (BO) was used to optimize the model's hyperparameters. Experiments were conducted based on ten prominent polarimetric features were extracted from three quad-polarimetric SAR images obtained by RADARSAT-2. Experimental results show that compared with other deep learning models, BO-DRNet performs best with a mean accuracy of 74.69% and a mean dice of 0.8551. This paper provides a valuable tool to manage upcoming disasters effectively.

TI  - Remote sensing assessment of trophic status based on chromaticity angle in Lake Daihai
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake eutrophication has become the focus of research in the field of water resources and a long-term severe challenge facing the field of the water environment. To explore the nutrient status of lakes in arid and semi -arid regions, taking the typical Lake Daihai water as an example, the trophic status assessment model of Lake Daihai water body was established based on the correlation between TSISDD and chromaticity angle, according to the Sentinel_2A and Landsat_8 OLI remote sensing data, and the nutrient state of water body at the long time series scale was retrieved, using the remote sensing image data from 1986 to 2020. The results show that: 1) According to the results of the accuracy test, the model of trophic status assessment established in this paper has good accuracy (R-2=0.74, RMSE=3.66, MAPE=4.84%). 2) The algorithm was applied to time series MSI, TM, ETM+ and OLI images, and the dynamic characteristics of the nutrient status of the Lake Daihai water body from 1986 to 2020 were obtained. The results showed that the water area of Lake Daihai decreased year by year, showing mild eutrophication most of the time. The eutrophication of the water body generally tends to ease from the edge to the center of the lake. The closer to the shore, the more serious the eutrophication is in general. Towards the center of the lake is mainly mesotrophic, and rarely oligotrophic. 3) The trophic status of the Lake Daihai water body was not significant in correlation with climate factors (temperature, wind speed and precipitation), which explain 13% of temporal and spatial variations. Monthly variation in trophic status, showed a significantly strong correlation, with an explanation rate of 93%.

TI  - Effects of Linear Calibration Errors at Low-Temperature End of Thermal Infrared Band: Lesson From Failures in Cloud Top Property Retrieval of FengYun-4A Geostationary Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top properties (CTPs) are important satellite products. However, the failures of CTPs derived from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager of FengYun-4A (FY-4A/AGRI) have been occasionally reported by users. To this end, the feasibility of the operational CTP algorithm has been reviewed. First, this study reveals the slight differences in brightness temperature (BT) maps of thermal infrared (TIR) bands between two different imagers. Further analyses found that the nonretrieved pixels of CTP products from FY-4A/AGRI usually have a negative value down to -13 K in 10.8-13.5-mu m BT difference (BTD10.8-13.5 mu m), and the joint distribution related to BTD10.8-13.5 mu m and BTD10.8-12 mu m is well separated from those successfully retrieved ones. These findings are confirmed by the simulations of the radiative transfer forward model (approaching -12 K or lower) and the cross-validation between the products from AGRI/FY-4A and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer of Meteorological Operational Satellite Program-Satellite B. In essence, the bias at the 13.5-mu m band is mainly affected by the relatively low accuracy and stability at the low-temperature end. Based on these findings, we have proposed a novel method to estimate calibration-related measurement biases of TIR bands and track their in-orbit stability. The statistical study based on the FY-4A/AGRI observations reveals significant daily and diurnal variations in performance and provides an insight into its stability at the TIR band (13.5 mu m).

TI  - Characterization of NDSI Variation: Implications for Snow Cover Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference snow index (NDSI) plays an important role in mapping snow cover with spaceborne visible and shortwave-infrared imagery. The NDSI variation depends on illuminating-viewing geometry and snow physical properties, including equivalent grain size (EGS), snow depth (SD) and impurity concentration, as well as fractional snow cover (FSC) within a mixed pixel; however, it is still not fully understood. To quantifiably characterize the pattern of snow NDSI variation, we use a light scattering model of snow to calculate bidirectional reflectance and consequent NDSI values for a wide range of illuminating-viewing geometries, SD, and EGS values. In the model designated bicontinuous snow model using Geometric Optics theory and Radiative Transfer Equation (bicontinuous-GO/RTE), snowpack is represented by a bicontinuous microstructure, and bidirectional reflectance is simulated based on geometric optics and vector radiative transfer equation. The discrete ordinates radiative transfer (DISORT) algorithm is used to simulate the soot concentration effect on snow NDSI. A soil spectral reflectance model (SOILSPECT) is utilized with the assumption of the linear spectral mixture of snow and soil to quantify the effect of FSC on NDSI. As for discontinuous forests, an analytical hybrid geometric-optical and radiative transfer (GORT) model in conjunction with the bicontinuous-GO/RTE model and the PROprietesSPECTrales (PROSPECT) model is used to examine the effect of canopy cover, which is related to the maximal FSC viewable to satellites. Modeling results indicate that: 1) snow NDSI is comparably low at off-nadir viewing angles, and this effect is exacerbated by the decline in solar elevation but limited by large EGS; 2) snow NDSI increases with EGS yet becomes saturated at EGS of 500 mu m; 3) the effect of SD that is as low as 1 cm on NDSI is rarely noticeable; 4) the concentration of internally mixed soot up to 1 ppm has little reducing effect on snow NDSI (<0.05); 5) the angular effects on the NDSI thresholding method to identify binary snow cover for soil background are nonsignificantly pronounced in the cross plane (CP); 6) NDSI increases linearly with FSC for soil background at nadir as well as in the CP; 7) the SNOw-MAPping algorithm (SNOMAP) method could omit snow cover at large zenith angles for solar zenith angles >20 degrees in forests; and 8) forests complicate the nonlinear relationship between NDSI and canopy cover with fully snow-covered ground beneath canopies. These findings imply important uncertainty sources of binary and FSC mapping with NDSI.

TI  - A Phase Optimization Method for DS-InSAR Based on SKP Decomposition From Quad-Polarized Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel distributed scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DS-InSAR) method is presented in which the sum of Kronecker product (SKP) decomposition method is applied to DS candidates. Unlike existing polarimetric optimization methods, the proposed method considers polarimetric and interferometric coherence information simultaneously, resulting in separation of the polarimetric scattering process for each target and the maximum diversity for the corresponding phase center locations. Physical reliability of the phase optimization solution is thereby ensured. The performance of the novel method is evaluated using 30 quad-polarized C-band Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images over Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. The proposed method provides a higher density of measurement scatterer (MS) points and a higher quality of DS interferometric phase with a temporally stable phase center than single-polarization (HH) method and quad-polarization exhaustive search polarimetric optimization (ESPO) method. Thus, the proposed method shows good performance in phase quality improvement and point density increasement.

TI  - Lake Water Storage Changes in Northeast Hoh Xil Observed by Cryosat-2 and Landsat-5/7/8: Impact of the Outburst of Zhuonai Lake in 2011
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The outburst of Zhuonai Lake (ZL) in 2011 changed the local hydro-ecological system in northeast Hoh Xil (HX). This study focuses on the impact of the outburst on lake water storage changes (LWSCs) of four lakes in this region. Monthly LWSC from 2009 to 2016 were constructed using Landsat and Cryosat-2 data. We determined and validated lake levels and areas derived from Cryosat-2 and Landsat data, respectively. The two satellite-derived sequences were merged by interpolation to compute LWSC, based on the level-area curve derived from the digital elevation model (DEM). Results reveal the apparent impact of the outburst on the hydrological system. Before the outburst, water volumes in all four lakes continuously grew from January 2009 to September 2011, with a total increase of 1.49 +/- 0.08 Gt. Most increased water was distributed in ZL and Kusai Lake (KL). The LWSC of each lake was strongly correlated (>0.9) with those of the whole basin. However, from October 2011 to December 2016, there was no ascending trend in LWSC of the three upper stream lakes, although the water volume in the basin was still increasing. More than 80% of the increased water flowed into Salt Lake (SL). Only the LWSC of SL kept a high correlation (0.91) with those of the whole basin.

TI  - Retrieving the Optical Properties of Aerosols Over Land With Directional Polarimetric Camera Observations and an Adaptive Algorithm
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) is a polarization sensor mounted on Chinese Caofen-5 satellite. It has the capability of observing multispectral, multiangular, and polarized light, and can be used to monitor global aerosols and clouds. This work developed an adaptive algorithm to retrieve aerosol properties based on DPC measurements. It performs initial surface property estimations, aerosol parameter retrievals, surface parameter adjustments, and result assessments. In the algorithm, it allows global aerosol optical depths (AODs) and Angstrom exponents (AEs) to be retrieved. The AOD values show good consistency with that from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The regression line between AODs from DPC and AERONET is y = 0.895x + 0.056, with a correlation coefficient of 0.894, and 49% of the DPC-retrieved AODs are within the expected error range of +/-(15%AOD + 0.05). For the AEs, the regression line is y = 0.728x + 0.395, the correlation coefficient is 0.763, and 41.4% of the AEs are within the error range of (AE +/- 0.4). We also investigated the passible influence of AOD errors retrieved from the DPC measurements over three typical areas. It was found that though the DPC-retrieved dust aerosols did not show so good consistency with the MODIS measurements as the smoke aerosols, the retrievals still matched well on the whole. It demonstrates the potential of DPC and the adaptive algorithm for aerosol remote sensing.

TI  - Improved SSD based aircraft remote sensing image target detection
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LIQUID CRYSTALS AND DISPLAYS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem that the accuracy and real-time performance of current aircraft remote sensing image target detection algorithms can not be balanced, an aircraft remote sensing image target detection algorithm based on single shot multibox detector(SSD) is proposed. Firstly, the improved deep residual network is used to replace the skeleton network of SSD. For the problems of lack of feature information association between feature maps, and different channels from feature maps have no weight values, this paper designs a new feature pyramid network with feature receptive field enhancement module and attention mechanism module. The network is used to fuse the feature information of different levels and the weight coefficients between the training feature channels, so that both the deep network and the shallow network can obtain fusion features with rich structural levels, which provides a good prerequisite for the classification and positioning of the subsequent network. In addition, the focus classification loss function is also used in the improved SSD algorithm to solve the problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples. Related experiments are carried out on the aircraft remote sensing data set, and the average accuracy reaches 92.45%, and the frame per second is 35.6. The results show that the improved SSD algorithm can balance high detection accuracy and real-time performance at the same time.

TI  - Quantifying Uncertainties in the Partitioned Swell Heights Observed From CFOSAT SWIM and Sentinel-1 SAR via Triple Collocation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radars (SARs) operating in wave mode and the real aperture radar (RAR) called Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM) onboard the China-France Oceanography SATellite (CFOSAT) are the only two kinds of spaceborne radars providing directional ocean wave information globally. To quantify the absolute uncertainties in the swell wave heights of a specific wave system (Hss) observed from these two spaceborne sensors, a triple colocation error model is exploited via WaveWatch III (WW3) wave model hindcasts for the first time. After implementing spatiotemporal collocation, cross-assigning swell partitions, and rejecting suspicious data, a database of the optimal-matched Hss triplets (S-1, SWIM, and WW3) is determined over a one-year period (June 2020-June 2021). Qualitatively, traditional dual intercomparisons indicate the inconsistency between the Hss from both SAR and RAR radars in terms of systematic biases. Furthermore, the triple collocated error analysis quantitatively reveals that, at a global scale, SWIM onboard CFOSAT has the least uncertainty in Hss [similar to 0.2-m root mean square error (RMSE) and similar to 11% scatter index (SI)] compared with S-1 SAR (0.35-0.50-m RMSE and 17%-26% SI depending on incidence modes) and WW3, under the assumption that the random errors of the three data sources are independent, indicating that the newly launched SWIM instrument is an invaluable resource of directional wave information for the scientific community. The results are dis cussed with respect to regional error characteristics along with a feasible explanation of error sources. The findings could be helpful for better understanding and synergistically exploiting the Hss datasets from these two spaceborne radars.

AB  - To precisely describe the dynamics of vegetation cover in high-density urban areas, this study evaluates the spatial and temporal consistency of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multiple satellite data sources. The study areas of Downtown Beijing target at two scales: the district scale, and the neighborhood scale. Results show that Planet, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS share a similar spatial pattern; Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS correlate in the temporal change of NDVI at both spatial scales in 2019, but AVHRR does not present useful information of spatial patterns of urban green space or urban vegetation dynamics at these two scales. Seasonal contrast derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 can be visualized through seasonal variation ratio to assist urban green space planning. This study highlights the usefulness of existing satellite observations in monitoring a variety of urban greening typologies at the neighborhood scale for improving urban environmental planning.

TI  - WETLAND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT MONITORING IN SICHUAN PROVINCE BASED ON WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK SECURITY
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - China's total wetland area is more than 65.9 million hectares, the wetland area accounts for 1/10 of the world's total wetland area, but China has not developed an effective measure to manage all kinds of resources, uncontrolled reclamation leads to a sharp decrease in China's wetland area. In order to better protect the wetland environment, wireless sensors are used to monitor the ecological environment of all wetlands in Sichuan Province in real time. Based on the Landsat remote sensing data in 2010 and 2020 in Qionghai Prefecture, Sichuan Province, and supported by wireless sensor technology, this paper interprets remote sensing images using remote sensing observation and interpretation technology. The ecological environment comprehensive assessment index (CEI) was obtained based on the ecological environment system health index, and the landscape pattern of wetland in this area was predicted. The index results show that the change of land use pattern significantly reduces the area of cultivated land and water, increases the patch density and destroys the landscape elements, and the wetland area in Qionghai decreases 436.5hm2. The coverage quality of vegetation was degraded by enlarging the coverage area of medium and low matter and reducing the coverage area of high vegetation. The ecological environment grade of wetland in Qionghai region of Sichuan province is grade iii . The change response, structure state and health status of wetland are not ideal when the ecological environment increases the pressure of wetland. In this paper, a CEI comprehensive index prediction model was established in Qionghai Lake, and the predicted ecological environment index was 0.524 in 2022. The comprehensive index of ecological environment of wetland in Qionghai lake region has been continuously decreasing, and the ecological environment of Qionghai lake has been continuously deteriorating by 2020.

TI  - INFLUENCES OF ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS ON SALINIZATION IN THE YANQI BASIN, CHINA, FROM 1990 TO 2018
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Prevention of soil salinization is key to agriculture in arid and semiarid regions. The first task in managing soil salinity is to understand its spatiotemporal characteristics, causal factors and influences, both over large regions and within individual fields. In the past 20 years, large-scale salinization control and water-saving irrigation technique have been widely carried out in arid regions of Northwest China, resulting in significant change in soil and water environment in irrigated areas. In the Yanqi Basin, the variation of salinization is mainly secondary salinization area affected by human interference. At present, the situated on the interactions among salinization area variations, anthropogenic interference have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we analyzed salinization area variations in the Yanqi Basin using Landsat-TM/ETM image data from 1990 to 2018. Within the study period, the salinization in the area have undergone with four stages: shrinkage in 1990-2000, expansion in 2000-2005, significantly decrease in 2005-2010, tend to be stable in 2010-2018. The value of NDVI and the Electrical Conductivity (EC 1:5) of Soil were used to an indirectly or directly reflect the degree of soil salinization in an area. The land use transfer matrix was used to obtain the changes in land use types; Population growth and Agricultural expansion and increasing water consumption are the main factors associated with decreased salinization area. Our research is anticipated to promote sustainable agricultural development in Xinjiang and other oasis agricultural ecosystems around the world.

TI  - Paddy Rice Mapping Using a Dual-Path Spatio-Temporal Network Based on Annual Time-Series Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice is one of the main foods of the global population. To guarantee paddy rice acreage is essential to ensure food security. Currently, techniques for large-area paddy field mapping rely mainly on complex rule-based machine learning algorithms. But it is difficult for them to achieve an optimal balance between discriminability and robustness. In this article, we proposed a novel deep learning-based approach for large-scale paddy rice mapping, termed dual-path interactive network (DPIN). An annual time-series Sentinel-2 remote sensing images are used as data source. Taking several areas of interest over the middle and lower Yangtze River plain of China as experimental fields, our model achieves an F1-score of 91.22% on the test dataset, which is 1.09% higher than the existing state-of-the-art predictive model, and its inference speed is 1.18 times faster than it. DPIN-Lite is a lightweight variant of DPIN, and while keeping a competitive mapping accuracy, its inference speed is 1.91 times faster than the compared method (with the best score except for DPIN and DPIN-Lite).

AB  - Snow cover plays a significant part in global surface radiation budget, hydrologic cycle and climate change. High computational efficiency and consistent accuracy is required to estimate fractional snow cover (FSC) using Landsat-8 OLI data, especially in variable terrain. This study proposes an optimized regression method to estimate FSC in various scenes. This method adaptively adjusts the function parameters according to the relationship of normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and universal ratio snow index (URSI), rather than changing fixed parameters. The main results show that our algorithm yields lower RMSE (13%similar to 19%) and higher correlation (0.70 similar to 0.90) than USGS FSC product. Evaluation in other regions obtains similar results, indicating that this method is feasible to estimate FSC in a larger region. Therefore, it is a potential approach to generate FSC product.

TI  - Deriving Mining-Induced 3-D Deformations at Any Moment and Assessing Building Damage by Integrating Single InSAR Interferogram and Gompertz Probability Integral Model (SII-GPIM)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to timely and accurately estimate the surface deformations in mining areas, especially the 3-D deformations during surface movement. At present, nearly all mining-induced 3-D deformations retrieved by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) pertain to the SAR imaging interval. Research on progressive 3-D deformations during surface movement is limited, and the existing approaches are unsatisfactory in practical engineering. Aiming at these challenges, we proposed a novel method for deriving mining-induced 3-D surface deformations at any moment by integrating single InSAR interferogram (SII), the Gompertz time function, and the probability integral model (PIM), named the SII-GPIM method. We established an inversion approach for GPIM parameters and derived the mining-induced 3-D surface deformations at any moment. Subsequently, we conducted experiments considering two ALOS PALSAR images in the Huaibei mining area. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated in subsidence, tilt, curvature, horizontal displacement, and horizontal strain. Compared with existing methods, the SII-GPIM method is the state of the art. Additionally, we assessed the building damage, performance of parameter inversion, and method generality. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately determine the mining-induced 3-D surface deformations and deformation level at any moment under different geological mining conditions. Moreover, accurate GPIM parameters can be acquired with only two SAR images and traditional measurement is nearly not required. Consequently, the SII-GPIM method owns great value for improving economic efficiency, assessing building damage, and restoring the ecological environment in the mining area.

TI  - Land Surface Freeze/Thaw Detection Over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using FY-3/MWRI Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extent and duration of soil freeze/thaw (F/T) control water and heat exchange, the energy cycle, and climate change. Global warming causes permafrost thawing, which increases carbon emissions and in turn exacerbates climate change. Passive microwave remote sensing has been proven to be effective in monitoring land surface F/T. However, it was found that the applicability of existing passive microwave remote sensing-retrieved F/T products in large-scale areas [such as the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP)] was influenced by some landscape factors, such as the arid climate type and terrain elevation gradient. FengYun-3 (FY-3) series satellites have accumulated nearly ten years of passive microwave data, but there is little work based on FY-3 passive microwave data to see its potential in land surface F/T status monitoring. In this work, we proposed a dynamic method to determine the surface F/T status by combining the edge detection method and discriminant function algorithm from FengYun-3B (FY-3B) X- and Ka-band microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data. Comparing the results against three F/T products based on in situ 5-cm soil temperature, we demonstrate that this algorithm performs best over different validation areas with an overall accuracy of 86.5%. More specifically, the new algorithm improved the accuracy of current F/T products in arid and semiarid regions from 73% to 90%. Additionally, the spatial distribution of frozen days over the QTP of 2018 based on the new algorithm has good consistency with the permafrost map. However, the accuracy is influenced by snowmelt and appears to be overestimated for thaw soil during the day. This algorithm performs well in QTP areas with complex topography and climate types and holds the promise of providing users with highly accurate F/T products on larger and even global scales.

TI  - Semisupervised Multiscale Generative Adversarial Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Image
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images based on deep neural networks has gained wide attention recently. Although many methods have achieved amazing performance, they need large amounts of labeled images to distinguish the differences in angle, color, size, and other aspects for small targets in remote sensing data sets. However, with a few labeled images, it is difficult to extract the key features of small targets. We propose a semisupervised multiscale generative adversarial network (GAN), which not only utilizes the multipath input and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module but leverages unlabeled images and semisupervised learning strategy to improve the performance of small target segmentation in semantic segmentation when labeled data amount is small. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with insufficient labeled data.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the data set of AVHRR GIMMS, TERRA/AQUA MODIS NDVI, and climate data from 1982 to 2018, CASA model, GIS spatial analysis, and mathematical statistics were used to study the changing law in the category of time and space, spatial distribution, and the correlativity between the NPP and meteorological factors in the sandy land of China's Seasonal Freezing-Thawing Typical Region. The results showed that the average annual NPP value of vegetation in the growing season of the sandy land from 1982 to 2018 fluctuated between 217.65-356.61 gC/m(2)a, showing an obvious seasonality and a significant increase. The spatial distribution of NPP in the sandy land in the near 37a is significantly different. There are significant seasonal differences in vegetation responses to temperature, precipitation, wind speed, evaporation, and other meteorological factors in different regions. The increase of vegetation cover in sandy land of China's Seasonal Freezing-Thawing Typical Region is controlled by regional atmospheric circulation and human dynamics.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Error-Correction Models Based on the Matched Pixel Scale Ground "Truth": A Case Study of MCD43A3 V006 Over the Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation merely provides the "impression of accuracy" of satellite products but does not deal with their errors. There have been several error correction/adjustment models. Nevertheless, their performances have not been evaluated and compared. In this study, three typical models, namely random forests (RF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and Kalman filter (KF) were comprehensively evaluated based on the pixel scale ground "truth" regarding their ability to correct errors of coarse-resolution satellite albedo products. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer albedo product (i.e., MCD43A3 V006) was utilized as an example due to its widespread use and application. These three models all show significant improvements regarding the accuracy of the corrected MCD43A3. Root-mean-square error (RMSEs) decreased from 0.037-0.020, 0.021, and 0.025 for RF, CDF, and KF, respectively. Biases were reduced from -0.018-0.004, -0.001, and -0.001 for these three models, respectively. And R-2 was increased from 0.585-0.849, 0.823, and 0.764 for RF, CDF, and KF, respectively. Generally, RF shows the best overall performance, followed by CDF and KF. These three models are more adept at handling the bias of MCD43A3 than their consistency with respect to the pixel scale ground "truth", and the improvement is the most significant at the sites with large errors. Nevertheless, the performance of RF shows dependence on both the number and representativeness of training samples. When these conditions were not satisfied, CDF performs best in this situation. Regarding the stability of their performance, RF performs better in reducing RMSE while CDF performs better in reducing Bias and improving consistency.

TI  - FRPNet: A Feature-Reflowing Pyramid Network for Object Detection of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a significant and fundamental task in the remote sensing field, object detection has received increasing attention and research studies. However, geospatial object detection is still a challenge owing to the dramatic variation in object scales, intraclass differences, and interclass similarity from multiscale and multiclass objects. To deal with these problems, an end-to-end feature-reflowing pyramid network (FRPNet) is proposed in this letter. FRPNet has two advantages that contribute to improve object detection accuracy. First, we embed a nonlocal block into the backbone in order to get the relevancy between different regions of the geospatial image for obtaining discriminative features. Furthermore, a feature-reflowing pyramid structure is proposed to generate high-quality feature presentation for each scale through fusing fine-grained features from the adjacent lower level, which improves the detection capability for multiscale and multiclass objects. Experiments on a public remote sensing data set DIOR illustrate that FRPNet can significantly improve the performance when compared to several state-of-the-art detection approaches in terms of mean average precision (mAP).

TI  - Influence of natural and anthropogenic controls on runoff in the Keriya River, central Tarim Basin, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential impact of natural factors on the runoff of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) has been largely ignored in the Tarim Basin, China. A representative example is the Keriya River. To quantify the long-term dynamic variations in lower reach surface runoff of IRES, river length, defined as the distance between a selected fix point along the perennial river segment to its dynamic, ephemeral end, was used as an indicator. Using a total of 272 remote sensing images, we digitized and measured the distance (river length) between the center of Yutian County and the river's end point on each image, and then calculated monthly inter-annual and intra-annual variations in length of the lower Keriya River from 2000 to 2019. Hydrometeorological data were combined with descriptors of anthropogenic disturbances to assess the relative influence of natural factors and anthropogenic disturbances on lower reach river runoff. The results showed that intra-annual variations in river length fluctuated seasonally, with the minimum value occurring in June; two main peaks occurred in March and August. The minimum June value in river length was closely linked to an increase in agricultural water demand and a decrease in upper reach runoff. The August peak in river length was related to the peak values in upper reach runoff and agricultural water demand; upper reach runoff made a significant contribution because the former was about 20% more than the latter in summer. The March peak corresponded to elevated lower reach groundwater levels and to the melting of ice along river channels. Inter-annual variations in river length were due to inter-annual variations in upper reach runoff and middle reach agricultural water use which increased slightly during the study period. Inter-annual variations in frequency and amplitude of the fluctuations in river length were mainly controlled by changes in upper reach runoff. The minimum in river length in 2009 was consistent with the low in upper reach runoff of the Keriya River and other rivers in the Tarim Basin. The most significant factors controlling variations in river length are natural in origin.

TI  - NAU-Net: A New Deep Learning Framework in Glacial Lake Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake mapping is essential for understanding the response of glacial lakes to climate change and the risk assessment of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Given that glacial lakes have little area compared with background objects, extracting glacial lakes high precisely is still challenging. Recently, U-Net, a deep learning (DL) method, has shown great potential in glacial lake extraction, due to its elaborate encoder-decoder structure and powerful skip connections. However, the skip connections transmit a lot of information irrelevant to glacial lakes from the low-level appearance features to the high-level semantic features, leading to inefficient utilization of the low-level features. In this letter, we propose a normalized difference water index (NDWI) attention U-Net (NAU-Net) for pixel-wise glacial lake segmentation, which utilizes NDWI as a spatial attention to highlight the signals of water regions in low-level feature maps, thereby making the network pay more attention to glacial lakes. Compared with the classical networks and the state-of-the-art non-DL methods, our NAU-Net shows better performance on glacial lake extraction.

AB  - Fine-scale population distribution data play an essential role in numerous fields, In this paper, we have developed an appropriate method that using a random forest algorithm to down-scale the town-level population distribution to the grid level. the method was supported by remote sensing data and social sensing data to obtain a population distribution map with a spatial resolution of 5m x 5m. Compared with WorldPop (100m x 100m). our method has well accuracy (PearsonR = 0.7985, RMSE = 613.5037, p <0.0001). This method has reference significance for the micro-mapping of urban population distribution.

AB  - Joint classification of multisource remote sensing data is a very meaningful yet challenging task. Especially when the actual scene composition is complex, spectral confusing categories overlapping and different appearances of the same object will bring great challenges for classification. In this paper, a novel Dual Attention Fusion Network (DAFNet) is proposed to solve the above problems. Firstly, a spectral attention block is designed to highlight or suppress the channel map, so as to better distinguish the spectral confusing categories. At the same time, we introduce a spatial attention block that integrates the features of all locations by weighted sum, to ignore the effect of spatial differences. Experimental results on real dataset show that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification results compared to other competitive works.

AB  - To investigate the differences in spectral features between smoke and other typical features, and to achieve remote sensing recognition of forest fire smoke. This paper takes muli county, liangshan, Sichuan province as the study area, uses Sentinel 2 multispectral images as the data source, extracts smoke, clouds, water bodies, vegetation, and bare ground image elements samples, builds forest fire smoke recognition models based on machine learning algorithms such as decision tree algorithm, support vector machine algorithm, and neural network algorithm, extracts the sum parameter of the reflection peak difference(SPRPD) and the product parameter of the reflection peak difference(PPRPD) to improve the models. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracies of the three models are 97.3%, 99.2%, and 99.4%, respectively, and the neural network model has the highest accuracy. The improved smoke recognition model reduces the probability of misclassification of thin clouds into smoke, and the model accuracies are improved to 99.0%,99.5%and 99.9%, respectively. The study shows that the combined feature parameters of the reflection peak band can effectively distinguish thin clouds and smoke, improve the accuracy of smoke recognition, and the smoke recognition model based on the neural network algorithm can effectively identify forest fire smoke.

AB  - In order to explore the radiation performance of FY-3D satellite in the visible short wave infrared band, this paper takes Dunhuang National Calibration Field as the research area, extracts the apparent radiance of the corresponding band based on the reflectance basis method of site calibration, and uses the apparent radiance obtained from the official calibration coefficient as the relative true value for relative difference analysis. The results show that the absolute value of the average relative difference of the apparent radiance of all bands is 2.30%, and the difference of the apparent radiance calculated by the two methods is very small; In addition, for images with large observation angles, after BRDF correction for ground reflectivity, the average relative difference can be reduced by 2.90% -3.87%, which proves the necessity of BRDF correction for images with large observation angles. The research shows that the radiation performance of FY-3D satellite is good, and there is no obvious sensor attenuation in the visible near infrared band.

AB  - Persistent scatterer (PS) techniques are used to identify radar pixels with minimal phase decorrelation artifacts. Existing PS selection algorithms mostly focus on analyzing the phase stability at each radar pixel independently, and the spatial phase consistency is not fully exploited. In this study, we developed a new PS selection algorithm based on the phase similarity between nearby radar pixels. We tested this algorithm using C-band Envisat data over the San Luis Valley, Colorado, and C-band Sentinel-1 data over the Greater Houston area. In both cases, our algorithm identified PS pixels with lower false positive and false negative rates than existing PS identification techniques. We used InSAR phase measurements at those PS pixels to solve for surface deformation time series, which are consistent with independent validation data sets. Our InSAR processing strategy reveals subtle deformation signatures that are otherwise undetectable over densely vegetated regions.

AB  - Phase decorrelation, caused by changes in the surface scattering properties between two radar acquisitions, is a major limiting factor for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface deformation analysis over vegetated terrain. Persistent Scatterer (PS) techniques have been developed to identify high-quality radar pixels suffering from minimal decorrelation artifacts. However, existing PS selection algorithms are often based on the statistics of InSAR amplitude and phase measurements at each individual radar pixel, and scattering signal models that take into account the phase correlation of nearby PS pixels have not been fully developed. Here, we present a new PS selection algorithm based on the similarity of phase observations between nearby radar pixels. We used this algorithm to analyze 25 C-band Envisat SAR scenes acquired over the San Luis Valley, Colorado, and 93 C-band Sentinel-1 SAR scenes acquired over the Greater Houston area, Texas. At both the test sites, the presence of dense vegetation leads to severe phase decorrelation artifacts even in some interferograms with short temporal baselines. Our algorithm can reduce the number of false positive and false negative PS pixels identified from an existing PS identification algorithm. The improved PS identification accuracy allows us to substantially increase the total number of high-quality interferograms that are suitable for time series analysis. We reconstructed spatially coherent InSAR phase observations through an interpolation between PS pixels, and recovered subtle deformation signals that are otherwise undetectable. In both the cases, the superior performance of our PS processing strategy was demonstrated using a large number of independent ground-truth data.

AB  - The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation provides temporally dense and high spatial resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The open data policy and global coverage of Sentinel-1 enables applications that require long time series, such as modelling surface deformation rates from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data, to be scaled-up and generate continent-scale products. In this paper, we present a workflow to generate interferometric products from the Copernicus Australasia Regional Data Hub archive of Single Look Complex (SLC) Sentinel-1 data, with the objective to derive a continent-wide ground surface deformation map for Australia. The proposed workflow can be used to generate Sentinel-1 InSAR Analysis Ready Data (ARD) suitable for ongoing monitoring of ground deformation.

CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - The nighttime light (NTL) remote sensed imagery has been applied in monitoring human activities from many perspectives. As the two most widely used NTL satellites, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) have different spatial and radiometric resolutions. Thus, some long-time series analysis cannot be conducted without effective and accurate cross-calibration of these two datasets. In this study, we proposed a deep-learning based model to simulate VIIRS-liked DMSP NTL data by integrating the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data product from MODIS. By evaluating the spatial pattern of the results, the modified Self-Supervised Sparse-to-Dense networks delivered satisfying results of spatial resolution downscaling. The quantitative analysing of the simulated VIIRS-liked DMSP NTL with original VIIRS NTL showed a good consistency at the pixel level of four selected sub datasets with R-2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.76, and RMSE ranging from 3.96-9.55. Our method presents that the deep learning model can learn from relatively raw data instead of fine processed data based on expert knowledge to cross-sensor calibration and simulation NTL data.

TI  - Developing machine learning models with multisource inputs for improved land surface soil moisture in China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and spatially continuous land surface soil moisture (SSM) data will greatly benefit analyses of heat transfer, energy exchange and agricultural dryness. To obtain spatiotemporally consistent SSM information, five machine learning (ML) models, i.e., polynomial regression (PR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LR), elastic net regression (EnR) and random forest regression (RfR) models, were generated to map the regional SSM in the 0-10 cm soil layer across the study area. Multiple features, including the geographical location, elevation, vegetation coverage, soil texture, seasonal patterns and satellite-retrieved SSM product from Fengyun-3C (FY-3C), were selected as the input variables for the proposed ML models. In situ SSM measurements from the Chinese Automatic Soil Moisture Observation Stations (CASMOS) were used as the reference dataset. The error metrics, including the coefficient of correlation (R), mean relative error (MRE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), between the measured SSM values and those estimated using the different models were calculated. Among those ML models, the RfR model showed the best performance in the training (R = 0.981, MRE = 7.3%, ubRMSE = 0.021 cm(3)/cm(3), and MAE = 0.015 cm(3)/cm(3)) and testing (R = 0.789, MRE = 22.2%, ubRMSE = 0.065 cm(3)/cm(3), and MAE = 0.047 cm(3)/cm (3)) processes and was applied to map the regional SSM values and measure the importance of each input feature. The results indicated that geographical location, i. e., latitude (35.84%) and longitude (16.96%), contributed the most to the SSM estimation model, followed by elevation (14.88%), vegetation coverage (9.75%), the FY-3C SSM product (8.30%), the soil texture (8.04%) and seasonal patterns (6.23%). In addition, the SSM estimations across mainland China matched the spatiotemporal patterns of historical precipitation well, which indicated the feasibility of achieving accurate and consistent land surface (0-10 cm) soil moisture monitoring results using the established RfR model with appropriately selected input features.

TI  - Decorin promotes decidual M1-like macrophage polarization via mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in recurrent pregnancy loss
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a distressing disorder that seriously affects the physical and psychological health of women. RPL is also a sentinel risk marker for future obstetric complications and warrants in-depth investigation. Abnormal polarization and functions of decidual macrophages are associated with RPL; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.Methods: Decorin expression, localization, and content in the decidua of women with normal pregnancy (NP) and those with RPL were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The profiles of decidual macrophage subsets were determined using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence in both groups. The correlation between decorin content and the proportion of decidual macrophage subsets in the decidua of early NP women was determined using Pearson analysis. The effects of decorin on the polarization and functions of macrophages were assessed in an in-vitro model of Raw264.7 cells via flow cytometry, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. Moreover, the mitochondrial metabolism in Raw264.7 cells under decorin administration was measured via flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Thirty-three pregnant mice were included in the in vivo model and underwent different treatments. The embryo abortion rate, macrophage phenotype in the spleen and uteri, and placental development were evaluated using flow cytometry and hematoxylin-eosin staining.Results: Decorin, derived from decidual stromal cells, was highly expressed in the decidua of women with RPL. A positive correlation between decorin content and the proportion of M1-like macrophages was also observed in the decidua of early NP women. In vitro studies showed that decorin treatment inhibited macrophage polarization to M2-like subsets and boosted the inflammatory response, which was related to enhanced anaerobic glycolysis, increased mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, reduced mitochondrial mass, and activation of the myeloid differentiation primary response 88-nuclear factor-Kappa B signaling pathway. Adoptive transfer of decorin-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages in pregnant C57BL/6 mice increased the embryo absorption, accompanied by impaired fetal vascularization. Conclusions: Decidual stromal cell-derived decorin can polarize decidual macrophages toward the M1 phenotype by regulating mitochondrial metabolism, resulting in the occurrence of RPL.

AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a kind of deep neural networks, which extracts image features through multiple convolution layers and is widely used in image classifications. However, the classical CNN cannot perform pixel-by-pixel classification, resulting in poor accuracy and unclear segmentation under complex image background, especially in crop remote sensing image. To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient modify the Fully Convolution Networks (FCN) algorithm to classify empty area species on crop remote sensing data set. Firstly, the ignoring connection structure and the conditional random field were used to modify the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) that was suitable for recognizing the empty areas in paddy. Then, the dynamic network clipping method was used to compress FCN and eliminate redundant parameters to reduce the amount of calculation and accelerate the model regression. The comparison experiment results showed that the comprehensive performance index of the FCN16s model performed best, and the amount of FCN16s parameters after compression was reduced by nearly 92.3% compared with before.

AB  - Many cities in Southeast Asia suffer from severe flooding due to the increasing rainfall intensity caused by climate change. Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is an example. Jakarta experienced four devastating floods during the past 20 years and is also facing a serious challenge with a land subsidence problem due to overexploitation of groundwater combined with the rising sea level. In view of these phenomena, a capital relocation project is proposed by the Indonesian government to move the capital city to Kalimantan island. This study provides flood assessment of the new capital city of Indonesia at its present condition. Due to the scarcity of good quality digital elevation model (DEM) data, which is a key component for the accuracy of flood simulations, a recently introduced DEM improvement scheme using remote sensing technology and artificial neural network (ANN) was applied. The scheme improved two publicly accessible satellite DEM data, SRTM DEM and AW3D30 DEM. These data, together with a multispectral imagery of Sentinel-2 satellite data, are used to derive a high-accuracy DEM using ANN. The DEM improvement scheme was tested at different countries (France and New Zealand) prior to its application on the study area. MIKE 21 Flow Model Flexible Mesh (MIKE 21 FM) was selected and applied to Kalimantan to simulate flood and identify the flood prone areas. Input data to MIKE 21 FM were DEM (from SRTM and AW3D30) and rainfall proxy data from WRF driven by ERAI. This study showed the flood map of 100-year return period of the study area.

AB  - Taking Shouxian Bagong Mountain Forest Park in Huainan City, China, a typical forest park in the climate transition zone as the study area, and based on the hyperspectral image of OHS-2 data, field measured sample data, as well as the extraction of spectral information, the factors with high correlation with the sample biomass were selected as the independent variables of modeling. The biomass estimation models of main forest types were constructed by regression model and compared with the modeling results of artificial neural network, and the quantitative reconstruction of forest biomass was realized. The results show that the main tree species included Platycladus orientalis (Linn) Franco, Pistacia chinensis Bunge, Castanea seguinii Dode, and Vernicia fordii. The ideal independent variables for each tree species were Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Vogelmann Red Edge Index 1 and Anthocyanin Reflectance Index 1 and Ratio Vegetation Index 3, respectively. The best fitting models of the first three of those types were exponential functions, while the best fitting model of Vernicia fordii was power function. The root-mean-square errors of the four main vegetation models were 25.806, 15.394, 26.058 and 22.705Mg/ha, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring Large-Scale Hydraulic Engineering Using Sentinel-1 InSAR: A Case Study of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Middle Route of South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) Project,known as one of the greatest hydraulic projects of China, undertakes most of domestic and industrial water use in the Beijing-Tianjin area, as well as a part of ecological water use. The whole canal should be monitored to ensure a continuous water supply for water-receiving areas. Compared with traditional ground-based monitoring tools limited by the low distribution density, intensive labor force, and huge cost, the satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) with wide coverage, high-frequency revisiting, and low cost is more suitable for monitoring large-scale infrastructures. In this study, we employed the Sentinel-1 data to monitor the canal of the Middle Route of the SNWD Project within Henan Province. The deformation rates along the canal were obtained by using persistent scatterer InSAR, from which a total of 20 deformed canal sections and seven suspected deformed canal sections were identified. Among them, the Shahe aqueduct is overall stable except for the Shahe Beam Aqueduct and Lushanpo Landing Aqueduct. The Yuzhou-Changge canal passes through a subsidence funnel with a maximum deformation rate of about -20 mm/year. The InSAR-derived deformation coincides well with the in-situ leveling measurements over the Yuzhou-Changge canal. Their correlation is 0.95 and the root mean square error of their differences is 2.41 mm/year. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite InSAR for monitoring large-scale hydraulic engineering. It can be combined with ground leveling to achieve overall investigations and detailed monitoring, largely improving the efficiency and cost of the current ground monitoring system.

TI  - Convolution-Embedded Vision Transformer With Elastic Positional Encoding for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformer, especially vision transformer (ViT), is attracting increasing attention in various computer vision (CV) tasks. However, two urgent problems exist for the ViT: 1) owing to its attending to an image in the patch level, the ViT seems to have a better performance in fetching global representations but is limited in extracting local features, which is an inherent advantage for the convolutional neural network (CNN) and 2) the learnable positional encoding plays a positive role, but limits the cross-resolution ability of the network. Specifically, the pre-trained model could only generate images of the same size during training. To conquer the two problems, we propose a novel convolution-embedded ViT with elastic positional encoding in this article. On one hand, we propose a joint CNN and self-attention (CSA) network to collaboratively extract local and global features. On the other hand, we propose to integrate the elastic CNN-based positional encoder into the framework to solve the rigid limitation of the ViT in cross resolution issues and improve the performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on IKONOS and WorldView-2 with 4- and 8-band multispectral (MS) images, respectively. The visual and numerical results show the competitive performance of the proposed method.

TI  - Reconstructing High-Precision Coral Reef Geomorphology from Active Remote Sensing Datasets: A Robust Spatial Variability Modified Ordinary Kriging Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active remote sensing technology represented by multi-beam and lidar provides an important approach for the effective acquisition of underwater coral reef geomorphological information. A spatially continuous surface model of coral reef geomorphology reconstructed from active remote sensing datasets can provide important geomorphological parameters for the research of coral reef geomorphological and ecological changes. However, the surface modeling methods commonly used in previous studies, such as ordinary kriging (OK) and natural neighborhood (NN), often represent a "smoothing effect", which causes the strong spatial variability of coral reefs to be imprecisely reflected by the reconstructed surfaces, thus affecting the accurate calculation of subsequent geomorphological parameters. In this study, a spatial variability modified OK (OK-SVM) method is proposed to reduce the impact of the "smoothing effect" on the high-precision reconstruction of the complex geomorphology of coral reefs. The OK-SVM adopts a collaborative strategy of global parameter transformation, local residual correction, and extremum correction to modify the spatial variability of the reconstructed model, while maintaining high local accuracy. The experimental results show that the OK-SVM has strong robustness to spatial variability modification. This method was applied to the geomorphological reconstruction of the northern area of a coral atoll in the Nansha Islands, South China Sea, and the performance was compared with that of OK and NN. The results show that OK-SVM has higher numerical accuracy and attribute accuracy in detailed morphological fidelity, and is more adaptable in the geomorphological reconstruction of coral reefs with strong spatial variability. This method is relatively reliable for achieving high-precision reconstruction of complex geomorphology of coral reefs from active remote sensing datasets, and has potential to be extended to other geomorphological reconstruction applications.

TI  - An Investigation on Inter-Calibrating EMI/GF-5 With TROPOMI/S5p in Ultraviolet-Visible Spectra
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inter-calibration is a general method to harmonize the in-orbit spectral radiance of the target instrument with the reference instrument in the visible and infrared spectra. This study proposes and applies an inter-calibration method to the space-based Ultraviolet and visible spectra (UVIS) grating radiometers. Based on pixel pairs derived from simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNO), the in-orbit spectral radiances from the environmental trace gas monitoring instrument onboard the Chinese high-resolution remote sensing satellite GaoFen-5 (EMI/GF-5) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite (TROPOMI/S5p) are compared through the double difference (DD) method, where the individual window channel method is also adopted for comparison. Uncertainties from SNO thresholds, instrument spectral specification, and radiative transfer simulation are estimated. The SNO thresholds, including time, distance, viewing angle, and scene uniformity of 300 s, 3 km, 0.01, and 0.01, are determined to get collocations for UVIS instruments. Several factors, including instrument line shape (ILS), instrument spectral accuracy, reference solar spectrum, surface albedo, and atmospheric polarization, can influence the radiometric difference obtained by the DD method. Accurate SAO2010 solar spectrum and wavelength accuracy can substantially reduce the dependence of radiometric difference on wavelength. Errors introduced by scalar approximation and parameterized ILS can be neglected. The surface albedo greatly affects the simulated radiance at wavelengths longward of 330 nm. The results show that radiometric differences obtained by using the DD method are consistent with those derived from the individual window channel method, with a discrepancy of 0.4%. An ocean-land calibration difference of 1.5% is found between EMI and TROPOMI at the UVIS band. Inter-calibration using the DD method can minimize the spectral variations in full spectral radiance inter-comparison for grating hyperspectral instruments, and the radiometric difference can be estimated comprehensively. The wavelength dependence can also be easily derived from the results of the DD method. The DD method is recommended for radiometric comparison for UVIS hyperspectral spectrometers.

AB  - Sea ice mapping in polar region is crucial for understanding the global climate change, benefiting disaster control for local community as well as providing accurate navigation for mariners. Currently, meteorological ice services in many countries manually create ice-charts, which is time-consuming work from domain experts. Machine learning and deep learning methodology can be utilized to automate ice charting, however, large amounts of reliable training data is crucial for implementing the technology successfully, and training data itself is sparse and costly to obtain in the Arctic areas. To obtain more training data, we proposed a two-stage methodology which incorporate the physics into training dataset generation procedure. Firstly, a physics-based incidence angle aware algorithm was employed for generating better connected and fewer reference classes to be manually labelled for training. Secondly, we enrich the training data to a balanced training set by using the physical knowledge regarding incidence angle dependence of SAR intensity. This many-fold enriched dataset can then be used for pixel-wise sea ice versus water classification by using a reduced UNet architecture. The primary result shows the sea-ice and water edges can be reasonably delineated by utilizing the physical based training dataset generation together with the reduced UNet architecture.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, China's environmental monitoring means have basically remained in the conventional stage, which can no longer meet the needs of the new situation of national ecological environment monitoring and management. With the development of time technology, remote sensing technology with large-scale, fast and massive information has become an important technical means of ecological environment monitoring. Remote sensing technology can realise large-scale, synchronous and continuous monitoring of the surface environment from the air, break through the limitations of the previous ground environmental monitoring, and fundamentally change the traditional mode of environmental monitoring. Satellite remote sensing technology cooperates with conventional ground monitoring, which constitutes an advanced sky earth integrated monitoring system, which improves the ability and efficiency of environmental monitoring in an all-round way. In the process of increasing efforts in environmental protection, the necessity and urgency of the application of medium and high-resolution satellite remote sensing data in the field of environmental protection are becoming more and more prominent. It has become a consensus to develop China's advanced image processing software platform for ecological environment monitoring. This paper expounds and analyses the main information sources, main image processing software platforms and typical cases of the application of medium and high-resolution satellite data in the field of ecological environment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Lead is an important feature of the Arctic ice cover, with possible contents of thin ice (TI) or open water (OW). In this letter, we present an algorithm for lead detection based on brightness temperature observations from a single thermal infrared (TIR) channel of Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager Type II (MERSI-II) onboard the Chinese FY-3D satellite. Lead contents are classified into OW and TI with support information from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Results are evaluated based on the visual interpretation of MERSI-II TIR and Sentinel-2 near infrared (NIR) data. The accuracy is found to be 85.6% for lead detection and 67% and 52% for TI and OW within the lead, respectively.

TI  - Trilateration-Based Device-Free Sensing: Two Base Stations and One Passive IRS Are Sufficient
T2  - 2022 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM 2022)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)
CL  - Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL
AB  - The classic trilateration technique can localize each target based on its distances to three anchors with known coordinates. Usually, this technique requires all the anchors and targets, e.g., the satellites and the mobile phones in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), to actively transmit/receive radio signals such that the delay of the one-way radio signal propagated between each anchor and each target can be measured. Excitingly, this paper will show that the trilateration technique can be generalized to the scenario where one of the three anchors and all the targets merely reflect the radio signals passively as in radar networks, even if the propagation delay between the passive IRS and the passive targets is difficult to be measured directly, and the data association issue for multi-sensor multi-target tracking arises. Specifically, we consider device-free sensing in a cellular network consisting of two base stations (BSs), one passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), and multiple passive targets, to realize integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). The two BSs transmit the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals in the downlink and estimate the locations of the targets based on their reflected signals via/not via the IRS. We propose an efficient trilateration-based strategy that can first estimate the distances of each target to the two BSs and the IRS and then localize the targets. Numerical results show that the considered networked sensing architecture with heterogenous anchors can outperform its counterpart with three BSs.

TI  - Robust Semisupervised Land-Use Classification Using Remote Sensing Data With Weak Labels
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work develops robust semisupervised classifiers to tackle the three most challenging problems in land-use classification using remote sensing data, namely, information imbalance, label noise, and image uncertainty. Limited by technology and cost, collecting clean labels for remote sensing images is difficult and often impractical. The change of environment and time also increases the uncertainty of remote sensing images. To overcome the obstacles incurred by the mixed pixels and weak labels, this work proposes dividing the pixels in remote sensing images into two groups, namely, pixels with accurate labels and those with weak labels, before processing the weakly labeled pixels using a nuclear norm-based cost function. To address the imbalanced data problem in pixels with accurate labels, an improved cross-entropy-based cost function is proposed to weigh the contributions from data of different classes based on their importance by exploiting the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. Finally, an artificial class called "unknown" is proposed to cope with the interference caused by weakly labeled data with unrepresentative spatial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed semisupervised classifier.

TI  - A Novel Method of Monitoring Surface Subsidence Law Based on Probability Integral Model Combined with Active and Passive Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the accurate and high-precision measurement of the deformation field in mining areas using different data sources, the probability integral model was used to process deformation data obtained from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Differential InSAR (DInSAR), and Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) to obtain the complete deformation field. The SBAS-InSAR, DInSAR, and UAV can be used to obtain small-scale, mesoscale, and large-scale deformations, respectively. The three types of data were all superimposed by the Kriging interpolation, and the deformation field was integrated using the probability integral model to obtain the complete high-precision deformation field with complete time series in the study area. The study area was in the WangJiata mine in Western China, where mining was carried out from 12 July 2018 to 25 October 2018, on the 2S201 working face. The first observation was made in June 2018, and steady-state observations were made in April 2019, totaling four UAV observations. During this period, the Canadian Earth Observation Satellite of Radarsat-2 (R2) was used to take 10 SAR images, the surface subsidence mapping was undertaken using DInSAR and SBAS-InSAR techniques, and the complete deformation field of the working face during the 106-day mining period was obtained by using the UAV technique. The results showed that the subsidence basin gradually expanded along the mining direction as the working face advanced. When the mining advance was greater than 1.2-1.4 times the coal seam burial depth, the supercritical conditions were reached, and the maximum subsidence stabilized at the value of 2.780 m. The subsidence rate was basically maintained at 0.25 m/d. Finally, the accuracy of the method was tested by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, and the medium error of the strike was 0.103 m. A new method is reached by the fusion of active and passive remote sensing data to construct efficient, complete and high precision time-series subsidence basins with high precision.

TI  - A Most-Unfavorable-Condition Method for Bridge-Damage Detection and Analysis Using PSP-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main contribution of this study is to provide a new idea to detect bridge damage by using PSP-InSAR technology. A most-unfavorable-condition method is proposed for bridge-damage detection and analysis. The method can determine the specific damaged location and occurrence time by using the differential deformation values of persistent scatterer (PS) points on bridge piers. Taking Beijing Suzhou Bridge as an experimental area, 96 COSMO-SkyMed time-series SAR images were used from September 2011 to November 2017. Deformation values of PS points around Suzhou Bridge were acquired and analyzed. Experimental results show that in July 2017, the unusual maximum differential deformation value was 25.73 mm. It occurred between piers D-3 and D-4 of Suzhou Bridge, and it was deduced that the main girder between piers D-3 and D-4 may have been damaged in July 2017. As a validation, taking the differential deformation value between piers D-3 and D-4 as an input, the maximum tensile stress, and the maximum compressive stress were calculated as 2.1 MPa and 8.4 MPa, respectively, through a finite element model. The tensile stress exceeded the design value of the concrete, further confirming the damage of the girder between piers D-3 and D-4. Moreover, all results are consistent with the Suzhou Bridge damage information shown in existing records, which verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method.

TI  - Feature Selection Method for Open-pit Mine Land Cover Classification Based on Multi-feature Set Using Sentinel-2
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land cover map is the basis of monitoring changes in open-pit mines. However, owing to the limitation of sensor spectral resolution, the misclassification of pixels is inevitable. To reduce the influence of misclassification on the accuracy of open-pit mine land cover classification (LCC), a feature selection method for open-pit mine LCC based on a multi-feature set using Sentinel-2 images is proposed in this study. First, Sentinel-2 images and shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) digital elevation models (DEM) are employed to extract multi-features, including spectral features, topographic features, texture features, and filter features. Then permutation importance (PIMP) feature selection is proposed for selecting optimal features from the multi-feature set. Finally, the results of a practical experiment in Xuzhou City of China are used to verify the validity of the proposed feature selection method. The experimental results show that the multi-feature set can improve the accuracy of open-pit mine LCC and that elevation is the most important feature variable in open-pit mine LCC. Moreover, the PIMP feature selection method can effectively optimize feature combinations to obtain the optimal feature subset. This study provides a useful reference for multi-feature extraction and optimal feature selection in open-pit mine LCC using Sentinel-2 image data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended sediments (TSS) are an important water quality indicator. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of TSS concentrations in summer in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) remain unclear between 2000 and 2020. Among empirical and machine learning models, the random forest (RF) model exhibits the best performance for the PAD with a coefficient of determination, normalized root-means-square error, and relative root-mean-square error of 0.92, 7.51%, and 27.36%, respectively. Our study analyzes the spatiotemporal TSS distribution based on 21 years of Landsat remote sensing data and the RF model. The results showed that the TSS concentrations of the Peace River were elevated in 2000, 2016, 2019, and 2020. The long-term TSS concentration distribution in the PAD showed a decreasing trend from west to east, and the TSS concentrations ranged from 6 to 80 mg/L level and remained stable in Lake Athabasca during the investigated period. Moreover, 57.14% of the PAD area exhibited no significant change between 2000 and 2020. The results of our study provide detailed information for the local government on the TSS concentrations in the PAD. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - A Nonparametric Tropical Cyclone Wind Speed Estimation Model Based on Dual-Polarization SAR Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observation is one of the most popular sources for high-resolution tropical cyclone (TC) wind speed estimation. The scarcity of high wind speed data with good quality restricts the inversion accuracy of high wind speed. It is a challenge to obtain a high-precision wind speed inversion model with sparse data points. In this article, the TC wind speed is successfully estimated from the dual-polarization SAR signal. First, the training dataset with a total of 327 data points is formed using the Sentinel-1A (S-1A) extra-wide / interferometric-wide mode images and their temporal-spatial matched stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) measurements. Then, a novel Nonparametric TC Wind Speed Estimation model (hereafter NWSE model) is proposed with this dataset by using the Bayesian nonparametric general regression method. The wind speed is interpreted as a function of the cross-polarized normalized radar cross sections and incident angle for the NWSE model. Moreover, the wind speed obtained from the co-polarized signal is used to improve the accuracy of NWSE model under low wind speed. Finally, the validation results show the excellent overall consistency between the model retrieved wind speed and the collocated SFMR and Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) measurements. Specifically, considering all the wind speeds, the overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the absolute bias of NWSE model are 2.85 and 2.26 m/s compared with the SMAP wind speed, respectively. When considering the wind speeds larger than 30 m/s, the RMSE and bias of NWSE model are 3.75 and 2.78 m/s, respectively.

TI  - A Taylor Expansion Algorithm for Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Land Surface Temperature
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) with fine spatiotemporal resolution is a much-needed parameter in the earth's surface system. The LST downscaling is an efficient way to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of' LST and has been developed rapidly in recent years. Due to the simple operations and discernable effects of statistical regression and its extension algorithms, these algorithms have been widely researched. However, most statistical regression models assume scale invariance, which makes the downscaled LST inaccurate. This study analyzed the scale effect in the process of LST upscaling/downscaling, then proposed a new algorithm based on Taylor expansion for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODES) LST downscaling. The Taylor expansion algorithm estimates regression coefficients between LST and auxiliary parameters in the consistent scale. It is tested in three typical areas of different landscapes with different auxiliary parameters, and the results are significantly improved compared to the traditional algorithm. However, the new algorithm may introduce the temporal discrepancy between MODIS LST and empirical concavity factor (5), which is estimated with Landsat 8 data, into the downscaling procedure in some circumstances. To discuss the influence of temporal discrepancy. we designed three schemes for pairing MODES and S and analyzed the downscaled results. The results show that the proposed algorithm got the best downscaled results when the MODES LST acquired time is consistent with the time of S. When the time is inconsistent, the pairing scheme of a similar season gives better results than that of different seasons. The algorithm performs generally well so long as the spatial distribution of auxiliary parameters in the date of Landsat 8 acquisition is similar to the date of MODIS acquisition.

TI  - Subfeature Ensemble-Based Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have always played an important role in remote sensing applications. Anomaly detection has become a hot spot in HSI processing in recent years. The popular detecting method is to accurately segment anomalies from the background. Informative bands are very important for the accuracy improvement of the detection technology. However, most of the abnormal targets segmentation methods focus on the usage of all the spectral features, thus are easily affected by redundant bands or feature noise. A hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithm based on subfeature ensemble is proposed in this article. The proposed method consists of the following steps. First, the bands of the original HSI are normalized and randomly divided into several subfeature sets according to different proportions. Second, six methods including the prior-based tensor approximation algorithm (PTA), Reed-Xiaoli method, a low-rank and sparse representation method, a low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition-based Mahalanobis distance method, the graph and total variation regularized low-rank representation-based method, and a method based on tensor principal component analysis are applied to detect anomalies on the original HSI, and the method with the best performance is used to obtain an enhanced feature set. Then, the enhanced features and the subfeatures are ensembled iteratively to construct a new dataset. Finally, the PTA method is operated on the dataset with ensemble features to get the final abnormal target results. Six hyperspectral datasets are used in the experiment. Seven methods are employed as comparisons. The results are analyzed from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed method performs best on all datasets.

TI  - Predicting prognosis of primary pontine hemorrhage using CT image and deep learning
T2  - NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prognosis of primary pontine hemorrhage (PPH) is important for treatment planning and patient management. However, only few clinical factors were reported to have prognostic value to PPH. Here, we propose a deep learning (DL) model that mines high-dimensional prognostic information from computed tomography (CT) images and combines clinical factors for predicting individualized prognosis of PPH. We proposed a multi-task DL model to learn high-dimensional CT features of hematoma and perihematomal areas for predicting the risk of 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality and 90-day functional outcome of PPH simultaneously. We further explored the combination of the DL model and clinical factors by building a combined model. All the models were trained in a training cohort (n = 219) and tested in an independent testing cohort (n = 35). The DL model achieved area under the curve (AUC) of 0.886, 0.886, and 0.759 in predicting 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality and 90-day functional outcome of PPH in the independent testing cohort, which improved over the previously reported new PPH score and the clinical model. When combining the DL model and clinical factors, the combined model achieved improved performance (AUC = 0.920, 0.941, and 0.894), indicating that DL model mines CT information that complements clinical factors. Through DL visualization technique, we found that the internal structure of hematoma and its expansion to perihematomal regions are important for predicting the prognosis of PPH. This DL model provides an easy-to-use way for predicting individualized prognosis of PPH by mining high-dimensional information from CT images, and showed improvement over clinical factors and present methods.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Spatial Data and Intelligence (SpatialDI)
CL  - Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The urbanization process causes the urban heat island effect and affects the urban climate change. The urban heat island intensity is often used to describe the urban thermal environment, but how to objectively and scientifically obtain the urban heat island intensity is a research difficulty. This paper uses remote sensing data, OpenStreetMap data, climate data and other data, based on the local climate zones framework, combined with surface temperature retrieval, GIS spatial analysis and other methods, to study the urban thermal environment differences in Wuhan. The research shows that the rapid acquisition method of the area of interest based on OpenStreetMap data can better realize the local climate classification. The overall accuracy is 77.1% and Kappa coefficient is 0.75, which meets the accuracy requirements. On this basis, by superimposing the results of surface temperature retrieval from remote sensing images, the thermal characteristics of ground objects of different local climate types in the city can be obtained, thereby comprehensively reflecting the differences in the thermal environment in the city.

TI  - Ground GNSS Station Selection to Generate the Global Ionosphere Maps Using the Information Content
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - More and more satellite constellations and ground receivers are available all over the world, and they can provide rich ionospheric remote sensing data sources. Due to the fact that different analysis centers use different generation techniques and different ground stations, their routinely released Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs) have some differences. To study the problems of how many stations and which stations should be optimally chosen to generate the GIMs, a step-by-step iterative method based on the information content is proposed under the framework of 3DVAR data assimilation. This method adopts the information content to qualitatively evaluate the information contribution of a measurement to the reconstructed GIM, and selects the ground station with a maximum information content in every iteration. About 500 ground receivers from the International GNSS Services networks and Multi-GNSS Experiment networks are collected from DOY 001 to DOY 120 in 2018 to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. The results show that the information contribution from the first 100 selected stations is over 70%, and the information contribution from the first 200 chosen stations is up to 87%. When the station selection criterion is taken as 95% of the total information content, nearly 300 stations are needed to reconstruct each GIM. Moreover, the quantitative information contribution from GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, and BEIDOU satellite constellations is preliminarily analyzed.

TI  - Enhanced Warming in Global Dryland Lakes and Its Drivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is sensitive to climate change. Previous studies have found that LSWT warming is occurring on a global scale and is expected to continue in the future. Recently, new global LSWT data products have been generated using satellite remote sensing, which provides an inimitable opportunity to study the LSWT response to global warming. Based on the satellite observations, we found that the warming rate of global lakes is uneven, with apparent regional differences. Indeed, comparing the LSWT warming in different climate zones (from arid to humid), the lakes in drylands experienced more significant warming (0.28 degrees C decade(-1)) than those in semi-humid and humid regions (0.19 degrees C decade(-1)) during previous decades (1995-2016). By further quantifying the impact factors, it showed that the LSWT warming is attributed to air temperature (74.4%), evaporation (4.1%), wind (9.9%), cloudiness (4.3%), net shortwave (3.1%), and net longwave (4.0%) over the lake surface. Air temperature is the main driving force for the warming of most global lakes, so the first estimate quantification of future LSWT trends can be determined from air temperature projections. By the end of the 21st century, the summer air temperature would warm up to 1.0 degrees C (SSP1-2.6) and 6.3 degrees C (SSP5-8.5) over lakes, with a more significant warming trend over the dryland lakes. Combined with their higher warming sensitivity, the excess summer LSWT warming in drylands is expected to continue, which is of great significance because of their high relevance in these water-limited regions.

TI  - Large-Scale Orthorectification of GF-3 SAR Images Without Ground Control Points for Chinas Land Area
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-3 (GF-3) is a C-band multipolarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite with 12 imaging modes. However, its initial positioning accuracy remains unsatisfactory, thereby hindering its use for large-area surveying and mapping. This study proposes a block orthorectification method without ground control points (GCPs) using the GF-3 Fine strip II (FSII) mode. To address the challenges with the accuracy and efficiency of this method, an integrated block orthorectification method was developed to conduct integrated processing of large-scale GF-3 satellite images without GCPs. Geometric calibration was used to improve the absolute positioning accuracy of each SAR image. Then, several tie points (TPs) were extracted using the SAR scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) operator. A parallel matching strategy was used in the block images registration. The block adjustment model was constructed to solve the orientation parameter of all SAR images. The experimental results of 1,468 GF-3 images of China & x2019;s entire land area show a TPs root-mean-square error of 0.724 pixel and 8.014 m for the independent checkpoint, suggesting that the proposed method can effectively improve the geometric accuracy of GF-3 satellite images and demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale SAR mapping without GCPs.

TI  - Revisiting the Intraseasonal Variability of Chlorophyll-a in the Adjacent Luzon Strait With a New Gap-Filled Remote Sensing Data Set
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the northern South China Sea of western Pacific Ocean during winter, clouds, sun glint, and other factors block optic sensors, leading to a high missing rate and hence a major concern in ocean color products such as the chlorophyll-a (CHL) data. These constraints inhibit the understanding of CHL variabilities at short (seasonal) scales. Here, we introduce a new gap-filling method to reconstruct data gaps in a daily CHL remote sensing product. We applied discrete cosine transform with penalized least square (DCT-PLS) approach in the adjacent Luzon Strait, yielding a 15-year full-coverage daily 4-km CHL product. Against the cross-validation set and an independent observational data set collected from 34 cruises, evaluations suggest that DCT-PLS has outperformed the widely applied classical data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function (DINEOF) method. Besides, the DCT-PLS method is characterized by more efficient computation. The complete CHL product was analyzed with a particular focus on the intraseasonal (30x2013;60 days) control on the winter bloom by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The MJOx2019;s local signature on the CHL presents asymmetry. The CHL peaks at the late phases of MJO events, which could be explained by the relaxation after the MJO-induced wind strengthening. This gap-filling approach can be promisingly applied in other remote sensing gap-filling problems, which could shed light on the short-term variability of biological and physical dynamics in the ocean.

AB  - The Fengyun (FY)-3D satellite launched in November 2017, provides the latest multi-frequency brightness temperature (TB) of Chinese FY-3 series satellites. In this study, the FY-3D TB at five frequencies from 10.7 to 89 GHz during 2019 to 2020 were intercalibrated against AMSR2 TB using two intercalibration methods, i.e., the commonly used global linear regression method and the global per-pixel linear regression method proposed in the study. The effects of different environmental variables (e.g., land cover and its heterogeneity, climate types, water body fraction, terrain and vegetation coverage) on the calibration accuracy were investigated. The results reveal the global per-pixel linear regression method performs much better than global linear regression method with an averaged root mean square difference (RMSD) of 2.93 K at ascending overpass and 2.34 K at descending overpass. The water body fraction has the greatest influence on calibration accuracy, followed by terrain, land cover heterogeneity, and vegetation coverage. The RMSD is relatively lower in savannas and barren lands as well as in arid, cold and tropical climatic zones than that in other land cover and climate types.

TI  - Comparison of Different Intercalibration Methods of Brightness Temperatures From FY-3D and AMSR2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the second generation of Chinese polar-orbiting meteorological satellite missions, the Fengyun (FY)-3D satellite provides the latest multi-frequency brightness temperature (TB) of FY-3 series satellites. The microwave radiation imager (MWRI) boarded on FY-3D has similar sensor configuration as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and thus the intercalibration of these two sensors can make their TB data more consistent and continuous to facilitate their joint applications. In this study, the FY-3D H-pol and V-pol TB at five frequencies from 10.7 to 89 GHz during 2019 to 2020 were calibrated against AMSR2 TB over land. Two categories of intercalibration methods were compared, including global intercalibration method, i.e., global linear regression, and per-pixel-based intercalibration methods, i.e., per-pixel linear regression joint global linear regression, per-pixel linear regression joint inverse distance interpolation, per-pixel linear regression joint nearest neighbor interpolation, and global per-pixel linear regression. Furthermore, the effects of diverse environmental variables (i.e., land cover and its heterogeneity, climate types, water body fraction, terrain and its complexity, soil texture, and vegetation coverage) on FY-3D calibration accuracy were fully investigated. The results indicate that all five approaches can reduce the bias between FY-3D and AMSR2 TB, and the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) also reduces accordingly. Among them, the global per-pixel linear regression method performs the best with the lowest averaged RMSD of 2.93 K (at ascending overpass) and 2.34 K (at descending overpass), followed by the per-pixel linear regression joint inverse distance interpolation. The global linear regression method performs the worst with the largest RMSD of 4.69 and 3.82 K at ascending and descending overpass, respectively. The RMSD is relatively larger in temperate and polar climate zones, as well as in grasslands and croplands than in other climate and land cover types. The calibration errors generally decrease as the altitude increases, while they increase with the increase in land cover heterogeneity. The water body fraction exerts the greatest impact on the calibration accuracy, and the RMSD reaches 3 K when the water body fraction is greater than 15%. Soil texture, terrain complexity, and vegetation coverage generally have little influence on the calibration accuracy. These findings can provide a good reference for the intercalibration of satellites with similar configuration to generate long-term climate data records.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Classification of Few Shot Hyperspectral Image With Deep 3-D Convolutional Random Fourier Features Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing hyperspectral images are very useful for land cover classification because of their rich spatial and spectral information. However, hyperspectral image acquisition and pixel labeling are laborious and time-consuming, so few-shot learning methods are considered to solve this problem. Deep learning has gradually been used for few-shot hyperspectral classification, but there are some problems. The feature extraction network based on deep learning requires too many parameters to be trained, resulting in a huge network model, which is not conducive to deployment on remote sensing data acquisition equipment. Moreover, due to the lack of label samples, the algorithm based on deep learning is more prone to overfitting. To solve the above problems, considering the advanced characteristics of the kernel method in dealing with nonlinear, small sample, and high-dimensional data, we propose a small scale high precision network called 3-D convolution random Fourier features (3-DCRFF) based on the random Fourier feature (RFF) kernel approximation, which is the 3-DCRFF network. First, we combine 3-D convolution with RFF as the basic structure of the network to extract the spatial and spectral features of HSI cubes. Second, we use a classifier based on attention mechanism to classify feature vectors to obtain recognition probability. Finally, the network parameters are solved from the perspective of Bayesian optimization, and the synthetic gradient optimization method is designed and implemented to realize the fast learning of the network. A large number of experiments HSI classification experiments were performed on University of Pavia (UP), Pavia Center (PC), Indian Pines (IP), and Salinas standard remote sensing datasets, the results show that our algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art algorithms on few-shot classification.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Sand and Dust Storm Sources Based on Wind Vector and Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand and dust storms (SDS) are both symptoms and causes of desertification. As one of the essential parts of desertification control, SDS source identification can be readily carried out using remote sensing data. This letter proposes an automatic SDS source identification method based on ERA5 surface wind direction and MODIS daily surface reflectance. This is also the first time Google Earth Engine (GEE) has been used to fully automate SDS source mapping, from spatial data processing to results visualization. In this study, we use the zero-crossing edge detection algorithm to extract the dust plume edge based on the enhanced dust index (EDI) and then trace the point sources through the upwind direction. We evaluate the model performance based on 12 SDS events in Arid Central Asia (ACA) and validate against manually labeled SDS point sources. The results showed that the mean accuracy of SDS sources estimation was greater than 67%. To demonstrate the geographic scalability of the method, we also investigate the spatial pattern of SDS point sources in ACA from 2000 to 2021. Last, we adopt land cover data to discuss its applicability in time-series studies. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method has the ability to identify SDS source points accurately and efficiently. We anticipate that this method will play an essential role in dust risk assessment and desertification control.

TI  - All-Weather Near-Surface Air Temperature Estimation Based on Satellite Data Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (NSAT) playsan important role in land surface and atmosphere interactions. It is widely used in many fields, such as hydrology, climatology, and environment. Although remote sensing-based approaches for NSAT estimation have been proposed by the scientific communities, many of them are limited in cloudy areas and, thus, are not able to provide all-weather NSAT (AW-NSAT) estimates. To satisfy NSAT-related applications for all-weather conditions over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), this study develops a novel model for estimating daily 1-km AW-NSAT based on machine learning techniques. The input variables for the AW-NSAT model include land surface temperature (LST) from a newly released satellite all-weather LST dataset (i.e., TRIMS LST), as well as other parameters. The model is trained with in situ NSAT, and the results show that the random forest model with all-weather LST as the main input yields the best performance. Validation with independent in situ NSAT shows that the AW-NSAT estimate has good accuracy: An overall root-mean-square error of 2.43 degrees C and an R-2 of 0.93. Intercomparison with an existing NSAT dataset based on MODIS LST shows that AW-NSAT has similar accuracy. Nevertheless, AW-NSAT has an evident spatial seamless characteristic, indicating that the developed model has good ability to overcome cloud contamination by introducing TRIMS LST. The developed model provides the possibility for generating the AW-NSAT for the whole TP. Furthermore, the proposed model can also be extended to other areas and then support NSATs subsequent applications.

AB  - Dual-co-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery also has large potentials in detecting sediments and habitats on exposed intertidal flats. We expand on our previous works of FCD-RF algorithm, that is, Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier decompositions of polarimetric SAR, along with a Double-Bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (DERD) parameter, and a Random Forest (RF) classifier. By adding indicators derived from the (polarimetric) Kennaugh elements, that is, FCDK-RF, we found its good performance in distinguishing sand flats, mud flats, and bivalves. We tested our results using Radarsat-2 (C-band) dual-co-polarization (HH+VV) SAR data acquired along the German Wadden Sea. Results show that FCDK-RF fulfills the requirements in intertidal flats mapping projects especially for sediments and haibitats.

TI  - Tomographic SAR Inversion by Atomic-Norm Minimization-The Gridless Compressive Sensing Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) extends the synthetic aperture principle into the elevation direction for 3-D imaging. Due to the sparsity of the elevation signal, compressive sensing (CS) methods have been introduced for tomographic reconstruction. However, the limited irregular acquisitions and the dense sampling grids of the elevation cannot guarantee the sufficiently sparse reconstruction in the presence of noise. By constructing a complete set of atoms, the gridless sparse methods can directly recover the sparse signals in the continuous frequency space. In this article, we propose the atomic-norm minimization or the gridless CS approach for tomographic SAR inversion and compare it with the L1-norm-based optimization. The enhanced sparsity, the super-resolution capability, and the more accurate estimates are demonstrated using the numerical simulations and experiments with real data. A gridless CS reconstruction of an urban area of Shanghai from the TerraSAR-X data set is presented.

M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to apply three advanced landslide susceptibility models (Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), forest by penalizing attributes (FPA), and functional tree (FT)) to evaluate the landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China. Firstly, 12 landslide conditioning factors were prepared based on the local geo-environmental characteristics and relevant studies, including slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), lithology, soil, distance to roads, and distance to rivers. Secondly, a landslide inventory map consisting of 279 landslides was randomly divided into training and validation datasets with the ratio of 70/30. Then, a certainty factors (CF) model was used to analyze the relationship between landslides and the classes of landslide conditioning factors, and a Chi-Squared statistic was used for contribution analysis. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-value) and some statistical parameters are used to compare and verify the three landslide susceptibility models. After comparison and validation, the FPA model should be used as the best model for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Muchuan County in this study. This study can provide valuable information for local governments or organizations to study slope stability. At the same time, the landslide susceptibility map obtained can be a tool for reference for infrastructure planning, engineering design, and disaster mitigation design in the study area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the physical parameters of the ocean, which plays an important role in meteorology, navigation, and fishing. SST retrieval from thermal infrared remote sensing has become a research focus because of its advantages of high efficiency and wide observation range. However, more accurate retrieval algorithms and more complete data processing procedures are needed for the satellite data with higher spatial-temporal resolution. High-precision SST retrieval models based on split-window algorithm were established using Gaofen-5 Visual and Infrared Multispectral Imager (VIMS) data, some of which introduced the quadratic term of brightness temperature difference into the models. The highest accuracy is better than 0.15 K. Moreover, we proposed a relatively complete cross-calibration approach to solve the problem of unstable calibration coefficients in bands 11 and 12 of VIMS. Therefore, the accuracy of the models was verified by satellite images. At last, the models were applied to the retrieval of SST in the vicinity of Fuqing Nuclear Power Plant. We expand the practical value of VIMS in SST retrieval and thermal discharge monitoring and provide technical support for the application of high-resolution remote sensing data.

TI  - Multiscale Densely Connected Attention Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) based on deep learning has always been a research hot spot in the field of remote sensing. However, most of the classification models extract relevant features based on fixed-scales convolution kernels, which ignores the complex features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) at different scales and impairs the classification accuracy. To solve this problem, a multiscale densely connected attention network (MSDAN) is proposed for HSIC. First, the model adopts three different scales modules with dense connection to enhance classification performance, strengthen feature reuse, prevent overfitting and gradient disappearance. Besides, in order to reduce the model parameters and strengthen the extraction of spatial-spectral features, the traditional three-dimensional convolution is replaced by three-dimensional spectral convolution block and three-dimensional spatial convolution block. Furthermore, the spectral-spatial-channel attention is embedded into the end of each scale to enhance the favorable features for classification and further extract the discriminant features of the corresponding scale. Finally, the key feature extraction module is developed to extract multiscale fusion features to further enhance the classification performance of the network. The experimental results carried out on real HSIs show that the proposed MSDAN architecture has significant advantages compared with other most advanced methods.

AB  - Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration is the premise and guarantees to effectively control PM2.5 concentration and avoid the adverse effects of high PM2.5 concentration on human health. However, given the existing statistical models can only predict the pollutant concentration at the monitoring sites, the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration cannot be predicted, which greatly limits the application of the model in PM2.5 concentration prediction. This study combined the PM2.5 spatial distribution data predicted using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 3 km aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological factors into a spatiotemporal autoregressive (STAR) model to predict the regional PM2.5 concentration and quantify the short-term spatial distribution change of PM2.5 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (JingJinJi) one day in advance. Five simulation functions were used to simulate the STAR model, and the 2014 data of JingJinJi were used to verify its accuracy. Results showed that the STAR model had the best prediction performance when gradient boosting decision tree was used as the simulation function compared with other simulation functions. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square prediction error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the STAR model were 0.85, 27.08 mu g/m(3), 0.96, and 20 mu g/m(3), respectively. The spatial distribution prediction results of PM2.5 showed that the +1-day PM2.5 spatial distribution prediction results were in good agreement with the PM2.5 spatial distribution results predicted by AOD to provide accurate spatiotemporal distribution data for reducing air pollution and air pollution early warning.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing technology is widely applied for real-time drawing maps, forecasting weather, and predicting natural disasters. However, many remote sensing satellite images contain cloud noise, resulting in difficulties in practical applications. Existing cloud removal methods are limited when an image contains lots of clouds or thick clouds. Besides, most methods need a cloudless image as a reference. Our study proposes an advanced algorithm to remove cloud noise (especially thick clouds) in remote sensing images, including a cloud segmentation model, prior knowledge refinement, and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. Firstly, we trained a Cloud-net model to segment cloud regions. RGB and Near Infrared (NIR) images are fed into the Cloud-net model. Then it outputs coarse segmentation images. Secondly, we introduced the prior knowledge to refine and recover segmentation results. Finally, we designed cloud removal rules based on D-S evidence theory to fuse muti-temporal remote sensing images. Our method achieves a surprising performance on GaoFen-4 (GF-4) satellite images, reducing the average percentage of cloud noise from 30%-40% to 2%-8% per image.

TI  - IDUDL: Incremental Double Unsupervised Deep Learning Model for Marine Aquaculture SAR Images Segmentation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine aquaculture is an important natural resource exploration that requires rational planning to avoid environmental damage. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are essential in remote sensing to monitor the marine ecological environment. Unsupervised methods provide an adequate solution to avoid the cost of training sample collection. However, unsupervised methods often struggle to discover effective semantic information and incrementally use newly acquired data. To address these challenges, this article presents an incremental double unsupervised deep learning (IDUDL) model, which is specially designed to characterize unlabeled marine aquaculture and achieve the results semantically. Based on the idea of alternately generating and updating pseudo- labels, the proposed IDUDL model defines the double neural networks comprising the feature extraction network (FEN) and the fully convolutional semantic segmentation network (FCSSN). A patch estimation (PE) is proposed to generate pseudo-labels with aquaculture semantic information based on the features extracted by the FEN. Then, the aquaculture extraction results are obtained by FCSSN with generated pseudo-labels. After that, the pseudo-labels and extraction results are updated in turn until the pseudo-labels are stable. In addition, due to the unique structure of double neural networks, newly acquired marine aquaculture SAR images can also be added to the pretrained FCSSN and followed pseudo-labels updated based on the FEN and PE part, which can achieve new data incremental learning without retraining the whole IDUDL model. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on two different ways of marine aquaculture including raft and cage types, which consist of GaoFen-3 (GF-3) and RADARSAT-2 SAR images from the Dalian and Ningde areas, respectively. The incremental experiments are also designed to verify the generalization of the IDUDL model for newly obtained marine aquaculture SAR images. The code of this work will be available at https://github.com/fjc1575/MarineAquaculture/tree/main/IDUDL for the sake of reproducibility.

TI  - DBMF: A Novel Method for Tree Species Fusion Classification Based on Multi-Source Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-source data remote sensing provides innovative technical support for tree species recognition. Tree species recognition is relatively poor despite noteworthy advancements in image fusion methods because the features from multi-source data for each pixel in the same region cannot be deeply exploited. In the present paper, a novel deep learning approach for hyperspectral imagery is proposed to improve accuracy for the classification of tree species. The proposed method, named the double branch multi-source fusion (DBMF) method, could more deeply determine the relationship between multi-source data and provide more effective information. The DBMF method does this by fusing spectral features extracted from a hyperspectral image (HSI) captured by the HJ-1A satellite and spatial features extracted from a multispectral image (MSI) captured by the Sentinel-2 satellite. The network has two branches in the spatial branch to avoid the risk of information loss, of which, sandglass blocks are embedded into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the corresponding spatial neighborhood features from the MSI. Simultaneously, to make the useful spectral feature transfer more effective in the spectral branch, we employed bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) with a triple attention mechanism to extract the spectral features of each pixel in the HSI with low resolution. The feature information is fused to classify the tree species after the addition of a fusion activation function, which could allow the network to obtain more interactive information. Finally, the fusion strategy allows for the prediction of the full classification map of three study areas. Experimental results on a multi-source dataset show that DBMF has a significant advantage over other state-of-the-art frameworks.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 28th International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling (MMM)
CL  - Phu Quoc, VIETNAM
AB  - Pan-sharpening of remote sensing images is an effective method to get high spatial resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) images by fusing low spatial resolution multi-spectral (LRMS) images and high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images. Recently, many remote sensing images pan-sharpening methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proposed and achieved excellent performance. However, two drawbacks still exist. On the one hand, since there are no ideal HRMS images as targets for learning, most existing methods require an extra effort to produce the simulated data for training. On the other hand, these methods ignore the local features of the original images. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale generative adversarial network method, which can train directly on the full-resolution images without down-sampling. Firstly, a multi-scale dense generator network is proposed to extract features from the original images to generate HRMS images. Secondly, two discriminators are used to protect the spectral information of LRMS images and spatial information of PAN images, respectively. Finally, to improve the quality of the fused image and implement training under the unsupervised setting, a new loss function is proposed. Experimental results based on QuickBird and GaoFen-2 data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain much better fusion results for the full-resolution images.

TI  - Generating Long Time Series of High Spatiotemporal Resolution FPAR Images in the Remote Sensing Trend Surface Framework
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve our capacity to map long-term vegetation dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes, this study proposed a new prior knowledge-based spatiotemporal enhancement method, namely, PK-STEM, to fuse MODIS and Landsat FPAR products following the remote sensing trend surface framework. PK-STEM uses historical Landsat FPAR images as prior knowledge and fuses them with new satellite-derived FPAR data. PK-STEM can work in three modes: 1) using only MODIS data; 2) using only Landsat data; and 3) using both MODIS and Landsat data. This study retrieved FPAR from Landsat images using a scaling-based method and tested the performance of PK-STEM in a regional application. For the entire year of 2012, we compared the performance of PK-STEM in different modes and with that of two typical spatiotemporal fusion methods, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance model (ESTARFM) and unmixing-based linear mixing growth model (LMGM). Then, a long time series FPAR data set at 30-m resolution and eight-day intervals was generated for 13 years (2000x2013;2012). Our results show that PK-STEM in mode III is the most robust and accurate (root mean squared error (RMSE) x003D; 0.062; mean $R = 0.851$ ) among the three modes and more accurate than ESTARFM (mean RMSE x003D; 0.065; mean $R = 0.776$ ) and LMGM (mean RMSE x003D; 0.074; mean $R = 0.734$ ). For the 12 years (2000x2013;2011), PK-STEM also achieves high accuracies with mean RMSE x003D; 0.066 and $R = 0.938$ . PK-STEM is very flexible with a continual update mechanism and is efficient for long time series applications.

TI  - Local Scale-Guided Hierarchical Region Merging and Further Over- and Under-Segmentation Processing for Hybrid Remote Sensing Image Segmentation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of medium- and high-resolution satellites, successfully segmenting differently sized geo-objects remains a challenging issue for geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). The hybrid image segmentation method is a good alternative to produce good segmentation that best matched the different sizes of geo-objects. However, the existing methods almost use segmentation parameters (SPs), such as scale, to control the sizes and shapes of segments. This will lead to two issues: (1) one single scale is impossible to segment every geo-object well due to the land cover complexity within remote-sensing imageries; (2) over- and under-segmented regions still occur in the segmentation results, whatever using any advanced segmentation methods. To solve the above problems, this paper developed a hybrid image segmentation method with local scale-guided hierarchical region merging and further over- and under-segmentation processing. First, the primitive segmentation was produced and then stratified into layers with different land covers. Then, the local scale was calculated for a more objective merging process in the separating layers. Third, the over- and under-segmentation at separating layers was recognized and re-processed for achieving a fine segmentation. To validate the proposed method, it was applied to three test images of gaofen-1 satellite with different land cover types, and ten competing methods were compared. The visual and quantitative results indicated the advantage of our method in segmenting out different sizes of geo-objects, which can effectively reduce the over- and under-segmentation error.

TI  - Changes of Aquatic Vegetation and Water Quality after Removal of Pen Aquaculture in Lake East Taihu
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to study the changes of aquatic vegetation and water quality after removal of pen aquaculture in Lake East Taihu, the landsat-8 ( OLI) data with 30 in resolution was selected as the data source to perform the supervised classification of aquatic vegetation. In addition, the field survey data of aquatic plants, as the basis for the classified evaluation of aquatic vegetation, was used to interprete the changes of typical aquatic vegetation in Lake East Taihu before and after the removal of net-pen aquaculture, and to analyze the changes of main water quality indexes and algal biomass from 2018 to 2020. Results show that, after the net-pen aquaculture of Lake East Taihu being completely removed in the end of 2019, the distribution area of floating-leaf plants in 2020 increased by 25. 9% compared with that in 2018, and the distribution area of emerged plants and submerged plants reduced by 11. 8% and 17. 0%, respectively. The dominant species of submerged plants changed from erect species to canopy species. The biomass of floating-leaf plant, Trapha maximowiczii, and the canopy submerged plant, Ceratophyllum demersum, increased explosively to 6. 84 and 9. 90 kg . m(-2), respectively. From July to November 2020, the water transparency in the former net-pen aquaculture area was only 25.9 cm, which decreased significantly compared with the same period in 2018. The decline of transparency is not conducive to the growth of submerged plants and the maintenance of macrophyte-dominated clear state. The concentrations of chlorophyll-a and ammonia nitrogen increased significantly, implying that there is a risk of transformation to algae-dominated turbidity state in Lake East Taihu. After the removal of pen aquaculture in Lake East Taihu, the lake ecosystem has changed greatly. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the ecological research and management of the lake, and artificially assist the lake ecosystem to succeed to the macrophyte-dominated clear state.

TI  - Offshore Petroleum Leaking Source Detection Method From Remote Sensing Data via Deep Reinforcement Learning With Knowledge Transfer
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A marine oil spill is an environmental pollution incident that generally has the attributes of a high speed, widespread, and long duration. It seriously threatens the marine ecological environment and related industries. It is vital to determine the source of the oil leakage so that it may be stopped and related hazards can be reduced. Oil spill accidents in the sea are generally located in offshore and navigation channels. With the rapid development of remote-sensing techniques, oil leak extraction using remote-sensing data has played an essential role in oil spill research. This article proposes a Monte Carlo-based deep Q-transfer-learning network (DQTN) offshore oil leak detection method that uses remote-sensing data. Remote-sensing data are utilized to continuously monitor a marine oil spill on the surface. The estuarine and coastal ocean model is utilized to simulate a marine oil spill event. The deep-Q-network method with offline transferred knowledge is then utilized to determine the marine oil spill source location. In an experiment, based on the Bohai oil spill incident on June 2, 2011, the effectiveness of the remote-sensing-based DQTN marine oil spill search algorithm is verified. The accuracy of the targeted oil spill point is up to 98.97%.

TI  - An Improved Spatiotemporal Fusion Algorithm for Monitoring Daily Snow Cover Changes With High Spatial Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the tradeoff between spatial resolution and temporal resolution, spatiotemporal fusion has become a promising technique to monitor snow cover dynamics with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. The representative spatiotemporal fusion methods, e.g., spatial-temporal data fusion approach (STDFA), usually exist obvious phenomenon of spectral distortion when the surface reflectance changes nonlinearly, which affects the quality of the spatiotemporal fusion image. To address this issue, an effective STDFA-matching-Pix2pix-generative adversarial network (SMPG) algorithm combining the unmixing-based method, deep learning method, and prematching and postmatching module is proposed to reduce the spectral distortion of STDFA fusion image. The high-temporal-low-spatial (HTLS) resolution MOD09GA data and high-spatial-low-temporal resolution (HSLT) Landsat 8 data are selected in this study. An SMPG algorithm is first employed to obtain daily high-spatial-high-temporal (HSHT) images, and then, daily snow cover results with a spatial resolution of 30 m are obtained by calculating the normalized difference snow index (NDSI). The SMPG algorithm is further compared with STDFA, spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), Swin spatiotemporal fusion model (SwinSTFM), and generative adversarial network-based spatiotemporal fusion model (GAN-STFM). The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm yields better overall performance in daily spatiotemporal fusion image and snow cover result with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The mean correlation coefficient (CC) of SMPG can achieve 0.962, which is 0.06-0.36 higher than that of other spatiotemporal fusion methods. The error between the percentage of snow cover area obtained through SMPG and validation data is within 0.84%.

AB  - The Gaofen-4 satellite (GF-4) is the first Chinese remote sensing satellite to be placed in a geosynchronous orbit, which has a wide range of application prospects. The image sharpness evaluation method is a key step to quickly, accurately and automatically obtain the quality of a large number of GF-4 remote sensing data and understand the changes of the in-orbit satellite. Moreover, the assessment of image sharpness changes is the verification of the stability of the satellite operation, and can also provide reference for the follow- up satellite planning. Taking the time-series GF-4 panchromatic images of Zhengzhou and Chifeng from May 2016 to July 2020 as the data source, we use the block standard deviation sharpness evaluation method based on spatial domain and the power spectrum sharpness evaluation method based on frequency domain to calculate four kinds image sharpness evaluation values and carry out the correlation analysis from the same day and the same month, considering whether to remove the influence of image brightness. We analyze the influence of image brightness on the sharpness evaluation, and explores the applicability of these two methods for GF-4 image, so as to select the best sharpness evaluation method. The results show that the image power spectrum that has been normalized by the average image brightness is the most suitable image sharpness evaluation method for GF-4 image. This method is used to evaluate the image quality of 208 GF-4 panchromatic images in Zhengzhou and Chifeng. The results show that: since the delivery of GF-4 in orbit test satellite, the image sharpness is stable. At the same time, some suggestions are given for the planning of subsequent geosynchronous orbit satellites. It is necessary to improve the anti- interference ability of the camera to the atmospheric conditions, platform jitter and other external conditions.

AB  - Cloud cover is a common problem in optical satellite imagery, which leads to missing information in images. To rapidly acquire non-cloud images, we design a cloud removal method to recover single-temporal remote sensing image based on land cover data which is easier to obtain than multitemporal data. Considering that the same features have the same radiation characteristics, we extract the similar pixels from same category around the missing pixels and calculate the value of missing pixels according to the distance weights of these pixels. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on MODIS images and Landsat images and the results also prove that universal applicability of this algorithm in different resolutions and surface contents.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation and Analysis on Sensitive Parameters of Forest Fire Smoke Using Smoke-Unet and Landsat-8 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire is a ubiquitous disaster which has a long-term impact on the local climate as well as the ecological balance and fire products based on remote sensing satellite data have developed rapidly. However, the early forest fire smoke in remote sensing images is small in area and easily confused by clouds and fog, which makes it difficult to be identified. Too many redundant frequency bands and remote sensing index for remote sensing satellite data will have an interference on wildfire smoke detection, resulting in a decline in detection accuracy and detection efficiency for wildfire smoke. To solve these problems, this study analyzed the sensitivity of remote sensing satellite data and remote sensing index used for wildfire detection. First, a high-resolution remote sensing multispectral image dataset of forest fire smoke, containing different years, seasons, regions and land cover, was established. Then Smoke-Unet, a smoke segmentation network model based on an improved Unet combined with the attention mechanism and residual block, was proposed. Furthermore, in order to reduce data redundancy and improve the recognition accuracy of the algorithm, the conclusion was made by experiments that the RGB, SWIR2 and AOD bands are sensitive to smoke recognition in Landsat-8 images. The experimental results show that the smoke pixel accuracy rate using the proposed Smoke-Unet is 3.1% higher than that of Unet, which could effectively segment the smoke pixels in remote sensing images. This proposed method under the RGB, SWIR2 and AOD bands can help to segment smoke by using high-sensitivity band and remote sensing index and makes an early alarm of forest fire smoke.

AB  - Settlement monitoring of high-voltage line pylons (HLPs) is an important part of power line inspection. In geologically active areas, or due to some environmental factors, it can substantially impact the stability of HLP bases, which can lead to collapse accidents, so it is essential to monitor and predict the areas around HLPs. In this paper, we use 74-view Sentinel-1A satellite ascending orbit data, and combine the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) with a long-term sequence prediction model (Autoformer) to perform surface deformation of a high-voltage line in Inner Mongolia, China, from January 2019 to January 2022 monitoring. The environmental factors were considered to predict the surface deformation in the key study area from February 2022 to April 2022 and provide early warning. By comparing with Transformer, Informer, and Reformer, the results show that the proposed combined PS-InSAR and Autoformer method is far superior to its counterparts with a mean squared error of 0.105. This paper provides a new, accurate, and automated method for HLP subsidence monitoring and early warning and establishes a system for HLPs surface deformation prediction, which highly improves the efficiency of HLP monitoring and early warning.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: NIR-II imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) has been clinically used in liver tumor resection. However, few data are available concerning the application of ICG-NIR-II in lymphatic and vascular systems in clinic. To expand the application and promote the clinical translation of this approach, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of ICG-NIR-II imaging for monitoring both lymphatic and vascular systems in physiological and pathological conditions using a swine model and compared it to ICG-NIR-I imaging.Methods: we constructed a portable NIR-II imaging system suitable for large animals. Different simulated clinical scenarios in lymphatic and vascular systems of pigs, including lymphatic drainage, lymphorrhea, lymphatic obstruction, lymphatic reconstruction in flaps, venous thrombus formation and vascular anastomosis were modeled to evaluate the reliability of our NIR-II imaging system and the imaging quality of ICG in the NIR-I/II window.Results: Under different simulated clinical scenarios, our portable NIR-II imaging system showed good reliability for pigs. With the help of the portable imaging system, dynamical visualization of lymph vessels, lymph nodes and blood vessels of pigs in different clinical scenarios could be achieved in NIR-II imaging by using the tail fluorescence of ICG. Moreover, ICG-NIR-II imaging has lower background fluorescence and higher resolution than ICG-NIR-I imaging.Conclusions: We demonstrated the first application of a portable NIR-II imaging system for dynamically monitoring both lymphatic and vascular systems in physiological and pathological conditions using a swine model. Our study indicates that ICG-NIR-II imaging be a promising approach for the diagnosis of malfunctions in lymphatic and vascular systems and the surgical navigation of microsurgery and reconstructive surgery.

TI  - Spatially Varying Relationships between Land Subsidence and Urbanization: A Case Study in Wuhan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence has become an increasing global concern over the past few decades due to natural and anthropogenic factors. However, although several studies have examined factors affecting land subsidence in recent years, few have focused on the spatial heterogeneity of relationships between land subsidence and urbanization. In this paper, we adopted the small baseline subset-synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) method using Sentinel-1 radar satellite images to map land subsidence from 2015 to 2018 and characterized its spatial pattern in Wuhan. The bivariate Moran's I index was used to test and visualize the spatial correlations between land subsidence and urbanization. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was employed to explore the strengths and directions of impacts of urbanization on land subsidence. Our findings showed that land subsidence was obvious and unevenly distributed in the study area, the annual deformation rate varied from -42.85 mm/year to +29.98 mm/year, and its average value was -1.0 mm/year. A clear spatial pattern for land subsidence in Wuhan was mapped, and several apparent subsidence funnels were primarily located in central urban areas. All urbanization indicators were found to be significantly spatially correlated with land subsidence at different scales. In addition, the GWR model results showed that all urbanization indicators were significantly associated with land subsidence across the whole study area in Wuhan. The results of bivariate Moran's I and GWR results confirmed that the relationships between land subsidence and urbanization spatially varied in Wuhan at multiple spatial scales. Although scale dependence existed in both the bivariate Moran's I and GWR models for land subsidence and urbanization indicators, a "best" spatial scale could not be confirmed because the disturbance of factors varied over different sampling scales. The results can advance the understanding of the relationships between land subsidence and urbanization, and they will provide guidance for subsidence control and sustainable urban planning.

TI  - Annual dynamic remote sensing monitoring of phycocyanin concentration in Lake Chaohu based on Sentinel-3 OLCI images
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Phycocyanin (PC) is an indicator pigment of cyanobacteria in water, and its concentration reflects the biomass of cyanobacteria. Monitoring the annual dynamics of PC concentration by satellite remote sensing is of great significance for the effective prevention and control of cyanobacteria bloom. Based on the measured data of phycocyanin concentration in Lake Chaohu in different seasons and the Sentinel-3 OLCI images of the same period, a machine learning regression retrieval model was constructed and applied to the 2019 OLCI image set of Lake Chaohu to monitor the spatial distribution and annual variation of PC concentration. The results show that among MUMM and C2RCC atmospheric correction methods, the atmospheric correction result of C2RCC is closer to the measured spectral reflectance. Among the machine learning regression algorithms, the retrieval model of PC concentration based on gradient boosting regression has the highest accuracy, its R-2, RMSE and rRMSE reach 0.84, 49.76 mu g/L and 34.1%, respectively. The concentration of PC was low from January to April and December, but high from May to November and fluctuated frequently. The average daily temperature was the main reason for the annual variation of PC concentration, and the short-term fluctuation of PC was mainly affected by the daily precipitation and sunshine duration. In summer and autumn, the PC concentration in the West Lake area was significantly higher than that in the middle and east lake area, which was mainly related to the high input of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake. Sentinel-3 OLCI images provide important data sources for the dynamic monitoring of PC concentration in lake and reservoir waters, and the gradient boosting regression algorithm has great application potential in the retrieval of PC concentration in eutrophication waters.

TI  - TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION CHARACTERISTICS OF LAND USE AND LANDSCAPE PATTERN IN KEY WETLAND AREAS OF THE WEST LIAO RIVER BASIN, NORTHEAST CHINA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of the wetland ecosystem on arid and semi-arid areas is much higher than that in humid areas. It plays a more significant role in regulating climate, conserving water sources, purifying water bodies, and protecting biodiversity. The West Liao River Basin is located in a moderately temperate, semi-arid, and continental monsoon climate-sensitive area, with a fragile ecological environment. Climate warming and drought have gradually caused dry-flow of some river sections in the basin, reduction in the water area, shrinking of wetlands, degradation of vegetation ecological function, and decline of biodiversity. Ultimately, the effect of ecological barriers is significantly weakened The research of the temporal and spatial evolution of landscape patterns and their relationship with human activities in arid and semi-arid regions is of great significance for the protection and restoration of wetland resources. Based on Landsat remote sensing images in 1985 and 2015, the temporal and spatial evolution of landscape patterns in four key wetland areas in the West Liao River Basin was studied by 3S technology and landscape ecology indexes. Results show that during the 30a years, the wetland resources area in the West Liao River Basin is drastically reduced. Wetland resources of the four study areas, the Dalinor, the Saihanwula, the Hongshan Reservoir, and the West Liao River Estuary, were decreased by 13.80%, 31.06%, 61.10%, and 66.03%, respectively. The reduced wetland resources in the Dalinor and the Saihanwula were mainly converted into grassland, while those of the Hongshan Reservoir and the West Liao River Estuary were mostly converted into farmland. The diversity and evenness indexes of landscape in the Hongshan Reservoir and the West Liao River Estuary are gradually decreasing. The diversity and evenness indexes of the Dalinor and the Saihanwula are not significantly changed but are slightly disturbed by human activities. Changes in the landscape pattern index highlight the decrease in the water area, the increase in the area of dry and paddy fields, and the improvement of sandy land. All these further reflect that insufficient water resources supplementation and increasing human disturbance have a profound impact on the landscape pattern, which has also become the main driving force for the evolution of the landscape pattern in the West Liao River Basin.

TI  - AIR-PolSAR-Seg: A Large-Scale Data Set for Terrain Segmentation in Complex-Scene PolSAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) terrain segmentation is a fundamental research topic in PolSAR image interpretation. Recently, many studies have been investigated to handle this task. However, the existing data for PolSAR terrain segmentation have relatively limited scale and their scene complexity is relatively simple. These issues greatly restrict the development of algorithms. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale data set for terrain segmentation in complex-scene PolSAR images. In this paper, we present a benchmark data set containing a PolSAR amplitude image with a 9082x9805-pixel region and 2000 image patches with a size of 512x512 for PolSAR terrain segmentation, which is called AIR-PolSAR-Seg. We collect the PolSAR image with a resolution of 8 m from the GaoFen-3 satellite, and it is equipped with pixel-wise annotation which covers six categories. Compared with the previous data resources, AIR-PolSAR-Seg preserves some specific properties. First, AIR-PolSAR-Seg owns a large-size PolSAR image and provides a large quantity of image patches. It offers the research community a complete data resource with adequate training examples and reliable validation results. Second, AIR-PolSAR-Seg is established upon a PolSAR image with high scene complexity. This characteristic motivates robust and advanced segmentation approaches to facilitate complex-scene PolSAR image analysis. Based on AIR-PolSAR-Seg, three tasks are introduced: multi-category segmentation, water body segmentation, and building segmentation. Moreover, a performance analysis of traditional approaches and deep learning-based approaches are conducted, which can be regarded as baselines and provide references for future research.

AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important indicator reflecting changes in the Earth's ecosystem, as it is essential for simulating growth processes and modeling land surfaces. At present, there have been several FVC products available on the global scale using a variety of satellite data with different retrieval methods. Compared with other FVC products, the Landsat-based FVC is able to describe global vegetation cover at a resolution of 30 m with long time series, which can better represent vegetation cover information with more spatial details. However, the revisit cycle of Landsat satellite is 16 days, resulting in poor performance of Landsat in temporal continuity. In this study, the Landsat-based FVC was enhanced by combining normalized the Sentinel-2 data and filling in some of the missing dates. By applying different temporal reconstruction methods, the temporal continuity of 30 m FVC was significantly improved, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method were also discussed.

TI  - Spatial Identification and Redevelopment Evaluation of Brownfields in the Perspective of Urban Complex Ecosystems: A Case of Wuhu City, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid industrialization and urbanization in China have led to a rapid increase in the number of brownfields, however there is a lack of identification of the spatial extent of brownfields in cities and accurate assessment of brownfield redevelopment. Based on the relationship between brownfields and urban complex ecosystems, this paper defines brownfields in China and constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system including socio-economic and ecological subsystems. Using Wuhu City as empirical evidence, 19 brownfields were identified using remote sensing data and field surveys. Based on the detection of soil contaminants in brownfields, a fuzzy integrated evaluation method was used to suggest their redevelopment direction. It is found that the government's planned land use types and the brownfield redevelopment evaluation results match to a large extent, but social, economic and ecological environmental factors should be more fully considered. At the same time, the identification and redevelopment of brownfield sites in the city as a whole need to be carried out by the government's professional forces in order to obtain more effective and scientific conclusions.

AB  - Addressing hunger is one of the greatest unsolved challenges Humanity has ever faced. Africa is one of the most fragile ecosy stems strongly affected by numerous factors ranging from climate change, increasing population, decreasing water resources, and undeveloped hydrological infrastructure. These factors make it exceptionally vulnerable to food insecurity. The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility and methodology of using Open Data Cube (ODC) and conventional machine learning algorithms to determine the extent of decrease in cropped area in the desert climate of Djibouti, the smallest Horn of Africa country (by landmass) over a thirty-year period. The research question was answered using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery taken during the month of June from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 then classified through machine learning algorithms - including decision tree and random forest. The data acquisition, analysis, and modeling were completed in an Open Data Cube environment using a cloud-based user computational platform miming completely in-browser, and all necessary software was provided as part of the environment. The research identified a decreasing trend in vegetative areas but was limited in determining whether the vegetative areas were purely agricultural cropland in nature or included native vegetation. While the research reveals a concerning decline in total vegetation over the thirty-year period, the lack of other data variables (such as weather and climate patterns) provides too narrow a picture to determine causation. Several areas for further research are outlined.

AB  - The paper summarizes the results of an ongoing research project carried out in cooperation between CTTC (Spain) and the University of Milan (Italy). The work aimed at investigating the role of quality indicators in the analysis of differential interferometric SAR time series products. Small baseline multi-temporal differential interferometric techniques have been used to derive TS products from six-year Sentinel-1 images covering railway networks in Barcelona, Spain. Redundancies of interferograms and post-phase unwrapping phase estimation residuals were pivotal parameters in determining the reliabilities of measurements. Preliminary results have supported the importance of quality indicators as well as the feasibility of multi-temporal differential interferometric techniques in monitoring subsidence along railway infrastructures. The time series evolutions of measurements from coherent scatterers have also shown that the target area is stable in the study period.

TI  - Indigenous Strength: Braiding Culture, Ceremony and Community as a response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health of urban Indigenous Peoples. This research sought to examine innovations and changes in service delivery by Indigenous service providers in the community who are addressing community needs based on an Indigenous worldview. The research was a collaboration between an academic team, an Indigenous research associate, and an Indigenous oversight committee. Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted with Indigenous service organizations, non-Indigenous organizations with Indigenous programming, Indigenous volunteer-based organizations, and Indigenous volunteers. Participants were recruited based on having mandates focused on mental and emotional wellbeing, education, chronic health conditions, women and children, and Indigenous cultural needs. The findings showed that health inequities for urban Indigenous Peoples were compounded during the pandemic. A lack of local infrastructure contributed to increased volunteerism in delivering and improving access to services. Service interruptions and access barriers triggered innovative programming and a strengths-based response with activities embedded on the Land, braided with language, ceremony, and culture. Unmet community service needs and capacity development priorities were identified. Access to land, infrastructure, and cultural programming are key to wholistic health for the urban Indigenous community. Despite continued inequities, the urban-based Indigenous response exemplifies the strengths-based approaches that helped to address pandemic impacts, and demonstrated how Indigenous ways of knowing build strength and foster innovative program adaptations based on culture, ceremony, and creating space for community.

TI  - Optical Force on a Metal Nanorod Exerted by a Photonic Jet
T2  - NANOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we study the optical force exerted on nanorods. In recent years, the capture of micro-nanoparticles has been a frontier topic in optics. A Photonic Jet (PJ) is an emerging subwavelength beam with excellent application prospects. This paper studies the optical force exerted by photonic jets generated by a plane wave illuminating a Generalized Luneburg Lens (GLLs) on nanorods. In the framework of the dipole approximation, the optical force on the nanorods is studied. The electric field of the photonic jet is calculated by the open-source software package DDSCAT developed based on the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). In this paper, the effects of the nanorods' orientation and dielectric constant on the transverse force F-x and longitudinal force F-y are analyzed. Numerical results show that the maximum value of the positive force and the negative force are equal and appear alternately at the position of the photonic jet. Therefore, to capture anisotropic nanoscale-geometries (nanorods), it is necessary to adjust the position of GLLs continuously. It is worth emphasizing that manipulations with nanorods will make it possible to create new materials at the nanoscale.

TI  - Synergies between Urban Heat Island and Urban Heat Wave Effects in 9 Global Mega-Regions from 2003 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global urbanization significantly impacts the thermal environment in urban areas, yet urban heat island (UHI) and urban heat wave (UHW) studies at the mega-region scale have been rare, and the impact study of urbanization is still lacking. In this study, the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) product was used to depict the UHI and UHW in nine mega-regions globally between 2003 and 2020. The absolute and percentile-based UHW thresholds were adopted for both daily and three-day windows to analyze heat wave frequency, and UHW magnitude as well as frequency were compared with UHI variability. Results showed that a 10% increase in urban built-up density led to a 0.20 degrees C to 0.95 degrees C increase in LST, a 0.59% to 7.17% increase in hot day frequency, as well as a 0.08% to 0.95% increase in heat wave number. Meanwhile, a 1 degrees C increase in UHI intensity (the LST differences between the built-up and Non-built-up areas) led to a 2.04% to 92.15% increase in hot day frequency, where daytime LST exceeds 35 degrees C and nighttime LST exceeds 25 degrees C, as well as a 3.30% to 33.67% increase in heat wave number, which is defined as at least three consecutive days when daily maximum temperature exceeds the climatological threshold. In addition, the increasing rates of UHW magnitudes were much faster than the expansion rates of built-up areas. In the mega-regions of Boston, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, and Mexico City in particular, the increasing rates of UHW hotspot magnitudes were over 2 times larger than those of built-up areas. This indicated that the high temperature extremes, represented by the increase in UHW frequency and magnitudes, were concurrent with an increase in UHI under the context of climate change. This study may be beneficial for future research of the underlying physical mechanisms on urban heat environment at the mega-region scale.

TI  - Extending the EOS Long-Term PM<sub>2.5</sub> Data Records Since 2013 in China: Application to the VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 is hazardous to human health, and highquality data are thus needed on a routine basis. An attempt is made here to improve the accuracy of near-surface PM2.5 estimates using the newly released aerosol product derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite with the Deep Blue retrieval algorithm. A high-quality PM2.5 data set is generated at a spatial resolution of 6 km from 2013 to 2018 by applying the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model, which also aims to extend the Earth Observing System (EOS) long-term PM2.5 data records in China. The PM2.5 estimates are highly consistent with ground-based measurements, with an out-of-sample cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.88, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 16.52 mu g/m(3), and a mean absolute error of 10 mu g/m3 at the national scale. Spatiotemporal PM2.5 variations at monthly scales are also well captured (e.g., R-2 = 0.91-0.94, RMSE = 5.8-11.6 mu g/m(3)). PM2.5 varied greatly at regional and seasonal scales across China. Benefiting from emission reduction and air pollution controls, PM2.5 pollution has reduced dramatically in China with an average of -5.6 mu g/m(3)/yr(-1) during 2013-2018. Significant regional reductions are also seen, in particular, in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (-6.6 mu g/m(3)/yr(-1), p < 0.001), and the Deltas of Yangtze River (-6.3 mu g/m(3)/yr(-1), p < 0.001) and Pearl River Delta (-4.5 mu g/m(3)/yr(-1), p < 0.001). Our study improved the accuracy of near-surface PM2.5 estimates in terms of their spatiotemporal variations at a relatively long-term record, which is important for future air pollution and health studies in China.

AB  - Due to the spatial heterogeneity within a relatively small distance of urban areas, it is necessary to consider the complex land cover types and three-dimensional geometric structure of urban surface. This study introduces the sky view factor (SVF) to calculate the equivalent emissivity of urban surface. In addition, the thermal radiation of adjacent pixels to target pixels is also considered to establish the urban radiative transfer model.The Landsat-8 collection-2 level-2 science product was taken to validate the proposed urban radiative transfer model. The area within the Fourth Ring Road of Beijing was regarded as the study area, then the land surface temperature retrieval algorithm was applied to estimate urban surface temperature (UST). The results of the UST retrieval algorithm were evaluated by comparing brightness temperature (BT) at the top of atmosphere (TOA) simulated by the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between brightness temperatures estimated by the urban radiative transfer model and those simulated by DART model was less than 0.21 K.

TI  - Rice Mapping in Training Sample Shortage Regions Using a Deep Semantic Segmentation Model Trained on Pseudo-Labels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A deep semantic segmentation model-based method can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and high computational efficiency in large-scale crop mapping. However, the model cannot be widely used in actual large-scale crop mapping applications, mainly because the annotation of ground truth data for deep semantic segmentation model training is time-consuming. At the operational level, it is extremely difficult to obtain a large amount of ground reference data by photointerpretation for the model training. Consequently, in order to solve this problem, this study introduces a workflow that aims to extract rice distribution information in training sample shortage regions, using a deep semantic segmentation model (i.e., U-Net) trained on pseudo-labels. Based on the time series Sentinel-1 images, Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and U-Net model, the optimal multi-temporal datasets for rice mapping were summarized, using the global search method. Then, based on the optimal multi-temporal datasets, the proposed workflow (a combination of K-Means and random forest) was directly used to extract the rice-distribution information of Jiangsu (i.e., the K-RF pseudo-labels). For comparison, the optimal well-trained U-Net model acquired from Arkansas (i.e., the transfer model) was also transferred to Jiangsu to extract local rice-distribution information (i.e., the TF pseudo-labels). Finally, the pseudo-labels with high confidences generated from the two methods were further used to retrain the U-Net models, which were suitable for rice mapping in Jiangsu. For different rice planting pattern regions of Jiangsu, the final results showed that, compared with the U-Net model trained on the TF pseudo-labels, the rice area extraction errors of pseudo-labels could be further reduced by using the U-Net model trained on the K-RF pseudo-labels. In addition, compared with the existing rule-based rice mapping methods, he U-Net model trained on the K-RF pseudo-labels could robustly extract the spatial distribution information of rice. Generally, this study could provide new options for applying a deep semantic segmentation model to training sample shortage regions.

AB  - Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are increasingly considered as an enabling technology for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communications and remote sensing. We consider an IRS-aided dual-function radar-communications (DFRC) system for multi-carrier waveforms in a combined light-of-sight and NLoS scenario. In this wideband system, we jointly design the radar receive filter, frequency-dependent beamforming, and IRS phases to maximize the average radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the minimal communications SINR among all users. The problem has a maximin objective function with constant modulus and power constraints and is, therefore, highly non-convex. We solve this optimization using the alternating maximization framework, which iterates amongst the alternating direction method of multipliers, Riemannian steepest descent, and Dinkelbach's algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for IRS-aided DFRC achieves better performance for both sensing and communications than the system without IRS.

TI  - Multiscale feature U-Net for remote sensing image segmentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The segmentation and extraction of buildings in high-resolution remote sensing images has good application prospects in military, civil, and other fields. With a depth encoder-decoder structure, U-Net is a frequently used model for high-precision image segmentation. However, the design of U-Net makes it hard to retain the detailed information of edges when processing the building segmentation. Specifically, the low-level features extracted from the shallow layer and the abstract features extracted from the deep layer cannot be completely merged, resulting in inaccurate segmentation. In response to this problem, we design a new multiscale feature extraction module that extracts target information through three convolution kernels of different scales. Taking U-Net as the baseline, by replacing skip connections with this module, we propose a multiscale feature extraction U-Net. This method can perform secondary feature extraction on the shallow feature information in the skip connection, refine the detailed information, and narrow the semantic gap between the low-level features and high-level features. It can not only improve the ability of the network to extract multiscale feature information, from a larger range to more layers to extract the edge detail information of the building in the remote sensing image, but also increase the number of skip connections to reduce network overfitting. Experimental results on Massachusetts remote sensing data and Massachusetts building data show that the method proposed offers significant improvement in terms of precision and accuracy compared with the methods full convolutional network, U-Net, SegNet, and high-resolution network, with an F1 score of 88.73%, mean IoU of 91.15%, precision of 89.74%, accuracy of 97.36%, and recall of 87.74%.

TI  - Mapping Large-Scale Plateau Forest in Sanjiangyuan Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Few-Shot Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the extent of plateau forests has drawn much attention from governments given the fact that the plateau forests play a key role in global carbon circulation. Despite the recent advances in the remote-sensing applications of satellite imagery over large regions, accurate mapping of plateau forest remains challenging due to limited ground truth information and high uncertainties in their spatial distribution. In this paper, we aim to generate a better segmentation map for plateau forests using high-resolution satellite imagery with limited ground-truth data. We present the first 2 m spatial resolution large-scale plateau forest dataset of Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve, including 38,708 plateau forest imagery samples and 1187 handmade accurate plateau forest ground truth masks. We then propose an few-shot learning method for mapping plateau forests. The proposed method is conducted in two stages, including unsupervised feature extraction by leveraging domain knowledge, and model fine-tuning using limited ground truth data. The proposed few-shot learning method reached an F1-score of 84.23%, and outperformed the state-of-the-art object segmentation methods. The result proves the proposed few-shot learning model could help large-scale plateau forest monitoring. The dataset proposed in this paper will soon be available online for the public.

We used an extensive plant-soil dataset that covers 14 elevational gradients (between 1500 and 2800m of elevation) distributed over the whole French Alps to analyse the spatial co-dependencies between the plant and soil compartments. We ran a Graphical Lasso that extracts the direct and indirect linkages between plant functional composition, soil microbial activities, and environmental conditions (local climate and soil properties). Our main results are 1) that plant traits are tightly associated with microbial activities, the former being driven by climate and the latter by soil properties; 2) that the dominance of specific plant traits was more important than their diversity to determine plant-soil linkages; and 3) that soil microbes invested strongly in nutrient acquisition in sites with conservative plant traits and reduced organic matter quality.

TI  - Validation of the MCD43A3 Collection 6 and GLASS VO4 Snow-Free Albedo Products Over Rugged Terrain
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive assessment of satellite-derived albedo products is undeniably essential for better use consideration and the further refinement of the retrieval algorithm. Although satellite albedo products have been extensively validated over spatially homogeneous areas, it remains a challenge to validate them over rugged terrain. Consequently, the accuracy of satellite albedo products over rugged terrain is still unknown. This study for the first time systematically evaluated two widely used satellite albedo products (i.e., NICD43A3 V006 and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) V04 albedo) over mountainous areas with a mountain radiation transfer (MRT) coupled multiscale validation strategy. Fine-scale albedo was first generated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) smaller than 0.0317. Then, they were upscaled to the coarse pixel and as the reference data for validation. The validation results indicated that the accuracy of the two products tends to decrease with the increase of means slopes. The RMSE and relative RMSE (RMSER) of full retrieval MCD43A3 C6 black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) over abrupt slopes (mean slope > 10 degrees) increase to 0.0432% and 31.87% and to 0.0436% and 32.21%, respectively. The RMSE and RMSER of high-quality GLASS V04 were 0.0452% and 33.71% of BSA and 0.0458% and 33.92% of WSA, respectively, over abrupt slopes. In particular, if the backup retrievals were included over the abrupt slopes, the RMSE and RMSER of MCD43A3 C6 can reach 0.0600% and 36.92% for BSA and 0.0613% and 37.67% for WSA, respectively, and those of GLASS V04 can reach 0.0567% and 36.28% for BSA and 0.0540% and 35.72%, respectively.

TI  - LANDSLIDE INVENTORY MAPPING FROM LANDSAT-8 NDVI TIME SERIES USING ADAPTIVE LANDSLIDE INTERVAL DETECTION
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - A landslide inventory map is one of the essential sources of geospatial information for land resource management. This study proposes an interval-based landslide detection strategy using satellite images' time series vegetation index. Landslide trends to be abruptly changed with the landscape can be clearly detected using the time series vegetation index. The proposed adaptive landslide interval detection (LID) method is a two stage algorithm. The first stage extracts local extremes and divides the time series to obtain discriminative intervals. Then, a predefined threshold is applied to determine whether a landslide occurs in each interval. The experiment compares the proposed scheme and the traditional time series forest (TSF) algorithm on a pre-labeled dataset. In the comparison of the results obtained from TSF and LID, the validation results show that the proposed LID has better discriminative ability in real scenarios, and the landslide detection rate for large areas reaches 85%. But the TSF can only provide good results on well-defined and unmixing datasets. In addition, LID does not require a large number of training datasets and can be applied to irregular time series with various lengths. In summary, this study demonstrated that the LID global pattern concerned splitting strategy is more effective than TSF random interval segmentation.

TI  - An Improved Azimuth Ambiguity Suppression Method for SAR Based on Ambiguity Area Imaging and Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, an azimuth ambiguity suppression method based on ambiguity area imaging and detection is proposed, which is suitable for various imaging modes such as strip, spot, and multichannel modes. The basic idea of this method is to focus the image of each azimuth ambiguity area of a single-look complex synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image through a reversible signal processing method, then the strong targets in the focused ambiguity area are detected and eliminated. Finally, the real target image in the main area is obtained through the inverse operation. This method can remove most of the azimuth ambiguity while maintaining the quality of the original image to the greatest extent. In this article, the method of segmentation of complex background and pure background is used to eliminate the error caused by single threshold detection, and the construction of ambiguity area focusing filter in spotlight mode and multichannel mode is studied. This method has good performance in engineering applications. The processing results of real spaceborne SAR images show the effectiveness and validity of the method.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is common cancer type with high mortality. There are still inperfections in the traditional diagnosis and treatment methods for cancer. Photoacoustic imaging combines the advantages of high specificity and deep tissue penetration and is especially suitable for early cancer detection and treatment monitoring. With its specificity and noninvasiveness; photothermal therapy has become one of the best representative treatment methods. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a near-infrared imaging reagent approved by the FDA for clinical application, with a potential application for photothermal therapy. ICG has low targeting specificity. Through the combination of EB and ICG, the timeliness of ICG circulation in vivo is improved, and the tumor targeting of ICG-E is improved by using RGD. ICG-ER, an integrated optical probe for diagnosis and treatment, was constructed, and high uptake of ICG-ER by 4T1 cells was observed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). ICG-ER photoacoustic signal intensity is concentration-dependent. In vivo photoacoustic imaging showed that the ICG-ER concentration time in the tumor site was long and reached a peak at 42 hours. Under laser irradiation, the temperature of the tumor site in mice that were injected with ICG-ER reached 56 degrees C. After photothermal treatment, the tumor tissue in the mice showed obvious necrosis and no tumor recurrence, proving that ICG-ER has a good photothermal effect. Based on the above results, ICG ER can be used in breast cancer optical imaging and photothermal therapy, which is expected to provide new ideas for breast cancer clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Abstract This study dealt in part with the use of grotesque aesthetics and the concept of development strategies among grotesque's interdisciplinary research work. The purpose of studying grotesque in relation to cultural content was to visually expand the theoretical part of grotesque and examine how it is applied to reality. The theorist who examined intensively analyzed the points where grotesque, which appeared in Kaiser and Bachjin's grotesque books, can be created as cultural content. In other words, through the 'exploration of books' of the two theorists, we looked at what they consistently aim for in cultural content that visualizes various non-language type languages. In this study, the 'attractive elements' related to cultural content are summarized as normal/abnormal indistinguishable, grotesque society, and supernormal stimulation. The psychological reason for favoring this tendency in modern society is not clear, but this tendency has left traces of various cultures from prehistoric times to the present. The worldview of the culture that created such a phenomenon has also constantly changed and achieved grotesque development. The achievement of this study is that attempts to designate this phenomenon as a grotesque could still be found in cultural content.

M3  - Data study
AB  - The study comprised of a surgey among surgeons to investigate wether variation in the use of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) in patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ might be explained by preferences of surgeons, organisational factors or the influence of patients preferences. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional web survey among Dutch oncological/breast surgeons. Preferences of surgeons and the influence of the patients preferences were determined two ways: by means of best-worst scaling (BWS) of profile case scenarios and by ranking risk factors. The survey also explored the influence on the decionsion to use SLNB of background characteristics and organisational factors. This study did not find background or organisational factors that could explain the inter-hospital variation in the use of SLNB. Patients could have some influence on the decision. The risk factors that most surgeons reported as reasons for performing SLNB at biopsy-proven DCIS are: having a suspicion of invasive breast cancer based on biopsy, DCIS grade and size of the DCIS.

AB  - The Sidoarjo mud flow in East Java is the result of a natural phenomenon in which hot mudflow occurs due to volcanic activity. The Sidoarjo mud flow resulted in a considerable ecological disaster in the area. In this study, by using the Modification of Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) technique we measured the extension of the mudflow area from 2013 to 2020 using Landsat 8 satellite data imagery. This study is meant to predict the extension of the mud flow area in the research site by comparing regression and neural network techniques in order to find the best approach. The RPROP MLP neural network technique was used to predict the Sidoarjo mud-flowing area in 2021 to 2025. Surprisingly the results of these calculations showed that the RPROP MLP neural network with three hidden layers and 20 neurons performed the best, with an R square value for training of 0.77915565 and for testing of 0.78321550.

AB  - Assessing the impacts of anthropogenic degradation and climate change on global carbon cycling is hindered by a lack of clear, flexible, and easy-to-use productivity models along with scarce trait and productivity data for parameterizing and testing those models. We provide a simple solution: a mechanistic framework (RS-CFM) that combines remotely-sensed foliar-trait and canopy-structural data with trait-based metabolic theory to efficiently map productivity at large spatial scales. We test this framework by quantifying net primary productivity (NPP) at high-resolution (0.01-ha) in hyper-diverse Peruvian tropical forests (30,040 hectares) along a 3,322-m elevation gradient. Our analysis captures hotspots and elevational shifts in productivity more accurately and in greater detail than alternative empirical- and process-based models that use plant functional types. This result exposes how high-resolution, location-specific variation in traits and light competition drive variability in productivity, opening up possibilities to fully harness remote sensing data and reliably scale up from traits to map global productivity in a more direct, efficient, and cost-effective manner.

AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation is a crucial pre-processing step for any application that uses multi-spectral satellite images. In particular, time-critical disaster applications, require accurate and immediate cloud and cloud shadow masks while being able to adapt to possibly large variations caused by different sensor characteristics, scene properties or atmospheric conditions. This study introduces the newly developed open-source Python package ukis-csmask for cloud and cloud shadow segmentation in multi-spectral satellite images. Segmentation with ukis-csmask is performed with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network based on a U-Net architecture. It works directly on Level-1C data, eliminating the need for prior atmospheric correction. Images need to be in top of atmosphere reflectance and include at least the Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 spectral bands. We provide a performance evaluation on a recent benchmark dataset for cloud and cloud shadow segmentation and proof the generalization ability of our method across multiple satellites (Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2). We also show the influence of augmentation and image bands on the segmentation performance and compare it to the widely used Fmask algorithm and a Random Forest classifier. Compared to previous work in this direction, our study focuses on multi-sensor generalization ability, simplicity and efficiency and provides a ready-to-use software package that has been thoroughly tested.

AB  - InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) phase closure, the net phase from linking three multilooked interferograms formed from three acquisitions, has been linked to soil moisture [1]. Here, we show one possible way to predict soil moisture from InSAR phase closure. Our data reduction approach includes an integration of the phase closure over time and subtraction of a random walk component to relate the differential phase values to soil moisture level. We find that for a large test region of Oklahoma, the integrated phase closure using Sentinel-1 data tracks the soil moisture observed in the field. In other cases, the match is less than good. If we can determine under what circumstances these InSAR measurements provide a good match to soil moisture, we have a valuable utility to remotely estimate soil moisture at scales useful for agricultural assessments, as conventional radiometric measurements cover hundreds of adjacent fields in each resolution cell.

TI  - Urban sprawl and its stress on the risk of extreme hydrological events (EHEs) in the Kelani River basin, Sri Lanka
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land modification and urban sprawl cause incremental changes in hydrological processes due to the results of novel or hybrid ecosystems. This study mainly investigated the unforeseen urban expansion in the lower Kelani River basin, Sri Lanka, and its impact on the increment of hydrological extremes. Remote sensing data, including night-time light images (NOAA/AVHRR) and Landsat (TM/ETM-P/OLI) data of different wavelengths, were analysed in this study. Land use and land cover data of the river basin were obtained from 1995. Shannon's entropy was used to demarcate urban sprawl in the river basin over nearly two decades. A spatial regression model was built to identify the correlation between increments of hydrological extremes and urban sprawl. This study revealed that the Kelani River basin has experienced a high urban sprawl rate over the past 23 years and that the total urban land area has increased by 130%. The flood risk analysis revealed that the flood frequency has also dramatically increased due to urban sprawl, and nearly 20 minor flood events have been recorded over the last two decades. Most of the urban areas situated in the lower river basin have invaded into the area with a higher flood risk, and the total flood damage has increased over the study period. The built-up land extent increased from 24.07 km(2) to 56.39 km(2). In 2018, the flood plain and the lower basin were mostly occupied by human settlements. Therefore, it is essential to improve current policies and mitigation plans to minimize the negative impact of rapid urban sprawl in the study area.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Finding appropriate community clinical placements has been challenging in recent years, most especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020-2021 semesters, a university in the province of Alberta, Canada chose to use the community health virtual simulation program, Sentinel City (R) 3.1, to provide clinical placements for three groups of undergraduate students. This expository paper, co-authored by students and faculty, sought to further explore how virtual simulation can be used to best support student learning by identifying practices that students find most helpful.Method: Jeffries' (2005) simulation framework was used to guide a quality improvement analysis which explored feedback received from 16 students regarding the use of Sentinel City (R) 3.1 as a clinical placement, with additional contributions from the student co-authors.Results: Students felt Sentinel City (R) 3.1 was an effective tool to learn community and population health concepts, however, all students indicated that they would have preferred more opportunities to work with real communities.Conclusion: Virtual simulation programs like Sentinel City (R) 3.1 might be best as a learning supplement rather than as students' sole clinical placement experience.

TI  - Mosquito surveillance in maritime entry ports in Miami-Dade County, Florida to increase preparedness and allow the early detection of invasive mosquito species
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive mosquito vector species have been inadvertently transported to new areas by humans for decades. Strong evidence supports that monitoring maritime, terrestrial, and aerial points of entry is an essential part of the effort to curb the invasion and establishment of invasive vector mosquito species. Miami-Dade County, Florida is an important operational hub for the cruise ship industry and leisure boats that routinely visit nearby areas in the Caribbean, and freight cargo ships transporting goods from Miami-Dade to Caribbean countries and vice versa. To deal with the increasing public health concern, we hypothesized that mosquito surveillance in small- and medium-sized maritime ports of entry in Miami-Dade is crucial to allow the early detection of invasive mosquito species. Therefore, we have selected 12 small- and medium-sized maritime ports of entry in Miami-Dade County with an increased flow of people and commodities that were not covered by the current mosquito surveillance system. Collection sites were comprised of two distinct environments, four marinas with international traffic of leisure boats, and eight maintenance and commercial freight cargo ship ports. Mosquitoes were collected weekly at each of the 12 collection sites for 24 hours for 6 weeks in the Spring and then for 6 additional weeks in the Summer using BG-Sentinel traps. A total of 32,590 mosquitoes were collected, with Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti being the most abundant species totaling 19,987 and 11,247 specimens collected, respectively. Our results show that important mosquito vector species were present in great numbers in all of the 12 maritime ports of entry surveyed during this study. The relative abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti was substantially higher in the commercial freight cargo ship ports than in the marinas. These results indicate that even though both areas are conducive for the proliferation of vector mosquitoes, the port area in the Miami River is especially suitable for the proliferation of vector mosquitoes. Therefore, this potentially allows the establishment of invasive mosquito species inadvertently brought in by cargo freights.

AB  - Here we will discuss two specific examples of how satellite data is being used to support the management of sustainable fisheries. The first example is a model to predict the potential sardine habitat along the US West Coast that relies on sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll data from JPSS VIIRS. The predicted habitat distribution is used to optimize the ship survey cruises conducted as part of the Pacific sardine stock assessment. The second example is the EcoCast model, which was developed as an effort to help minimize fishery bycatch. EcoCast identifies regions within the Pacific swordfish fishing grounds where the bycatch of protected and endangered species ([leatherback turtle, blue shark, and California sea lion) is less likely. This model also uses sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll data from JPSS VIIRS as two of its data inputs. Outputs from both the sardine habitat and EcoCast models are available on the NOAA CoastWatch West Coast Node ERDDAP server.

TI  - Incidence of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella in Blantyre, Malawi between January 2011-December 2019.
T2  - Wellcome open research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: The Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme (MLW) has undertaken sentinel surveillance of bloodstream infection and meningitis at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Blantyre, Malawi for 20 years. Previously, three epidemics of Salmonella bloodstream infection have been identified. Here we provide updated surveillance data on invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella disease from 2011 - 2019. Methods: Surveillance data describing trends in invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella disease and associated antimicrobial susceptibility profiles are presented for the period January 2011 - December 2019. Results: Between January 2011-December 2019, 128,588 blood cultures and 40,769 cerebrospinal fluid cultures were processed at MLW. Overall, 1.00% of these were positive for S. Typhimurium, 0.10% for S. Enteritidis, and 0.05% positive for other Salmonella species. Estimated minimum incidence of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease decreased from 21/100,000 per year in 2011 to 7/100,000 per year in 2019. Over this period, 26 confirmed cases of Salmonella meningitis were recorded (88.5% S. Typhimurium). Between 2011-2019 there was a substantial decrease in proportion of S. Typhimurium (78.5% to 27.7%) and S. Enteritidis (31.8% in 2011 to 0%) that were multidrug-resistant. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generationgeneration cephalosporins (3GC) remained uncommon, however 3GC increased amongst Salmonella spp. and S. Typhimurium in the latter part of the period. Conclusions: The total number of iNTS bloodstream infections decreased between 2011-2019. Although the number multidrug resistance (MDR) S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis isolates has fallen, the number of MDR isolates of other Salmonella spp. has increased, including 3GC isolates.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua spacecrafts have been in operation for 22 and 20 years, respectively. Each of the two MODIS instruments has provided valuable climate quality data to the scientific community throughout their respective mission lifetimes. To achieve this, the instruments are calibrated on-orbit using on-board calibrators combined with observations from external targets, such as selected Earth-view sites and the Moon. Lunar observations for MODIS have taken place nearly monthly through the space-view port over the entire mission in a narrow phase angle range, with view geometry corrections provided by the USGS ROLO model. These observations have provided a stable calibration reference that has allowed for the characterization of the MODIS scan-mirror response at a different angle-of-incidence compared to the onboard solar diffuser. In this work, we will detail the lunar calibration algorithms for MODIS with a focus on changes related to the Collection 7 RVS characterization. These include a change from using every lunar image (including partial images) to using only full disk lunar images in order to remove errors from pixel oversampling, a data mask to remove crosstalk contamination, and a correction to digital counting errors for some detectors (referred to as sticky bin). Overall, these changes lead to reduced variation in the data, particularly for the mirror-side differences, and an improvement to the data quality without a significant change in long-term trends.

TI  - Surface Corrected Lunar MTF Measurements in MODIS and VIIRS Using the SP Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunar observations have been used for sensor performance assessments for a number of Earth-observing instruments, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP (SNPP) and NOAA-20 (N20). While the primary purpose of lunar observations in MODIS and VIIRS is radiometric calibration, these observations have been leveraged for other sensor performance assessments, such as spatial registration and deriving the modulation transfer function (MTF). In this work, we will derive the lunar MTF using a knife-edge approach similar to the previous work. However, to further isolate the edge of the lunar disk when deriving the edge spread function (ESF), we will apply a lunar surface variation correction using a model based on data obtained by the spectral profiler (SP) onboard the SELENE spacecraft. This model was provided to us by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan. To align the measured and modeled data, we developed techniques for projecting the measured lunar surface pixels onto the radiance maps produced by the SP model. We correct the lunar surface variation while preserving the signal of the lunar disk edge in the ESF and then calculate the MTF results using standard techniques. These results are in good agreement with previously published results from both Moon-based observations in MODIS and VIIRS and from the spectroradiometric calibration assembly (SRCA) on MODIS. With the exception of MODIS bands 1 and 2, the MTF is stable on orbit for the reflective bands in both instruments.

AB  - As climate change-induced global flooding increases in both frequency and magnitude, having accurate and timely flood maps becomes essential for humanitarian and future flood mitigation efforts. The Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) aids humanitarian organizations and inundation observation research efforts through its archive of historical flood events extending back through 1985, as well as by providing current daily flood maps derived from a combination of observations, and also precipitation-based modeling products. Both could benefit from the addition of microwave observations that penetrate through clouds, rain, and vegetation, such as GNSS-R data now becoming available on a daily basis. In this work, we discuss a current collaboration to combine CYGNSS data with operational MODIS flood maps and evaluate the expected benefits for an example scenario over the recent anomalous flooding in South Sudan.

T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An extreme landscape is a spatially heterogeneous area with unusual topography that is prone to natural disasters but still exhibits interrelated structures and functions. One of the important functions of an extreme landscape is its ecological function. This study aimed to determine the structure and reveal the ecological functions of an extreme landscape in a tropical region of West Java, with special reference to Rongga Sub-district. The method used was a combination of remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems, which were required to process, analyze, and interpret Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data. The landscape structure was quantified by landscape metrics, after which an analysis of ecological functions was carried out based on the constituent elements of the landscape. The results showed that the landscape structure of Rongga Sub-district consists of various elements of agroforestry land, open fields, settlements, shrubs, plantations, and rainfed and irrigated rice fields. Additionally, secondary forest land acted as a landscape matrix where rivers crossed as natural corridors. The amount of each element varied; agroforestry land had the highest value, indicating that this element showed a high degree of human intervention. Each patch was adjacent to other patch types, and the landscape diversity was quite high. The extreme topography of Rongga Sub-district supports the landscape connectivity and consequently the presence of wild animals in this area. Therefore, Rongga Sub-district has an essential ecological function as a refuge for protected animals living in non-conservation areas.

We then used maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) to classify the landscape into four 'spectral similarity' classes that reflected the degree to which 30-m pixels contained a multispectral signature similar to that found at known owl nest/roost sites and mapped spectral similarity classes from 1986-2020. For map interpretation, we used nationally consistent forest inventory data to evaluate the structural and compositional characteristics of each spectral similarity class. We found a monotonic increase of structural characteristics typically associated with owl nesting and roosting over classes of increasing similarity, with the 'very similar' class meeting or exceeding published minimum desired management conditions for owl nesting and roosting. We also found an increased rate of loss of forest vegetation typical of owl nesting and roosting since the beginning of the 21st century that can be partly attributed to increased frequency and extent of large (>= 400 ha) wildfires. This loss resulted in a 38% reduction over the 35-year study period in forest vegetation most similar to that used for owl nesting and roosting.

TI  - DEEP LEARNING FOR THE DETECTION OF EARLY SIGNS FOR FOREST DAMAGE BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - We present an approach for detecting early signs for upcoming forest damages by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the pixel-wise prediction of the remaining life-time (RLT) of trees in forests based on Sentinel-2 imagery. We focus on a scenario in which reference data are only available for a related task, namely for a bi-temporal pixel-wise classification of forest degradation. This reference is used to train a CNN for the pixel-wise prediction of forest degradation. In this context, we propose a new sub-sampling-based approach for compensating the effects of a heavy class imbalance in the training data. Using the resulting classification model, we predict semi-labels for images of a Sentinel-2 time series, from which training data for a CNN designed to regress the RLT can be derived after some label cleansing. However, due to data gaps in the time series, e.g. caused by clouds, only intervals can be derived for the target variable to be regressed, and for some training pixels one of the interval limits may even be unknown. Consequently, we propose a new loss function for training a CNN for regressing the RLT that only requires the known interval limits. The method is evaluated on a data set in Germany, covering a time-span of 5 years. We show that the proposed sub-sampling strategy for dealing with strong label imbalance when training the classifier significantly reduces the training time compared to other approaches. We further show that our model predicts the RLT with a maximum error of two months for 80% of the forest pixels that die within one year from the acquisition date of the Sentinel-2 image.

AB  - In this study we map Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) urban household water supply data from 30 African countries and 52 DHS-surveys to Sentinel 2 RGB data and show that modern convolutional neural networks can find a mapping function and predict abstract variables derived from DHS data, like household water supply. In addition, the purpose of this research is to show the ability of such networks to predict data for areas and countries where no survey data are available. Therefore, we use one-year medians of 2x2km cloud removed Sentinel 2 tiles at the surveyed locations in a VGG19 CNN and classify sources of water supply. In addition, we perform a regression analysis for the distance and the first principal component of a PCA. We achieve an F1-score of up to 0.76 for the classification and an r(2) of 0.76 for the prediction of the first principal component. The prediction of the distance to the water source is less precise with an r(2) of 0.57, which is potentially due to the extreme skewness of input data. In further studies, we want to prove that these results can also be achieved for rural and mixed models as well as for other food security indicators, such as asset wealth.

TI  - Association between viral suppression during the third trimester of pregnancy and unintended pregnancy among women on antiretroviral therapy: Results from the 2019 antenatal HIV Sentinel Survey, South Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives About half of the pregnancies among women living with HIV (WLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan African countries are reported to be unintended. Unintended pregnancy is associated with late initiation of antenatal care (ANC), and may delay provision of viral load monitoring services, antenatal adherence counselling and support, and other services that promote sustained viral suppression throughout pregnancy. This study examines the association between unsuppressed viral load during the third trimester of pregnancy and unintended pregnancy among women who initiated ART before pregnancy.Methods This was an analysis of data from a national antenatal survey conducted at 1 589 public health facilities in South Africa between 1 October and 15 November 2019. Consenting pregnant women aged 15-49 years attending ANC during the survey period were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data were collected through interview and medical record review. Pregnancy intention was assessed using two questions from the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy, and responses were categorized as "unintended," "undecided," and "intended." Blood specimens were collected from all women and tested for HIV; and if positive, a viral load test was performed. A survey domain-based poisson regression model examined the association between unsuppressed viral load during the third trimester of pregnancy and unintended pregnancy among women who initiated ART before pregnancy. Viral suppression was defined as viral load <50 copies/mL.Results Of 10 901 WLWH with viral load data available, 63.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.4%-64.1%) were virally suppressed. Among the 2 681 women (representing 24.1% of all WLWH with viral load data) who initiated ART before pregnancy and were in their third trimester at the time of enrolment, 74.4% (95% CI: 73.0%-75.8%) were virally suppressed. In the same population, the proportion virally suppressed was lower among women whose current pregnancies were unintended (72.1%, 95% CI: 70.1%-74.1%) compared to women whose pregnancies were intended (78.3%, 95% CI: 75.9%-80.5%). In multivariable analyses adjusted for age, gravity, marital status, education, location of facility and syphilis status, unintended pregnancy was associated with unsuppressed viral load during the third trimester (adjusted relative risk: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4) among women who initiated ART before pregnancy.Conclusion The identified association between unsuppressed viral load and unintended pregnancy among pregnant women who initiated ART before pregnancy highlights the need to strengthen routine assessment of fertility preferences and provision of contraceptive services to reproductive age WLWH receiving ART.

AB  - Drought   caused   by   meteorological   factors   negatively   affects   vegetation   in   terrestrial ecosystems.  In  this  study,  the  state  in  which  meteorological  drought  affects  vegetation  was  defined  as the ecological drought of vegetation, and the ecological drought condition index of vegetation (EDCI- veg) was proposed to quantitatively monitor the degree of impact. EDCI-veg is derived from a copula- based  bi-variate  joint  probability  model  between  vegetation  and  meteorological  drought  information, and  can  be  expressed  numerically  how  affected  the  current  vegetation  condition  was  by  the  drought when  the  drought  occurred.  Comparing  past  meteorological  drought  events  with  their  corresponding vegetation  condition,  the  proposed  index  was  examined,  and  it  was  confirmed  that  EDCI-veg  could properly  monitor  the  ecological  drought  of  vegetation.  In  addition,  it  was  possible  to  spatially  identify ecological drought conditions by creating a high-resolution drought map using remote sensing data.

AB  - This study is a study of the aesthetic elements of space and the shape of emotional aesthetics that art pursues. In other words, it categorizes the spatial shape of Korean dance into the spatial form of the deliberate and spontaneous aesthetic world, such as the beauty of the line, the beauty of color, and the beauty of the spatial worldview, and structurally discusses the phenomenon of dance becoming an art and a beauty.   Through the shape and aesthetic spatial aspects of dance, the margins were able to confirm that the phenomenon of dance was a space of structural dynamics in which the phenomenon of dance became an art at its root. Dance seeks to shape itself as the art of the body, and when the figure disappears by time, it gives a sense of beauty in which only the energy and aesthetic shape painted in space remain.In this sense, the dance itself is the Blank Spaces, and the movement is the energy of the imagination that transcends the fingertips, the toes. In addition, the marginal beauty of Korean dance is not a spatial imagination that is left empty like a painting, but an emptiness and dissolution that is let go. It is the color of white light that pursues the ball while repeating the making and unraveling.

AB  - In this study, a mixed research method that collects and analyzes qualitative and quantitative data together was used to broaden the understanding of young children’s faith. First of all, the contents of interviews with 18 research participants were divided into categories, and the frequency of each category was calculated. From 75 statements made in the interview, the importance of each was evaluated with a 5-point Likert scale. The means and standard deviations of the evaluation score were calculated, and sub-factors were identified through exploratory factor analysis. The frequency of categories mentioned in the qualitative interview was in the following order: faith manifested in difficulties, religious activities, Christian education at home, Christian education in the church, love and faith in God, and the formation of a Christian worldview (identity). The statement on the perception of God, theological concepts, religious activities, and Christian education at home and in the church received high scores. On the other hand, statements on developmentally difficult or abstract content, value judgment or conflict resolution based on the Word, and evangelism showed low scores. The sub-factors extracted through factor analysis were faith education through home and church, awareness of God and religious activities, identity based on the gospel, character based on the gospel, and overcoming a crisis through faith. In conclusion, the results of each of the mixed methods of looking at young children’s faith were very similarrelationships with God, religious activities, Christian worldview (identity), Christian education at home and church were highlighted, even though various methods were used. This study is meaningful in that it suggests what and how to teach in early childhood Christian education.

AB  - The process of change in the world perception of Mao Zedong and the CCP before the reform era was ultimately a process of struggling to establish an independent worldview. From the beginning of its foundation, the CCP interpreted the international situation from the viewpoint of ‘world revolution’ rather than from the Chinese reality, accepting the world view of the Comintern as it is. As a consequence, the CCP subordinated the strategy of the Chinese revolution to the interests of the Soviet Union and the Comintern’s world revolution. Although it is true that Mao stressed the importance of ‘independence and self-reliance’, the CCP’s official world view and interpretation of international circumstances, even after Mao’s rise to power in the party, was basically a copy of Comintern’s viewpoint, at least until the end of the Sino-Japanese war.Mao Zedong’s ‘intermediate-zone’ theory, which was raised in 1946, was a very important turning point in the centenary of the CCP’s world perception in that it was the starting point for establishing an independent worldview based on the ‘attitude toward China’. During Mao’s era, this ‘intermediate-zone’ theory showed various variations and finally resulted in the ‘three-worlds theory’ of the 1970s. Also, even when there was a paradigm shift in the CCP’s world strategy under the discourse of ‘peace and development’ in Deng Xiaoping’s era, assessing other countries’ attitude towards China has always been at the core of CCP’s world perception since 1946. During Mao’s period, when the antagonistic ideological atmosphere prevailed in the Cold War regime, it was expressed in the ideological concept and term of ‘anti-imperialism’. But after Deng Xiaoping, when ideological confrontation weakened, ‘anti-hegemonism’ became the new keyword, which was a more specific and exact expression in explaining the worldview of Mao’s and Deng’s era.The world perceptions of the CCP in the Mao’s and Deng’s era were basically ‘responsive’ in that they took the attitude of foreign powers toward China as the core factor of their perception. However, following the rise of China in the end of the 20th century, important changes have been taking place in this ‘responsive’ world view. The CCP is gradually admitting its status as a world power and is actively demonstrating its will to reform the international regime according to ‘Chinese standards’. These changes appearing in the 21st century are very different from the CCP’s world perception that has been maintained throughout Mao’s and Deng’s era. Breaking away from the existing worldview which was focused on understanding the international situation mainly in response to external threats, China is now seeing itself as the center of world civilization and is revealing its grand ambition to reconstruct the world order based on Chinese model.‘Modern Chinese nationalism’ and ‘Traditional Sino-centrism’ were the two pillars that constituted the CCP’s worldview in the past 100 years. Whereas the former became the main melody in the eras of Mao and Deng, as China accomplished its basic goals of nationalism at the end of the 20th century, it is very likely that the center of gravity gradually shifted to the latter.

AB  - This study attempts to newly understand “Hwajeonga of Dendongeomi” from a rhetorical point of view. Because literature is an essence of language and an intensive everyday language, we can learn rhetoric from literature. From the perspective of rhetoric, “Hwajeonga of Dendongeomi” consists of persuasion stories of the main character and surrounding characters discussing remarriage. The educational significance derived by analyzing these discourse can be derived by methods of argumentative schemes and model.“Hwajeonga of Dendongeomi” shows various and authentic persuasion methods. The protagonist used two types of examples to persuade the widow to remarry. First, her life was used as an illustrative example, and secondly, another's cases was used as inductive examples. Meanwhile, the woman in the neighborhood used an analogy to persuade the main character.“Hwajeonga of Dendongeomi” shows the importance of the warrant in persuasion. The warrant that is a principle that connects claims and reasons contains the speaker's world view. In this work, the circular worldview and the fateful worldview are competing. The main character changes from a circular worldview to a fateful worldview and changes from being persuaded to being persuaded.The tradition of using literature in rhetoric was also in Aristotle’s Rhetoric. In Korean language education, literatures can be used to enrich the contents of rhetoric. This study is meaningful as such an attempt.

AB  - This study attempted classification through deep learning-based image training for land cover classification in river spaces which is one of the important data for efficient river management. For this purpose, land cover classification analysis with the RGB image of the target section based on the category classification index of major land cover map was conducted by using the learning outcomes from the result of labeling. In addition, land cover classification of the river spaces was performed by unsupervised and supervised classification from Sentinel-2 satellite images provided in an open format, and this was compared with the results of deep learning-based image classification. As a result of the analysis, it showed more accurate prediction results compared to unsupervised classification results, and it presented significantly improved classification results in the case of high-resolution images. The result of this study showed the possibility of classifying water areas and wetlands in the river spaces, and if additional research is performed in the future, the deep learning based image train method for the land cover classification could be used for river management.

AB  - The fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora (Ea) was first reported in 2015 in Korea, and the disease has rapidly spread to 22 regions until 2021. In Korea, all host plants in the apple and pear orchards where fire blight occurred should be eliminated and buried by the Plant Protection Act. To prevent the spread of the disease, all burial sites were prohibited from planting the new host plants for the next three years. To confirm the eradication efficiency of Ea and the reoccurrence of fire blight, the surveillance facilities were established on three burial sites from 2019 to 2020 in Anseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, and Chungju-si, Chungcheongbuk-do. As host plants, five apple trees of fire blight-susceptible cultivar ‘Fuji’, were planted in each facility. All facilities were enclosed with fences and nets and equipped with two CCTVs, motion sensors, and several other sensors for recording weather conditions to monitor the environment of the sentinel plants in real-time. The sentinel plants were checked for the reoccurrence of fire blight routinely. Suspicious plant parts were collected and analyzed for Ea detection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification polymerase chain reaction and conventional polymerase chain reaction. Until November 2022, Ea has not been detected in all sentinel plants. These results might support that the burial control of infected plants in soil works efficiently to remove Ea and support the possibility to shorten the prohibition period of host plant establishment in the burial sites.

AB  - In this study a method for near-real time (nRT) crop progress estimation (CPE) for data-poor regions - those without large scale crop surveys - is proposed. The method utilizes Long Short-Term Memory and is pre-trained on USDA corn crop progress data for the US Midwest using weather and MODIS-derived vegetation index products. Performance of the method is evaluated in different growing zones of Argentina, a major corn exporter, using Bolsa de Cereales corn crop progress data. To establish how the proposed nRT CPE method would perform in regions any ground survey data, evaluation is conducted without prior access to or fine-tuning on Argentinian ground truth crop progress. Initial results from a single growing zone in Argentina indicate that pre-training an LSTM-based nRT CPE method using data from regions with high ground truth data availability may translate to effective nRT CPE in regions where ground survey data are unavailable.

TI  - <i>L</i><sub>(1/2)</sub> Regularization for ISAR Imaging and Target Enhancement of Complex Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging technology are powerful tools to acquire high-resolution radar image, which is an important basis for further automatic target recognition (ATR). For ISAR, if the radar frequency is high enough, signals that the radar received usually have strong sparsity when the radar data convert to Fourier domain, and they can be downsampled and restored by compressed sensing (CS). As for the regularization method in CS theory, while regularization is proved to be a sparse regularization framework and could achieve well performance. In this work, inspired by the -based complex approximated message passing (CAMP) method and the regularization framework, we extend the CAMP method into an -based iterative thresholding method in ISAR imaging under the downsampling rate of the scattered fields. The matched filtering (MF) method is widely used to generate the SAR image, where targets are usually overwhelmed by noise and scene background. In order to make the target enhanced to further improve recognition, regularization is adopted in recovering sparse solution and the clutter reduction of MF image. This work implements the-based regularization into the SAR image target enhancement and the scene-noise reduction via CAMP. The SAR image is generated by ideal point scatterers and the real measurement data of RADARSAT-1. Given the sparsity estimated, the experiment results show the advantage of regularization compared with the regularization.

AB  - The urban thermal environment has an important impact on human health and sustainable development. Most of the current mainstream studies on the influence of thermal environment focus on the relationship analysis with a single factor, but there are fewer studies on multiple factors and their interactions, and there is a lack of analysis of human activities as an important factor. In this paper, the relationship between summer surface temperature and natural environment, surface cover, landscape structure, and human activities in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is investigated in depth by using Bayesian structural equation model. The results show that: impervious surface (0.66) and air temperature (0.78) have significant positive effects on the thermal environment, while vegetation (-0.37) and transpiration (-0.27) have significant negative effects on the thermal environment; human activities indirectly affect the surface thermal environment through their effects on the natural environment and landscape structure, so the construction of the driving mechanism model of the surface thermal environment needs to consider the role of human activities The model results are optimal at 6k scales, with Rhat less than 1.01 for all parameters, Bulk_ESS and Tail_ESS values greater than 1500, and no effect value over 1. The LOOIC value is 67431.1. The remote sensing image data has the advantages of sufficient data volume and significant spatial and temporal effects, so it is feasible and effective to apply it to BSEM analysis.

TI  - A new estimate of global desert area and quantity of dust emission
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deserts and their margins have long presented a challenge for human habitation_ as an unstable and easily degraded environment. Deserts are the most important source of global dust emission, and the dust flux can be used as an index of land degradation and climate change, as well as a way to assess the dust's own effects on global climate. In this study. we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, combing with Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis. trial-and-error method and visual interpretation analyses, to extract the global and regional desert area, and analyze the accuracy of classification of the extracted desert area. We use data on topography. precipitation, evapotranspiration, and surface wind speed to characterize the environment of the world's deserts, in order to explore the natural conditions that produce and accompany desert and produce a clear objective definition for the desert environment. Our results show that global desert area is similar to 17.5 x10(6) km(3), and the overall classificatory' accuracy is 92%. according to the cross-checked by the multi-sources data calibrations. Globally, desert is mainly distributed in eastern hemisphere and northern hemisphere; North Africa and East Asia have the largest desert area. The classificatory accuracy of all individual regions is greater than 75%. Global desert, as characterized by our multi-faceted definition, is mainly distributed in low regions below 2000 m elevation, mean annual precipitation less than 200 mm. and annual wind speed is about 4-6 m/s. Based on our defined distribution of global deserts. we estimated dust emissions from those areas.Because dust emission is a small-scale, random process, it is necessary to collect field data of dust emission from typical landscape types. in order to describe dust emission and quantitatively assess their impact. We used data from the Portable In-Situ Wind Erosion Laboratory (PI-SWERL), which is a newly developed portable wind erosion instrument. Its observation data are in good agreement with the wind tunnel experiment results. Because of its small size and portability, it has great advantages in measuring dust emission at specific sites. We integrated measured data about 1400 PI-SWERL observation points of dust emission (PM10), combing with land cover type. soil moisture and friction wind speed data, and obtained about 14000 points quantifying dust emission through interpolation. These 14000 dust emission amounts points are distributed across different areas of the desert. Using these 14000 points to make Tyson polygons, we estimated the annual dust emission amount of each polygon area, and then added each annual dust emission amounts polygon area to obtain the annual dust emission amount of global desert. Dust emission amount shows considerable geographical differences between different desert areas. The region around the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea in central Asia,. Mesopotamia in western Asia. sandy areas in northern West Asia and eastern Australia have the highest annual dust emission rates. This result is in good agreement with previously published results on global dust source regions. The annual dust emission amounts in the desert area are similar to 1792.65 Tg/a, and North Africa has the largest annual dust emission amounts, similar to 786.03 Tg/a, accounting for 43.85% of the total dust emission amounts of global desert. According to the relationship between dust deposition in land and sea, we estimate that similar to 1344.49 Tg/a dust is deposited in land and similar to 448.16 Tg/a in ocean. The global desert area interpreted from remote sensing images using our new standardized protocol, and our dust emission estimates. will facilitate further understanding of the environmental changes within deserts and their impacts.

TI  - Online Forest Disturbance Detection at the Sub-Annual Scale Using Spatial Context From Sparse Landsat Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest disturbances using dense time series can timely identify disturbances at the subannual scale. However, these change detection methods using dense time series may be infeasible when not enough temporal observations are available. In this article, an online change detection algorithm that identifies forest disturbances at a subannual scale using spatial context from the sparse Landsat time series was proposed. First, the spatial normalized index that removed forest seasonality was prepared for establishing a simplified model instead of the harmonic model, thereby reducing the requirements for a high temporal frequency of clear observations for model initialization. Second, by using the spatial errors model to establish the simplified model, the normally distributed residual time series that removed the spatial autocorrelation were obtained. Third, the spatial statistic t time series transformed from residual time series within a 3 x 3 spatial window were subsequently subjected to the exponentially weighted moving average t chart (EWMA-t), which is a statistical process control chart for a short cycle corresponding to sparse Landsat time series. Fourth, disturbed pixels were labeled if the chart values persistently deviated from the control limits of the chart. The proposed algorithm was applied to a subtropical forest with low Landsat data availability and yielded an overall accuracy of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 93.7%, achieving accurate and timely identification of forest disturbances. The proposed method called the EWMA-t change detection (EWMATCD) algorithm provides an alternative for disturbance detection at the subannual scale in regions with low data availability.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis on Coastline Changes of Yangtze River Delta Based on High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline situation reflects socioeconomic development and ecological environment in coastal zones. Analyzing coastline changes clarifies the current coastline situation and provides a scientific basis for making environmental protection policies, especially for coastlines with significant human interference. As human activities become more intense, coastline types and their dynamic changes become more complicated, which needs more detailed identification of coastlines. High spatial resolution images can help provide detailed large spatial coverage at high resolution information on coastal zones. This study aims to map the position and status of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) coastline using an NDWI threshold method based on 2 m Gaofen-1/Ziyuan-3 imagery and analyze coastline change and coastline type distribution characteristics. The results showed that natural and artificial coastlines in the YRD region accounted for 42.73% and 57.27% in 2013 and 41.56% and 58.44% in 2018, respectively. The coastline generally advanced towards the sea, causing a land area increase of 475.62 km(2). The changes in the YRD coastline mainly resulted from a combination of large-scale artificial construction and natural factors such as silt deposition. This study provides a reference source for large spatial coverage at high resolution remote sensing coastline monitoring and a better understanding of land use in coastal zone.

TI  - Estimation of Maximum Hail Diameters from FY-4A Satellite Data with a Machine Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude of damage caused by hail depends on its size; however, direct observation or indirect estimation of hail size remains a significant challenge. One primary reason for estimations by proxy, such as through remote sensing methods, is that empirical relationships or statistical models established in one region may not apply to other areas. This study employs a machine learning method to build a hail size estimation model without assuming relations in advance. It uses FY-4A AGRI data to provide cloud-top information and ERA5 data to add vertical environment information. Before training the model, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze the highly influential factors on hail sizes. A total of 18 features, composed of four groups, namely brightness temperature (BT), the difference in BT (BTD), thermodynamics, and dynamics groups, were chosen from 29 original features. Dynamic and BTD features show superior performance in identifying large hail. Although the selected features are more closely correlated to hail sizes than unselected ones, the relationships are complicated and nonlinear. As a result, a two-layer regression back propagation neural network (BPNN) model with powerful fitting ability is trained with selected features to predict maximum hail diameter (MHD). The linear fitting R-2 between predicted and observed MHDs is 0.52 on the test set, which signifies that our model performs well compared with other hail size estimation models. We also examine the model concerning all three hail cases in Shanghai, China, between 2019 and 2021. The model attained more satisfactory results than the radar-based maximum estimated hail size (MEHS) method, which overestimates the MHDs, thus further supporting the operational applications of our model.

AB  - Vegetation phenology is a key indicator of ecosystem processes and biosphere feedbacks to the climate system. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used for large scale phenology observations. In this study, the first-order derivative (FOD) method was used to extract the start of the growing season (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS) based on the GIMMS LAI3g time series from 1982 to 2015. The results showed that the global 34-year mean SOS and EOS exhibited significant latitudinal variation in spatial distribution. In the Northern Hemisphere, SOS and EOS showed insignificant trend (1982-2015). In the Southern Hemisphere, EOS showed significantly delayed trend of 0.1251 days/year. In addition, GIMMS SOS and EOS showed a significant positive correlation on a global scale with MODIS SOS and EOS. Overall, we produced global vegetation phenology data with longer time series (1982-2015) compared to MODIS vegetation dynamics products (MCD12Q2).

TI  - Urban Impervious Surface Extraction Using Seasonal Time Series SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban impervious surface (UIS) is an essential indicator to measure urban ecology, and understanding its temporal and spatial distribution is of great significance for alleviating urban diseases, such as heat island. Although remote sensing techniques have been widely used to extract UIS, the capability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology in UIS extraction has not been thoroughly investigated. Accordingly, this article systematically analyzed the role of the backscattering and interferometric coherence features of dual polarized (VH/VV) SAR in UIS extraction, taking Tianjin city, China, as a study case. Specifically, we used seasonal time series Sentinel-1B backscattering and coherence images to extract UIS via two object-based classifiers. We further investigated the seasonal, polarization, and precipitation effects on UIS extraction using SAR images. Our findings suggested that, for coherence images, the extraction accuracy of UIS in summer is the highest, while for backscattering that in spring and winter are the highest. Our results also suggested that VH polarization is more suitable for UIS extraction compared with VV polarization. These findings of this study confirmed the utility and effectiveness of time series SAR backscattering and coherence images in UIS extraction, providing an essential reference for UIS extraction in other places with a similar climate. We encourage more efforts to be made toward UIS extraction using SAR images and toward designing a filling scheme for the UIS extraction in a continuous manner, especially in cloudy and rainy areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the natural environment and orthopedic diseases based on remote sensing in Zhejiang Province, China. The Landsat 8 OLI images were employed to extract environmental factors such as the vegetation, water, and urban indices. Combined with the distribution data of patients of different ages diagnosed with different types of orthopedic diseases, derived from the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, we analyzed the spatial distribution relationship and evaluated the natural environmental factors around the distribution sites of the patients. The results showed that the vegetation index (NDVI) is negatively correlated with the prevalence of hospital visits, whereas the water index (MNDWI) is positively correlated. And urban index (IBI) is positively correlated but unstable. The analysis and evaluation of the impact of natural environmental factors related to the patient on orthopedic diseases show that the risk of orthopedic disease might be associated with less vegetation and more water, and are not related to urbanization. And this conclusion is stable in the four seasons.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of Albedo at Subpixel Satellite Scales and Its Effect in Validation: Airborne Remote Sensing Results From HiWATER
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing the subpixel heterogeneity within satellite pixels is a key issue in validation. Nevertheless, it is challenging due to multi-scale problems in the geological description based on remote sensing. Based on an airborne platform, the multi-scale variation laws of several key indicators in validation including spatial heterogeneity (SH), representativeness errors, and representative area with subpixel size were analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, this article discussed the optimal subpixel size to assess SH within a coarse pixel and the optimal footprint of in situ measurements for building dense and sparse validation networks. SH decreases with the increase of subpixel size. And a reduction of about 10% can be obtained from 5 m x 5 m to 150 m x 150 m subpixel size, depending on the degree of SH within the typical satellite pixels. And the sensitiveness of SH to subpixel size decreases gradually with the increasing of subpixel size. Ideally, SH should be assessed using maps with pixel sizes corresponding to the footprint of in situ measurements. Regarding the deployment of future validation networks, the footprint of in situ sites should be designed at least larger than 25 m for dense networks. And much larger footprints (e.g., 100 m) are preferred in designing sparse networks. The representativeness error is not fully related to subpixel sizes because it is affected by many factors. The findings are also transferable to model evaluation when comparing model grid values to local observations.

AB  - In recent years, enormous research has been made to improve the classification performance of single-modal remote sensing (RS) data. However, with the ever-growing availability of RS data acquired from satellite or airborne platforms, simultaneous processing and analysis of multimodal RS data pose a new challenge to researchers in the RS community. To this end, we propose a deep-learning-based new framework for multimodal RS data classification, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are taken as a backbone with an advanced cross-channel reconstruction module, called CCR-Net. As the name suggests, CCR-Net learns more compact fusion representations of different RS data sources by the means of the reconstruction strategy across modalities that can mutually exchange information in a more effective way. Extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal RS datasets, including hyperspectral (HS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, i.e., the Houston2013 dataset, and HS and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, i.e., the Berlin dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CCR-Net in comparison with several state-of-the-art multimodal RS data classification methods. The codes will be openly and freely available at https://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE_TGRS_CCR-Net for the sake of reproducibility.

AB  - Landscape pattern change can well show the results of the interaction between human beings and the natural environment. Based on the Landsat series images of Daqing City from 1999 to 2019, we used Fragstats software to analyze and calculate various landscape indexes. The results showed that the construction land and forest land were increased, the grassland, cultivated land and unused land were reduced, and the water change rate was the lowest. The landscape fragmentation and heterogeneity of Daqing City were decreased, the gap between the types of landscape patches gradually narrowed, and the landscape abundance were increased. Daqing city showed the aggregate growth. Population and policy factors are the main driving forces of landscape pattern change in Daqing City.

AB  - In this work, we compare the impact of two ways of representing the crop growth model uncertainty (the crop growth model was calibrated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)) on the subsequent assimilation of the Sentinel-2 LAI through Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF): generating N sets of crop parameters based on the Optimal-posterior parameter value (reference method, we name it OMCMC-EnKF) and Randomly selecting N sets of crop parameters from the most frequent parameters (our proposed method, RMCMC-EnKF). The results show that our proposed method is better than the reference model, when compared with the field measured winter wheat LAI and yield, its performance in the R-2, RMSE, and uncertainty estimation is better. Furthermore, our proposed method is more robust to feedback from remote sensing data and more resistant to lower quality observations encountered during assimilation.

AB  - Accurate and timely regional crop yield information, particularly field-level yield estimation, is essential for commodity traders and producers in planning production, growing, harvesting, and other interconnected marketing activities. In this study, we propose a novel data assimilation framework. Firstly, we construct the county-level prior and likelihood constraints for a process-based crop growth model based on the previous year's statistical yield and the current year's field observations. Then, we infer the posterior sets of model-simulated time-series LAI and the final yield of winter wheat with an MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) method for each meteorological data grid of ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5). Finally, we estimate the winter wheat yield at the spatial resolution of 10 m by combining Sentinel-2 LAI and the WOFOST model in Hengshui, the prefecture-level city of Hebei province of China. The results show that the proposed framework can estimate the winter wheat yield with a coefficient of determination R-2 equal to 0.29 and mean absolute percentage error MAPE equal to 7.20% compared with field measurements. However, agricultural stress that crop growth models cannot quantitatively simulate, such as lodging, can greatly reduce the accuracy. The results also suggest good agreements with county-level statistics of the growing year with a coefficient of determination R2 equal to 0.52 and mean absolute percentage error MAPE equal to 7.19%.

AB  - We jointly analyzed 23 L-band ALOS PALSAR scenes and over 200 soil core samples collected near the Toolik region. Based on the fact that the maximum thaw subsidence is proportional to the total soil water content in the active layer, we derived an equivalent water depth map over the Toolik area using the InSAR thaw subsidence estimates. We quantified the noise terms in the InSAR measurements and demonstrated that the DEM error is the dominant error source in the study area, mostly in steep terrains. We developed a mitigation strategy that reduces the uncertainty in the InSAR-based soil water estimates from > 20cm to < 10cm. Our study suggests that InSAR has greater observational capabilities than previously assumed for monitoring the active layer soil water storage above continuous permafrost.

AB  - Snow is one of the most significant essential climate variables in global climate change study, and snowmelt accounts for a large part of the streamflow in mountainous regions on the Tibetan Plateau. However, previously researchers often calculate snow water equivalent using precipitation data, which is more unreliable in solid precipitation. This study is designed to combine a hydrological model and snow remote sensing data to improve the streamflow simulation in Lhasa river basin. Firstly, this study proposes a method to produce a set of snow cover maps with high temporal and spatial resolution from multiple satellite imagery (MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel-1. Secondly, by comparing with this snow cover product, we evaluated the capability of a Geomorphology-Based Hydrological Model (GBHM) on snow cover simulation. Third, by margining the remotely sensed snow cover maps into the GBHM, the improvement of spring streamflow simulation was validated against in situ gauge observation. Finally, the GBHM simulated snow water equivalent (SWE), which was constrained by the water balance, was employed to assess the performance of SWE products in this basin. This study provide a method to estimate streamflow reliably in snow-covered mountainous regions, as well as to evaluate SWE at basin scale.

TI  - Investigating the Efficacy of the SMAP Downscaled Soil Moisture Product for Drought Monitoring Based on Information Theory
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) information can be routinely obtained from high-quality microwave retrievals at a global scale-such as datasets generated by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. In this article, using mutual information (MI) theory, we investigate the efficacy of the downscaled SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2 3-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL2) for the detection of agricultural drought over northwestern China. The SPL2 is generated by merging SMAP enhanced radiometer data with Sentinel-1 radar observations. To evaluate the efficiency of the SPL2 downscaled algorithm, the SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer 9-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL3) is also utilized as a non-downscaled baseline. Over croplands, comparing normalized MI (NMI) values sampled between the NDVI time series and 3-km Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficient (sigma) from SPL2 with NMI values between NDVI and SPL3 radiometer brightness temperature (Tb; resampled to 3-km resolution), we find that the Sentinel-1 sigma explains more (3-km) NDVI information than the SPL3 Tb, as the NMI between sigma(vh) (sigma(vv)) and NDVI is 15% (8%), larger than that between SPL3 Tb and NDVI (5%). However, compared to the SPL3 Tb baseline, the information from downscaled SPL2 Tb on NDVI is reduced by approximately 3%, and the SPL2 algorithm extracts only 7% (10%) of the total information available from both enhanced SPL3 Tb and Sentinel-1 sigma(vh) (sigma(vv)). Overall, the C-band sigma signal provides valuable information for vegetation monitoring due to its frequency advantage. However, additional efforts should be focused on SPL2 merging algorithms to improve the value of the downscaled SPL2 product for agricultural applications.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring and Driving Force Analysis of Salinized Soil in Grassland Mining Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To deal with the problem of soil salinization that exists widely in semi-arid grassland, the Shengli Coalfield in Xilinhot City was selected as the study area. Six periods of Landsat remote sensing data in 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017 were used to extract the salinity index (SI) and surface albedo to construct the SI-Albedo feature space. The salinization monitoring index (SMI) was used to calculate and classify the soil salinization grades in the study area. The soil salinization status and its dynamic changes were monitored and analyzed. Combined with the logistic regression model, the roles of human and natural factors in the development of soil salinization were determined. The results were as follows: (1) The SMI index constructed using the SI-Albedo feature space is simple and easy to calculate, which is conducive to remote sensing monitoring of salinized soil. R-2 of the SMI and soil salt content in the 2017 data from the study area is 0.7313, which achieves good results in the quantitative analysis and monitoring of soil salinization in the Xilinhot Shengli Coalfield. (2) The study area is a grassland landscape. However, grassland landscapes are decreasing year by year, and town landscapes, mining landscapes, and road landscapes are greatly increased. The areas of soil salinization reversion in the Shengli mining area from 2002-2005, 2005-2008, 2008-2011, 2011-2014, 2014-2017, and 2002-2017 were 65.64 km(2), 1.03 km(2), 18.44 km(2), 0.9 km(2), 7.52 km(2,) and 62.33 km(2), respectively. The overall trend of soil salinization in the study area was reversed from 2002 to 2017. (3) The driving factors of salinized land from 2002 to 2008 are as follows: the distance to the nearest town landscape > the distance to the nearest mining landscape > the distance to the nearest road landscape. The driving factors of salinized land from 2008 to 2017 are as follows: the distance to nearest mining landscape > the distance to the nearest water landscape > the distance to nearest town landscape > altitude > aspect. Coal exploitation and town expansion have occupied a large amount of saline land, and petroleum exploitation and abandoned railway test sites have intensified the development of saline land. This study provides a reference for the treatment and protection of soil salinization in semi-arid grassland mining areas.

TI  - Deep Learning for the Detection and Phase Unwrapping of Mining-Induced Deformation in Large-Scale Interferograms
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes deep convolutional neural networks to detect and map localized, rapid subsidence caused by mining activities using time-series Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A deformation detection network (DDNet) is developed to automatically identify rapidly subsiding areas from wrapped interferograms, and a phase unwrapping network (PUNet) is designed to unwrap the cropped interferogram patches centered on the detected subsiding locations. To train the two networks, interferogram simulation strategies are developed to generate various training samples using the distorted 2-D Gaussian surface and fractal Perlin noises. The performance of the DDNet is verified by simulations on a synthetic dataset with 13 large interferograms, while the PUNet is evaluated by simulations using synthetic datasets with different levels of deformation gradients and noises. Compared with the traditional and deep-learning methods, the PUNet exhibits excellent performance and efficiency in unwrapping interferograms with rapid mining-induced deformation. The proposed networks are further verified by applying them to Shanxi province, China, which is characterized by serious ground subsidence hazards caused by long-term coal mining activities. The time-series deformations of 1344 detected subsidence areas are calculated with the vertical velocities ranging from -19.7 to -254.8 cm/year. The results are validated using the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 Interferograms and an L-band ALOS-2 interferogram covering the same area within the acquisition period, showing highly consistent vertical deformation rates. The proposed strategy and methods introduce deep learning to the time-series interferometric SAR (InSAR) processing chain and may have profound implications on the detection and monitoring of localized mining-induced deformation using InSAR.

AB  - The PROSAIL (PROSPECT + SAIL) model has been utilized in the retrieval of many vegetation biophysical and biochemical variables such as the leaf area index (LAI) and the leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). However, less attention is paid to the impact of spatial heterogeneity on the PROSAIL model. This paper uses a linear-mixing model to simulate within-pixel spatial heterogeneity. Simulated spectra are resampled to Sentinel-2's bands, and several common spectral indices are calculated. Results show that spectral indices calculated from mixed spectra can deviate up to 10% compared to those calculated from pure spectra when spatial heterogeneity comes to 0.5 (measured in Coefficient of Variation, CV). We further use four widely used machine learning methods for LAI inversion, i.e., Supporting Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Neural Network (NN). Concerning R-square and RMSE, all models trained with pure spectra show performance decline when tested on mixed spectra, which can be partially mitigated by using mixed spectra for model training.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of ice dynamics in Iceland with Sentinel-1 satellite radar images
T2  - JOKULL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, satellite remote sensing has revolutionized observations of glacier dynamics enabling for the first time the generation of detailed ice-velocity fields at regular intervals for Icelandic glaciers. We generated dense time series of ice-velocity fields from 2014 to 2020 exploiting the continuous acquisition of Sentinel-1 SAR using the offset-tracking technique. The fastest ice flow, with velocities up to 400-800 metres per year, is observed in the middle and lower part of the main outlet glaciers of the ice caps that span a large elevation range in the areas of high precipitation in the South and Southeast of Iceland. Several outlet glaciers of Vatnajokull, such as Skeioararjokull and Breioamerkurjokull, draining towards the South and Southeast, show high-ice-speed channels with pronounced shearing zones where the ice speed increases by an order of magnitude within a distance of only a few ice thicknesses. Velocities on the order of a few tens of metres per year, and up to 50-100 metres per year, are observed on the large surge-type outlet glaciers of N- and WVatnajokull and generally on glaciers in the central Icelandic highland and in the northern and western part of the country. Slow-moving ice is observed along the main ice divides and near the glacier margins. The velocity data set is affected by gaps due to decorrelation, particularly during summer, because of temporal variations in the radar-image texture. The ice-velocity fields derived in this study from Sentinel-1 data agree well with other data sets, although these are affected by a larger number of outliers and data gaps, particularly in the accumulation areas. The generated velocity time series can be used for monitoring long-term dynamic trends, seasonal variations and for studying glaciological events such as surges or jokulhlaups.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape visual effect of a city, which is generated by its long-term development, is an important index in city planning. In this study, we build a quantitative evaluation and remote sensing estimation scheme of landscape visual effect. The study contains two main steps. First, utilizing the Elo rating system and in situ sampled panoramic pictures, the quantitative assessment of the city landscape visual effect was carried out. Then, the landscape visual effect estimation model was built and applied to Landsat remote sensing image to generate the spatial distribution of landscape visual effect in Zhengzhou city, 2017. At last, the effect of different combination of land use and elevation to the landscape visual effect was discussed. The results showed the following: (1) the Elo rating system is an effective method to quantitatively evaluate the city landscape visual effect; (2) the landscape visual effect remote sensing estimation model had a good performance, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the model are less than 0.05 and 80, respectively; (3) the landscape visual effect score of Zhengzhou city, 2017, was high in the southwest and low in the northeast; (4) different land use situation and average surface elevation had a complex influence on the landscape visual effect.

TI  - Multitarget Detection Algorithms for Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Target detection is always an important topic in the field of hyper/multispectral remote sensing image processing. At present, target detection algorithms in this field are generally limited to processing single-temporal remote sensing data, and they cannot obtain satisfactory results when the spectra of target and background are similar to each other. Recently, a target detection algorithm called filter tensor analysis (FTA), which is specially designed for multitemporal remote sensing data, has been reported and has achieved better detection results in many cases than the traditional single-temporal methods. However, FTA can only extract one target of interest at a time, and it cannot work when there are multiple targets of interest in the image. Therefore, considering that the matrix form of the FTA method is similar to that of the constrained energy minimization (CEM) model, it naturally comes to us that we can combine the tensor filter in FTA and the multiple target constraints to detect multiple targets by fully exploiting the time-series information in multitemporal data. To be specific, through: 1) adding the "output to one" constraints to the multiple targets in FTA; 2) applying linear/nonlinear function to the outputs of FTA for the multiple targets; and 3) modifying the autocorrelation matrix in FTA, four multitarget detection algorithms for multitemporal remote sensing data are proposed in this article. Experiments with simulation data and real data both show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods.

TI  - Forest Canopy Height Mapping by Synergizing ICESat-2, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Topographic Information Based on Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne LiDAR has been widely used to obtain forest canopy heights over large areas, but it is still a challenge to obtain spatio-continuous forest canopy heights with this technology. In order to make up for this deficiency and take advantage of the complementary for multi-source remote sensing data in forest canopy height mapping, a new method to estimate forest canopy height was proposed by synergizing the spaceborne LiDAR (ICESat-2) data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, multi-spectral images, and topographic data considering forest types. In this study, National Geographical Condition Monitoring (NGCM) data was used to extract the distributions of coniferous forest (CF), broadleaf forest (BF), and mixed forest (MF) in Hua' nan forest area in Heilongjiang Province, China. Accordingly, the forest canopy height estimation models for whole forest (all forests together without distinguishing types, WF), CF, BF, and MF were established, respectively, by Radom Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). The accuracy for established models and the forest canopy height obtained based on estimation models were validated consequently. The results showed that the forest canopy height estimation models considering forest types had better performance than the model grouping all types of forest together. Compared with GBDT, RF with optimal variables had better performance in forest canopy height estimation with Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values for CF, BF, and MF of 0.72, 0.59, 0.62, and 3.15, 3.37, 3.26 m, respectively. It has been validated that a synergy of ICESat-2 with other remote sensing data can make a crucial contribution to spatio-continuous forest canopy height mapping, especially for areas covered by different types of forest.

TI  - Identification and monitoring of coal dust pollution in Wucaiwan mining area, Xinjiang (China) using Landsat derived enhanced coal dust index
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal dust is the main pollutant in coal mining areas. Such pollutants easily diffuse and are difficult to monitor, which increases the cost of environmental pollution control. Remote sensing technology can be used to dynamically monitor mining areas at a low cost, and thus, this is a common means of mining area management. According to the spectral characteristics of various ground objects in remote sensing images, a variety of remote sensing indexes can be constructed to extract the required information. In this study, the Wucaiwan open-pit coal mine was selected as the study area, and the Enhanced Coal Dust Index (ECDI) was established to extract the coal dust pollution information for the mining area. A new mining area pollution monitoring method was developed, which can provide technical support for environmental treatment and mining planning in Zhundong. The results of this study revealed the following: (1) Compared with the normalized difference coal index, the ECDI can expand the difference between the spectral information about the coal dust and the surrounding features, so it has a significant recognition ability for coal dust information. (2) From 2010 to 2021, the coal dust pollution in the study area initially increased and then decreased. With the continued exploitation of the coal mines in the study area, the coal dust pollution area increased from 14.77 km(2) in 2010 to 69.49 km(2) in 2014. After 2014, the local government issued various environmental pollution control policies, which had remarkable results. The coal dust pollution area decreased to 36.85 km(2) and 17.85 km(2) in 2018 and 2021, respectively. (3) There was a great deal of pollution around mines and roads, around which the pollution was more serious. Various factors, such as wind, coal type, and the mining, processing, and transportation modes, affect the distribution of the coal dust pollution.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Aerosol Optical Depth Fusion Combining Active and Passive Remote Sensing Based on Bayesian Maximum Entropy
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important parameter for studies related to atmospheric environment, climate change, and biogeochemical cycle. Unfortunately, the relatively high data missing ratio of satellite-derived AOD limits the atmosphere-related research and applications to a certain extent. Accordingly, numerous AOD fusion algorithms have been proposed in recent years. However, most of these algorithms focused on merging AOD products from multiple passive sensors, which cannot complementarily recover the AOD missing values due to cloud obscuration and the misidentification between optically thin cloud and aerosols. In order to address these issues, a spatiotemporal AOD fusion framework combining active and passive remote sensing based on Bayesian maximum entropy methodology (AP-BME) is developed to provide satellite-derived AOD data sets with high spatial coverage and good accuracy in large scale. The results demonstrate that AP-BME fusion significantly improves the spatial coverage of AOD, from an averaged spatial completeness of 27.9%-92.8% in the study areas, in which the spatial coverage improves from 91.1% to 92.8% when introducing Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) AOD data sets into the fusion process. Meanwhile, the accuracy of recovered AOD nearly maintains that of the original satellite AOD products, based on evaluation against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD. Moreover, the efficacy of the active sensor in AOD fusion is discussed through overall accuracy comparison and two case analyses, which shows that the provision of key aerosol information by the active sensor on haze condition or under thin cloud is important for not only restoring the real haze situations but also avoiding AOD overestimation caused by cloud optical depth (COD) contamination in AOD fusion results.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Dihedral Corner Reflectors for Slope Movements: A Case Study From Aniangzhai Landslide in China
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR (InSAR) technology, artificial corner reflectors (CRs) are popular coherent targets for monitoring ground instability with subcentimeter accuracy in nonurban areas. In this letter, we investigate the performance of a newly designed small dihedral CR for monitoring postfailure creep at the Aniangzhai landslide in Danba County, China. The new double geometry CRs consist of two sets of semicircular metal plates, each 30-40 cm in radius and perpendicular to each other. Six such CRs are installed for CR-InSAR analysis using both TerraSAR-X (TSX) high-resolution spotlight (HS) data and medium-resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR images. The CRs are first identified in SAR images using a probability model by taking into three factors. These are: 1) inverse of amplitude dispersion; 2) intensity increment after the installation; and 3) an upper empirical bound derived from the ensemble average of pixel intensities in postdeployment SAR images. Experimental results show that the CRs improve the background intensity in TSX images by around 30 dB, with signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) exceeding 25 dB. Furthermore, the radar crass section (RCS) of CRs in both TSX and S1 images remains relatively stable, ranging from 15 to 23 dB, making them suitable for CR-InSAR analysis using double-difference phase observations.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Security (ICAIS)
CL  - Qinghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - This paper presents a multi-sequence satellite image removal algorithm to remove cloud cover in remote sensing images. The algorithm is based on dual residual network. Above all, the network uses multi-temporal cloud images as the input of the model. Then, it fuses the global and local feature information through the dual residual connection structure, which makes the overall structure of the generated restored image reasonable and the edge details clearer. Finally, it uses pixel up-sampling to enhance the utilization of spatial information and improve the restoration effect. Experiments on the European Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellite image dataset with different cloud removal algorithms demonstrate that our network achieves higher quality than the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method was verified on the dataset, and the PSNR and SSIM indexes were 27.04 and 0.8479, both exceeding the original processing method STGAN of the dataset, and improving the effectiveness of remote sensing image cloud removal.

TI  - Terrain Segmentation in Polarimetric SAR Images Using Dual-Attention Fusion Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrain segmentation in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is an important task for image interpretation. Since the speckle noise and complex scattering mechanism exist in SAR images, the classification results achieved by traditional methods appear fragmented. Gradually, deep-learning-based methods are proposed to solve this problem. However, only the amplitude data in the SAR image is utilized, which limits the classification precision. In this letter, a novel method based on a dual-attention fusion network (DAFN) is presented. DAFN is mainly composed of a two-way structure encoder for feature extraction and the attention-based fusion module. Considering the terrain characteristic and the SAR imaging mechanism, the introduction of the polarization information in DAFN increases the discrimination of different categories, which contributes to the consistent and accurate fine-grained classification results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the corresponding experiments are done based on a GaoFen-3 satellite full-polarization SAR data set, in which the superior performance in terrain segmentation is obtained.

TI  - Improving the Split-Spectrum Method for Sentinel-1 Differential TOPSAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) is a useful technique used to measure small movements and surface deformation. However, ionospheric phase screens are a major error source in multipass terrain observation by progressive scans sar (TOPSAR) interferograms. In this letter, an improved split-spectrum method is proposed. First, the burst used for ionospheric phase estimation is selected through coherence, and then, the ionospheric phase of the burst is estimated based on the split-spectrum method. Finally, the TOPSAR ionospheric space-variable phase in a large scene is obtained through 2-D space-variable fitting, which avoids the complicated processing of splicing between bursts of different periods and reduces the number of unwrapping calculations for large scenes after splicing. The method can ensure that the number of calculations is reduced without loss of accuracy. Sentinel-1 TOPSAR real data processing verifies the correctness of the proposed method.

AB  - Optical imagery is one of the most important sources for model remote sensing. Super resolution of the optical data could be very useful for industry and academia. Conventional solutions from computer vision only offers super resolution on small images describing relatively smaller scene and optimized towards human perception. In this paper, we proposed a new deep learning model for large remote sensing image super resolution. By using conditional coordinate and self-attention, the model could achieve arbitrary large image super resolution task with special focus on correctness of the details. Numerical evaluation of the model is carried out based on real satellite remote sensing data. Result shows a promising performance with PSNR > 33 dB and SSIM > 0.93.

AB  - Aircraft detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a special case because all the targets are located in the airport. Comparing with the whole scene SAR image, the area of an airport is relatively small, therefore, this information can be utilized to speed up the algorithm. This paper proposes a centroid network detection method based on the combination of geographic coordinate information and subscene classification. Firstly, the airport area is detected based on the priori geographic coordinate information. Secondly, to further narrow down the scope of detection and extract the regions containing valid targets, the subscene is fed into the ResNet50 network which incorporates Squeeze and Excitation (SE) to separate the aircraft area from the background area. The method is validated in ablation experiments on the GaoFen-3(GF3) datasets to reveal the impact of each factor. The results show that the proposed method can achieve a reduction in false alarm rate around 6% and time cost around 30%.

TI  - Improving Fractional Snow Cover Retrieval From Passive Microwave Data Using a Radiative Transfer Model and Machine Learning Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical sensors are subject to cloud obscuration and sunlight dependence, resulting in large proportions of missing snow cover information. Microwave sensors are a good alternative to snow cover monitoring in all weather conditions. Thus far, few studies in the literature have directly derived the fractional snow cover (FSC) from passive microwave data, and none have considered the relationship between FSC and brightness temperature (TB). This study first explores the FSC-TB relationship with a radiation transfer model, exhibiting that no generic function can properly describe the nonlinear and complex FSC-TB relationship. Therefore, a new algorithm based on machine learning method was designed to improve FSC retrieval from TB data, considering other auxiliary information, including soil property, land surface, and geography information. Benchmarked against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reference FSC, our FSC retrieval model performed well with an average correlation coefficient of 0.70, the mean absolute error ranging from 0.15 to 0.17, and the root-mean-square error ranging from 0.19 to 0.21. The generated FSC maps reasonably characterized the seasonal dynamics and spatial distribution patterns of snow cover; time series analysis with three AmeriFlux stations observation indicated effective capture of snowpack evolution process by the generated FSC. In addition, the verification of snow mapping capability using snow depth measurements from 13 521 stations indicates that it was relatively stable with overall accuracy greater than 0.88. For precise monitoring of snow cover extent in all weather conditions, particularly for subpixel snow cover areas, the development of the FSC estimation scheme with TB data should be extensively encouraged and implemented.

AB  - Retrieving temperature structure of the interior ocean based on surface parameters is important for the study of complex dynamic processes in the ocean. This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) approach called Attention U-net to reconstruct the subsurface temperature (ST) field in the South China Sea (SCS) from sea surface parameters. The 5-day average temperature profiles with 0.5 degrees spatial resolution from Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) product were used for training the network and evaluating the accuracy of estimated results. The Attention U-net model showed a good performance on the ST reconstruction in the upper 100 m of the SCS. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the reconstructed temperature and SODA reanalysis data ranges from 0.39 to 1.42 degrees C, and the average value is 1.08 degrees C. The correlation coefficient (R) is significant in the upper 60 m and becomes weaker as depth increases. The overall R is 0.95. This study provides an effective technique for the ST reconstruction with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution in the SCS.

TI  - Reconstruction of Subsurface Temperature Field in the South China Sea From Satellite Observations Based on an Attention U-Net Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an attention U-net network was proposed to reconstruct the subsurface temperature (ST) field with high temporal and spatial resolution in the South China Sea (SCS) from sea surface parameters observed by satellites. In addition to sea surface temperature, sea-level anomaly, and sea surface wind (SSW) field, the wind stress curl, which influences the 3-D structure of temperature through the induced Ekman pumping and transport, was also input into the model. The five-day average vertical temperature profiles with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees from simple ocean data assimilation (SODA) reanalysis were used for training and evaluating the network. The results show that the attention U-net model performs quite well in ST reconstruction in the upper 100-m layers of the SCS. The additional input of wind stress curl helps to improve the model accuracy. The average root-mean-square error (RMSE)/bias of ST decreases from 1.08 degrees C/-0.21 degrees C to 1.01 degrees C/-0.05 degrees C. In particular, the RMSE near the thermocline is reduced significantly by up to 10.9%. The estimation error of the attention U-net model is much smaller than that of some linear and tree models in the SCS, especially in shallow waters and regions with complex dynamic processes. The case study also shows that our model is capable of capturing the evolution of mesoscale processes in the SCS. The combination of satellite observations with a high-precision ST reconstruction model will help us comprehensively understand the fine structure and variation of temperature and circulation in the marginal seas and open oceans.

TI  - Fine-Grained Oil Types Identification Based on Reflectance Spectrum: Implication for the Requirements on the Spectral Resolution of Hyperspectral Remote Sensors
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectively obtaining the information about the types of oil pollutants in a spill event can help determine the source of spill and formulate the plan of emergency responses. Researchers have reported the feasibility of fine-grained oil types identification using reflectance spectra, but its requirements on spectra resolution were seldom considered. To answer this question, this study examined the oil types identification accuracies using the reflection spectra with a different number of bands. The reflectance spectra of various types of oil samples were collected with a high-resolution hyperspectral remote sensor and then resampled to coarser spectral resolution. Some of the coarse-resolution spectra were built based on the central wavelengths of AVIRIS and Landsat 8 in visible bands, so as to evaluate the potential of fine-grained oil types identification using these sensors. Three kinds of machine learning algorithms were introduced as the classifier. The identification results using the reflection spectra at different resolutions showed that the machine learning models could identify oil types based on high-resolution reflectance spectra. In term of the spectra at coarser resolution, the models were still able to provide accurate predictions until the number of bands was reduced to about 16 in the visible range. Therefore, the high-resolution hyperspectral sensors (e.g., AVIRIS) have the potential of fine-grained oil types identification, but they may not be accomplished by satellite-based hyperspectral sensors with less than four visible bands.

TI  - A Deep-Learning-Based Fusion Approach for Global Cyclone Detection Using Multiple Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclone detection is a classic yet developing topic. Various methods have been developed for the purpose of cyclone detection based on sea level pressure, cloud imagery, and wind field. In this article, a data fusion approach that utilizes the data productions from multiple remote sensors is presented. A deep-learning-based object detection algorithm was adopted to form a global-scale cyclone detection model. Wind field data obtained from mean wind field-advanced scatterometer was integrated with the rainfall intensity data obtained from global precipitation measurement as the dataset for model training and testing. Feature pyramid network (FPN), which was designed for small target detection, was integrated with faster-regions with convolutional neural network to detect the cyclones within the fused dataset. The proposed model consists of two modules: a feature extractor and region proposal network based on FPN that searches for the potential areas of cyclones within the fused dataset, and a regions of interests processor that calibrate the locations of cyclone regions through a fully-connected neural network and a bounding box regression. An ablation experiment was also designed in the study in order to verify the necessity of data fusion. The results from ablation experiment suggested that the wind field data provided more contribution in the cyclone detection than the precipitation data.

TI  - Global Cross-Sensor Transformation Functions for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Top of Atmosphere and Surface Reflectance Products Within Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The collaborative use of Landsat and Sentinel-2 could substantially improve the temporal observation frequency at the medium spatial resolution, which was very important for the studies demanding dense temporal observations. The purpose of this study was to develop the global cross-sensor transformation functions for the well-established Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface reflectance (SR) products integrated within Google Earth Engine (GEE). Comparison results indicated the significant radiometric differences between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, resulting in band-wise root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.0091 to 0.0357 and 0.0168 to 0.0348 for TOA and SR, respectively, and the linear relationships were developed accordingly. Furthermore, via using 12 validation sites across the globe, this study confirmed that the proposed correction models could substantially IMPROVE the time-series agreement between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, resulting in a 0.63%-27.83% and 7.16%-21.36% reduction in RMSE for TOA and SR, respectively. The findings of this study were highly useful for the collaborative utilization of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data within GEE for the applications requiring high temporal observation frequency at medium spatial resolution.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, the urban ecological environment is facing severe challenges. Taking the urban area of Zhengzhou as the study area, the Landsat remote sensing images of 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 were selected to extract the indexes of humidity, greenness, heat and dryness respectively. The principal component analysis method was used to construct the remote sensing ecological index RSEI (remote sensing ecological index) model to quantitatively evaluate and monitor the ecological environment of Zhengzhou in the past 25 years, and analyze the reasons. The results showed that from 1995 to 2020, the urban ecological environment quality of Zheng-zhou decreased slowly in chronological order, and the ecological quality first decreased and increased slightly, then increased slowly, and then tended to be stable after a large decrease. From the perspective of spatial sequence, the ecological deterioration area of Dengfeng City under the jurisdiction of Zhengzhou has been restored in a large area, the ecological environment of the built areas of the central area, Gongyi City and Xinzheng City is still not optimistic, and the eco-environmental quality of other areas is basically stable. By analyzing the relationship between RSEI index and the area of built-up area and the intensity of human activities, it is determined that the decline of urban eco-environmental quality must be related to the increase of built-up area, and the intensity of human activities has a certain impact on the quality of ecological environment.

TI  - Angular-Dependent Polarized Characteristics of Surface Emissivity at 150 GHz Over Saharan and Taklimakan Deserts
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterizes the marginally known angular-dependent polarization difference (PD) of the land surface emissivity (LSE), using the microwave humidity sounder (MWHS) onboard China's Sun-synchronous satellite FengYun-3B (FY-3B). The instrument has two quasi-polarization channels at 150 GHz in addition to the three water-vapor absorption channels in the vicinity of 183 GHz, allowing observations at quasi-vertical and quasi-horizontal polarizations with its cross-track scanning geometry. The Saharan and Taklimakan deserts are taken as examples due to the relatively homogeneous surface conditions. In the two 150-GHz channels of MWHS, the polarization bias is corrected according to the measurements at the Earth incidence angle (EIA) of 0 degrees. The monthly mean quasi-polarization difference (QPD) at 150 GHz is found to he varying with the EIA and exhibits seasonal variations over deserts. The QPD reaches a maximum value at the EIA of similar to 35 degrees, while the zero value appears near the EIA of similar to 53 degrees [equal to the satellite viewing angle (VA) of 45 degrees] as expected. In contrast to the relatively stable and low QPD over Sahara, the QPD, quasi-polarized emissivity difference, and pure polarized emissivity difference (PPED) are generally larger in the Taklimakan Desert, where the maximum monthly QPD is similar to 4 K and the polarized emissivity difference increases monotonously to similar to 0.2 at the EIA of 50 degrees. The complex surface parameters and temporal variabilities impinge on the uncertainties of the land polarization. The increasing soil moisture due to precipitation damps the dichroic ability of the land surface, while the frozen surface due to snowfalls in cold seasons enhances the polarization.

TI  - Evaluation and Assimilation of FY-3C/D MWHS-2 Radiances in the RMAPS-ST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, humidity information can be obtained from the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) mounted on the polar-orbiting satellites FY-3C and FY-3D. However, making full use of the MWHS-2 data remains a challenge, particularly in the application of regional numerical weather models. This study is the first to include MWHS-2 radiance data in the Rapid-refresh Multi-scale Analysis and Prediction System-Short-term (RMAPS-ST) regional model. The results and impact of MWHS-2 radiance data assimilation were investigated and evaluated. It is found that MWHS-2 radiance data can be effectively assimilated in the RMAPS-ST after a series of quality control and variational bias correction. Benefits could be obtained in the reduction of background departures for each humidity sounding channel. Assimilation experiments over a period of one month were carried out, and the impacts of MWHS-2 radiances were quantitatively analyzed on the forecasts of RMAPS-ST system. The results showed that MWHS-2 saw a small but significant improvement for low-level humidity of short-range forecast, by 16.5% and 3.2% in terms of mean bias and root-mean-square error, respectively. The positive impact on short-range forecast also can be found for middle and low level temperature and wind. For quantitative precipitation forecast, the assimilation of MWHS-2 radiances increased the score skills of different rainfall levels in the first 12 h forecast by an average of 1.4%. There was a slight overall improvement in the 24-h precipitation forecast for over-estimation and false alarm of 3-h accumulated rainfall below 1.0 mm, with 0.75% and 0.36%, respectively. The addition of MWHS-2 radiance data gives a small positive impact on low-level humidity, temperature, and wind in the RMAPS-ST regional model, and it also improves short-range forecast of rainfall, particularly in the first 12 h of the forecast.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval Over South Asia Using FY-4A/AGRI Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) is one of the main imaging sensors onboard the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite. Because of its high observation frequency, AGRI is suitable for continuous monitoring of atmospheric aerosols. In this study, we propose an aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm called the multichannel (MC) algorithm, which uses four channels (0.65, 0.83, 1.61, and 2.25 mu m) of AGRI. The algorithm assumes that the ratios between surface reflectance of different channels remain unchanged within two weeks, and the ratios are calculated by using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-combined AOD data to perform atmospheric correction on AGRI data under low pollution conditions (AOD at 550 nm less than 0.5). Since this algorithm is not developed for specific surface types, AOD retrieval can be achieved over both dark targets and bright surfaces. This algorithm has been applied to aerosol retrieval in South Asia. The accuracy assessment of the AGRI AOD dataset in 2019 and 2020 using the ground-based data from 11 aerosol robotic network (AERONET) sites shows that the AGRI AOD dataset has a high accuracy, and the statistical parameters of AGRI AOD dataset are slightly better than those of MODIS-combined AOD dataset. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative mean bias (RMB), and percentage of data with errors within the expected error +/-(0.05+0.15 x AOD(AERONET)) (EE15) of AGRI AOD dataset are 0.16, 0.12, 0.23, and 63.71%, respectively. The RMSE, MAE, RMB, and EE15 of MODIS-combined AOD dataset are 0.18, 0.13, 0.24, and 61.06%, respectively.

AB  - Remote sensing images of Earth observation with high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution are critical for the application of remote sensing technology in Megacities.With the development of Smart City,more demands which are still difficult to be perfectly satisfied on the spatial resolution and temporal resolution of remote sensing images have been put forward. This paper studies the use of SRGAN which means Super-Resolution using a Generative Adversarial Network (a network structure that uses the loss function considering the perceptual loss and the adversarial loss to improve the spatial resolution of remote sensing images) for super-resolution reconstruction of single remote sensing image.It is able to enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing images and improve the depth and breadth of remote sensing images.We adjust the reasonable parameters and network structure for our research by analysing the SRGAN in the network architecture, the perceptual loss and the adversarial loss.A super-resolution model is obtained by training with aerial photogrammetry images whose spatial resolution are 0.1 meter in Shanghai.We find the improved SRGAN has a good performance in in remote sensing image super-resolution by comparing the super-resoved images with real high-resolution images in visual perception, spatial position mapping accuracy and chromaticity spatial information. In addition, it is proved that the trained model is also effective to deal with Worldview-2 and SuperView-1 satellite images whose spatial resolution are 0.5 m. Our research shows that our method which can effectively realize the super-resolution of remote sensing images has great potential in the application of remote sensing technology such as urban mapping and changes monitoring.

AB  - This paper addresses the intercalibration of the thermal infrared channels 11 similar to 14 of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on the Chinese Fengyun 4A (FY-4A) satellite against the Advanced Himawari Imager on the Himawari 8 (AHI-8) using the Double Difference (DD) method, in which an accurate thermal infrared radiative transfer model is constructed over both sea and land surfaces. The intercalibration results indicate that the on-orbit radiometric calibration biases are observed in FY-4A AGRI thermal infrared channels, especially for the channel 11 (8.0 similar to 9.0 mu m), whose radiometric calibration biases are 4.36 +/- 0.26 K in the north hemisphere and 2.36 +/- 0.38 K in the south hemisphere. For the AGRI channels 12 (10.3 similar to 11.3 mu m), 13 (11.5 similar to 12.5 mu m) and 14 (13.2 similar to 13.8 mu m), the on-orbit radiometric calibration biases are -0.14 +/- 0.31 K, 0.91 +/- 0.41 K and -0.54 +/- 0.51 K, respectively. Through linear regression on the matching observations, the intercalibration coefficients are finally determined.

TI  - Learning to Cooperate: Decision Fusion Method for Few-Shot Remote-Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, remote-sensing scene classification has become an essential primary research topic. Nowadays, scholars have proposed various few-shot remote-sensing scene classification methods to achieve superior performance with few labeled data. Most of the prior work utilized a meta-learning strategy, which suffered from too little data affecting performance. In this letter, we apply the pre-trained feature extractor for image embedding. Meanwhile, because of the negative transfer problem caused by the inadaptability of the pre-trained feature extractor to remote-sensing data, we propose to exploit two pre-trained models to classify the remote-sensing scene, respectively. Then we fuse the decision to obtain the final classification category. We design a decision attention module to automatically update combination weights for each decision. It comprehensively considers the contribution of various decisions and further improves the discrimination of features. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the method and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark remote-sensing scene datasets, namely NWPU-RESISC45 and UC Merced.

TI  - Mountain Snow Depth Retrieval From Optical and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Using Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth (SD) or snow water equivalent in mountainous regions is crucial for hydrology, water resources management, meteorological, and climate research. Remote sensing can be used for SD monitoring on a regional scale or global scale. However, the spaceborne remote sensing of SD in the mountain is challenging because of the sensor sensitivity and spatial resolution problems. Recently, the time series Sentinel-1 is used for SD retrieval in mountains, which shows encouraging accuracy. In this study, an algorithm to estimate the SD in mountainous regions using optical and passive microwave remote sensing observations is proposed, which can be applied in periods before and after the launch of Sentinel-1. The optical and passive microwave remote sensing observations and the Sentinel-1 derived SD in 2016-2021 are used to train the SD retrieval algorithm using the Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm. Validations are performed using the cross-validation method and independent in situ SD data. The cross-validation shows a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 m. The correlation coefficient and MAE of predicted SD and in situ SD in 2002-2016 are 0.61 and 0.33 m, respectively, which shows significantly higher accuracy compared with AMSR-E/AMSR2 SD products. The site dependence of the machine learning method is also discussed. The machine learning-based SD retrieval presented in this study can be applied to mountains globally in the optical and passive microwave remote sensing era.

TI  - Monitoring land subsidence using interferometric synthetic aperture radar time-series analysis: a case of Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone (SPFTZ) is the first free trade zone in China, consisting of eight independent zones and located in Pudong New District. With the rapid development in the SPFTZ, frequent human activities may induce severe land subsidence. Based on time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and multitemporal C-band images, the temporal and spatial evolution of subsidence in Pudong New District is obtained from May 2016 to October 2020. The achieved results show that severe subsidence occurred in the east of the study area, where the maximum subsidence rate was -40 mm/year. Most of the land in the SPFTZ remained stable, but small-scale subsidence with a maximum subsidence rate of -18.1 mm/year occurred in two zones. InSAR-derived results are in good agreement with the manual measurements, with a root mean square error of 1.4 mm. Time-series analysis reveals that land subsidence in the SPFTZ mainly originates from urban constructions, including building construction and vehicle load. Meanwhile, the most severe subsidence occurred in the east of Pudong International Airport, which may be attributed to the airport renovation project. In a reclaimed area, land subsidence can be classified into different construction periods, which gradually weakens from north to south.

M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) generally suffers from enormous strains from large quantities of sampling data and serious interferences from the speckle noise. This letter proposes a novel deep network to address these problems. By utilizing the prior knowledge in a more reasonable way, the proposed network could realize SAR imaging and despeckling with down-sampled data simultaneously. Specifically, we decompose the SAR image in the SAR imaging-despeckling observation model into a sparse matrix and a low-rank matrix, and then establish an optimization problem with the corresponding sparse and low-rank priors. Moreover, the deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) denoiser prior is also introduced to further improve the speckle reduction capability. Then, we devise a deep network called SLRCP-Net to solve this problem. Experiments conducted on real Radarsat-1 down-sampled data demonstrate the validity of SLRCP-Net in SAR imaging and speckle suppression.

TI  - InSAR Crowdsourcing Annotation System With Volunteers Uploaded Photographs: Toward a Hazard Alerting System
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been more and more applied in acquiring long-term deformation of land surface in a large coverage and is becoming a routine investigation technique. Validation of the InSAR results depends largely on the in situ measurements. These measurements are usually point-wise and of high cost, as many sensors need to be set up for the long-term monitoring. In applications associated with a large area, qualitative and low-cost validation may be more necessary at the first place, which is still a challenge. In the recent decade, the crowdsourcing and volunteered geographic information (VGI) have been more and more accepted in the field of geoinformatics. Inspired by these, this letter proposes an InSAR crowdsourcing annotation system to integrate the InSAR displacements and the photographs uploaded by volunteers. We processed 119 Sentinel-1A data ranging from 2017 to 2021 to derive long-term displacements. Then, based on the InSAR displacements, task areas were selected and published to public via the system. Volunteers online accepted the task and uploaded photographs, indicating land displacements. In a coastal city, Shenzhen of China, 135 task areas were selected and published in total, and 1742 useful photographs were uploaded. The uploaded photographs were then inspected to validate and analyze the InSAR results. Post-analysis found some high correlation between the uploaded photographs with the InSAR alerting displacements. The proposed system is a prototype, and its interface and functions can be further extended in the future toward an effective and efficient alerting system for risking land deformations.

TI  - Emerging hot spot analysis and the spatial-temporal trends of NDVI in the Jing River Basin of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important indicator of vegetation coverage, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) reflects the changing pattern and evolving trend of the environment. In the Loess Plateau, vegetation plays a critical role in soil and water conservation, which strongly affects the achievement of sustainable development goals. The study of the spatial distribution and temporal trends of NDVI is of great practical importance for the planning of soil and water conservation measures and the evaluation of the environmental situation. In this study, the NDVI, precipitation, land use and land cover data of the Jing River Basin were collected, the emerging hot spot patterns of the NDVI analyzed, the characteristics of spatial distribution and temporal variation of the NDVI in the basin obtained, and the impacts on NDVI from the climate changes and the land cover changes discussed. The results show that the NDVI in Jing River Basin represents a spatial trend of decreasing from northwest to southeast. The emerging hot spot analysis results show that diminishing cold spot, oscillating hot spot and intensifying hot spot are predominant patterns in the basin. The whole basin shows a statistically significant upward trend of high value aggregation of NDVI. The temporal trend of NDVI in the basin varies from - 0.0171 to 0.0185 per year. The increasing trend of vegetation coverage in the basin is statistically significant. The positive correlation between the NDVI and the precipitation mainly observed upstream of the basin reveals that the growth of vegetation in the Loess Plateau is more dependent on the water supply from the precipitation. Land cover transition patterns and the land use patterns also impact the spatial-temporal trends of the vegetation coverage in the basin. The study results may be helpful for the vegetation restoration, soil and water conservation and sustainable development of the Jing River Basin.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning has achieved great accuracy in SAR image ship detection tasks. However, for large-scene SAR images, the sliding window method will generate a large number of slices sent to the network, resulting in a waste of GPU resources. To solve this problem, we proposed a ship detection algorithm based on CFAR, which significantly reduces the number of slices and false alarms on land. Firstly, the sea regions to be detected are obtained under the prior guidance of Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines(GSHHS), and remove major land areas in the SAR image. Secondly, the ship candidate region generation algorithm based on block G0-CFAR is implemented to obtain the candidate slices. Finally, the Yolov5 model is used to detect ships from the candidate slices. The validation experiment of sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 largescene SAR images shows that the proposed method can detect the ships in large-scene SAR images with 88% detection accuracy within 97s, and the number of image slices fed into GPU is greatly reduced. It has certain practical significance for ship detection in large-scene SAR images.

AB  - Tiled remote sensing data is essential for web-based remote sensing applications, widely applied in online map services, cloud-based remote sensing processing, etc. However, most existing tiling algorithms focus on tiling single remote sensing images with stand-alone machines. As the volume of remote sensing data increases, the demand for tiling high-resolution and large-scale remote sensing datasets increases dramatically. In this research, we propose a cloud-based parallel tiling algorithm for large-scale remote sensing datasets. A three-step processing flow is designed to implement the tiling of datasets composed of a set of images. Furthermore, three types of cloud-based storage are adopted to improve the efficiency of data extraction, namely, cloud storage, block storage, and NoSQL. We experimented with the proposed algorithm for tiling a national-scale 2 m resolution remote sensing dataset. The whole process took about 25.7 hours with up to 180 cores.

TI  - Global Forest Types Based on Climatic and Vegetation Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest types are generally identified using vegetation or land-use types. However, vegetation classifications less frequently consider the actual forest attributes within each type. To address this in an objective way across different regions and to link forest attributes with their climate, we aimed to improve the distribution of forest types to be more realistic and useful for biodiversity preservation, forest management, and ecological and forestry research. The forest types were classified using an unsupervised cluster analysis method by combining climate variables with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Unforested regions were masked out to constrict our study to forest type distributions, using a 20% tree cover threshold. Descriptive names were given to the defined forest types based on annual temperature, precipitation, and NDVI values. Forest types had distinct climate and vegetation characteristics. Regions with similar NDVI values, but with different climate characteristics, which would be merged in previous classifications, could be clearly distinguished. However, small-range forest types, such as montane forests, were challenging to differentiate. At macroscale, the resulting forest types are largely consistent with land-cover types or vegetation types defined in previous studies. However, considering both potential and current vegetation data allowed us to create a more realistic type distribution that differentiates actual vegetation types and thus can be more informative for forest managers, conservationists, and forest ecologists. The newly generated forest type distribution is freely available to download and use for non-commercial purposes as a GeoTIFF file via doi: 10.13140/RG.2.2.19197.90082).

AB  - Crop biomass is a key biophysical metric for monitoring crop growth and yield. Previous studies have utilized satellite imagery to estimate aboveground biomass, but the retrieval of crop biomass by components has not been fully investigated. This study therefore evaluated the capability of Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and texture features to estimate maize total biomass, leaf biomass, and stem biomass based on multi-label k-nearest neighbor (MLKNN) and multi-output support vector regression (MSVR). Based on a set of in situ measurements covering three growth stages of maize, the findings revealed that: 1) the mean texture features were more correlated to biomass components than other textures and significantly improved the retrievals of biomass components compared to polarizations; 2) the MLKNN outperformed MSVR. The best predictive accuracy was achieved by MLKNN with the mean textures of VV, VH, and VH+VV as predictors (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.09 kg/m(2) for leaf biomass; R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.22 kg/m(2) for stem biomass and R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.53 kg/m(2) for total biomass). Summarizing, the results demonstrate the suitability of Sentinel-1 SAR texture information for the retrieval of maize biomass components based on MLKNN.

TI  - Revisiting Ice Flux and Mass Balance of the Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf System Using Multi-Remote-Sensing Datasets, East Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid global warming, the relationship between the mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet and rising sea levels are attracting widespread attention. The Lambert-Amery glacial system is the largest drainage system in East Antarctica, and its mass balance has an important influence on the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet. In this paper, the recent ice flux in the Lambert Glacier of the Lambert-Amery system was systematically analyzed based on recently updated remote sensing data. According to Landsat-8 ice velocity data from 2018 to April 2019 and the updated Bedmachine v2 ice thickness dataset in 2021, the contribution of ice flux approximately 140 km downstream from Dome A in the Lambert Glacier area to downstream from the glacier is 8.5 & PLUSMN; 1.9 Gt & BULL;a(-1), and the ice flux in the middle of the convergence region is 18.9 & PLUSMN; 2.9 Gt & BULL;a(-1). The ice mass input into the Amery ice shelf through the grounding line of the whole glacier is 19.9 & PLUSMN; 1.3 Gt & BULL;a(-1). The ice flux output from the mainstream area of the grounding line is 19.3 & PLUSMN; 1.0 Gt & BULL;a(-1). Using the annual SMB data of the regional atmospheric climate model (RACMO v2.3) as the quality input, the mass balance of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Lambert Glacier was analyzed. The results show that recent positive accumulation appears in the middle region of the glacier (about 74-78 & DEG;S, 67-85 & DEG;E) and the net accumulation of the whole glacier is 2.4 & PLUSMN; 3.5 Gt & BULL;a(-1). Although the mass balance of the Lambert Glacier continues to show a positive accumulation, and the positive value in the region is decreasing compared with values obtained in early 2000.

TI  - Understanding the Relationship between China's Eco-Environmental Quality and Urbanization Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of urbanization and population growth in China has posed a major threat to the green sustainable development of the ecological environment. However, the impact of urbanization on the eco-environmental quality (EEQ) in China remains to be developed. Understanding their interactive coupling mechanism is of great significance to achieve the urban sustainable development goals. By using multi-source remote sensing data and the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM), we intended to answer the question "What are the temporal and spatial characteristics of urbanization and EEQ in China on the pixel scale during 2000-2013, and what is the coupling mechanism between the urbanization and the EEQ?". To answer these questions, we explored the coupling mechanism between urbanization and the EEQ in China with a combined mathematical and graphics model. The results show that the urbanization and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of the whole region continually increased from 2000 to 2013, especially in the three major urban agglomerations, with a spatial distribution pattern that was "high in the east and low in the west". Most importantly, from 2000 to 2013, the CCD type of cities in China gradually evolved from uncoordinated cities to coordinated cities. Additionally, the decisive factor affecting the CCD from 2000 to 2013 was the development of urbanization, and the degree at which urbanization had an impact on CCD was about 8.4 times larger than that of the EEQ. At the same time, the rapid urbanization that has occurred in some areas has led to a significant decline in the EEQ, thus indicating that China needs to increase its protection of the ecological environment while pursuing social and economic development in the future. This study makes up for the deficiencies in the existing literature and investigates the long-term coupling of the EEQ and urbanization in China, thereby providing a new research perspective for the sustainable development of China and even the world in the future.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation of Aboveground Biomass of <i>Pinus densata</i> and Its Drivers in Shangri-La, CHINA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the drivers of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential to further understanding the forest carbon cycle. In the upper Yangtze River region, where ecosystems are incredibly fragile, the driving factors that make AGB changes differ from other regions. This study aims to investigate AGB's spatial and temporal variation of Pinus densata in Shangri-La and decompose the direct and indirect effects of spatial attribute, climate, stand structure, and agricultural activity on AGB in Shangri-La to evaluate the degree of influence of each factor on AGB change. The continuous sample plots from National Forest Inventory (NFI) and Landsat time series were used to estimate the AGB in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017. The structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyze the different effects of the four factors on AGB based on five scales: entire, 1987-2002, 2007-2017, low population density, and high population density. The results are as follows: (1) The AGB of Pinus densata in Shangri-La decreased from 1987 to 2017, with the total amount falling from 9.52 million tons to 7.41 million tons, and the average AGB falling from 55.49 t/ha to 40.10 t/ha. (2) At different scales, stand structure and climate were the drivers that directly affect the AGB change. In contrast, the agricultural activity had a negative direct effect on the AGB change, and spatial attribute had a relatively small indirect effect on the AGB change. (3) Analyzing the SEM results at different scales, the change of the contribution of the agricultural activity indicates that human activity is the main negative driver of AGB change in Shangri-La, especially at the high population density region. In contrast, the change of the contribution of the stand structure and climate indicates that the loss of old trees has an important influence on the AGB change. Forest resources here and other ecologically fragile areas should be gradually restored by adhering to policies, such as strengthening forest protection, improving forest stand quality, and limiting agricultural production activities.

AB  - To analysis the main clinical symptoms and causative hazards of foodborne disease outbreaks to provide a reference for the prevention, control, and early warning of foodborne diseases. 2,919 FBDs cases were collected and summarised through the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) surveillance system. Foodborne diseases were detected according to national standards. Microsoft Excel 2010 and SPSS 12.0 were used for data descriptive analysis. The mean +/- standard deviation was used to describe the numerical variables, and the frequency and composition ratio were used to describe the classification variables. There were 2,919 FBDs cases included in the analysis. The highest number of cases occurred among students (41.49%) and farmers (22.85%). The months of August (398,13.63%), September (333,11.41%) and July (330,11.31%) accounted for most cases. The two most frequent pathogens supported by laboratory confirmation are Norovirus and Salmonella. The major symptoms of illness were diarrhoea (97.64%), fever (27.95%), abdominal pain (24.67%), vomiting (22.30%), and nausea (13.7%). This study revealed epidemiological characteristics of FBDs and identified some higher risk factors for interventions. Salmonella and Norovirus were the main pathogens. Foods from catering service settings and animal foods were the factors most likely to contribute to foodborne diseases. Most cases of intoxication and outbreaks were related to wild mushrooms.

TI  - Variable-Resolution SAR Imaging Mode With the Principle of Maximum Mutual Information
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A generalized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) modality of operation named variable-resolution (VR) SAR is proposed, which explores the diversity of antenna patterns and inhomogeneity of pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) for adaptive imaging. Based on the relationship between the azimuth resolution and the corresponding integration angle, it uses dynamic beam patterns along the trajectory to illuminate different regions. We formulate the optimization problem of VR SAR based on the principle of maximum mutual information. First, the information content of a specific scene is defined by modeling its distributed scattering as a stochastic process, and the mutual information between scenes and the observed SAR image can be derived. Then, we construct an optimization problem to maximize the mutual information by solving for the optimal beam manipulation scheme of the VR SAR mode. Further optimization of PRF is conducted to obtain a relatively larger swath width and smaller data volume by compromising the resolution of some regions with less information while ensuring there are no azimuth ambiguities. The potential advantages of VR mode are: 1) it simultaneously provides higher resolution for the high-information regions and a larger imaging area than would otherwise be possible in strip map and spotlight SAR modes and 2) it optimizes the efficiency of data acquisition while extracts as much information from scenes as possible. A mathematical model of VR SAR mode with the principle of maximum mutual information is established, and the feasibility and merits of the method are demonstrated through a series of simulations and an equivalent experiment using RADARSAT-1 raw data.

TI  - A Linear Regression of Differential PWV Calibration Model to Improve the Accuracy of MODIS NIR All-Weather PWV Products Based on Ground-Based GPS PWV Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) products derived from the near-infrared (NIR) channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, onboard Aqua and Terra satellites, were calibrated using a linear differential PWV (LinearDP) calibration model based on GPS-retrieved PWV observations. All MODIS NIR PWV pixels were classified into two groups according to the cloud mask of each pixel. For each group, MODIS NIR PWV products and ground-based PWV data from 453 GPS sites in Australia from January 2017 to December 2018 were utilized to determine the differential PWV by subtracting GPS PWV from MODIS PWV. Then, empirical regression relationship between the differential PWV data and the MODIS PWV products was developed using a linear regression approach. The LinearDP model coefficients were independently obtained from each month for each group. The period for model validation spans from January to December in 2019. Comparison of calibrated MODIS NIR PWV versus GPS-derived PWV over Australia showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of Aqua has reduced 42.61% for clear group, 41.43% for cloudy group, and 41.45% for both clear and cloudy groups; and has respectively reduced 53.76%, 37.03%, and 39.33% for Terra. By comparing against ERA5 PWV data, the RMSE reduced 37.21%-43.14% for Aqua and 38.73%-53.87% for Terra. The improvement of MODIS NIR PWV products is further validated in China, with an RMSE reduction of 24.53%-31.78% for Aqua and 28.26%-38.69% for Terra against reference PWV from 214 GPS stations. The mean bias was reduced to -0.415-0.752 mm in Australia and to -0.382-2.013 mm in China.

TI  - Evaluation of Precipitable Water Vapor Product From MODIS and MERSI-II NIR Channels Using Ground- Based GPS Measurements Over Australia
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed a thorough validation of the precipitable water vapor (PWV) products from near-infrared bands of very similar instruments, i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-II). The PWV products validated are those derived from MODIS/Aqua, MODIS/Terra, and MERSI-II/FY-3D sensors. The PWV data from global positioning system (GPS) in 453 in situ sites situated in the interior and coastal areas of Australia from June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 were utilized as reference values. The accuracy of the satellite PWV products was studied under different weather conditions. The evaluation results show that all the three PWV products did not provide good quality water vapor observations in the presence of clouds, with a correlation below 0.2 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) above 10 mm. Under confident clear sky conditions, MERSI-II/FY-3D instrument had the highest retrieval accuracy with an RMSE of 2.801 mm, but had the worst correlation with reference GPS PWV (R-2 = 0.841). On the contrary, MODIS/Terra instrument had the lowest retrieval accuracy (RMSE = 4.903 mm), but had the best correlation with a correlation of 0.903. Both MODIS/Aqua and MODIS/Terra instruments tended to overestimate PWV value, whereas the MERSI-II/FY-3D instrument tended to underestimate PWV value. All PWV data records showed better retrieval accuracy with higher correlation and lower RMSE under the dry condition than under the wet condition. The performance analysis of all the three satellite PWV products was also studied per day, per station, per season, and per land-surface type in this article.

TI  - A Back Propagation Neural Network-Based Algorithm for Retrieving All-Weather Precipitable Water Vapor From MODIS NIR Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor can observe precipitable water vapor (PWV) at near-infrared (NIR) bands. In this article, we proposed a novel Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN)-based water vapor retrieval algorithm to enhance the all-weather retrieval accuracy of the PWV estimation from MODIS NIR observations. The input of the model includes the transmittance, latitude, longitude, elevation, season, cloud, and solar zenith angle information. The water vapor data collected from in situ 453 Global Positioning System (GPS) sites in Australia in 2017 were employed as the output PWV for the training of the BPNN method. The performance of the retrieval approach was evaluated utilizing reference GPS-measured PWV data during 2018-2019 over Australia, independent of the 2017 training data. The results indicate that the algorithm can notably enhance the accuracy of MODIS NIR PWV retrieval under all-weather conditions as well as under each type of weather condition. The BPNN-retrieved weighted mean PWV data calculated with a 2-channel ratio approach had the best retrieval accuracy, reducing root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 57.26% from 10.95 to 4.68 mm for all-weather conditions and 47.49% from 5.58 to 2.93 mm for confident-clear conditions. The new all-weather PWV estimates present a retrieval accuracy superior to official MODIS NIR confident-clear PWV product, illustrating the effectiveness of the retrieval algorithm. This algorithm has been well evaluated in Australia and its performance in other global regions will be investigated in the future, while the MODIS official products are applicable to the global regions.

TI  - Time-Series InSAR Dynamic Analysis With Robust Sequential Adjustment
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, SAR instruments such as ESA's Sentinel-1 constellation, ICEYE's constellation of small and agile radar satellites, and the upcoming ALOS-4 and NASA/ISRO SAR missions provide new opportunities for near-real-time monitoring of geohazards with enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. The sequential dynamic adjustment model is regarded as an effective way to rapidly update time-series InSAR measurements. However, the accuracy of geophysical parameters of interest estimated from the conventional sequential least squares is greatly sensitive to anomalous observations and/or anomalous prior parameter information. This letter aims to introduce the robust sequential adjustment method based on the M-estimation principle into near-real-time InSAR deformation monitoring to mitigate the effect of anomalous errors. Using both synthetic and real Sentinel-1 SAR datasets over Echigo plain in Japan, we fully evaluate the performance of the robust sequential estimation approach with respect to unwrapping errors in the SAR data stack. Measurements at nine GPS stations located in the study area are used to validate the results. We find that the averaged RMSE of robust sequential adjustment is reduced by 15% in comparison with that of the conventional sequential least-squares method.

AB  - This is the fourth article in a series studying on the site-testing at Muztagh-ata site. The results of the characterization of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmospheric column at Muztagh-ata site are presented. This paper studies the temporal variability of PWV, acquired from remote sensing data sets and validated by limited radiometers data, spanning a period from 2018 to 2019. The clear day PWV annual median values are 2.28 mm and 2.37 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively. The results show that the driest seasons at Muztagh-ata site are from October to March and there are about 60 similar to 70 days with daily median PWV less than 2 mm in this period. Atmospheric transmission in mid-infrared bands calculated by AM model confirms the IR observation potential of Muztagh-ata site.

TI  - Geometric Auto-Calibration of SAR Images Utilizing Constraints of Symmetric Geometry
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has evolved into an essential Earth observation technique. Geometric quality is one of its most fundamental elements to ensure subsequent applications. Excellent localization accuracy requires comprehensive error compensation and calibration, while traditional calibration work is time-consuming and depends on the test sites. Besides, the available calibration test sites are scarce and unevenly distributed for certain SAR satellites. It is, hence, necessary to research how to make geometric calibration without ground control points (GCPs) for SAR. This study proposes a method utilizing the constraints of symmetric geometry that could cancel out plane error symmetrically and then calculates calibration constants combined with external digital elevation model (DEM). Experiments demonstrate that the calibration accuracy of the proposed way is approximately 0.3 m along range direction when all constraints are met, and the discrepancy between the proposed method and that using GCPs is analyzed. Generally, the method can achieve fast, labor-saving, and normalized calibration work for SAR images in the absence of available control data.

AB  - As one of the most important grains worldwide, paddy rice plays a significant role in not only regional food supply but also international food trading. In past decades, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been proved to be an effective tool in paddy rice monitoring. However, in Southeast Asia, the construction of sophisticated paddy rice response models and the substantial sample set can be quite difficult, because of the diverse phonologies of different paddy rice cultivation practices. Targeting this problem, this paper intended to explore the consistency in time series SAR features of different paddy rice regions. Two tropical paddy rice producing regions, Hainan Province of China and the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, were selected as the study areas. Through the analysis of temporal responses using time series Sentinel-1 data, the behavior of paddy rice fields on time-series SAR were investigated and the comparisons of these two study areas were also conducted, which provided an evaluation for the portability of intelligent paddy rice mapping model in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Implementation Strategy and Spatiotemporal Extensibility of Multipredictor Ensemble Model for Water Quality Parameter Retrieval With Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In previous studies, empirical models have been widely used to map water quality parameters for inland waters using remotely sensed imagery. Due to the complex optical properties of inland waters, empirical models often have limited performances and they cannot be extended or reused across space and time. To overcome the limitations of traditional empirical models, this article further explores the ensemble method for water quality parameter retrieval. Based on the Sentinel-2 multispectral images and extensive coincident <italic>in situ</italic> water quality data, we examined different implementation strategies and evaluated the extensibility of a multipredictor ensemble model for retrieving chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) across space and time. Our analysis shows that the multipredictor ensemble model can improve the Chl-a prediction accuracy by 46 compared with the best traditional empirical model. Our experiments suggest that the selection of heterogeneous component models improves the performance of the ensemble model and the new iterative -fold calibration approach results in a considerably better ensemble model than the global calibration approach. To evaluate the spatial extensibility, our ensemble model calibrated for Harsha Lake was applied to Caesar Creek Lake and Brookville Lake. This ensemble model calibrated with the data sets acquired on October 7, 2016 was also applied to Sentinel-2 images of Harsha Lake acquired on October 2, 2017 and August 23, 2018, to evaluate its extensibility for different years. Our evaluation results show that the ensemble model can be transferred and reused across space and time to provide reliable and accurate Chl-a estimates.

TI  - A 21-Year Time Series of Global Leaf Chlorophyll Content Maps From MODIS Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an important plant physiological trait and is critical for accurate modeling of vegetation photosynthesis over time and space. To date, there is still a lack of a global long time-series dataset of LCC. In this study, we developed an algorithm to retrieve global LCC from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data from 2000 to 2020. An essential requirement for generating LCC time series is to capture its seasonal dynamics. This issue was addressed by using a matrix system with two pairs of vegetation indices to minimize the impacts of leaf area index and canopy nonphotosynthetic material on LCC estimation in different seasons. The matrix system algorithm was applied to Landsat data and MODIS data, respectively. The validation based on Landsat data and ground measurements reveals that the algorithm has the ability to catch the seasonal variations of LCC in different plant functional types, and the MODIS-derived LCC shows good agreement with Landsat-upscaled LCC (R-2 = 0.77 and RMSE = 6.9 mu g/cm(2)). The global eight-day LCC data at 500-m resolution in 2000-2020 were generated using the matrix system from MODIS and presented distinct temporal and spatial variations, which provides a new opportunity for analyzing vegetation physiological dynamics in climate change studies.

TI  - A Method to Derive Bathymetry for Dynamic Water Bodies Using ICESat-2 and GSWD Data Sets
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on lake bathymetry is essential for both hydrology-related studies and water resource management. Conventionally, lake bathymetry was mapped using high-cost approaches (e.g., ship/boat-based multibeam echosounders or airborne bathymetric lidars). With only satellite remotely sensed data sets, a method for deriving high-resolution bathymetry for dynamic areas was proposed by combining the new Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) lidar data and the Landsat-based Global Surface Water Data Set (GSWD). First, ICESat-2 can provide accurate along-track topographic points after the point cloud processing and bathymetric error correction, and the GSWD can supply water occurrence information within the lake dynamic area between 1984 and 2018. Second, using the derived relationship between the elevation and water occurrence, the bathymetric map of Lake Mead, USA, was produced with the dynamic area exceeding 235 km(2), elevation ranging nearly 37 m, and a resolution of 30 m. The local reference data (i.e., the airborne topographic lidar data and ship/boat-based bathymetric data) in six areas around Lake Mead were used for the validations. In general, the produced lake bathymetry achieved an accuracy of approximately 2 m in elevation with R-2 of 0.97. The proposed method is promising to obtain global bathymetry for inland water bodies (e.g., the lake and reservoir) and coastal areas (e.g., the tidal zone) where water level fluctuations are strong and the water clarity is sufficient.

TI  - LMO-YOLO: A Ship Detection Model for Low-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been observed that the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based ship detection models often result in high false detection rate in low-resolution optical satellite images. This problem arises from the following factors: 1) the current 8-b rescaling schemes make the images lose some important information about ships in low-resolution imagery; 2) the effective features of ships at low resolution are far fewer than those of ships at high resolution; and 3) the detection of low-resolution ships is more sensitive to object-background contrast variation. To solve these problems, a low-resolution marine object (LMO) detection YOLO model, called LMO-YOLO, is proposed in this article. First, a multiple linear rescaling scheme is developed to quantize the original satellite images into 8-b images; second, dilated convolutions are included in a YOLO network to extract object features and object-background features; finally, an adaptive weighting scheme is designed to balance the loss between easy-to-detect ships and hard-to-detect ships. The proposed method was validated by level 1 product images captured by the wide-field-of-view sensor on the GaoFen-1 satellite. The experimental results demonstrated that our method accurately detected ships from low-resolution images and outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - COCO-Net: A Dual-Supervised Network With Unified ROI-Loss for Low-Resolution Ship Detection From Optical Satellite Image Sequences
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-resolution ship detection from optical satellite image sequences is critical in high-orbit remote sensing satellite applications. However, it is still a difficult problem due to the following challenges: 1) the size of the ship is tiny in the low-resolution image; 2) the ship target is dim and the contrast with the background is low; and 3) the interference of cloud and fog covering is complex and changeable. For these reasons, the targets are easily lost during the detection. In fact, the Clearer the Objects against to the background, the more Confident the Observers can detect it. In light of these considerations, we propose a COCO-Net to detect the small dynamic objects on low-resolution images in this article. First, the multiframe images are associated by introducing motion information as an effective compensation for small object features. Second, an integrated dual-supervised network that processes single-level tasks hierarchically is presented to adaptively enhance the input data quality of object detection without being limited by diverse scene disturbances. Third, a unified region of interest (ROI)-loss scheme that modulates the loss function of the first component by introducing ROI-masks from the second component is utilized to make the first component also work for object detection. In addition, we construct a new dataset for the small dynamic object detection based on the GaoFen-4 satellite imagery. Comprehensive experiments on a self-assembled dataset from the GaoFen-4 satellite show the superior performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art object detectors.

TI  - A New Algorithm for Himawari-8 Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval by Integrating Regional PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced Himawari imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 can provide full-disk observations with high temporal resolution (10 min), which has outstanding advantages for dynamic real-time aerosol monitoring in East Asia. In this study, a new aerosol retrieval algorithm for AHI by integrating regional PM2.5 concentrations (IRPAR) was proposed. The IRPAR algorithm constructed the surface reflectance library by integrating regional PM2.3 levels as a quantitative indicator of atmospheric aerosol loadings. The IRPAR algorithm was used to obtain the aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals over Beijing-Tianjin- Hebei (BTH) region from March 2019 to February 2020, and its performance was preliminarily evaluated by aerosol robotic network (AERONET) measurements. The results showed that the IRPAR algorithm was able to obtain more highly accurate AOD retrievals compared to the JAXA L2 algorithm during the autumn in BTH region, with a large R of 0.87 (0.71 for JAXA L2 AOD) and a global climate observing system fraction (GCOSF) percentage of 28% (21% for JAXA L2 AOD). During different daytime hours, the IRPAR AOD showed a stable retrieval performance, while the JAXA L2 AOD exhibited a worst performance from 12:00 to 14:00 Beijing standard time (BST). These results demonstrated that the IRPAR algorithm was relatively less affected by the viewing angle. Future work will require a comprehensive evaluation of the IRPAR algorithm on a larger spatial scale.

AB  - The consistency between the Sentinel-3A & B during the tandem mission is analyzed. The data of a pass with continuous valid measurements of more than 2200 seconds are processed. It is shown that the sea surface height, significant wave height and Sigma-0 measurements of S3A and S3B are all consistent and almost all the error terms can be canceled out. Additionally, the measurements of SAR mode outperform that of the PLRM in the sense of both the relative bias and the relative deviation between S3A and S3B, especially for the 20Hz data, indicating the capability of capturing subtle oceanography features of the SAR altimetry.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was carried out in order to clarify the effects of different water and irrigation conditions on crop models and remote sensing assimilation results. It involved taking winter wheat from 17 test sites in Henan Province as the research object and calibrating the World Food Studies model. The ensemble Kalman filter algorithm was used to calibrate the two modes and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Leaf Area Index of the calibrated world food studies model. The study found that the average error of the world food studies model for simulating flowering and maturity periods is within 2 days, the R2 of the leaf area index calibration results is between 0.87-0.98, and the R2 and root mean square error of the verification results are 0.77 and 1.06 respectively. Under the latent model, the R2 of the world food studies model taking account of the water supply situation and the assimilation results without taking account of the water supply situation are 0.50 and 0.48, respectively. In the water restric-tion mode, the R2 increased from 0.79 to 0.86 compared with the assimilation results where the water supply was not considered. The results show that: depending on the water supply of different regions, selecting the corresponding assimilation parameters can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of crop models and remote sensing assimilation for wheat yields under different water and irrigation conditions.

AB  - Southwest China is an ecologically fragile area in China. Understanding temporal and spatial variations of vegetation degradation can help to formulate measures of ecosystem protection and ecological function restoration. In this study, we evaluated vegetation dynamics and identified vegetation degradation and its spatial patterns in Southwest China, based on land cover, DEM, and GLASS LAI datasets from 2001 to 2017. The key results are: (1) Though the average LAI in Southwest China showed an insignificant trend during the study period, based on grid-scale analysis, significant declines in LAI indicating vegetation degradation were identified in some areas such as western Sichuan, western and central Yunnan, and western Tibet; (2) about 10.75% of the vegetation experienced significant degradation during the study period in Southwest China; (3) degraded vegetation was mostly distributed in high elevation areas, and about 43% degraded vegetation was located in areas with the elevation between 3500m and 5000m; (4) the dominant degraded vegetation types included grassland, alpine vegetation, shrubland, and coniferous forest. Our findings can provide valuable management implications for vegetation restoration and ecological protection in Southwest China.

TI  - RFI Source Localization Based on Joint Sparse Recovery in Microwave Interferometric Radiometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, radio frequency interference (RFI) poses a growing threat to microwave interference radiometer with aperture synthesis (MIRAS) led by the European Space Agency, whose scientific goal is to monitor the soil moisture and ocean salinity of the Earth. RFI localization is a critical step to mitigate the impact of RFI sources on the brightness temperature (BT) maps. In this article, we propose an effective and robust RFI source localization approach combined with the joint sparse recovery (JSR) theory using multisnapshot data. The JSR method uses the joint sparsity property of RFI sources in the spatial domain to improve the robustness and accuracy for RFI source localization problem. First, we propose a JSR model by exploiting the joint sparsity of multisnapshot visibility data with RFI contained from MIRAS after conducting the field of view (FOV) registration. Then, we present a greedy algorithm using the orthogonal matching pursuit on multisnapshot data (MSOMP) to localize RFI sources. Results on synthetic data and real satellite data show that compared with the previous existing approaches, the proposed method has a better performance on the mitigation of localization accuracy bias, especially for a low BT value range case and a mixed BT value range case with multiple RFI sources.

AB  - Rapid monitoring of urban waterlogging is of great significance for disaster recovery. In order to quickly extract the inundation area and evaluate loss, based on Google Earth engine (GEE), we compared four water indexes (NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI, WI2015) and data sources (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) in 2021/07/20 Zhengzhou rainstorm. It is found that compared with Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 can provide richer data with higher resolution. The accuracy of monitoring disaster inundation area with MNDWI was the highest (89.7%), and especially when its threshold was around 0.15. The quantitative framework of urban rainwater and flood area in this study can provide technical support for flood disaster analysis of relevant departments.

We design a novel sampling method that takes polarization information into account, in addition to the image augmentation based positive pair sampling method that is commonly used in contrastive learning approaches. The results of the experiments show that positive pairs of VH and VV polarized images can provide complementary information about ship targets to strengthen the classifiers. Besides, different similarity measurement functions are analyzed in the experiments.

TI  - Universal Adversarial Examples in Remote Sensing: Methodology and Benchmark
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep neural networks have achieved great success in many important remote sensing tasks. Nevertheless, their vulnerability to adversarial examples should not be neglected. In this study, we systematically analyze the Universal Adversarial Examples in Remote Sensing (UAE-RS) data for the first time, without any knowledge from the victim model. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack method, namely, Mixup-Attack, and its simple variant Mixcut-Attack, for remote sensing data. The key idea of the proposed methods is to find common vulnerabilities among different networks by attacking the features in the shallow layer of a given surrogate model. Despite their simplicity, the proposed methods can generate transferable adversarial examples that deceive most of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks in both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks with high success rates. We further provide the generated universal adversarial examples in the dataset named UAE-RS, which is the first dataset that provides black-box adversarial samples in the remote sensing field. We hope UAE-RS may serve as a benchmark that helps researchers design deep neural networks with strong resistance toward adversarial attacks in the remote sensing field. Codes and the UAE-RS dataset are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/UAE-RS).

AB  - The intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images based on deep learning has become a hot spot with the increasing satellite images acquired due to the rapid development of aerospace technology. Sufficient and reasonable distributed samples are essential for the accuracy of deep learning. The spatial distribution of natural features is inhomogeneous in the real world. When people create sample dataset, they often collect within a certain local range, which may bring problems of unbalanced distribution of samples, including the unbalance between training dataset and validation dataset, and the unbalance among different sample categories. This long-tail distribution of samples (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while most classes are under-represented) can lead to bias in the training model and make it difficult to ensure accuracy.In this paper we tried to solved the above-mentioned problem in landcover classification with high spatial and spectral resolution (HSSR) remote sensing images. We first adopted an iterative stratification method for multi-label data classification to ensure that both training dataset and validation dataset contain reasonable proportion of landcover classes. Then we proposed a weighted loss algorithm to further strengthen the learning ability of the model for rare categories. Experiments on a large volume HSSR dataset shows that with our methods the accuracy of landcover classification increased by 2%.

TI  - Impact of Rain on Retrieved Warm Cloud Properties Using Visible and Near-Infrared Reflectances Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Techniques
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) and optical thickness (tau) can he derived using reflected sunlight in a visible non-absorbing channel combined with reflectances from a near IR channel that is absorbing [e.g., the bispectral method (BSM)]. Discrepancies between BSM-estimated r(e) and collocated in situ measurements are commonly attributed to a violation of the assumptions used in the BSM algorithm such as plane parallel geometry, and a single mode droplet size distribution (DSD). This research uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) experiments to examine the impact of precipitation on BSM-retrieved r(e) near optical cloud top by comparing the retrievals and associated uncertainties obtained from two types of experiments assuming a unimodal or bimodal drop size distribution. Where rain is present, BSM-retrieved r(e) overestimates the true cloud mode r(e). Moreover, there is no longer a unique measure of r(e) within the precipitating liquid-phased clouds, resulting in a substantial increase in retrieval uncertainties. This leads to a corresponding loss of information on the total number concentration and liquid water content (LWC) near the cloud top. It is found that r(e) biases are not strongly correlated with properties exclusively pertaining to rain, such as rain water content (RWC) or precipitation rates, but tend to be a function of the ratio between rain and cloud water content (CWC) and the cloud total number concentration. These results highlight the need for additional independent information such as from an active or passive microwave sensor that can identify the presence of precipitation and constrain additional aspects of bimodal droplet distributions.

TI  - Allometric Vegetation Modeling and SAR Image Simulation for Polarimetry and Interferometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article establishes a low Degree-of-Freedom allometric vegetation model based on the biomass and allometry database (BAAD). It consists of a 5-bit species encoding scheme and a five-parameter relationship derived from the BAAD data records. Combined with an open-source fractal tree generation engine, it can produce realistic tree samples of a large variety of species. A coherent electromagnetic scattering calculation method is developed for the vegetation model where the generalized Rayleigh-Gans (GRG) approximation and the infinite cylinder approximation are used to calculate the scattering matrix of leaves and branches/trunk. Four-path multiple scattering mechanisms between vegetation and the ground are considered, and attenuations through vegetation canopy are also considered. The scattering model is validated against numerical methods. In addition, an end-to-end simulation tool is developed. An optical image is used to extract individual trees with center positions and crown diameters. The rest parameters are generated using the derived allometry model. A virtual 3-D scene with vegetation on a digital elevation map (DEM) can be generated, and SAR images can be simulated. Several case studies are carried out for both polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (PolInSAR) and multitemporal interferometric SAR (InSAR). One case of the Mount Fuji area is simulated and validated against ALOS-2 data and demonstrates an average scattering coefficient error of less than 3 dB. Additional cases of Southwest China, Hainan Island, and the Great Khingan Mountain demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed simulation scheme for various application scenarios.

TI  - Monitoring Fractional Floating Algae Cover Over Eutrophic Lakes Using Multisensor Satellite Images: MODIS, VIIRS, GOCI, and OLCI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coarse-resolution sensors have been used operationally to monitor floating algal blooms with a near daily revisit in coastal and inland waters. Most of the current methods in estimating fractional floating algae cover (FAC) were based on the linear pixel un-mixing assumption. In this study, a new FAC model following a logistic curve was developed and applied to multisensor satellite data in two large shallow eutrophic lakes, Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu, in China. The results indicated that after resampling to 250 m, match-up pairs of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), The Visible and Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) possessed consistent Rayleigh corrected reflectance (R-rc} and floating algae index (FAI) or AFAI (alternative FAI). The FAC model was developed based on the simulated AFAI data of GOCI using point spread function (PSF) and bloom percent derived from Operational Land Imager (OLI) and then was applied to MODIS, VIIRS, and OLCI. Compared with the linear pixel un-mixing method, the FAC model reflects the asymptotic reflectance saturation in the near-infrared (NIR) band with the accumulation of blooms. Besides, the equivalent bloom area (EBA) of GOCI was validated using OLI-matched pairs with UPD 37.6% (N=39, R-2=0.96). The spatial-temporal dataset of FAC (2002-2020) shows that Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu experienced severe algal blooms after 2010, partly resulting from the higher frequency of multisensor data. This study provides a method for building a lasting and comparable FAC dataset using multisensors.

AB  - Urban areas are complex scenarios consisting of objects with various materials. This variety poses a challenge to single-data classification schemes. In this paper, we propose a feature fusion and classification network on RGB top-view point cloud and SAR images with swin-Transformer. In this network, the heterogeneous features are learned separately by an asymmetric encoder, and then they are concatenated along the channel dimension and fed into a fusing encoder. Finally, the fused features are decoded by an UperNet for generating the semantic labels. As data we use the subset of high-resolution 3D point cloud provided by Hessigheim benchmark which are complemented by TerraSAR-X images. The overall precision and the mean intersection over union (mloU) achieves 87.25% and 73.56%, respectively, which outperforms the single-data swin-Transformer by 4.08% and 1.91%, respectively.

TI  - Ensemble Learning Embedded With Gaussian Process Regression for Soil Moisture Estimation: A Case Study of the Continental US
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is critical in maintaining the balance of Earth's environment and climate system. Existing machine learning-based SM estimation methods mainly belong to a single model, which may be unstable and probably lacks adaptability when switching to other sites. In addition, the in situ observations are usually inadequate, deteriorating the generalization performance of a single model. To overcome the above issues, we design two novel ensemble learning models based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR) for SM estimation. One is bagging embedded with GPR (BAGGPR), which is a parallel algorithm designed by randomly selecting multiple data subsets to train an ensemble of GPR models. The other is gradient boosting (BOOST) embedded with GPR (GBGPR), which is a sequential algorithm built by iteratively learning the residual between the previous prediction and its true value. In GBGPR, we also propose an improved Huber loss function by applying square loss on different residuals. The proposed methods greatly enhance the stability, adaptability, and generalization performance of a single GPR model. Experiments are conducted in the continental U.S. (CONUS) between April 2015 and March 2016, where BAGGPR and GBGPR are tested to estimate SM based on 11 multisource remote sensing features. The results demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform other state-of-the-art models, including thirteen single models and three ensemble models, with R being 0.8958 and 0.9047, and root mean square error (RMSE) being 0.0513 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.0490 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, for BAGGPR and GBGPR. Moreover, the proposed methods can well capture spatial dynamics, and they have higher consistent with the in situ measurements, better generalization performance in terms of training data, and higher adaptability to different in situ networks.

AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing data acquisition technology, there are multimodal images over the same observed scenes. These multimodal remote sensing images could provide complementary valuable information for land cover classification. In this article, we propose a novel self-supervised feature learning and few-shot classification model for multimodal remote sensing images, called S2FL. Specifically, a contrastive learning architecture is investigated to learn spatial feature representations from very high resolution (VHR) image. And the spectral features from hyperspectral data are integrated with learned spatial features for few-shot land cover classification. Classification experiments are conducted on a widely-used dataset, i.e., Houston 2018, to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed S2FL model compared with several state-of-the-art baseline approaches.

TI  - Deep Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we develop a novel deep hierarchical vision transformer (DHViT) architecture for hyperspectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data joint classification. Current classification methods have limitations in heterogeneous feature representation and information fusion of multi-modality remote sensing data (e.g., hyperspectral and LiDAR data), these shortcomings restrict the collaborative classification accuracy of remote sensing data. The proposed deep hierarchical vision transformer architecture utilizes both the powerful modeling capability of long-range dependencies and strong generalization ability across different domains of the transformer network, which is based exclusively on the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, the spectral sequence transformer is exploited to handle the long-range dependencies along the spectral dimension from hyperspectral images, because all diagnostic spectral bands contribute to the land cover classification. Thereafter, we utilize the spatial hierarchical transformer structure to extract hierarchical spatial features from hyperspectral and LiDAR data, which are also crucial for classification. Furthermore, the cross attention (CA) feature fusion pattern could adaptively and dynamically fuse heterogeneous features from multi-modality data, and this contextual aware fusion mode further improves the collaborative classification performance. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are conducted on three benchmark hyperspectral and LiDAR datasets, and the DHViT model could yield an average overall classification accuracy of 99.58%, 99.55%, and 96.40% on three datasets, respectively, which sufficiently certify the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method.

AB  - Due to climate and land-use change, natural disasters such as flooding have been increasing in recent years. Timely and reliable flood detection and mapping can help emergency response and disaster management. In this work, we propose a flood detection network using bi-temporal SAR acquisitions. The proposed segmentation network has an encoder-decoder architecture with two Siamese encoders for pre and post-flood images. The network's feature maps are fused and enhanced using attention blocks to achieve more accurate detection of the flooded areas. Our proposed network is evaluated on publicly available Sen1Flood11 [1] benchmark dataset. The network outperformed the existing state-of-the-art (uni-temporal) flood detection method by 6% IOU. The experiments highlight that the combination of bi-temporal SAR data with an effective network architecture achieves more accurate flood detection than uni-temporal methods.

AB  - The polarimetric study in terms of energy spectrum (matrix decomposition) and degree of polarization (m) for vegetation targets infer the accuracy of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors and vegetation operational algorithms. In the present work the dual polarimetric radar vegetation index (DpRVI) and polarimetric radar vegetation index (PRVI) were used as a radar vegetation descriptor (V) in modified water cloud model (MWCM) for assessment of retrieval accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) for wheat crop in the vegetative cropland using Sentinel -1 (C - band) satellite data. The Jacobian based non - linear least square optimization algorithm was used for the parametrization of MWCM. Further, the inversion methods were adopted for retrieval of LAI at VV polarization. The statistical correlation analysis was indicated that DpRVI employed the better R-2 = 0.78 than PRVI.(R-2 = 0.71) Thus, the DpRVI may be alternative tool than optical indices in all weather and in night time acquisition for gap filling in time -series study of crop monitoring.

TI  - Synergy of Vegetation and Soil Microwave Scattering Model for Leaf Area Index Retrieval Using C-Band Sentinel-1A Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The crops' biophysical parameters play an important role in balancing the land surface energy fluxes and are needed in crop simulation modeling, evapotranspiration, etc. The vegetation parameters' retrieval using microwave scattering model, mainly affected by the heterogeneous distribution of land targets, hampers an accurate retrieval of soil-vegetation parameters in microwave remote-sensing algorithms. To minimize the errors in biophysical parameters' retrieval, the synergetic approach of modified water cloud model (MWCM) and modified soil scattering model (MSSM) was attempted to retrieve the leaf area index (LAI) of wheat and barley crops. Due to the spatiotemporal resolution of Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission, it could be more sensitive to vegetation condition and the retrieval accuracy than optical/IR satellites. The nonlinear least square optimization algorithms were used for the parameterization of modified scattering model. The lookup table (LUT)-based inversion algorithm was applied to compute the LAI values through the modified scattering models. The statistical analysis was performed to assess the model efficiency. In case of forward modeling, the highest R-2 = 0.96 and low RMSE = 0.20 dB were computed between the modeled sigma(0) (dB) and SAR-derived sigma(0) (dB) using vegetation descriptor (V) = LAI. On the other hand, for inverse modeling, the LAI values obtained were more accurate at VV polarization (R-2 = 0.94 and RMSE = 0.124 m(2)/m(2)), when compared with the in situ data. The overall product was also compared with the Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-LAI to check the robustness of the approach.

TI  - Accurate Azimuth Ground Deformation Estimation From Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes the exploitation of the overlapping areas between bursts of Sentinel-1 interferometric wide (IW) swath data for the estimation of ground azimuth deformation velocities from time series, which provides high sensitivity to the North-South direction. The availability of two separated Doppler spectral looks over these areas allows one to obtain high accurate estimates, overcoming the limited performance of classical correlation techniques with coarse resolution modes. Since the estimation is restricted to the (sparsely distributed) burst overlaps, its applicability is limited to geophysical phenomena characterized by a slow spatial variability, e.g., seismic scenarios. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach to time series over a region in Pakistan affected by post-seismic deformation. The estimated mean azimuth velocity performance from real data indicates an accuracy better than 7 mm/year over high long-term coherent areas for a three-year data stack.

AB  - A novel alteration of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) and its inversion is proposed in this research work to improve the accuracy of Soil Moisture Content (SMC) mapping. This paper suggests using the Optical Trapezoid Model as the sole vegetation descriptor in the WCM, as well as the use of a specific configuration of parameters derived from a function of radar frequency, polarization, dielectric particle size, and orientation distribution. The proposed inversion scheme is applied on Sentinel-1 data along with the Landsat-8 images component. The proposed approach achieves higher SMC estimation accuracies compared to those produced by tested methods. Indeed, the designed approach achieved improvements in terms of accuracy as demonstrated by a decrease of Root Mean Square Error values in the order of 0.3% and 0.55% in the Blackwell farms and Sidi Rached study areas respectively.

AB  - Improvement of crop remote sensing application in precision agriculture systems and development of algorithms for satellite and aerial imagery interpretation necessitate comparing remote sensing and ground-based survey data. This paper is the first to report data on spectral characteristics of the leaf diffuse reflection in spring wheat, their relationship with plant productivity, colorimetric characteristics and reflection indices of the crop vegetation cover, depending on the crop management technologies. The first research objective was to assess the dependence of crop canopy optical characteristics and productivity on seeding density and the rates of pre-treatment with nitrogen fertilizer. The second objective was to reveal correlations between the canopy remote sensing data and the leaf diffuse reflection parameters registered by a contact sensor (on the example of spring wheat Triticum aestivum L. cv. Daria). The plants were grown on the test plots (Menkovo experimental station of Agrophysical Research Institute, Leningrad Province, Gatchina District) in 2020-2021 years. In total, six test plots with an area of 100 m(2) were assigned. Nitrogen rates ranged from 0 (no fertilizers applied) to 200 kg/ha with increments of 40 kg/ha, and seeding rates of 500 and 600 seeds per m2. The diffuse light reflection of leaves was registered in situ on stages BBCH 30-31 "booting" and BBCH 53-55 "earing" by a fiber-optical spectroradiometric system (Ocean Insight, USA) in the range from 350 to 1000 nm with a step size of 0.3 nm. After the reflectance spectra recording, the plants were dried to constant weight and each plant was weighed to assess correlations with the optical parameters of leaves. The light diffusion index R800 was determined from the spectra of reflected radiation. The reflectance indices calculated were the following: ChlRI (chlorophyll index), PRI (photochemical index), FRI (flavonoids index), WRI (water content index), ARI (anthocyanins content index) and FRI (flavonoids content index). These indices estimate the intensity of the photosynthetic apparatus function and the efficiency of light use in photosynthesis. The crop canopy remote sensing was performed at BBCH 25-27 ("tillering"), BBCH 30-31 ("booting"), BBCH 53-55 ("earing"), and BBCH 61- 65 ("blossoming") stages using two synchronized digital cameras Canon G7X (Canon Inc., Japan) mounted on a Geoscan 401 quadcopter (Geoscan, Russia). From a height of 75-120 m, the digital images were obtain in the visible and near infrared spectral ranges. The vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and ARVI (Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index) were calculated based on the optical characteristics. For quantitative interpretation of the colorimetric characteristics of leaves and the crop canopy, we used a three-dimensional model of the CIELAB color space. Plants were weighted during the growing season, and, after harvesting, the grain productivity was estimated for the plants sampled from 0.25 m(2) reference plots. The obtained results indicate that at the early stages of plant development when the vegetation cover remains open, NDVI characterizes the degree of nitrogen supply rather exactly and identifies areas with underdeveloped plants. However, with the development of plants and the formation of a closed vegetation cover this index fails to provide reliable results. ADVI also fails to provide reliable information about the state of spring wheat plants and identifies areas that require additional fertilize application.A close linear correlation between the rate of applied nitrogen fertilizer, the net productivity of plants and spectral characteristics of leaves measured in situ occures until the late stages of development (BBCH 53-55 "earing", BBCH 61-65 "blossoming"). Crop monitoring based on colorimetric characteristics made it possible to detect changes in the crop canopy associated not only with the plant development and crop density, but also with the spectral characteristics of the diffuse reflection of plant leaves. A comparison of the remote and contact sensing data allows us to conclude that the ChlRI, PRI, FRI and WRI indices can successfully identify areas in which nitrogen deficiency has developed during the closed canopy formation, when the commonly used indices, for example, NDVI, fail to be reliable.

AB  - Orono-shima Island is a remote Island in the Tsushima Strait, it is 4.3km around. Since ancient times, it has been a landmark when crossing from the Korean Peninsula to Japanese archipelago via Tsushima Island and Iki Island. However, large-scale mins and burial mounds are not known on Orono-shima Island until now. During my four years on the island, the author walked all over the island for terrain survey. As a result, the author discovered a topography like keyhole tomb which is a characteristic Japanese burial mound, on the northern cape of the island. It could be up to 150m in size, one of the largest around Kyusyu Island. There is no burial mound comparable to this on a remote island in Japan. Therefore, we created a 3D image using a drone Laser surveying of this terrain and we compared the results with another keyhole tomb. In addition, we analyzed the image of infrared radiation of Orono-shima Island took by Landsat8. In conclusion, it was speculated that this topography was the prototype of the oldest type of keyhole cairn tomb in Japan. The topography of the northern part of Orono-shima could be regaining the missing link between the cairn on the Korean Peninsula of the first century and the oldest type of keyhole cairn tomb in Japan of the third century.

TI  - Influence of anti-coronavirus disease 2019 policies on 10 pediatric infectious diseases
T2  - PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To combat the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, many countries, including Japan, implemented policies limiting social activities and encouraging preventive behaviors. This study examines the influence of such policies on the trends of 10 infectious pediatric diseases: pharyngoconjunctival fever; group A streptococcal pharyngitis; infectious gastroenteritis; chickenpox; erythema infectiosum; hand, foot, and mouth disease; herpangina; respiratory syncytial virus; exanthem subitum; and mumps. Methods The research adopted a retrospective cohort study design. We collected data from Japan's National Epidemiological Surveillance Program detailing the incidences of the 10 diseases per pediatric sentinel site for a period beginning at 9 weeks before government-ordered school closures and ending at 9 weeks after the end of the state of emergency. We obtained corresponding data for the equivalent weeks in 2015-2019. We estimated the influence of the policies using a difference-in-differences regression model. Results For seven diseases (pharyngoconjunctival fever; group A streptococcal pharyngitis; infectious gastroenteritis; chickenpox; erythema infectiosum; hand, foot, and mouth disease; and herpangina), the incidence in 2020 decreased significantly during and after the school closures. Sensitivity analysis, in which the focus area was limited to the policy-implementation period or existing trend patterns, replicated these significant decreases for one of the above mentioned seven diseases - infectious gastroenteritis. Conclusions Policies such as school closures and encouragement of preventive behaviors were associated with significant decreases in the incidences of most of the 10 diseases, which sensitivity analysis replicated in infectious gastroenteritis. To determine the long-term effects of these policies, prospective cohort studies are needed.

AB  - One span of an aqueduct bridge suddenly collapsed in Wakayama City in western Japan on October 3, 2021. This study investigates the use of remote sensing data for the assessment of bridge situations in the normal time and in accidents/disasters. A field survey was conducted by the authors with the aid of a small UAV. Google Street View photos taken before the accident were also used. Based on these data, it is estimated that more than 5 hangers out of 18 might have failed for the collapsed span when the bridge collapse occurred. The failure of 4 hangers was also confirmed in the adjacent surviving span from the UAV images. The pre- and post-event high-resolution TerraSAR-X intensity images were also introduced to extract the collapsed span from the SAR data.

TI  - Improved Method to Detect the Tailings Ponds from Multispectral Remote Sensing Images Based on Faster R-CNN and Transfer Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The breaching of tailings pond dams may lead to casualties and environmental pollution; therefore, timely and accurate monitoring is an essential aspect of managing such structures and preventing accidents. Remote sensing technology is suitable for the regular extraction and monitoring of tailings pond information. However, traditional remote sensing is inefficient and unsuitable for the frequent extraction of large volumes of highly precise information. Object detection, based on deep learning, provides a solution to this problem. Most remote sensing imagery applications for tailings pond object detection using deep learning are based on computer vision, utilizing the true-color triple-band data of high spatial resolution imagery for information extraction. The advantage of remote sensing image data is their greater number of spectral bands (more than three), providing more abundant spectral information. There is a lack of research on fully harnessing multispectral band information to improve the detection precision of tailings ponds. Accordingly, using a sample dataset of tailings pond satellite images from the Gaofen-1 high-resolution Earth observation satellite, we improved the Faster R-CNN deep learning object detection model by increasing the inputs from three true-color bands to four multispectral bands. Moreover, we used the attention mechanism to recalibrate the input contributions. Subsequently, we used a step-by-step transfer learning method to improve and gradually train our model. The improved model could fully utilize the near-infrared (NIR) band information of the images to improve the precision of tailings pond detection. Compared with that of the three true-color band input models, the tailings pond detection average precision (AP) and recall notably improved in our model, with the AP increasing from 82.3% to 85.9% and recall increasing from 65.4% to 71.9%. This research could serve as a reference for using multispectral band information from remote sensing images in the construction and application of deep learning models.

TI  - Extending a Linear Kernel-Driven BRDF Model to Realistically Simulate Reflectance Anisotropy Over Rugged Terrain
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models are used to correct surface bidirectional effects and estimate land surface albedo. Many operational BRDF/albedo algorithms adopt a Roujean linear kernel-driven BRDF (RLKB) model because of its simple form and good performance in fitting multidirectional surface reflectance values. However, this model does not explicitly consider topographic effects, resulting in errors when applied over rugged terrain. To address this issue, we proposed a hybrid algorithm suitable for both flat and rugged terrain, called topographical kernel-driven (Topo-KD). First, we constructed a linear kernel-driven BRDF model considering terrain (LKBx005F;T) which describes the topographic effects with a mountain radiative transfer (MRT) model. Then, the Topo-KD algorithm adaptively selects the most suitable model (RLKB or LKBx005F;T) according to the terrain conditions and fitting residuals. The performances of Topo-KD and RLKB using the RossThickx2013;LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) kernel are compared using simulated data sets and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The results show that the BRDF of the pixel is affected by topography. But the RTLSR model does not specifically account for it, resulting in larger biases over rugged terrain than the Topo-KD algorithm in both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The experiment using MODIS data sets demonstrates that the Topo-KD algorithm reduces fitting residuals in the red and NIR bands by 21.5x0025; and 27.4x0025; compared with the RTLSR model. These results indicate that the Topo-KD algorithm can be a better choice for retrieving land surface parameters and describing the radiative transfer process in mountainous areas.

TI  - Evaluation of the Vegetation-Index-Based Dimidiate Pixel Model for Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing estimation based on the dimidiate pixel model (DPM) using vegetation indices (VIs) is a common approach for mapping fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The major drawback of DPM is that it does not consider real endmember conditions and multiple scattering between soil and vegetation. An analysis of FVC uncertainties caused by these model deficiencies is still lacking. Here, we first calculated the FVC theoretical uncertainty caused by reflectance uncertainties based on the law of prapagation of uncertainty (LPU). Then, we tested the performance of DPM using six VIs over 3-D forest scenes. We simulated both Aqua-MODIS and Landsat-OLI surface reflectance (SR) at their corresponding spatial resolutions and spectral response functions (SRFs) using a well-validated 3-D radiative transfer (RT) model which helps to separate the model and input uncertainties. We found that ratio vegetation index (RVI)- and enhanced vegetation index (EVI)-based models were most affected by sensors, followed by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-, enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2)-, renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI)-, and difference vegetation index (DVI)-based models. Without considering SR uncertainties, the DVI-based model performed best (FVC absolute difference < 0.1); however, the commonly used NDVI model reached a maximum difference of 0.35. At the same time, input uncertainty increased the uncertainty of FVC retrieval. We noticed that the increase of solar zenith angle (SZA) resulted in a clear increase of retrieved FVC under the uniform distribution, which can be explained by the increased shadow proportion. Besides, model accuracy was dominated by the purity of soil (vegetation) endmember in low (high) vegetation cover area. This study provides a reference for the selection of the optimal VI for FVC retrieval based on the DPM.

TI  - Vicarious Radiometric Calibration of the AHSI Instrument Onboard ZY1E on Dunhuang Radiometric Calibration Site
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced hyperspectral imager (AHSI) is the second hyperspectral imager of China, which is also one of the most important payloads onboard the ZY1E satellite. In order to monitor the radiometric calibration status since its launch on September 12, 2019 and thus provide supplementary onboard radiometric calibration, this article conducts several vicarious radiometric calibration experiments for the ZY-1E AHSI. Five satellite observations over the Dunhuang radiometric calibration site, one of the most relevant China Radiometric Calibration Sites (CRCS), were used. Surface reflectance, radiosonde data, aerosol optical depth (AOD) loading, and water vapor content were used to simulate the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance at the entrance pupil of the satellite via MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN). Our results show that the vicarious radiometric calibration coefficients are relatively constant with the official coefficients: the mean relative differences are 5.55%, 5.64%, 7.02%, 5.07%, and 5.30% on January 11, January 17, February 12, May 7, and November 23, 2021, respectively. The vicarious radiometric calibration coefficients were found in good agreement with the official ones according to the validation analysis based on different surface types, i.e., water and vegetation. Uncertainties of vicarious radiometric calibration due to AOD assumptions, AOD measurements, water vapor measurements, radiosonde data measurements, relative spectral response (RSR) shifts, and surface reflectance measurements are also discussed in detail. The obtained results show that the ZY-1E AHSI exhibits good on-orbit radiometric status.

TI  - LOVD: Land Vehicle Detection in Complex Scenes of Optical Remote Sensing Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, there is a growing body of research about object detection in remote sensing data. However, the detection algorithms for small targets in remote sensing areas are inadequate, largely because of the unavailability of high-quality datasets. Most remote sensing datasets are comprehensive, which means that they include bridges, airplanes, and lots of other common categories. Compared with other categories, the number and diversity of weak objects, such as vehicles, are quite insufficient. These limitations greatly affect the detection of small targets in remote sensing images. In order to promote the development of algorithms for the detection of small targets in remote sensing images and also allow access to remote sensing data, we have established a large-scale dataset for the detection of vehicle targets in optical remote sensing images and called it LOVD. It contains 1196 pictures and 541751 instances, covering 13 categories. For the dataset, we have proposed in this article: 1) it is the largest one in terms of vehicle category and the total number of vehicle instances; 2) it contains images with various backgrounds in different weather and scenarios; and 3) all targets are marked by oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), and two label formats are provided. Finally, we test the state-of-the-art detection algorithms on our dataset and provide a benchmark for OBB detection.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a crucial variable in many domains including climate, agriculture and hydrology. In the past decades, satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) has been widely used to estimate SM at various spatial scales. In the present study, the Chinese Feng Yun (FY) satellites (FY-4A and FY-3D) were first used to estimate SM over the mainland China, following a pixel-to-pixel scheme of the LST-FVC trapezoid method. The soil moisture active passive (SMAP) product was conducted to assess the estimated SM over the study area. Results indicated that a root mean square error of approximately 0.108 m(3)m(-3) can be found between the FY-derived SM and SMAP product.

CP  - 10th International Conference on Communications, Signal Processing, and Systems
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Marine Scotland is tasked with reporting on the environmental status of Scottish marine waters, an enormous area of water extending from the shoreline to deep oceanic waters. As one of the most important variables, chlorophyll concentration (Chl) plays an important role in the seawater quality monitoring. Currently, the Chl observation is mostly done by expensive ship-based surveys that have very limited spatio-temporal coverage. Satellite based ocean colour remote sensing has the potential to significantly enhance monitoring capabilities but this opportunity has not been widely adopted by statutory reporting bodies across Europe due to concerns over satellite data quality. To break through this bottleneck, in this paper, we explore to implement advanced machine learning techniques to automatically estimate the Chl via the historic time series of ocean colour remote sensing data during from July 2002 to September 2019.

TI  - Cross-Dimensional Object-Level Matching Method for Buildings in Airborne Optical Image and LiDAR Point Cloud
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, an object-level matching method was proposed to perform building matching in cross-dimensional remote-sensing data. Object-level matching of buildings is essential pre-work for 3-D shape reconstruction, to further generate productions, such as a digital building model. Optical images and LiDAR point clouds, with rich colors and precise 3-D positioning information, respectively, are mostly used alone for 3-D shape reconstruction. Obviously, it is better to combine both the 2-D image and 3-D point cloud. However, it is difficult to first perform the cross-dimensional object-level matching (COlM), since there are few descriptors which can unify the 2-D image and 3-D point cloud. To address this issue, a feature transformation framework was proposed. First, a cross-dimensional encoder module is introduced to unify the descriptor extracted from the optical image and LiDAR point cloud. Second, a spatial occupancy probability descriptor (SOPD) is employed to associate the descriptor extracted from different dimensional data with instinct geometric structure of buildings. Then, the 3-D geometric structure is transformed into a feature vector for matching. For experiments, a cross-dimensional object-level building dataset was collected and labeled to verify our method. It includes cross-view 2-D optical images and LiDAR point clouds for each building from hundreds of buildings. The results show that a high-accuracy COlM was achieved.

TI  - MD<SUP>3</SUP>Net: Integrating Model-Driven and Data-Driven Approaches for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a special image fusion task of reconstructing a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image by integrating a panchromatic (PAN) image of high spatial resolution and a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image. To handle such an ill-posed multimodal fusion task, in this article, we propose a novel pansharpening method, referred to as model-driven and data-driven network (MD(3)Net), which combines model-driven and data-driven approaches. The architecture design of MD(3)Net is inspired from the traditional model constructed based on domain knowledge and thus making its network topology explainable and its input-output predictable. To further explore the powerful learning ability of deep-learning-based approaches, we introduce the deep prior into the MD(3)Net as its implicit regularization, thus improving its data adaptability and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both reduced and full resolution of several acknowledged datasets have qualitatively and quantitatively verified the superiority of our network compared with a benchmark consisting of several state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - Monitoring dynamics variation of the glacier is critical in understanding regional hydrology and predicting future glacial changes. In this paper, we reported the annual variation of glacier boundaries of Geladandong, a typical mountain glacier, and the headwater of the Yangtze River in the Tibetan Plateau from 1999 to 2020 and explored its elevation dependence. The object-oriented random forest method, a machine learning method, was adopted. Several satellites were used, including Landsat 7/8, Ziyuan-3, and Gaofen-1/2. The results show\ that 1) during 1999-2020, glacier areas in the study region decreased by 45.67 km(2), 7.27% of 1999; 2) The retreat of glacier tongue and hanging glacier are quite different in shape, velocity, and distribution characteristics; 3) the decrease of glacier area is mainly concentrated between 900-1650m, accounting for more than 98% of the retreat area.

TI  - IRCNN: An Irregular-Time-Distanced Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Change Detection in Satellite Time Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL)-based methods incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully applied to change detection in satellite time series. However, traditional RNNs assume identical time interval between image sequences, which hardly meets the real case in satellite time series because of clouds and shadows. In this letter, a novel irregular-time-distanced recurrent CNN (IRCNN) is proposed. IRCNN consists of three sub-networks: a multi-branch Siamese CNN, irregular-time-distanced long short-term memory (ILSTM), and fully connected (FC) layers. Superior to the existing methods, IRCNN can account for temporal dependency among time series with irregular time distances. It is end-to-end trainable with samples generated using an automatic annotation generation method, which is proposed based on the prior knowledge from the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) approach. IRCNN was tested over five study areas using Landsat time series collected between 2013 and 2020. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed network with better performance, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Our IRCNN Pytorch code and data are available at https://github.com/thebinyang/IRCNN.

TI  - UTRNet: An Unsupervised Time-Distance-Guided Convolutional Recurrent Network for Change Detection in Irregularly Collected Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection in time series is among the most critical problems in Earth monitoring and attracts extensive attention in the remote sensing community. The task is, however, nontrivial because available images are irregularly collected due to interference by clouds and shadows. Traditional recurrent neural networks neglect such information and, thus, degrade the possibility of distinguishing pseudochanges (caused by intra-annual and interannual dynamics) and real changes. To this end, we proposed an unsupervised time-distance-guided convolutional recurrent network (UTRNet) for change detection in irregularly collected images. UTRNet is distinctive because the influence of pseudochanges can be suppressed by adopting a novel time-distance-guided long short-term memory (TLSTM) unit, in which input and forget gates are modified to adapt to irregular time distances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the influence of pseudochanges can be suppressed using irregular time distances. Moreover, to make UTRNet more applicable, a weighted prechange detection model is proposed to extract the most reliable training samples automatically. In the training process, unlike existing approaches that only care about changed and unchanged sample imbalance, our UTRNet also pays attention to imbalance between hard and easy samples, and proposes a new focal weighted cross-entropy loss, which helps to make the training process focus on hard changed samples. The proposed UTRNet is validated on Landsat 8 time-series data collected over nine typical scenes in the 2013-2021 period. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods suggest the superior performance of UTRNet. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/thebinyang/UTRNet.

AB  - This paper describes an automatic blue ice extent mapping technique in Grove Mountains, East Antarctica, where the key focused area of the Antarctic scientific expedition and many meteorites are distributed. In previous studies, the monitoring of blue ice extent was usually conducted using satellite images with coarse spatial resolution or offline operation, which lowered the description performance of blue ice in detail as well as the efficiency of continent-scale data production. Using Google Earth Engine, we first developed an automated framework that employs Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) indices in joint with the Otsu thresholding method to distinguish blue ice areas on Landsat imagery. Taking Grove Mountains as a study case, we further analyzed the annual variability of blue ice extent in the austral summer from 2007 to 2021. The results indicated that the blue ice extent can be automatically detected based on cloud platform and has no significant variability trend in Grove Mountains over the study period fluctuating with an overall average area of 440 similar to 600 km(2). This framework is expected to be used for automated mapping on the whole of Antarctica and other concentrated blue ice areas (e.g., the East Antarctica ice sheet periphery and the Transantarctic Mountains surroundings) in a rapid and efficient manner, which provides guidance on the meteorite recovery and the support of the polar sustainable development goals.

AB  - Monitoring mining impact has become increasingly important as the awareness of safety and environmental protection is rising. Our project Integrated Mining Impact Monitoring (i(2)Mon), funded by European Commission - Research Fund for Coal and Steel, intends to monitor the mining-induced impact, in particular, ground movement. The monitoring system comprises terrestrial measurement and remote sensing: levelling, GPS, LiDAR scanning, UAV survey, and SAR interferometry. The aim is to launch an interactive GIS-based platform as an early warning and decision making service for mining industry. This study has developed a scheme based on advanced SAR interferometry to monitor the ground movement over an extensive area at millimetre level. The first test site is a deactivated open-pit mine in Cottbus, Germany owned by Lausitz Energie Bergbau AG. The whole area was reclaimed into a post-mining lake and must be monitored for the safety. The second test site is located in Poland, where the underground mining operated by POLSKA GRUPA GORNICZA began in June 2021. We have monitored the in-situ ground movement carefully as part of the influenced area covers the human settlement. The ground movement of our test sites was analysed from Sentinel-1 images. The crucial parameters include stepwise movement series, instantaneous velocities and accelerations, and significance index. In addition, six corner reflectors along with sensors like GPS were installed across the region in Cottbus. They were observed in the Sentinel-1 series and the GPS readings will be used for validation. Finally, all the data will be integrated into DMT's platform - SAFEGUARD.

TI  - EFFECT OF BREAST CONSERVING SURGERY COMBINED WITH SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY ON SERUM IL-6, IL-10 LEVELS AND PROGNOSIS OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER
T2  - ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the effect of breast conserving surgery combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy on serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Methods: 118 patients with breast cancer admitted in our hospital from May 2017 to July 2018 were divided into control group and experimental group according to different treatment methods, 59 cases in each group. The control group was treated with traditional radical mastectomy combined with axillary lymph node dissection, while the experimental group was treated with breast conserving surgery combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The clinical indicators (operation time, intraoperative blood loss, extubation time, total drainage volume) of breast cancer patients in the two groups were observed and recorded. The quality of life scores (social function, role function, health function, physical function, emotional function), prognosis (recurrence rate, distant metastasis rate, survival rate) and complications were compared between the two groups after 6 months Limb edema, subcutaneous effusion, skin flap necrosis) and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 before and 6 months after treatment. Results: the operation time, blood loss, extubation time and total drainage volume in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in the two groups were significantly lower than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the levels of serum IL-6 and IL-10 in experimental group were significantly lower than those in control group (P<0.05). The scores of social function, role function and health function in experimental group were significantly lower than those in control group (P 0.05); there was no significant difference in physical function and emotional function between experimental group and control group (P 0.05). There was no significant difference in recurrence rate, distant metastasis rate and survival rate between the experimental group and the control group (P>0.05). The total incidence of complications in experimental group was significantly lower than that in control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: breast conserving surgery combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy can effectively reduce the levels of serum IL-6 and IL-10 in patients with breast cancer, improve the quality of life of patients, reduce the risk of complications, and promote the recovery of patients. However, it has no significant impact on the prognosis and has high clinical application value.

TI  - MSFusion: Multistage for Remote Sensing Image Spatiotemporal Fusion Based on Texture Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitations of current technology and budget, a single satellite sensor cannot obtain high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing images. Therefore, remote sensing image spatio-temporal fusion technology is considered as an effective solution and has attracted extensive attention. In the field of deep learning, due to the fixed size of the perception field of a convolutional neural network, it is impossible to model the correlation of global features, and the features extracted only through convolution operation lack the ability to capture long-distance features. At the same time, complex fusion methods cannot better integrate temporal and spatial features. In order to solve these problems, we propose a multistage remote sensing image spatio-temporal fusion model based on texture transformer and convolutional neural network. The model combines the advantages of transformer and convolutional network, uses a lightweight convolution network to extract spatial features and temporal discrepancy features, uses transformer to learn global temporal correlation, and finally, fuses temporal features with spatial features. In order to make full use of the features obtained in different stages, we design a cross-stage adaptive fusion module CSAFM. The module adopts the self-attention mechanism to adaptively integrate the features of different scales while considering the temporal and spatial characteristics. To test the robustness of the model, the experiments are carried out on three datasets of CIA, LGC, and DX. Compared with five typical spatio-temporal fusion algorithms, we obtain excellent results, which prove the superiority of MSFusion model.

TI  - Analysis and Estimation of Net Primary Productivity of Vegetation in Nanjing Using Multi-Sourced Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator of Earth's ecosystem. However, NPP estimation of cities by high spatial resolution is limited in China, especially Nanjing, and NPP evolution and quantitative analysis of influencing factors in time series are insufficient. Nanjing, as one of the central cities in China, plays a major role in China's economic development. In this paper, high spatial resolution data combined with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data are used for NPP estimation and analysis in Nanjing City. The research contents of this paper are as follows: (1) To improve the passive effect of "red border region" on GF-1 WFV forest and farmland classification ability, the multispectral and high-resolution images are fused, and the image fusion effect was also evaluated. (2) The NPP of four seasons in Nanjing in 2017 was estimated using the CASA model. (3) The results of NPP estimation are analyzed based on statistical principles. The advantage of this paper lies in the comprehensive utilization of multi-source data and the quantitative analysis of the response mechanism between meteorological data and the NPP estimation value.

TI  - Region-Level Traffic Prediction Based on Temporal Multi-Spatial Dependence Graph Convolutional Network from GPS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Region-level traffic information can characterize dynamic changes of urban traffic at the macro level. Real-time region-level traffic prediction help city traffic managers with traffic demand analysis, traffic congestion control, and other activities, and it has become a research hotspot. As more vehicles are equipped with GPS devices, remote sensing data can be collected and used to conduct data-driven region-level-based traffic prediction. However, due to dynamism and randomness of urban traffic and the complexity of urban road networks, the study of such issues faces many challenges. This paper proposes a new deep learning model named TmS-GCN to predict region-level traffic information, which is composed of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The GCN part captures spatial dependence among regions, while the GRU part captures the dynamic change of traffic within the region. Model verification and comparison are carried out using real taxi GPS data from Shenzhen. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms both the classic time series prediction model and the deep learning model at different scales.

TI  - Bathymetric Inversion and Mapping of Two Shallow Lakes Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Bathymetry Data in the Central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy lake bathymetry and mapping are crucial for estimating lake water storage on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this article, we constructed traditional empirical (TE) models and machine learning (ML) models to compare the prediction accuracy and remote sensing bathymetric mapping performance by using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and in situ measured water depth from Caiduochaka (CK) and QiXiang Co in the central TP. We analyzed the relationship between the band reflectance and depth and explored the universality of the model in different lakes. The results indicated that when using the TE model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) varied between 14.5% and 26.5% for the test dataset at different study sites. When using the ML models, the MAPE varied between 7.6% and 18.9%, and it was the better choice overall. For the test dataset of the random forest model with the highest accuracy, in the CK with the maximum depth of approximately 16 m, the mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.54 and 0.89 m, and the precision was the highest with an MAE of 1.13 m and RMSE of 1.67 m in QiXiang Co with a maximum depth of approximately 28 m, whereas the portability of the model was not satisfactory. Overall, the results indicated that the ML model can obtain bathymetric maps with high accuracy, good visual performance, and reliability, outperforming the TE model. It can be used effectively for deriving accurate and updated high-resolution bathymetric maps for shallow lakes.

TI  - Mapping Dongting Lake Wetland Utilizing Time Series Similarity, Statistical Texture, and Superpixels With Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland is of significant ecological value, which is very important and challenging for large-scale mapping. Sentinel-1 can continuously record wetland changes with its all-day, all-weather working capability. How to fully utilize multidimensional information, such as time and statistical texture of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, to classify wetlands more accurately has become a research focus. Thus, this article constructed time series similarity parameters to describe the temporal change information of targets in wetland and introduced G(0) statistical texture parameters to describe texture characteristics of SAR images. Combining multifeatures and superpixels, we proposed a classification method based on random forest (RF) to map Dongting Lake wetland. The overall classification accuracy was 97.57%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.97. The classification accuracy of reed beach and grass marsh was above 95%. The results showed the proposed SAR time series similarity features could effectively utilize dynamical information among classes and was helpful to identify mudflat, grass marsh, and reed beach with high dynamics in wetland. The introduced statistical texture features expressed the heterogeneity of targets, and enhanced the recognition and extraction ability of forest beach, mudflat, and reed beach. Compared with support vector machine, decision tree, and RF classification methods, RF with superpixels optimized not only got high precision but also could effectively reduce the pepper-salt error in classification, because of the consideration of superpixels context information.

TI  - Two-Dimensional Spectral Analysis Filter for Removal of LFM Radar Interference in Spaceborne SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio spectrum bands allocated to spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are shared by multiple missions. In practical radio spectrum environments, these bands are also used by some ground radars, e.g., C-band weather radar. Due to this fact, radio frequency interference (RFI) may occur for a spaceborne SAR when its received signals contain the transmitted waveforms from another SAR or radar operating at the same frequency band. This particular class of RFI is usually linear-frequency-modulation (LFM) signals, which can cause bright radiometric artifacts in focused SAR images. Most existing signal processing approaches designed for addressing this problem belong to the class of preprocessing methods, which removes RFI in level-0 raw radar data before SAR focusing. In this article, we propose a postprocessing kernel & x2014;2-D SPECtral ANalysis (2-D SPECAN) filter, for removing the class of LFM RFI in level-1 SLC images. The filtering consists of three main steps: Step 1: focus LFM RFI artifacts in SLC images as point-like responses in the spectral domain via 2-D SPECAN; Step 2: perform 2-D notch filtering in the spectral domain to remove the most contribution of the RFI responses; and Step 3: transform the filtered spectrum back into the SLC image domain using the inverse operation of the 2-D SPECAN. For computation efficiency, we design a simplified processing flow and adopt a blockwise processing strategy. Experiments with several Sentinel-1 SLC images demonstrate that severe RFI artifacts in SLC images can be removed significantly by the proposed method.

TI  - The July 2020 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.3 Nima Earthquake, Central Tibet: A Shallow Normal-Faulting Event Rupturing in a Stepover Zone
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 22 July 2020, an M-w 6.3 earthquake with a predominantly normal-faulting mechanism struck the Yibug Caka fault zone, central Tibet, where the overall tectonic environment is characterized by left-lateral strike-slip motion. This event offers a chance to gain insight into the tectonic deformation and the cause of shallow normal-faulting earthquakes in this little studied region. Here, we use Sentinel-1A/B Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data to investigate the coseismic and postseismic deformation related to this earthquake. The earthquake ruptured a previously mapped West Yibug Caka fault and is dominated by normal slip with a peak value of 1.9 m at depth of 6.9 km. Postseismic deformation analysis indicates that the observed subsidence signals of up to similar to 4.7 cm are a consequence of afterslip. Most of the afterslip is confined at depths between 0.8 and 8.4 km, peaking at 0.27 m at depth of 6.1 km. The significant coseismic slip and afterslip involved in the earthquake highlights a complex interaction between the major normal fault and the secondary synthetic fault. By an integrated analysis of the inversions, regional geology geomorphology, fault kinematics, and seismicity background, we propose a tectonic model that attributes the occurrence of this normal-faulting event to the release of extensional stress in a stepover zone controlled by the northeast-striking sinistral strike-slip Riganpei Co fault and Bu Zang Ai fault. Compared with that the structural stepover often acts as a barrier to affect the propagation of earthquake rupture, our study demonstrates that the failure of a stepover may potentially induce the occurrence of earthquake along the bounding strike-slip faults.

AB  - Operational aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are limited to coarse resolution (kilometers or hundreds of meters). In this study, the Sentinel-2 images were used to generate high-resolution (60 m) AODs over urban surfaces. Compared with traditional aerosol retrieval algorithm, the proposed algorithm has three major improvements including: 1) taking advantage of the aerosol-sensitive coastal band in aerosol retrieval; 2) no estimation of surface reflectance; and 3) not using of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band. For validation, measurements from four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites located in Beijing covering 2018 to 2021 were collected. The validation results show that the retrieved Sentinel-2 AODs highly correlate with AERONET measurements, with overall correlation coefficient for all four sites of 0.927, expected error (EE) of 68.75%, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.082, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.108. The proposed algorithm can provide reliable AODs at 60 m resolution over urban surfaces.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has become a popular sensor and valuable tool for sea ice extraction because of its observation ability in all-day, all-weather and high-resolution features. With the development of SAR, there are three different polarization modes called by single-pol, quad-pol and compact polarization, which have been used for sea ice application. Only the intensity information is obtained by single-pol observation. As for the quad-pol, which can provide more information of subject and perform well in the classification of sea ice. However, the development of quad-pol is limited by its high cost and smaller coverage. Compact polarization was proposed, because it can obtain the similar information as quad-pol SAR with the wide coverage, which is very suitable for sea ice monitoring. In this study, sea ice information are extracted with k-means algorithm from compact polarization data. And the results are compared with those from quad-pol GaoFen-3(GF-3) data. The classification results from the two SAR modes are close. It indicates that compact polarization has a good potential in the application of sea ice monitoring.

TI  - Hidden Path Selection Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Targeting at depicting land covers with pixelwise semantic categories, semantic segmentation in remote sensing images needs to portray diverse distributions over vast geographical locations, which is difficult to be achieved by the homogeneous pixelwise forward paths in the architectures of existing deep models. Although specific algorithms have been designed to select pixelwise adaptive forward paths for natural image analysis, it still lacks theoretical supports on how to obtain optimal selections. In this article, we provide mathematical analyses in terms of the parameter optimization, which guides us to design a method called hidden path selection network (HPS-Net). With the help of hidden variables deriving from an extra mini-branch, HPS-Net is able to tackle the inherent problem about inaccessible global optimums by adjusting the direct relationships between feature maps and pixelwise path selections in existing algorithms, which we call hidden path selection. For the better training and evaluation, we further refine and expand the 5-class Gaofen image dataset (GID-5) to a new one with 15 land-cover categories, i.e., GID-15. The experimental results on both GID-5 and GID-15 demonstrate that the proposed modules can stably improve the performance of different deep structures, which validates the proposed mathematical analyses.

TI  - Daily actual evapotranspiration estimation of different land use types based on SEBAL model in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northwest China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in hydrological and energy cycles, as well as in the assessments of water resources and irrigation demands. On a regional scale, particularly in the agro-pastoral ecotone, clarification of the distribution of surface ET and its influencing factors is critical for the rational use of water resources, restoration of the ecological environment, and protection of ecological water sources. The SEBAL model was used to invert the regional ET based on Landsat8 images in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northwest China. The results were indirectly verified by monitoring data from meteorological stations. The correlation between ET and surface parameters was analyzed. Thus, the main factors that affect the surface ET were identified. The results show that the SEBAL model determines an accurate inversion, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an average root mean square error of 0.9 mm/d, which is highly suitable for research on water resources. The correlation coefficients of normalized vegetation index, surface temperature, land surface albedo, net radiation flux with daily ET were 0.5830, 0.8425, 0.3428 and 0.9111, respectively. The normalized vegetation index and the net radiation flux positively correlated with the daily ET, while the surface temperature and land surface albedo negatively correlated with the daily ET. The correlation from strong to weak is the net radiation flux > surface temperature > normalized vegetation index > surface albedo. In terms of spatial distribution, the daily ET of water was the highest, followed by woodland, wetland, cropland, built-up land, shrub land, grassland and bare land. However, the SEBAL model overestimates the inversion of daily ET of built-up land.

AB  - To address the difficulty of waterline extraction in areas with gentle slopes in the muddy coastal zone, Chongming Dongtan in the Yangtze River estuary is selected as the research object. This paper analyzes the spatial relationship of the waterline in Landsat images at three spatial scales, gives a method for numerically calculating the spatial relationship characteristics at different spatial scales and the application means in waterline extraction, and constructs a model for waterline extraction from Landsat images using the multiscale spatial relationship. Finally, the execution efficiency and positioning accuracy of the multiscale spatial relationship waterline extraction model are quantitatively evaluated. The results show that the spatial relationship is effectively used to solve the problem of discontinuous extraction of a weak waterline in the muddy coastal zone, and the waterline recognition ability for remote sensing images is significantly improved. The position accuracy of waterlines obtained by the improved method can reach 12.4 meters. Compared with other methods, this method shows great advantages in terms of automation, waterline continuity, and positioning accuracy and provides technical support for the use of remote sensing technology to study the dynamic changes in coastal zones.

AB  - To solve the problem that target recognition in infrared detection blindness, a DoFP infrared polarimetric imagery is designed. The top of the infrared detector pixel, based on a domestically made uncooled long-wave infrared focal plane array detector, integrates a micro-polarizer array with different polarization directions. Then, according to the infrared intensity image, infrared DoLP image, and infrared AoP image of the infrared blind spot scene, which have different physical properties and imaging characteristics, a multi-polarization parameter infrared polarization fusion method is integrated at the information processing end of the detector, and the fusion criterion of polarization color mapping is adopted. The test results show that the system can output the infrared intensity, DoLP, AoP and infrared polarization fusion enhanced image of the target scene in real time, and can effectively detect the target in the infrared blind area. The study has great potential for camouflage recognition and polarization remote sensing.

AB  - The Fengyun-3E satellite (FY-3E) is the world's first civilian weather satellite in the twilight orbit, which enables the solar panel to be designed with a larger size and vertically upwards to absorb more energy. In order to solve the problem of obstructing the observation field of the GNSS positioning antenna, the GNOS positioning antenna on the FY3E is designed as a dual-antenna combination cooperative observation method. Therefore, the precise orbit determination (POD) solution mainly needs to solve two problems: (1) the problem of inconsistent phase centres; (2) the problem of inconsistent hardware delay parameters. This article is aimed at the design structure of FY-3E satellite GNOS dual positioning antenna, uses the simplified dynamics non-differenced low-orbit satellite POD method and least squares quadratic (LSQ) recursive batch processing, subsequently to calculate the satellite's precise orbit, and at the end evaluates the POD precision with the overlapping arc inspection method. The results show that the satellite-borne GNSS low-orbit satellite with dual-antenna can observe more GNSS data, while the position accuracy of POD is centimetre level, and the speed accuracy is micrometres per second, finally the orbit accuracy is equivalent to that of the traditional unobstructed single positioning antenna for POD.

TI  - In-Flight, Full-Pixel Calibration of Reflectance in Spatial Dimension for Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibrating the top-of-atmospheric reflectance measurements of spaceborne hyperspectral atmospheric composition monitoring instruments is necessary to ensure the accuracy during cloud and aerosol retrieval. Here, we present a method for calibrating full-pixel reflectance data collected by the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI). This method compares EMI reflectance data with simulation using a radiative transfer model (RTM). To simplify the radiative transfer calculations, a clear observation situation without clouds or aerosols was chosen. Correction coefficients for each spatial dimensional pixel were obtained by comparing the EMI Earth reflectance with the simulated reflectance under clear sky conditions. The corrected reflectance data were cross-compared with Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) reflectance data, highlighting that there were relative errors of >20% at 345, 388, 425, and 440 nm before correction. After correction, however, the errors of all selected wavelength bands were < 5%, demonstrating that the developed method can help in calibrating EMI in-flight reflectance measurements.

AB  - We created understory species maps (i.e., barberry, greenbriar, mixed invasive and mountain laurel) at 10 m resolution in Connecticuts deciduous forest in 2020. Harmonic time series model and three years of Sentinel-2 time series from 2019 to 2021 were used to classify understory species based on their unique intra-annual phenology characteristics. The time series model coefficients could not only capture the subtle phenology differences, but also create synthetic cloud-free images within a short temporal window (e.g., on the 100th and 120th day of year) in the early spring (hereafter called observe window), in which Sentinel-2 data can penetrate the deciduous overstory canopy and observe the unique trajectories of different understory species due to their phenology differences. As the different conditions of leaf growth in the observe window present distinct spatial patterns within deciduous forests, we also calculated multiple texture features (i.e., mean, second moment, and contrast from gray level co-occurrence matrix) based on the synthetic images created within the observe window. By using the spectral, temporal, and spatial features as input variables from dense Sentinel-2 data, auxiliary data (i.e., LiDAR and drainage soil layer), a random forest classifier, and a new strategy to iteratively select representative samples (namely ISRS), accurate understory species maps were created with an overall accuracy of approximately 93%, and the users and producers accuracies varied from 39% to 99% for the four mapped understory species. The proposed method can also create an accurate binary map of understory with an overall accuracy of 95%, a producers accuracy of 84%, and users accuracy of 68%. Besides, we can separate the invasive and native species with an overall accuracy of 94%. We estimated that the invasive species cover an area of 741.16173.99 km2, which occupies a large proportion (~65%) of the shrub understory in Connecticuts deciduous forests. With enough accurate training data collected, this classification strategy has the potential to be applied at a much larger scale within the Sentinel-2 era.

AB  - Earth observations from remote sensing imagery play an important role in many environmental applications ranging from natural resource (e.g., crops, forests) monitoring to man-made object (e.g., builds, factories) recognition. Most widely used optical remote sensing data however is often contaminated by clouds making it hard to identify the objects underneath. Fortunately, with the recent advances and increased operational satellites, the spatial and temporal density of image collections have significantly increased. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based imputation technique for inferring spectral values under the clouds using nearby cloud-free satellite image observations. The proposed deep learning architecture, extended contextual attention (ECA), exploits similar properties from the cloud-free areas to tackle clouds of different sizes occurring at arbitrary locations in the image. A contextual attention mechanism is incorporated to utilize the useful cloud-free information from multiple images. To maximize the imputation performance of the model on the cloudy patches instead of the entire image, a two-phase custom loss function is deployed to guide the model. To study the performance of our model, we trained our model on a benchmark Sentinel-2 dataset by superimposing real-world cloud patterns. Extensive experiments and comparisons against the state-of-the-art methods using pixel-wise and structural metrics show the improved performance of our model. Our experiments demonstrated that the ECA method is consistently better than all other methods, it is 28.4% better on MSE and 31.7% better on cloudy MSE as compared to the state-of-the-art EDSR network.

TI  - Reexamining the relationship between surface urban heat island intensity and annual precipitation: Effects of reference rural land cover
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) across cities is significantly positively correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP), including linear and nonlinear correlations. Different explanations for these SUHII-MAP relations have been suggested, yet a systematic examination of the impact of variability in reference rural land cover on geographic variations of daytime SUHII and the relation with MAP is still lacking. In this study, the previously proposed SUHII-MAP relations are reexamined by investigating 60 cities across North America and 346 cities across the globe, respectively. The focus of the study is on the role of variability of reference land cover types in the SUHII-MAP relations. The 10-yr time series of satellite-observed land surface temperature, precipitation and solar radiation data, in conjunction with global land cover data, are used for analysis. Our results confirm the reproducibility of both the linear and nonlinear SUHII-MAP relations; nevertheless, the significant positive correlations between the daytime SUHII and the MAP are found to be dependent mainly on the variability of the reference land cover types associated with MAP levels (i.e., varying from desert to tree cover). In contrast, when a constant land cover type is taken as the reference, no significant correlations between the daytime SUHII and the MAP are observed. The finding highlights that respecting SUHI intensity as a relative measure and accounting for variability of reference land cover is of crucial importance for proper interpretation and understanding of SUHI.

TI  - A Correction Method of NDVI Topographic Shadow Effect for Rugged Terrain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of solar altitude and azimuth angles makes shadows prevalent in remote sensing images of rugged terrains. Consequently, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the shadow areas is much lower than that of sunlit areas-a phenomenon known as the NDVI topographic shadow effect. In this study, we developed an NDVI topographic shadow effect correction (NTSEC) model. The NTSEC is based on the difference in solar radiation between the sunlit and shadow areas, and introduces a variable factor that indicates the intensity of shadows to simulate the reflectance for direct solar light not received in the shadow areas. The simulated reflectance for direct solar light in the shadow areas is used as a compensation value to be summed with the original reflectance for calculating the corrected NDVI. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images from two different regions were used to test the NTSEC method and multiple strategies were employed to provide objective evaluative results. The model performance was compared with four commonly used topographic correction (TC) models: C-correction, Minnaert, variable empirical coefficient algorithm, and statistical empirical. The results show that NTSEC can suppress the overcorrection of the self shadow areas that are difficult to eliminate in the TC methods, while simultaneously improving the undercorrection of the cast shadow areas. The corrected NDVI of the self shadow and cast shadow areas were almost the same. The NDVI differences between shady and sunny slopes were significantly reduced after correction. In addition, the NTSEC method did not produce outliers, and the NDVI of different land cover types retained interclass stability. In summary, the NTSEC model can be used as a simple and robust method for correcting the NDVI in shadow areas.

TI  - Hyper-Temporal Data Based Modulation Transfer Functions Compensation for Geostationary Remote Sensing Satellites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past years, the acquisition of hyper-temporal data (HTD) from geostationary orbit remote sensing satellites (GEORSS) has provided numerous new research opportunities. Many factors influence the in-orbit dynamic modulation transfer function (MTF) of GEORSS, making it difficult to satisfy the requirements for space-borne cameras. The MTF compensation (MTFC) technique can effectively optimize the design of dynamic MTFs for GEORSS. The traditional MTFC methods mainly consider the sensor, atmosphere and relative motion of the satellite platform when improving GEORSS image quality. They will introduce new high frequency noise, resulting in image information loss. In this article, a mixed sparse higher-order non-convex total variation (MS-HONCTV) model-aided MTFC method is proposed. By introducing the group sparse regularization (GSR) term into the MS-HONCTV model, it increases the robustness to noise and hence reduces the degeneration of the MTF produced by satellite' low pointing stability. The MS-HONCTV model is then applied to solve the problem of image degradation. The quality of remote sensing (RS) data is improved by the proposed MTFC and this is achieved without modifying the aperture diameter, focal length, or detector size of the satellite's optical system. Experimental results show that the proposed MS-HONCTV effectively improves the images' MTF, SNR, gray mean gradient (GMG), and standard deviation (SD), as evidenced by subjective qualitative analysis and objective quantitative assessments of simulated data, laboratory data, and GF-4 satellite data. Compared with other methods, the SNR of the proposed method is increased by 30%, GMG by 14.21%, and SD by 6.3% on average.

TI  - Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Savitzky-Golay Method for Reconstructing High-Quality NDVI Time Series: Reduced Sensitivity to Quality Flags and Improved Computational Efficiency
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal Savitzky-Golay (STSG) method for noise reduction can address the problem of tempor- ally continuous normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) gaps and effectively increase local low NDVI values without overcorrection. However, STSG largely depends on the quality flags of the NDVI time-series data, and inaccurate quality flags yield misleading final results. STSG also requires extensive computing time when used in large-scale applications. This study proposes an enhanced method, called compute unified device architecture (CUDA)-based STSG (cuSTSG), to address the aforementioned limitations of STSG. First, cosine similarities between the annual NDVI time series were used to identify and exclude the NDVI values with inaccurate quality flags from the NDVI seasonal growth trajectory. Second, computational performance was improved by reducing redundant computations and parallelizing computationally intensive procedures using the CUDA on graphics processing units (GPUs). Experiments on four MODIS NDVI time-series datasets of various sizes and regions showed that compared with the original STSG, cuSTSG reduced the mean absolute errors of the final products by 4.90%, 7.77%, 11.76%, and 2.06%, respectively. The results also showed that cuSTSG on a GPU achieved more than 75 speed-up compared with the Interactive Data Language-implemented STSG, and more than 30 speed-up compared with the C++-implemented STSG. cuSTSG can effectively mitigate the impacts of inaccurate quality flags on final products and generate high-quality NDVI time series at large scales with high accuracy and performance. The source code of cuSTSG is available at https://github.com/HPSCIL/cuSTSG.

TI  - Single-Stream CNN With Learnable Architecture for Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose an efficient and generalizable framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for multisource remote sensing (RS) data joint classification. While recent methods are mostly based on multistream architectures, we use group convolution (GConv) to construct equivalent network architectures efficiently within a single-stream network. Based on a recent technique called dynamic grouping convolution (DGConv), we further propose a network module named separable DGConv (SepDGConv), to make GConv hyperparameters, and, thus, the overall network architecture, learnable during network training. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to residual network (ResNet) and UNet, and the adjusted networks are verified on three very diverse benchmark datasets (i.e., Houston2018 data, Berlin data, and MUUFL Gulfport Hyperspectral and LiDAR Airborne Data Set (MUUFL) data). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed single-stream CNNs, and in particular, SepG-ResNet18 improves the state-of-the-art classification overall accuracy (OA) on hyperspectral-synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) Berlin dataset from 62.23% to 68.21%. In the experiments we have two interesting findings. First, using DGConv generally reduces test OA variance. Second, multistream is harmful to model performance if imposed to the first few layers, but becomes beneficial if applied to deeper layers. Altogether, the findings imply that the multistream architecture, instead of being a strictly necessary component in deep learning models for multisource RS data, essentially plays the role of model regularizer. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yyyyangyi/CNNs-for-Multi-Source-Remote-Sensing-Data-Fusion. We hope our work can inspire novel research in the future.

TI  - Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm for Sentinel-2 Images Over Complex Urban Areas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution aerosol retrieval is of great significance for understanding the impact of aerosols on air pollution and climate change. In this study, an algorithm for aerosol retrieval at a spatial resolution of 60 m over complex urban areas is developed using Sentinel-2 images. The proposed algorithm has two assumptions: 1) the blue-red surface reflectance ratio does not change temporally in a single season and 2) surface reflectance over bright areas is invariant over three months. Then, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is retrieved from the surface reflectance correlations with a combination of temporal signatures over the vegetated areas and bright areas. The aerosol robotic network (AERONET) measurements in Beijing and its surrounding from 2017 to 2019 are collected and used to validate the retrieved 60-m Sentinel-2 AODs; 77% of the retrieved Sentinel-2 AODs fall within the expected error (EE), and the correlation coefficient is of 0.927. MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products at 1- and 10-km resolutions (MCD19A2 and MOD04_L2, respectively) are acquired to compare with the retrieved Sentinel-2 AODs. Comparison results show that the retrieved Sentinel-2 AODs are superior to the MOD04_L2 dark target (DT) and MCD19A2 AODs, and slightly better than the MOD04_L2 deep blue (DB), and DT and DB combined (DTBC) AODs. The validation and comparison results indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to describe aerosol distributions at high resolution continuously. However, further work is needed to apply the proposed algorithm on a global scale.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - This paper uses the level-2 Ocean data (OCN) of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath (IW) model to retrieve the sea surface radial current velocity. The level-2 OCN data of IW mode includes two modules: radial surface velocity (RVL) and ocean wind field (OWI). The RVL module provides parameters such as radial Doppler frequency shift, which can be used to retrieve the sea surface current velocity. The OWI module provides wind field retrieved from the SAR image and is used as the input of the empirical model CDOP to remove the Doppler frequency shift caused by the sea surface wind-wave field. The retrieval results are verified by using HYCOM data, and the bias was less than 0.1m/s and the root mean square error was about 0.2m/s in 4 test areas, which showed good agreement and utility of Sentinel-1 Ocean data in retrieving ocean current data.

TI  - Category Correlation and Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Compact Cloud Detection in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection relying on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) obtains remarkable accuracy gains at the expense of high computation and storage costs, which are difficult to deploy to resource-constrained devices, such as intelligent satellites. Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a promising solution for a compact model. However, most existing KD methods only transfer the feature relationship of pairwise pixel, which fails to cope with thin clouds and cloud-like objects in complex scenes. Furthermore, those KD methods directly imitate the output of the complicated model regardless of the correctness. In this article, we propose a novel category correlation and adaptive KD (CAKD) framework for the lightweight cloud detection network. We design a category relational context (CRC) module to refine the structured pixel-category correlation from the teacher and student network. Then, we perform the category correlation distillation (CCD) to make the student model better address the intraclass consistency and the interclass difference, thus reducing the category confusion. Besides, a pixel-adaptive distillation (PAD) module is utilized to adaptively transfer the soft-output knowledge of a teacher model by extracting the teacher's pixel prediction probability. Extensive experiments on Landsat 8, Landsat 7, Gaofen-2, Gaofen-1, and Google Earth dataset report the effectiveness and universality of our distillation method. The CAKD allows MobileNetV2 with 2.31M parameters and 4.63G float-point operations (FLOPs) to outperform advanced cloud detection methods without the added inference overhead.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of fractional vegetation coverage in the Aydingkol Lake Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the driest and lowest regions in Asia, the vegetation variation in the Aydingkol Lake Basin in Xinjiang, China, reveals the status of its ecological recovery. To more accurately retrieve the fractional vegetation index (FVC) to investigate the vegetation variation in this basin, we proposed an innovative method-the random forest (RF) method-based on multiple remote sensing indices. The retrieval shows a satisfactory accuracy with a mean error, mean square error, mean relative error (RE) percentage, and determination coefficient of 0.01,0.04,14.61% and 0.95, respectively. In the Aydingkol Lake Basin, the average annual FVC peaked in 2015 with a value of 0.08. The annual average value of FVC decreases at a rate of 0.06 * 10(-2)/a during these eight years. The reduction of FVC is mainly distributed in the central-western part of the basin. In exploring the influence on FVC, average annual precipitation has the most significant impact on the FVC. Its correlation coefficient with FVC is 0.87. With increasing elevation and slope, most FVC showed a decreasing trend. In recent years, the conversion of cropland to barren land and cropland to grassland had the greatest impact on decreasing of the FVC, and the mean FVC decreases from 0.19 to 0.17 before and after the land-use change. Moreover, human impact had a significant influence on the variation in FVC. Due to the establishment of the Aydingkol Lake Basin Wetland Reserve (the SAIC Volkswagen Test Site), the annual average FVC in the corresponding place increases from 0.06 to 0.13 (decreases from 0.148 to 0.005). This study is helpful to guide ecological protection in similar arid regions. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - PolSAR Ship Detection Based on Azimuth Sublook Polarimetric Covariance Matrix
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) is an important tool for marine remote sensing. In the past two decades, subaperture decomposition is considered as an alternative method to extract ship targets, especially in complex conditions where the detection based on intensity performs not well. The introduction of polarization information can enhance the detection ability of radar. The combination of sublook techniques and polarization will lead to more precise target extraction. The first methods jointly using information of polarization and sublook is the polarimetric internal Hermitian product (Pol-IHP), which nowadays has been corrected as Pol-HIP. However, it is limited by the number of sublooks and recently developed as generalized multi-sublooks correlation. In this article, a novel sublook polarimetric covariance matrix (SPCM) is established, based on which a sublook-polarimetric whitening filter (sub-PWF) is further proposed for ship detection. The SPCM represents a given pixel using a high-dimensional covariance matrix which utilizes the spectral correlation in imaging progress and the scattering characteristics of different polarization channels. The superiority of sub-PWF based on SPCM is validated via the measured single look complex PolSAR data from RadarSAT-2 and GaoFen-3. Results show this new method can improve the target to clutter ratio and reduce the clutter fluctuation. The ROC curves in both small and large scenes proves that sub-PWF can reach ideal detection performance.

TI  - Transformation of The Philosophical and Soteriological Principles of The Buddhism in China
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the process of transformation of the philosophical and soteriological teachings of Buddhism in China as a result of the interaction of the Chinese and Indo-Buddhist civilizations. The substantiation is given that the transformation of Buddhism was a natural process of adaptation of Buddhism in China, which did not distort the original principles of maternal Buddhism. It represented a logical process for the further development of Buddhism in the Far East. It is shown that Buddhism, which brought new soteriological and philosophical principles to this country, collided with traditional religious beliefs and a rich philosophical tradition, which necessitated its adaptation to the local mentality and adaptation to the Chinese sociocultural bedrock. A comparative analysis of the religious beliefs of the Chinese and Indo-Buddhist religious principles, as well as the philosophical argumentation of Buddhism and traditional Chinese philosophy is given. The article notes the difficulties that Buddhism faced on its way, when entering the Chinese socio-cultural environment, as well as the objective and subjective conditions that contributed to the spread of soteriological and philosophical attitudes in China. The canonical texts of Mahayana Buddhism are indicated, the content of which became accordant with the Chinese worldview and served for Tao Sheng to put forward his famous thesis about the instant attainment of Buddhahood, which served as the starting point for the development of a new soteriological trend in the Far East. The analysis of the process of adaptation of soteriological principles to the Chinese mentality is given, the ontologization of the philosophical attitudes of Buddhism as a result of its collision with the natural-philosophical teaching of Chinese philosophy is shown. It is substantiated that the formation of a new soteriological direction of Buddhism in China influenced the philosophical content of Buddhism, which determined the formation of a qualitatively new stage in the development of Buddhism in the Far East.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing Images Using Pyramid Object-Based Markov Random Field With Dual-Track Information Transmission
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation is one of the most important tasks in remote sensing image processing. According to task requirements, the semantic depth given to the same remote sensing image can be different, and many people have studied it through a pyramid or multilayer structure. The Markov random field (MRF) is widely used in single-layer modeling due to its outstanding spatial relationship capturing ability and feature description ability, but it is not sufficient enough to mine the interlayer information, and the way of information transmission between layers is relatively simple direct projection segmentation results. To solve this problem, new dual-track information transmission is proposed in this letter. The proposed method first constructs a triple-multi (multiresolution, multiregion adjacency graph (RAG), and multisemantic)-pyramid (TMP) structure with the original resolution image as the middle layer in the pyramid. Then, the MRF model is defined on each layer; its likelihood function and the prior function that are related to the adjacent layer are constructed. Finally, the dual-track information transmission circulation is carried out to traverse the entire pyramid structure starting from the original resolution layer. The proposed method is tested on different remote sensing images obtained by the SPOT5, Gaofen-2, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better segmentation performance than other multilayer MRF methods.

TI  - Influence of Atmospheric Scattering on the Accuracy of Laser Altimetry of the GF-7 Satellite and Corrections
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite laser altimetry can obtain sub-meter or even centimeter-scale surface elevation data over large areas, but it is inevitably affected by scattering caused by clouds, aerosols, and other atmospheric particles. This laser ranging error caused by scattering cannot be ignored. In this study, we systematically combined existing atmospheric scattering identification technology used in satellite laser altimetry and observed that the traditional algorithm cannot effectively estimate the laser multiple scattering of the GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite. To solve this problem, we used data from the GF-7 satellite to analyze the importance of atmospheric scattering and propose an identification scheme for atmospheric scattering data over land and water areas. We also used a look-up table and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to identify and correct atmospheric scattering, for which the availability of land and water data reached 16.67% and 26.09%, respectively. After correction using the MLP model, the availability of land and water data increased to 21% and 30%, respectively. These corrections mitigated the low identification accuracy due to atmospheric scattering, which is significant for facilitating satellite laser altimetry data processing.

AB  - Over the past few decades, a large collection of feature extraction and classification algorithms have been developed for land cover mapping using remote sensing data. Although these methods have shown the gradually-increasing performance, their potential inevitably meets the bottleneck due to the lack of high-quality and diversified remote sensing benchmark datasets, particularly for the multimodal cases. Accordingly, this, to a larger extent, limits the development of the corresponding methodologies and the practical application of land cover classification. To this end, we aim in this paper to introduce and build several multimodal remote sensing benchmark datasets for land cover classification. Furthermore, two new multimodal land cover classification benchmark datasets, i.e., Berlin and Augsburg, are openly available. Experiments are conducted on the two datasets for evaluating the performance of several multimodal feature learning and classification methods.

TI  - Impact of Accumulated Temperature on Wetland Vegetation Area in Poyang Lake
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accumulated temperature, which is now widely used in agronomy, is an important ecological factor to the growth of plants, but few relative studies have been found on the vegetation area of floodplain grasslands in Poyang Lake. This research used the classification and regression tree (CART) to classify normalized vegetation area index derived from MODIS images from 2008 to 2014, according to different climate indexes, such as mean daily air temperature (n), accumulated temperature (jw), daily maximum temperature (g), daily minimum temperature (d), accumulative precipitation (j), water level (s) and average water level for 20 days preceding (a). The results showed that: (1) The accumulated temperature and the 20-day average WL (water level) were found to have the greatest impact on variation in wetland vegetation area, and they both dominated the classification process twice; (2) Two classification thresholds of accumulated temperature were 790??C and 1784??C, approximately corresponding to the beginning of April and midMay; (3) 790??C could also be used as a threshold to select remote sensing images to analysis the annual variability of vegetation, i.e. while accumulated temperature is lower than 790??C, remote sensing images of similar accumulated temperature rather than similar date should be selected from different years for comparison. We also found that, effects of different hydrological factors on area of floodplain grasslands showed stage characteristics: (1) From January to March, water level changes slowly with less rainfall, as a result, the 20-day average WL which can interpret the hydrologic characteristics smoothly showed significant importance in this stage; (2) While entering April, intense rainfall make accumulative precipitation to be the dominating accumulative precipitation higher than 405 mm, daily water level is of most importance, because to the flood recession process as well as rapid water level fluctuations.

TI  - Mapping Irrigated Area at Field Scale Based on the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) Using Landsat Images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is critical to agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions, and it is imperative to map high-resolution irrigated area to improve water productivity. This study proposes a field-scale (30-m resolution) irrigated area mapping method based on soil moisture change detection using remote sensing data only. First, normalized soil moisture is obtained using the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) and then converted to soil water content. Next, individual irrigation events are identified in the time series of soil water content using threshold detection. Finally, irrigation events are accumulated over the time series, and then, the irrigated area map can be obtained. This method was tested using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze remote sensing images and map irrigated areas in a typical arid and semiarid region called Hexi Corridor in northwestern China in the past 30 years. In situ validation shows that this method has an accuracy close to 100%. The shortcoming of low recall is also overcome by long-term observations. An application of the proposed method shows that the irrigated cropland of Hexi Corridor has increased by 4840 km(2) (42.2%) over a 31-year time period (1990-2020). This field-scale irrigated area mapping method can improve the management of water resources.

AB  - The data of Microwave Radiation Imager(MWRI) on FY3D satellite suffers from numerous impacts during data acquisition, resulting in a loss in spatial resolution. However, existing methods such as wiener filtering and Lucy Richardson are unable to enhance spatial resolution under complicated deterioration conditions. In this paper, an unsupervised method using the "zero-shot" super-resolution(ZSSR) framework is applied to microwave image processing. Experimental results on simulated images and real MWRI images have demonstrated the validity and effectiveness of the method.

TI  - The Role of Women in Kurdish Cultural Heritage*
T2  - WORLD OF MUSIC-NEW SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article-an intervention from an archivist and author who builds collections and museums to preserve and promote Kurdish culture and writes from outside of academia in the strictest sense-interrogates the frequently valorized and romanticized notion of Kurdish oral tradition as enshrined in the art of the dengbej, revealing that on recordings and books and in popular imagination, male performers and male performance contexts have come to define this domain. The article argues that the contributions of women in creating and evolving the rich spectrum of orally transmitted genres, with their poetics, emotive force, and unique approaches to vocalization, is completely erased in the iconography of the male dengbej. An understanding of the spaces of domestic seclusion and the vibrant role of a full range of languagebased arts in household rhythms and the imparting of a worldview and historical consciousness supports the adoption of the term zarbej (non-professional performer and purveyor of a spectrum oral genres) as an unsung counterweight to the dengbej, who dominates public spaces from village gatherings to radio broadcasts and folklore collections.

M3  - Article
AB  - The "top-bottom" opposition is a binary spatial opposition which describes the orientation of objects in the space as well as identifies the spatial qualification of an object and models the coordinate system of the linguistic (resp. dialectal) worldview. This article deals with the problem of the semantic structure of geographical denominations, i.e. fragments of the derivative clusters of the base words of this opposition: sepx, aopa ("top") and (sic) ("bottom"). The author scrutinizes the semantics of derivatives, compounds, combinations of words (sic) etc. These names represent the semantic field, Relief". The semantics of the nouns under study represent various aspects of the Ukrainians' life and reflect their material and spiritual culture. This study applies the onomasiological model of description, moving the focus from the meaning to the word. The analysed units represent semantic and derivational features which are typical for the dialects of the Ukrainian language. The sources of the study are dialect recordings, regional dictionaries and texts as well as linguistic atlases.

AB  - This study applied a supervised machine learning classification and intensity analysis of Landsat imageries to examine the spatio-temporal dynamics of woody vegetation cover in Barbados for two-time intervals: 2001-2015 and 2015-2019. The results show a larger persistence and concentration of woody vegetation in the East Coast (the Scotland District) of Barbados. Woody vegetation cover declined by approximately 11 km(2) from 2001 to 2015, and 1.5 km(2) from 2015 to 2019. Intensity analysis showed that total observed change in the landscape was slow in the first-time interval but fast in the second. Categorical gain-loss showed a systematic targeting between woody vegetation and other vegetation. Built-up and woody vegetation, however, systematically avoided each other. Woody vegetation remained active in both time intervals, but the intensity of change was larger in the second interval. In conclusion, the systematic targeting between woody vegetation and other vegetation (mainly agriculture) provides a focus for management, conservation, and spatial expansion of the latter.

AB  - The auroral oval is a region of footprints where configuration of the Earth's magnetic field lines is such that energetic particles could penetrate into the denser part of the ionosphere. The auroral oval features the most complex ionospheric processes. In this region intensive small-scale ionospheric irregularities exist during both calm and disturbed geomagnetic conditions. Such irregularities could result in radio wave scattering, GNSS (global navigation satellite system) positioning quality deterioration, failures in radio communication, etc. During the last decades scientists have been using GNSS ROTI (rate of total electron content index) data along with other tools to study small-scale irregularities. This data can help to study the oval dynamics. The current report provides data on the auroral oval dynamics, based on GNSS receiver global network data, coherent radars data, and satellite data. To calculate ROTI data we used SIMuRG system (https://simurg.iszf.irk.ru/). The auroral oval regions are assumed to correspond to high values of ROTI. Therefore, we can keep track of the oval's boundary using these data Coherent scatter radars record signals scattered from plasma irregularities which intensively appear at the oval boundary. We used SuperDARN-like radars located in Russia. Satellite data show sharp variations in field-aligned currents. During magnetic storms the oval expands equatorward, and small-scale irregularities generation shifts to mid-latitudes. All instruments are in good agreement when positioning the oval's boundary. That allows us to use different data to estimate the oval boundary. Some advance was achieved with computer vision techniques to find the auroral oval boundary in the Northern hemisphere. The techniques implemented mathematical morphology to expand data and decrease data gaps, and K-means and Otsu techniques to cluster image data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Marine gravity anomalies are crucial parameters and elements for determining coastal and ocean geoid, tectonics and crustal structures, as well as offshore studies. This study aims to derive and develop a marine gravity anomaly model over Malaysian seas from multi-mission altimetry data. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia 2020 Mean Sea Surface Model is computed based on along-track data from nine satellite missions, incorporating TOPEX, Jason-1, Jason-2, ERS-2, Geosat Follow on (GFO), Envisat-1, CryoSat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, and Sentinel-3A. The data exploited are from 1993 to 2019 (27 years). Residual gravity anomaly is computed using Gravity Software, and two-dimensional planar Fast Fourier Transformation method is applied. The evaluation, selection, blunder detection, combination, and re-gridding of the altimetry-derived gravity anomalies and Global Geopotential Model data are demonstrated. Cross-validation procedure is employed for data cleaning and quality control using the Kriging interpolation method. Then, cross-validation procedure is applied to the tapering window width 200, which adopting the GECO model denotes the optimum gravity anomaly with root mean square errors in the range of +/- 4.2472 mGal to +/- 6.0202 mGal. The findings suggest that the estimated marine gravity anomaly is acceptable to be implemented in the marine geoid determination and bathymetry estimation over Malaysian seas. In addition, the results of this study are valuable for geodetic and geophysical applications in marine areas.

TI  - An Accurate Calculation of the Atmospheric Refraction Error of Optical Remote Sensing Images Based on the Fine-Layered Light Vector Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric refraction is an important factor that affects the positioning accuracy of optical high-resolution satellite imaging. Current calculation methods do not consider regional change characteristics in the atmosphere; the atmospheric division model is rough and does not conform to reality. This article studies atmospheric refraction in optical remote sensing satellite observations, provides a formula for calculating the strict refraction of a multilayer atmosphere, and shows a new method for calculating atmospheric refraction error. We use a ray-tracing method to calculate the light propagation path in the atmosphere and continuously layer the atmosphere according to the height difference of 100 m. Different from general calculation methods, we prove that a regional atmospheric model can calculate the atmospheric refraction index more accurately than using the empirical model. As the off-nadir angle gradually increases, the calculation results in this article are better than the current commonly used methods. We use WorldView-2 images of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region in China for the experiments. When the off-nadir angle is less than 32 degrees, the positioning accuracy improves by 6-47%. Compared with the standard atmospheric model, the regional atmospheric model improves positioning accuracy by 2-18%. This method reflects the continuous variation in the atmospheric refractive index with the vertical distribution of the atmosphere and amended regional meteorological conditions. Model errors caused by overly simple atmospheric division are avoided, andthe positioning accuracy of optical remote sensing images is increased.

TI  - High-Precision Digital Surface Model Extraction from Satellite Stereo Images Fused with ICESat-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of ground control points (GCPs) affects the elevation accuracy of digital surface models (DSMs) generated by optical satellite stereo images and limits the application of high-resolution DSMs. It is a feasible idea to use ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) laser altimetry data to improve the elevation accuracy of optical stereo images, but it is necessary to accurately match the two types of data. This paper proposes a DSM registration strategy based on terrain similarity (BOTS), which integrates ICESat-2 laser altimetry data without GCPs and improves the DSM elevation accuracy generation from optical satellite stereo pairs. Under different terrain conditions, Worldview-2, SV-1, GF-7, and ZY-3 stereo pairs were used to verify the effectiveness of this method. The experimental results show that the BOTS method proposed in this paper is more robust when there are a large number of abnormal points in the ICESat-2 data or there is a large elevation gap between DSMs. After fusion of ICESat-2 data, the DSM elevation accuracy extracted from the satellite stereo pair is improved by 73~92%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of Worldview-2 DSM reaches 0.71 m.

M3  - Article
AB  - Crop rotation is subsidized by the government because of its many advantages, monitoring whether crop rotation is beneficial to agricultural management and can also provide a reference for government subsidy policies for crop rotation. In this letter, we propose an unsupervised object-oriented crop rotation detection method using time-series polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. On the one hand, we construct the change detection matrix based on the likelihood ratio test (LRT) distance to perform temporal filtering. Then, the pixel-level temporal change image is generated using Shannon entropy and maximum between-class variance (OTSU). On the other hand, we perform temporal segmentation on time-series PolSAR images to obtain superpixel results. Finally, the object-level crop rotation results are obtained with the probabilistic label relaxation (PLR) model; 42 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR datasets during 2018 and 2019 are selected for detecting crop rotation changes on farms within Jinchang, China. Experimental results show that the crop rotation detection accuracy and Kappa coefficients of this method can reach 96.21% and 0.8989, respectively.

TI  - Evaluating Snow Bidirectional Reflectance of Models Using Multiangle Remote Sensing Data and Field Measurements
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the anisotropy of snow surface reflectance, it is essential to select a proper snow bidirectional reflectance model for extracting snow cover and inverting snow properties from remote sensing image, especially during the period of snow rapidly changed. In this letter, the ability of reproducing snow bidirectional reflectance by three semiempirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models (Ross-Li, Roujean, and Raman-Pinty-Verstraete) and the asymptotic radiative transfer theory (ART) model was evaluated using the polarization and directionality of the earth reflectance (POLDER) data. In addition, the ART model was compared with the bicontinuous geometric optics (bic-GORT) model based on field measurements. The results indicated that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are small and similar for all models during the stable-snow period. The physical models perform better than the semiempirical models in capturing the bidirectional signatures of snow during the periods of snow rapidly changed. The bic-GORT model achieves higher accuracy, while the ART model holds the advantages of simple and efficient to be used.

TI  - Evaluation of Sea Surface Temperatures Derived From the HY-1D Satellite
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are detected by the Chinese ocean color and temperature scanner (COCTS) instruments aboard the HaiYang (HY)-1C and HY-1D satellites. In this study, the SSTs derived from the COCTS instrument on the HY-1D (COCTS/HY-1D) satellite and a nonlinear SST algorithm with corresponding coefficients were introduced. The COCTS/HY-1D SSTs recorded from April 26 to August 31, 2021, were evaluated against water temperature measurements taken at depths above 1 m from the in situ Quality Monitor system; root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 0.65 and 0.71 degrees C and robust standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.51 and 0.47 degrees C were obtained for the daytime and nighttime SSTs, respectively, using a spatiotemporal matching window of 4 h and 2.5 km. Daily gridded SSTs derived from COCTS/HY-1D were compared with those obtained from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite in the same period, and RMSEs of 0.67 +/- 0.06 and 0.81 +/- 0.06 degrees C and RSDs of 0.49 +/- 0.04 and 0.58 +/- 0.05 degrees C were obtained for the daytime and nighttime SSTs, respectively. The COCTS/HY-1D-derived SSTs covering Gulf Stream waters were cross-validated against the VIIRS/S-NPP data as a case study, and RMSEs of 0.53 and 0.47 degrees C for the daytime and nighttime, respectively, were obtained.

TI  - Split-Window Algorithm for Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From Landsat-9 Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the process of energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere, and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important approach to efficiently obtain LST over a large area. Algorithms for retrieval of LST from TIR remote sensing data have been studied for decades, and the split-window (SW) algorithm can directly eliminate atmospheric effects by using the brightness temperature (BT) at the top of the atmosphere in two adjacent TIR channels and, thus, is widely applied. Landsat-9, the latest launch in the Landsat series of satellites, provides two-channel TIR images with the same 100-m spatial resolution as Landsat-8, and it is meaningful to develop the SW algorithm for LST retrieval using Landsat-9 data. In this letter, four SW algorithms were developed, and the accuracy and noise sensitivity of the results under different observation conditions were compared based on the simulation dataset to select the algorithm with the best performance. The ground measurement data under different land cover types and the global Landsat-9 LST products, produced by the single-channel algorithm, were selected to verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the ground validation accuracy is about 1.574 K, better than the Landsat-9 existing LST product. Moreover, the retrieved LST images have similar spatial distribution to the Landsat-9 LST products, with RMSEs from 0.31 to 2.87 K in various regions.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval Based on Thermal Infrared Channel Decomposed Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter affecting ground-air energy exchange, and can be applied in many fields such as drought monitoring, evapotranspiration estimation, and crop yield assessment. The single-channel (SC) algorithm only needs thermal infrared (TIR) data with only one channel to retrieve the LST, but requires accurate atmospheric correction, which is difficult to guarantee in many cases. The split-window (SW) algorithm exploits the difference in atmospheric absorption of adjacent channels and can accurately obtain the LST without atmospheric parameters, but the input requirement of two TIR channels makes the application limited. Some previous studies found that there is a strong correlation between the top-of-atmosphere thermal radiance in adjacient TIR channels with similar wavelength ranges, which makes it possible to decompose a single TIR channel into two TIR channels with close wavelengths using empirical relationships with errors smaller than those caused by the uncertainty of atmospheric correction. In this article, Landsat-7 ETM+ TIR data was decomposed into two virtual TIR channels by fusing with the simultaneously observed Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and the channel decomposed SW (TCD-SW) based on the generalized nonlinear SW algorithm was developed and applied to retrieve the LST to eliminate the dependence on atmospheric parameters. The validation results using the simulation dataset, ground-measured site data, and well-validated MODIS sea surface temperature product showed that the proposed TCD-SW algorithm achieved more accurate results than the SC algorithm, being more advantageous in the humid atmosphere. The TCD-SW algorithm can be used as a potential new method for LST retrieval from remote sensing data with only one TIR channel under complex atmospheric conditions.

T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Alpine glaciers are sensitive to changes in land surface temperature (LST), and measurements of the mass balance are limited, especially for small glaciers. In this study, we investigate the relationship between snow albedo of the melting season (June, July, and August) and annual glacier mass balance of the White Glacier from 2002 to 2018. Since there are many gaps in the albedo data, we use a interpolation method to fill them and then obtain the average value of the melting season. The study results show that surface temperature plays a dominant role in albedo and mass balance changes, and mass balance change and albedo variation show a significant consistency, with an excellent correlation (R-2 > 0.93). The acceleration of mass balance shows that the rate of mass reduction slows down, and the albedo change shows that the albedo increases from year to year. The interpolation albedo measurements using MODIS data can provide a useful means to reflect the annual change of glacier mass balance.

TI  - Optical-to-SAR Image Matching Using Multiscale Masked Structure Features
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic and precise matching between optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is still a challenging task because of significant radiation and texture differences between such images. Recently, structure feature-based methods are popular for the matching of SAR and optical images. However, current structure descriptors include many noninformative features, which degrade their matching performance. To address that, we present a robust matching method by a multiscale masked structure feature representation. We first extract pixelwise gradient structure features on multiple scales of images. Then, a mask is constructed according to large contours of an image, which is used to increase the contribution of the main structure region and alleviate the influence of noninformative regions. Finally, a fast template scheme based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed to obtain correspondences. The proposed method is tested using the optical and SAR images from the Sentinel and GaoFen sensors. Experiment results show that the proposed method significantly improves the matching performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, especially for the images with poor structure features.

TI  - Application of Hypothetical Ecological Risk Analysis to Sustainable Usage of Possible Winter Recreation Areas in Seyhan Basin (Turkiye)
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the long-term suitability of the area proposals for winter recreation activities in the Seyhan Basin (Turkiye), which is located in the Mediterranean and Central Anatolia regions and includes a large part of the Taurus Mountains, were examined ecologically. For this purpose, the predicted global warming scenarios in the basin and the anthropogenic impacts arising from the planned recreation areas were evaluated for the upper basin (recreation areas) and lower basin (water resources, agricultural lands, and settlements) using a hypothetical risk analysis. For this purpose, multispectral images were obtained by using Landsat 8 Oli Multispectral images of the snow areas in the region in January-February-March 2019, and a hypothetical ecological risk analysis was created considering a total of 5 pressure factors originating from global climate change and anthropogenic effects. These possible factors were determined as flood (S1), drought (S2), sedimentation (S3), aquatic nutrients (S4), and tourist density (S5). The effects of these factors on a total of four features (C1: water quality, C2: fauna-flora, C3: agricultural areas, and C4: settlements) in the region were evaluated by hypothetical grading based on the literature. According to the hypothesis results obtained by the formula and statistical calculations, it was determined that the flood factor (S1) that will occur due to possible snow melt due to global climate change in the winter recreation areas in the studied region is the most significant factor limiting the sustainable usage of the Basin. For this reason, it has been emphasized in this study that the possibility of regions being exposed to the effects of climate change in the future should be taken into account, especially when planning for winter recreation areas. At the end of this study, it was concluded that the ecological balance analysis of basins is important, especially in terms of ensuring the long-term sustainable use of winter recreation areas.

TI  - IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE AREA OF MAJOR CROPS
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a statistical analysis of the time series of areas of majoritarian crops for 20 years (from 1998 to 2020) is carried out, and the influence of agro-climatic zones on the area of cultivation of major crops is analyzed. Climate change is acutely felt in the southern regions of Ukraine, increasing the production risk in the agricultural sector through changes in temperature, precipitation, and other extreme weather events. Historical climatic data indicate an increase in temperature on the territory of Ukraine, and climate forecasts suggest further warming, especially in the south of Ukraine.Using satellite and statistical data, changes in the earth's surface are investigated for certain areas, which are characterized by the greatest changes in crop areas for the main types of crops. To analyze the dynamics of cultivated areas in relation to climatic zones, we used national statistical data for 1998-2019, maps of the classification of land cover from 2016-2020, data on climatic zones on the territory of Ukraine for 2000 and 2020, as well as the contours of administrative units of the NUTS2 level. Since statistical data for many districts are not available for the period 2019-2020 due to the reform of territorial boundaries, we used instead cultivated areas obtained from open satellite records. As additional and alternative information for the analysis of acreage, crop classification maps for 2016-2020 were used, obtained by specialists of the Space Research Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the State Space Agency of Ukraine from their own in-depth training technologies.We used classification maps obtained using open satellite data of the Copernicus program: SAR Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 with a spatial resolution of 10 m. A comparison of statistical data and crop areas obtained from satellite data was carried out by applying the metric of statistical analysis of the correlation coefficient (r). To assess the accuracy, the coefficient of determination R-2 between the statistical area of the main crops and the area according to satellite data was also applied.

AB  - In May 2019, UAV photogrammetry using drones (unmanned aircraft) was conducted to investigate thespatial distribution characteristics of the seagrass habitat in Wan Island. Wan Is. sea was divided into 3geographical areas (Site A, B, C) by referring to the seagrass distribution identified by the National Coastalseagrass forest precision survey (Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, 2015), and contour lines were extracted fromgrid depth data. In addition, a 3-D benthic topographic map using DTM (Digital Terrain Model) was created tounderstand the characteristics and slope of the benthic topographic map. Through the analysis of the seagrassdistribution results and the water depth results, it was confirmed that the boundary between the seagrassdistribution in the outer and coastal areas converges to different water depth limits (within 10 m, and within 5m), which is estimated to be based on the characteristics of the outer sea area. As a result of the analysis of thebenthic topography, it was confirmed that the slope of the well-covered distribution was relatively gentle below0.2~0.8 degrees, and the well-covered distribution was limited to the vicinity of the boundary where the slopechanged rapidly. As a result of comparing the area of the seagrass distribution survey in 2015 and 2019, it wasconfirmed that the area was 238.4 ha and 1,070.9 ha, respectively, which was 4.5 times more widerly whenperforming Drone survey than diving survey. In order to understand the surrounding environment of the seagrassdistribution site, satellite image data and license fishing ground information map at the time of drone shooting(May 2019) were checked. As a result, seaweed (Kelp, Sea mustard seaweed, Seaweed, Seaweed fulvescens, etc.)and shellfish (Abalone) were densely distributed, and most of the facilities except for Seaweed fulvescens farmswere separated from their habitat. Drone survey confirmed Zostera marina, Zostera caulescens, and Zosterajaponica in Wan Is., but no Phyllospadix iwatensis and Halophila nipponica were identified in 2015. It wasconfirmed that there was a limit to classifying the types of vegetation due to the characteristics of Phyllospadixiwatensis attached to the rock substrate, and in the case of Halophila nipponica with short leaves of 2 to 3 cm,they were not exposed to the water even at low tide, so there was a limit to detection using drones. Theseresearch results are expected to be useful data for grasping the characteristics of a wide range of seagrass habitatsin other seas in the future.

AB  - The appearance of bronze wares and tools in humans' civilizational history is a revolutionary change because it was when metals appeared for the first time. Among the various bronze wares, there is also the bronze mirror with various forms of ‘rays of light   and murals of the Four Guardian Deities designed onto it. Most of the discussion on the culture of bronze ware up until now has been limited to the archaeological and cultural meanings of the artifacts and their relations to the history. However, there seems to be a need to open the philosophical and humanities prospects or horizons of the bronze mirror, which is quite different from the debate thus far.But what's important is to read the "language of painting" with regard to the paintings and patterns designed on the bronze mirror, which is a milestone provided by M. Heidegger and H. Rombach. Hence, in this paper, their phenomenology will be adopted as the methodology.For example, Heidegger reveals what a pair of shoes of rural women really means and what they exist as through Van Gogh’s Shoes But in this artwork of Van Gogh the farmer’s shoes reveal the truth of the existence on their own. So to speak, Heidegger is stating the fact that this tool called the farmer’s shoes is revealing the non-concealment of its existence "as it is(die Sachen selbst)", without the need to engage with any epistemology or aesthetic theory.This provides us with clues to understanding the bronze mirror of the Four Guardian Deities. It is easily inferred by anyone that the Four Guardian Deities designed on the bronze mirror are transcendental beings who protect and look after the four cardinal directions, which is clear from the way they are referred to as the Guardian Deities or the Deities of All Directions. In other words, the bronze mirror of the Four Guardian Deities has been revealing that it was assigned the role to safeguard and look after all four directions on its own. At the time of the creation of the bronze mirror, there was a philosophical worldview established to protect and look after the four directions (the whole worlds) through such transcendental beings. When one realizes that there is a clear difference between the philosophical worldview of care and protection handed down from the pre-historic times and the dialectical worldview universalized in the West, which was handed down from Heraclitus in Ancient Greece and blossomed in Hegel, with war and struggle(Πόλεμος) as its basic premise, one can witness the significant philosophical depth of the former.

AB  - By proposing the ‘living (called Salim)’ of Koh Jeong-hee (1948-1991) and reviewing the people revealed in her later poems, this study intends to verify how the popular consciousness of ‘living’ on Koh Jeong-hee is revealed in the final stage of her poems. It aims to find a significant point about the people as a monolithic integration with three keywords: people, women, and Christianity by avoiding the conventional method of analysis while examining the popular consciousness of ‘living’ that has not been submitted. In the 1980s, her focus on “Another Culture”, her activities for The Women’s Newspaper and poetic activities were read around the keywords and the situation in which she tried to monopolize her poetry in a feminist manner, resulting in her public consciousness not being read from a holistic perspective. The people’s consciousness of Koh Joeng-hee was born in Hae-nam, a Christian ground and the site of the people, and later changed to a landscape while studying Anh Byoung- moo and Seo Nam-dong of Hanshin University and the Korean Theological Research Institute and Han Wan-sang and Kim Ji-ha.Koh Jeong-hee’s ‘living’ consciousness was directly or indirectly influenced by her teacher Anh Byoung-moo. The problem consciousness is shared in that the main spirit of Anh Byoung-moo’s household consciousness is based on Kim Ji-ha’s thoughts. Koh Jeong-hee examines Anh Byoung-moo’s Christian worldview and his ‘living’ consciousness, suggesting the direction to which the people will move, and discovers the chronic class order located inside the female people. In addition, Koh Jeong-hee identifies the spirit of living through Kim Ji-ha’s ‘Rice’ (Bob) and ‘Life Spirit’, and identifies the current status of the female people and female literary people in parentheses. Through this, she moves forward with a bold attitude as a female literary person. The poetry works and traces of life shown in her latter years are the essence and essence of the spirit of living.Given that female people’s consciousness of Koh Jeong-hee was completed by reviewing ‘living’ and people’s consciousness of Kim Ji-ha, she reviewed Kim Ji-ha and Ahn Byoung-moo’s ‘living’ and people to see at what level they were adjacent and separated from theirs. Kim Ji-ha and Anh Byoung-moo’s life is explained by a Christian worldview, and she recalled that the history of death and killing was not an individual death event but a people’s event, and considered ‘living’ by saying that death became a seed and moved the people to the subject. Koh Jeong-hee reviewed Kim Ji-ha and Anh Byoung-moo to find the absence of female citizens in their people, and found that there was a problem with the immediate attitude of female citizens in addition to the actual social and political context. Therefore, looking at ‘living’ on the three steps of Kim Ji-ha, Anh Byoung-moo, and Koh Jeong-hee is to see how their ‘living’ consciousness embodies Koh Jeong-hee’s “people” and to integrate Koh Jung-hee’s Christianity, people, and women.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to examine Koh's poetic practice by looking inside and outside the 70s and 80s, and especially Koh's unique method against ‘Gukpung81’, which seeks to erase the May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement. As a research method, I will look for the secularization of Hanshin University and the Christian world those days, then look at Koh's method of fighting against the ‘Gukpung81’ through the work of Aleida Assmann. The research has mainly focused on the Christian worldview, on the people and on women's liberation although she is regarded as a unique poet who remembers the May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement. A year after the May 18th Gwangju Democratization Movement in 1980, the state hosted ‘Gukpung81’ and prevented the concentration of the 5․18 Gwangju Democratization Movement memorial ceremony. ‘Gukpung 81’ was a national ‘festival’ with a hidden political purpose. As a result of the study, Koh laid the foundation for the‘remembering method’of the May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement in the way the state erases collective memories. Since then, the literary and cultural circles have recalled the 5․18 memories for various methods, and have not only become monuments of cultural and literary memories, but also play a pivotal role in collective memory. A comparative discussion on the memory recall method and embossing of memories between the literary and cultural circles will be left for future research.

AB  - This study analyzes the characteristics of the stories of 29 sea-related tales selected from The Comprehensive Collection of Korean Folklore. The purpose of this study is to examine the ecological awareness of the narrative community. Due to the characteristics of tales transmitted orally, sea tales vividly contain the transmission group's perception of the sea and the community attitude toward the sea. Twenty-nine tales have different descriptions of the sea space and conflict situations, but the aspects of the stories can be classified into six themes based on similar motifs. As a result of the discussion, it was possible to confirm ecological lessons and messages in the narrative imagination of the sea.The sea space in the tale is a place that holds a sense of mystery that humans cannot bear to fathom. In the thoughts of humans imagining the sea, we can find clues to their attitude towards nature and ecological awareness to understand the order of nature. The motif that accounts for the largest number of stories in searelated tales is about the creation of the sea. From where a lot of water flowed in to create the space called the sea, we can guess the background of the creation of sea-related tales from human curiosity about the sea. In addition, the type and characteristics of stories were examined with six themes: the story of the disappearing sea, the story of getting rich at sea, the story of seeing a dead body in the sea, and the superstition about maritime activities.As for the ecological thought embedded in the story of the sea, first, it is to perceive the world as a monism. In the story of the creation and extinction of the sea, the sea and the land are not separated, and the boundary between humans and nature living in it also forms an organic worldview. Next, the tale of the sea tells of a way for humans to adapt to the order of nature as the ecological thinking that values all life equally is represented as a taboo on eating meat. This study's attempt to read ecological thinking in folktales is meaningful in that it presents a practical discourse to overcome the ecological crisis..

AB  - This paper is a case of philosophical practice for a Christian. After the death of her husband, who lived as an irreligious person, the counselee in this case suffered a mental conflict and suffered because of the selective worldview of salvation that she accepted as heaven and hell. To solve this problem, I introduced Cohen's philosophical antidote idea of Logic-Based Therapy as a method of philosophical practice, and tried to use the thought experiment of Pascal's wager as the antidote.To find a philosophical antidote suitable for the counselee's case, theological perspectives such as the Catholic doctrine of purgatory and universalism of J. Moltmann was sought, but she accepted Pascal's wager. Their options were constructed according to the counselee's worldview, and then she could look back on her worldview, understand it more deeply, and be provided with an opportunity for healing.Pascal's wager originally contains several philosophical issues, but when used in philosophical practice, the counselee's conflicts and problem situations can be arranged or reviewed, and the result can be intuitively understood according to the choice. It is expected that this can be used in various philosophical practice situations.

TI  - Axillary lymph node "bubbly" calcifications and body tattoo: A case series and proposed algorithm to minimize lymph node biopsies.
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The presence of mammographically evident hyperdense foci within axillary lymph nodes elicits concern for calcium deposits, which in turn have a wide differential diagnosis including both benign and malignant entities. Tissue sampling, most commonly by way of image-guided core needle biopsy, is needed in many cases when a definite etiology cannot be clinically established. In this case series we present history, imaging findings, and pathology results (or long term follow-up stability as biopsy surrogate) of several women with body tattoos who at mammography were noted to have a characteristic pattern of "bubbly" pseudo-calcifications within axillary lymph nodes, and absence of other mammographic, sonographic and clinical abnormalities.

AB  - Earth Observation data is often used for land cover classification or change monitoring. It is rarely used for both goals in a single algorithm. The multi-change Cumulative Sum (CuSum) algorithm proposed in this study allows both classification and change monitoring in a single algorithm using Sentinel-1 C-SAR time series. The multi-change CuSum approach allowed to classify pixels belonging to the fused non-forest vegetation and bare soil classes apart from the pixels belonging to new cuts. The distinction of each class is better made using the two polarizations: VV is more accurate for detecting non-forest vegetation (Kappa coefficient of 0.62) and VH for detecting new cuts (Kappa coefficient of 0.65). The algorithm showed an accuracy up to 0.82.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper argues that Won Buddhism, which has generally been discussed in the category of “new religions,” in fact provides an innovative modern ethics capable of reforming our political and economic behavior. This distinguishes it from other new religions, which adhere to traditional moral principles. The first step in the argument interprets the “Dependent Origination” (緣起) of Buddhism as “Beneficence” (恩). In this way Won Buddhism avoids the pessimistic connotations of Buddhism and also presents a universal interpretation which allows friendly relations to be established between individuals without the intervention of transcendent beings. Next, I argue that unlike other new religions, which set up knowledge and morality in opposition, Won Buddhism advocates a knowledge-oriented social order in which the acquisition of knowledge is the foundation for a truly moral life. In addition, while other new religions aim to reform society, including modern Western civilization, Won Buddhism accepts that reform has already begun through the very fact of modern Western civilization. In other words, Won Buddhism understands the achievements of Western civilization as a fundamental aspect of reform, and interprets jariita (自利利他) as the cooperative division of labor required for mutually beneficial economic interdependence. Indeed, in Won Buddhism sound economic activity is one of several essential disciplines, together with correct knowledge, and a spiritual attitude which fosters a grateful mind and transcends the distinction between self and others. In this way, Won Buddhism rationally organizes everyday life as a training experience, so that the acquisition of logical and practical knowledge facilitates participation in a chain of gratitude, by working conscientiously in each position. Thus, Won Buddhism provides a worldview in which daily labor is integral to moral life, rather than relying on an extrinsic moral code derived from a particular metaphysical approach. In conclusion, this paper argues that Won Buddhism morally justifies the pursuit of material and scientific knowledge which underpins the global trend toward modernization, but Won Buddhism remains distinct from purely capitalist ideologies in emphasizing boeun (social benefits) instead of individual ownership.

AB  - This paper analyzes how kinship and related mentalities existed during 1950s in Imsil County, Jeonbuk Province, through Diary of Samgye. The diary shows that there were very strong Confucian patrilineal system and mentalities in Imsil County during the 1950s. In these mentalities, father as the legal head of family is the center of his family. He represented the family, controlled and managed his family, continued his ancestors’ linage, and mediated his family to his clan. Mother, in contrast, was described as the warm carer of family members, especially children, as the person who do domestic works, but no continuation of ancestors. Thus, she was a spiritual outsider.The writer of the diary described not his place where he lived but the place of Big House(큰집, the house of his elder father) where his close patrilineal relatives were living and the tombs of close patrilineal ancestors were located nearby as his home-village(고향). The mentalities of home-village was not based on the place where he was born or raised, but on the place where his patrilineal identity is located. It also shows the perspective that he is an integral part of the patrilineal lineage and this patrilineal community is the central site of his worldview.In his diary, the description of matrilineal relatives is very scarce. Only one or two times, his mother’s father, his mother’s sister’s daughter, his mother’s brother’s daughter and son were mentioned. On the contrary, almost all description on relatives focused on patrilineal relatives. The diary mentioned ancestors very often upto the fifteenth generation of ancestors in patrilineal side. But no ancestors except his mother’s father in matrilineal side and none in his wife’s side. In patrilineal side, he mentioned many distant relatives as big-father(대부), big-mother(대모), or uncle(아저씨). They are distant patrilineal relatives but higher-up in generation of kinship tree. He participated very often in various patrilineal ancestral rituals at home, at tombs, and at shrine, but rarely in matrilineal or wife’s sides. It shows that he was living with very strong patrilineal and patriarchal mentalities.But his diary also shows some seeds for the change of his patrilineal mentalities. When there were some conflicts with his patrilineal kin, he raised questions about whether his close relationship and dependence on patrilineal relatives is valid or not.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to trace the evolution of the relationship between A.S. Pushkin and F.R. de Chateaubriand. The issue of Chateaubriand's influence on Russian literature and Pushkin's creation and worldview in the first half of the 19th century has received much attention in academia, but has yet to be fully resolved. Above all, since research on the relationship of influence is mainly focused on the specific period (the 1920s or 1930s) of Pushkin's creation, it lacks a global perspective and there are still many controversial points on the theme. Moreover, the problem of the direct influence of Chateaubriand on Pouchkine is not easy to approach because the influence of Byron is interposed between these two poets.In view of this, rather than examining in depth a specific topic or making new statements, this article presents the studies and discussions that have taken place so far on Pushkin's reception of Chateaubriand through his literary and critical works, such as Evgeny Onegin, the Southern epic and the critique on the traudition of Milton's Lost Paradise by Chateaubriand. Through this study, we we were able to notice that Pushkin took as his vocation the establishment of modern national literature just like Chateaubriand and that he made Chateaubriand a model in the realization of this vocation.

AB  - This article examines the thoughts of Ahn Jae-hong, who was active in Japanese colonial era and the liberation regime. The characteristics and arguments of Ahn Jae-hong's thought can be summarized as follows.First, it constitutes the philosophy of the Korean people by paying attention to the meaning contained in native words.Second, it finds the 'eternal life' of the Korean people in Gojoseon's culture and language.Third, the Taegeuk(Taiji) thought and logic of Yijing are common international cultural elements and are very consistent with the Korean people's worldview.Fourth, the ideology of 'Bulhamdo' and 'Dasari' is a unique national philosophy, and this has universality that can be applied to modern times.Fifth, people are pre-state beings ahead of any political ideology, and  nationalism as such humanism cannot be neutralized.Sixth, liberalism and socialism, centered on nationalism, should be mutually integrated.Seventh, the national culture of the world can develop and move forward by interacting with each other.His idea that individual ethnic groups and the world should communicate with each other and grow together suggests the direction in which Korea should move today.

TI  - Sensitivity of Multifrequency Polarimetric SAR Data to Postfire Permafrost Changes and Recovery Processes in Arctic Tundra
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We used full-polarimetric L-band and P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected from the recent NASA Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) airborne campaign and Sentinel-1 C-band dual-polarization data to understand the sensitivity of radar backscatter intensity and phase to fire-induced changes in the surface and subsurface soil processes in Arctic tundra underlain by permafrost. The 2007 Anaktuvuk River fire on the Alaska North Slope was used as a case study. At similar to 10-year postfire, we observed a strong increase (>similar to 3-4 dB) in the low-frequency radar backscatter in severely burned areas during the thaw season, in contrast to limited (<similar to 0.5 dB) C-band backscatter differences (VV and VH) between burned and unburned areas. However, C-band winter backscatter is generally higher (>1 dB) in burned areas than the adjacent unburned areas. Polarimetric decomposition analysis indicated a general trend toward more random surface scattering, and strong increases in double-bounce scattering and volume scattering power at both P- and L-band in the burned areas. The ice-rich yedoma region shows the largest backscatter increases in burned areas and the highest correlation with burn severity and microtopography changes. The above backscatter changes are attributed to increasing surface roughness and microtopography due to ice-wedge degradation and thermokarst development and increasing subsurface scattering due to an overall drier and deeper active layer in burned areas. Among all frequencies, P-band shows consistently larger contrast in backscatter power and phase between burned and unburned areas, which makes it potentially more useful to study fire-permafrost interactions in the Arctic over decadal time scales.

T2  - GEOMATIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change due to global warming causes irregularity in precipitation and temperature. For this reason, rapid changes occur in coastal areas, which are of great socioeconomic importance on a global scale. One of the methods used to monitor long-term changes in coastal areas is the remote sensing method. Thanks to the Landsat satellite mission provided by NASA and USGS, regular multispectral data can be obtained from the 1970s to the present. Thanks to the DSAS tool, which is also developed by NASA and can be used via ArcGIS software, the changes of the coastlines between different dates can be monitored and the amount of change can be analyzed statistically. In this study, the changes in the coastal areas of Marmara Lake, which is an alluvial barrier lake within the borders of Manisa province, were examined in 5-year periods between 1985 and 2020. The shoreline was drawn from 8 Landsat data using MNDWI and object-based classification method. Erosion and accretion amounts were determined by DSAS on the extracted coastline and analyzed with statistical methods (EPR and LRR). Result of the study, correlation values between EPR and LRR according to R-2 and Pearson's r method were calculated as 94% and 97%, respectively.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes on the West-South shore of the Sea of Marmara in Silivri near Istanbul using remotely sensed data (Landsat images) and geographic information systems. The percent of LU/LC types has been calculated by using of geographic information systems. The results of the satellite based on land cover classes have been accomplished matched with the CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) database. In this study, land use/land cover changes concerning 2018 have been analysed and compared to previous data of LU/LC changes concerning 1987 and 2000 in Silivri. Satellite images from 1987, 2000, and 2018 were monitored and used to determine the multi-temporal changes in the same area. The study reports changes of land use/land cover over 13 + 18 = 31 years period (1987-2000-2018) in Silivri District, West-South part of Istanbul, Turkey. The study results indicate that increases due to 'artificial surfaces' land use will affect negatively the agricultural lands, forest and natural grasslands. Finally, the artificial surfaces reached to approximately 53% of study area in 2018. Population and populated areas expanded in parallel with the expansion in industrial areas and the construction of the motorway. Urban fabric area reached to 19% in 2018 and it shows a continuous increase. As a result, this study will form an important basis for the planning of the region based on ecological and sustainable planning principles, by following the alteration in LU/LC as multi-temporal.

TI  - Evolutions of 30-Year Spatio-Temporal Distribution and Influencing Factors of <i>Suaeda salsa</i> in Bohai Bay, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall. (S. salsa) acts as a pioneer species in coastal wetlands due to its high salt tolerance. It has significant biodiversity maintenance, socioeconomic values (e.g., tourism) due to its vibrant color, and carbon sequestration (blue carbon). Bohai Bay region, the mainly distributed area of S. salsa, is an economic intensive region with the largest economic aggregate and population in northern China. The coastal wetland is one of the most vulnerable ecosystems with the urbanization and economic developments. S. salsa in Bohai Bay has been changed significantly due to several threats to its habitat in past decades. In this paper, we analyzed all available archived Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images of the Bohai Bay region by using a decision tree algorithm method based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to generate annual maps of S. salsa from 1990 to 2020 at a 30-m spatial resolution. The temporal-spatial dynamic changes in S. salsa were studied by landscape metric analysis. The influencing factors of S. salsa changes were analyzed based on principal component analysis (PCA) and a logistic regression model (LRM). The results showed that S. salsa was mainly distributed in three regions: the Liao River Delta (Liaoning Province), Yellow River Delta (Shandong Province), and Hai River Estuary (Hebei Province, Tianjin). During the past 31 years, the total area of S. salsa has dramatically decreased from 692.93 km(2) to 51.04 km(2), which means that 92.63% of the area of S. salsa in the Bohai Bay region was lost. In the 641.89 km(2) area of S. salsa that was lost, 348.80 km(2) of this area was converted to other anthropic land use categories, while 293.09 km(2) was degraded to bare land. The landscape fragmentation of S. salsa has gradually intensified since 1990. National Nature Reserves have played an important role in the restoration of suitable S. salsa habitats. The analysis results for the natural influencing factors indicated that precipitation, temperature, elevation, and distance to the coastline were considered to be the major influencing factors for S. salsa changes. The results are valuable for monitoring the dynamic changes of S. salsa and can be used as effective factors for the restoration of S. salsa in coastal wetlands.

AB  - In this study, the eigenvector-based polarimetric feature extraction methods are analyzed based on the target dichotomy decomposition. The eigenvector-based scattering characterization methods, including the alpha/beta scattering model, Touzi's scattering model, and a recently developed scattering vector parameterization model, are applied to the single scattering matrix decomposed by the stable Huynen decomposition, i.e., Yang's decomposition. Experiments are performed on RADARSAT-2 data acquired over an oil spill area, where several scattering behaviors are presented such as backscatter from ships and the metallic target, ocean surface, oil slicks, and the multiple reflections between ships and ocean surface. Results show that the dichotomy decomposition-based scattering vector parameters are effective in characterizing the dominant scattering mechanism of targets.

TI  - High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation via Multiscale Context and Linear Self-Attention
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image semantic segmentation, which aims to realize pixel-level classification according to the content of remote sensing images, has broad applications in various fields. Thanks to the superiority of deep learning (DL), the semantic segmentation model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) dramatically promotes the development of remote sensing image semantic segmentation. Due to the high resolution, comprehensive coverage, extensive data, and sizeable spectral difference of high-resolution remote sensing images (HRRSI), the existing GPU is not suitable for directly semantic segmentation of the whole image. Cutting the image into small patches will lead to the loss of context information, resulting in the decline of accuracy. To address this issue, we propose the multiscale context self-attention network (MSCSANet). It combines the benefits of the self-attention mechanism with CNN to improve the segmentation quality of various remote sensing images. The MSCSANet extracts multiscale features from multiscale context images to solve the problem of feature loss caused by image segmentation. In addition, in order to make use of the feature of large-scale context, the multiscale context patches are used to guide the local image patch to focus on different fine-grained objects to enhance the feature of the local image patch. Moreover, considering the limited computing resources, we designed a linear self-attention module to reduce the computational complexity. Compared with other DL models, our proposed model can enhance the ability of multiscale features in complex scenes, and realizes improvements of 1.56% mean intersection over union (MIoU) on the Gaofen Image Dataset and 1.93% MIoU on the ISPRS Potsdam Dataset, respectively.

TI  - Fundamental Definition of Two-Stream Approximation for Radiative Transfer in Scattering Atmosphere
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The two-stream approximation (TSA) is a primary method for tackling radiative transfer in a scattering atmosphere, which has wide applications in radiation balance evaluation, atmospheric simulation, and remote sensing data assimilation. This article defines fundamental TSA (F-TSA) by introducing the TSA conversion function, which reveals the causal characteristics of various existing specific TSA (S-TSA) models. The unified diffuse irradiance equations and their solutions are obtained based on F-TSA. The properties of the conversion function and the coefficients of irradiance equations are analyzed. It is proven that the weighted average of different conversion functions is also a conversion function. The specified conversion functions and scattering phase function treatments of six existing and four newly proposed S-TSA models are described. These S-TSA models and their typical combinations are evaluated and compared for incident lights from different directions and atmospheric layers with different optical depths. The main results are: 1) the accuracy of an S-TSA model depends on which one of transmissivity and reflectivity is concerned, and is affected by multiple factors such as the specified conversion function, the phase function processing, the single scattering albedo, the optical depth, and the direction of incident light; 2) the proper combination of different S-TSA models can improve the TSA accuracy significantly, and both the delta function and phase function B models combined with the modified Eddington model are recommended; and 3) applying proper combined S-TSA models instead of the delta transformed S-TSA models to calculate radiation flux may be beneficial.

TI  - Automatic Framework of Mapping Impervious Surface Growth With Long-Term Landsat Imagery Based on Temporal Deep Learning Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impervious surface (IS) cover and its dynamics are key parameters in research about urban and ecology. This letter proposed an automatic framework to map the IS growth end-to-end based on the temporal deep learning (DL) model and long time-series Landsat imagery. First, the training and validating datasets were auto-generated by a joint strategy. Then, a DL network was designed, and the IS growth was predicted in temporal windows. Finally, the results from multi-temporal windows are combined to generate the IS growth map. The data around the core of Beijing, China, is tested, and the result shows that the proposed method could: 1) efficiently model the IS growth; 2) map IS growth with less salt-and-pepper noise and false alarm compared to existing products; and 3) be extended to future data easily.

TI  - Internal Tides and Their Intraseasonal Variability on the Continental Slope Northeast of Taiwan Island Derived from Mooring Observations and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, strong internal tides were observed on the continental slope northeast of Taiwan Island. Owing to the lack of long-term observations, these tides' intraseasonal variability and the impact of the Kuroshio Current remain unclear. This study aimed to fill in the gaps using one-year continuous mooring observations, satellite data and analysis data. The horizontal kinetic energy (HKE) of semidiurnal internal tides showed that there was conspicuous energy from 100 days to 200 days, which was mainly attributed to the cross-term of HKE. The impact of the Kuroshio Current and mesoscale eddies on the HKEs were assessed: Cyclonic (anticyclonic) mesoscale eddies propagated from the open ocean, weakened (strengthened) the Kuroshio and shifted the Kuroshio onshore (offshore) northeast of Taiwan Island. The weakened (strengthened) Kuroshio increased (decreased) the shoreward velocity at the mooring site, and the onshore (offshore) Kuroshio migration increased (decreased) the northeastward velocity and enhanced (weakened) the HKEs of internal tides by modulating the tidal energy horizontal propagation. The weakened (strengthened) Kuroshio also resulted in gentler (steeper) isopycnals across the slope and enhanced (weakened) the HKEs of internal tides by influencing the interaction between ocean stratification and bottom topography.

TI  - Quantifying Uncertainty in Downscaling of Seismic Data to High-Resolution 3-D Lithological Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building high-resolution lithological models using seismic data can facilitate decision-makings for earth resources development, but they are subject to considerable uncertainties due to the limited seismic resolution. Traditionally, high-resolution lithological models are built deterministically or stochastic simulation is performed using seismic as "soft data" in geostatistical contexts. Many approaches have been developed to do the above, but in this work, we explicitly account for the uncertain relationship between seismic data and lithological models. We introduce a data-driven Bayesian approach to first quantify soft data uncertainty by generating multiple lithology proportions from seismic. The spatial lithology proportion uncertainty arises from the uncertain relationship between low-resolution seismic and lithology proportions. We quantify this proportion uncertainty by learning the statistical relationships with seismic using high-resolution borehole data. Once conditioning the statistical relationships to observed seismic, we can generate multiple realizations of spatial proportions. With the generated proportions as volume averages, a sequential indicator simulation (SISim) is then performed to build high-resolution lithofacies models. This approach is applied to a real channelized turbidite system with four lithofacies. We demonstrate that the generated high-resolution lithological models can preserve the global uncertainties captured by proportion trends while locally matching borehole observations. When compared with the conventional approaches that use deterministic soft data, our statistical learning approach avoids the problem of underestimating reservoir model uncertainty. More importantly, the lithofacies models from the proposed method are less likely to be falsified by observed data. Additionally, an open-source Python library for the uncertainty quantification is provided.

TI  - A Cascaded Spectral-Spatial CNN Model for Super-Resolution River Mapping With MODIS Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are important elements of the earth's ecosystem, and their spatial distribution information is critical for the study of hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery has been widely used for river mapping due to its high temporal resolution and long-term observation records, which are essential to capture the rapid fluctuation of rivers. However, when the conventional hard classification methods are used, the accuracy of the river maps produced from MODIS data (and especially for those rivers with narrow widths) is often limited because mixed pixels are common in MODIS imagery, due to coarse spatial resolution. In this article, a cascaded spectral-spatial information combined deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for super-resolution river mapping (DeepRivSRM) is proposed to produce Landsat-like fine-resolution river maps from MODIS images. In DeepRivSRM, a CNN made up of a spectral unmixing module and a super-resolution mapping (SRM) module is introduced to handle the spectral and spatial information simultaneously. Moreover, for training the DeepRivSRM model, an adaptive cross-entropy loss function incorporating the fraction information of the rivers is designed to improve the performance of the DeepRivSRM model for small rivers. The proposed method was evaluated with MODIS images from three test sites and was compared with hard classification, a conventional SRM method, and a CNN-based SRM (SRMCNN) method. The results show that DeepRivSRM can generate more accurate river maps by effectively learning the subpixel-scale spatial-spectral information in MODIS imagery.

AB  - With video satellites coming into service, it is convenient to obtain video satellite imagery with continuous angles for dynamic observation of the Earth. Compared to traditional remote sensing data, satellite video data shows advantages over land cover classification because of extra angular information. However, most of existing deep learning based remote sensing classification methods were proposed for hyperspectral image classification. These models do not perform as good as expected in satellite video data classification because they do not take the extra dimension into consideration. To tackle this problem, a novel height attention network is proposed to improve the satellite video data classification performance. In particular, the 4D convolution is employed to jointly capture angular-spectral-spatial features. Furthermore, a height attention module is used to extract the discriminative height features after principal component analysis. The experiment results on real video data sets demonstrate that the proposed model perform competitive classification results with shorter training time.

TI  - Breaking Limits of Remote Sensing by Deep Learning From Simulated Data for Flood and Debris-Flow Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a framework that estimates the inundation depth (maximum water level) and debris-flow-induced topographic deformation from remote sensing imagery by integrating deep learning and numerical simulation. A water and debris-flow simulator generates training data for various artificial disaster scenarios. We show that regression models based on Attention U-Net and LinkNet architectures trained on such synthetic data can predict the maximum water level and topographic deformation from a remote sensing-derived change detection map and a digital elevation model. The proposed framework has an inpainting capability, thus mitigating the false negatives that are inevitable in remote sensing image analysis. Our framework breaks limits of remote sensing and enables rapid estimation of inundation depth and topographic deformation, essential information for emergency response, including rescue and relief activities. We conduct experiments with both synthetic and real data for two disaster events that caused simultaneous flooding and debris flows and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach quantitatively and qualitatively. Our code and data sets are available at https://github.com/nyokoya/dlsim.

AB  - The windbreak forests called as "Igune" are planted in the surroundings of farmers' dwellings, in several flat agricultural regions, mainly in the Tohoku region of Japan. They bring many benefits to the rural society, but require maintenance. Satellite remote sensing data are useful for the scientific assessment of Igune, because they have a wid geographical distribution. In this study, a method to analyze SPOT 6 data obtained in early May by K-means clustering is proposed. A dataset based on the multispectral image combined with vegetation indices, a dataset based on the multispectral image combined with texture features, and a dataset based on the pan-sharpened image combined with texture features, were analyzed and compared. The optimum number of clusters was determined to be seven by experimental analysis. To extract an Igune with an area of less than 500 m(2), pan-sharpened images, combined with efficient texture features, are suitable. Further, the multispectral image, combined with the vegetation indices, is suitable for extracting Igune with areas more than 500 m(2). Therefore, SPOT 6 data are expected to be useful for assessing the distribution of Igune.

AB  - Val Plumwood(1939~2008) was an Australian leading ecological philosopher who criticized the dominant view of dualism and the human-centered worldview at the root of Western culture. In particular, Plumwood found the possibility of overcoming the harmful effects of the chronic material/ spirituality dichotomy of Western culture in animism captured in the religious culture and lifestyle of Aboriginal Australians. Plumwood’s philosophical animism reminds us that the world is not a human arena and that other non-human actors are forming complex networks, and asks us to establish conversational relationships with various actors in the world .In this paper, I analyze the ‘Philosophical Animism’ proposed by Val Plumwood focusing on the “materialist spirituality of place”, and examine the meaning of her discussion to us living in an era of ecological crisis.In Chapter II, under the title of ‘Return of the non-human’, Plumwood's Philosophical Animism is compared with the discussion of ‘Old Animism’ from a modern perspective and the ‘New Animism’. Chapter III examines Plumwood's discussion of the ‘materiality’ shared by the human and nonhuman worlds, under the premise of ‘materialistic spirituality’ to overthrow deep-rooted dualistic thinking. In particular, I examine the characteristics and utility of Plumwood's strategy of focusing discussions on the ‘natural world’, unlike the general trend of New Materialisms that blurs the boundary between nature and culture, emphasizing the actor's powerful influence in this world. Chapter IV examines the relationship between human and non-human nature in Plumwood’s works, focusing on the concept of death and food, and pays attention to the differentiation of Plumwood's discussion compared to the deep ecologist Arnes Naess. Chapter V attempts to interpret Plumwood's discussion emphasizing the connection with the place in terms of understanding the capitalist world.

AB  - Building information is essential for various urban spatial analyses. For this reason, continuous building monitoring is required, but it is a subject with many practical difficulties. To this end, research is being conducted to extract buildings from satellite images that can be continuously observed over a wide area. Recently, deep learning-based semantic segmentation techniques have been used. In this study, a part of the structure of the context-based ResU-Net was modified, and training was conducted to automatically extract a building from a 30 cm Worldview-3 RGB image using SpaceNet’s building v2 free open data. As a result of the classification accuracy evaluation, the f1-score, which was higher than the classification accuracy of the 2nd SpaceNet competition winners. Therefore, if Worldview-3 satellite imagery can be continuously provided, it will be possible to use the building extraction results of this study to generate an automatic model of building around the world.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the cases and characteristics of each collaboration type of Zepeto, a metaverse platform. The research method was theoretically reviewed by referring to previous papers, books, and websites on Metaverse, Zepeto, and collaboration cases centered on fashion items conducted from 2018 to 2022 were collected and analyzed. Zepeto is becoming a playground for generation Z where various community activities, games, and SNS can be played in a digital virtual space with avatars that combine AR and VR technologies. In addition, users can become creators and engage in economic activities that produce and sell fashion items themselves. Examples of Zepeto's collaboration type are as follows. First, through collaboration with fashion companies, luxury fashion brands allowed users to experience the brand's sensibility and worldview through virtual collections and interactive experiences and events in digital space.It is also receiving great response for selling luxury fashion items at a much lower price than in reality. Second, collaboration with entertainment companies hosts digital concert, music video, and fan signing events in the non-face-to-face era caused by COVID-19, and communication between famous stars and fans centered on K-pop idol groups is taking place. In addition, fun and creative fashion items that applied animation, webtoon, drama, and game characters were released. Third, collaboration with heterogeneous companies emphasized the friendly and innovative image of the brand by introducing virtual stores, uniforms, and new products such as convenience stores, coffee, and IT companies. The characteristics of Zepeto collaboration were first shown as interactive experiences, secondly, the realization of playful fantasy, and thirdly, the pursuit of discriminatory scarcity. The research results are expected to be helpful as reference materials for the domestic fashion industry and education field in the era of the fourth industry.

AB  - The occult movie, which started in the West, deals with invisible fear. In Korea, a new Korean occult films were formed by combining the customs of horror films centered on "Yeo-Gui" (revengeful female ghost) and the genre formula of occult films.The Korean occult films have not only features Yeo-Gui appearing, but also features a shaman of shamanism instead of a Western priest to solve the problem, and a paradigm of resentment and revenge that is the basis of shamanism.However, the representative works of occult films released in the 2010s, <Sbaha> and <The Walling>, are characteristic in that they do not follow the existing formula and customs of the Korean occult films’ narrative, but transform and abalone.Therefore, analyzing the elements of these variations and abalones was the subject of this study. As a result of the study, in the movie <Sabaha>, shamanic elements appeared in the opening, but did not affect the problem-solving, and it was found that some of the Yeo-Gui images and revenge mechanisms still exist. In the movie <The Wailing>, shamanic elements appear as important subjects throughout the movie, but in terms of theme, they are based on a Christian worldview, and the Yeo-Gui is a modified image, and no revenge mechanism appears at all. Through this, it is possible to discover the evolution of new Korean occult films.

AB  - We present a novel approach for modeling streamflow in ungauged catchments. Because of their widespread availability and global coverage, remotely sensed data provide an attractive alternative to supplement the absence of streamflow data in hydrological model calibration. One observable signal holds particular appeal; the satellite-derived calibration ratio-measurement (C/M ratio) has been widely studied as a direct measurement of streamflow because of its physical relationship to streamflow and demonstrated correlation with in situ streamflow. This study identifies the challenges in calibrating a hydrological model using a satellite-derived C/M ratio, presenting a rationale designed to account for the limitations that these data pose. A new Bayesian calibration approach is developed that uses the surrogate streamflow derived from the C/M ratio in place of direct streamflow observations. We assess and demonstrate our approach for three Australian Hydrologic Reference Stations, which can be considered free from anthropogenic effects, with distinct attributes. The results indicate the competency of the proposed approach, showing model performance with 0.54 similar to 0.78 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values, with the uncertainties in the model calibration quantified via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Overall, our study finds the new model calibration promising for predictions in ungauged basins (PUB), as the global data coverage of satellite data and the suitability of the approach suggest significant improvements over traditional approaches to PUB.

TI  - Multi-time Predictions of Wildfire Grid Map using Remote Sensing Local Data

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th IEEE International Conference on Knowledge Graph (ICKG)

AB  - Due to recent climate changes, we have seen more frequent and severe wildfires in the United States. Predicting wildfires is critical for natural disaster prevention and mitigation. Advances in technologies in data processing and communication enabled us to access remote sensing data. With the remote sensing data, valuable spatiotemporal statistical models can be created and used for resource management practices. This paper proposes a distributed learning framework that shares local data collected in ten locations in the western USA throughout the local agents. The local agents aim to predict wildfire grid maps one, two, three, and four weeks in advance while online processing the remote sensing data stream. The proposed model has distinct features that address the characteristic need in prediction evaluations, including dynamic online estimation and time-series modeling. Local fire event triggers are not isolated between locations, and there are confounding factors when local data is analyzed due to incomplete state observations. Compared to existing approaches that do not account for incomplete state observation within wildfire time-series data, on average, we can achieve higher prediction performance.

TI  - Appropriation of Critical Realism as an Antidote to Post-truth?: Revisiting Wentzel van Huyssteen's Postfoundational Rationality
TI  - 탈진실의 해독제로서 비판적 실재론의 차용?: 웬첼 반 휴이스틴의 후토대주의 합리성에 대한 재검토

AB  - Post-truth, which has emerged as a hot topic in our time, is an epistemological phenomenon resulting from the rapid spread and consumption of fake news and fabricated truth through fringe digital media in extraordinary circumstances such as terrorism, refugees, the corona pandemic, and climate crisis. In the context of the extraordinary epistemological crisis caused by post-truth, Wenzel van Huyssteen's postfoundationalism, which brought Roy Bhaska's critical realism into theological discourse, provides important insight as an alternative epistemology of theology.First, van Huyssteen, sharply criticizing the fideism of anti-foundational theology, which neutralizes the concept of rationality itself in Christian theology, breaks the ‘modern dichotomy about rationality’ and reconsiders the rationality of theology that is differentiated from natural science. Furthermore, he asserts that scientific and theological statements can be intertwined and overlapped through ‘rationality’.Third, van Huyssteen emphasizes the practical dimension for solving practical problems beyond the cognitive and evaluative dimension of rationality. Since rationality is inseparable from ‘humans’ who form and utilize beliefs and understandings, it is inevitably intertwined with the social and cultural contexts and multidimensional conditions of life in which ‘humans’ live. This pragmatic shift encourages the active participation of theology in practical issues such as the climate crisis.The theological use of critical realism attempted by van Huyssteen exposes the methodological limitations of the alternative theory, which seems to loosen the premises and doctrinal connections of the Christian worldview and lean toward the philosophy of science. Although critical realism is a 'hard-to-tune theory', it deserves to be considered as a possible epistemological alternative, especially in the post-truth era where the order, relationship, and boundaries of facts and values, truth and perception, and where cognitive biases based on fabricated facts and fake news spread like a virus.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to reflect on the discourse of the post-hu- manism era from the point of view of human nature and to suggest the direction of future education. Post-humanist discourse reflection was examined from three perspectives: human dignity, autonomy, and justice. In the case of human dignity, what criteria can be provided for judging whether a being is dignified? Deeper thought and discussion about the question was needed. In the case of freedom and autonomy, the freedom to improve human capacity must be guaranteed in a liberal society. However, on the contrary, it possibl that freedom and autonomy may be infringed by guaranteeing that freedom and autonomy. In the case of justice and fairness, there distinction between those who have digital access and those who do not need to discuss digital segmentation.Based on these discourses, the direction of future education is suggested. First, education on transcendence is necessary. Beyond the anthropocentric worldview, nature, ecosystems, and technologies that have been conquered must also be dealt with in the discourse of education. Second, systemic in- novation of education is necessary. Education should be conducted focusing on the required core competencies along with innovation of the relative evalu- ation system and entrance exam system centered on memorization. Third, post-human use ethics education is necessary. Justice needs to extend to a wide variety of non-human beings, and digital literacy is needed for everyone.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed to identify factors related to medication errors in hospitals, provide basic data for medication safety, and to provide evidence to develop an intervention program to prevent medication errors.Methods This cross-sectional descriptive study was using the 2021 patient safety report data released by Korea Institute for Healthcare Accreditation. Of the total of 13,146 patient safety incidents, 4,198 medication errors were used, excluding psychiatric hospitals, oriental medicine hospital, and missing data were excluded. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and multinominal logistic analysis were performed using SPSS 26.0 program.Results Factors affecting adverse events of medication errors were age, the place of occurrence and bed size.In addition, the factors influencing the sentinel event of medication error were the evening shift, the place of occurrence. Among the medication errors 70.4% (1,201) were near misses, 26.1%(445) were adverse events, and 3.5% (59) were sentinel events.Conclusions In order to prevent medication errors in medical institutions, factors that can affect medication errors by work department should be identified in various aspects, such as organizational, management, system, and human factors, and sufficient medical personnel, positive working environment, and medication safety system should be improved.

AB  - n the 14th and 15th centuries, there was a movement to put the English language, which had been firmly established as the first language, at the center and leading position of society. It was none other than the church that the English struggled the most. The purpose of this study is to examine and analyze the vocabulary he used in the English Bible, focusing on Wycliffe's English Bible, in order to examine the period of time on the English Bible for interpretation and translation studies. Therefore, by capturing the historical background, Wycliffe's worldview, the historical situation and his achievements when he translated the Latin Bible into the English Bible, and the lexical categories appearing in the Bible he translated into English were analyzed. It was discovered that many words appearing in the English Bible were derived from Wycliffe's translation, and many phrases commonly used in modern English were analyzed. This study confirmed the usefulness of the results of this study by analyzing the lexical contribution of Wycliffe's English Bible to modern society

TI  - Design of a High-Gain Single Circular Patch Radiator With a Cavity-Backed Structure Using Multiple SIW Feeders for Monopulse DF-Applications
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes the design of a gain enhanced single circular patch radiator (SCPR) with a cavity-backed structure using multiple substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) feeders for monopulse systems. We derive the equations of a radiation pattern for the multi-feed SCPR and compare it with the full EM simulation results. Based on the theoretical results, the proposed SCPR with multiple feeds is designed by adding the cavity-backed structure to obtain high gain characteristics. In the feeding network, four SIW structures are designed and circularly arranged, which can reduce loss and mutual coupling. Each pair of the SIW feeders can provide sum (Sigma) and difference (Delta) patterns to achieve the monopulse direction finding (DF) properties in both elevation and azimuth directions. To verify the feasibility, the proposed antenna is fabricated, and the antenna characteristics are measured. The measured reflection coefficient is -14.5 dB at 5.8 GHz, and the maximum gains are 4.9 dBi and 4.8 dBi in zy-plane. To observe the monopulse DF, the estimated direction of arrival (DOA) results are examined in both elevation and azimuth directions. In the whole estimated angle range, the estimation error is lower than 0.49, and the average error is 0.26.

AB  - PURPOSE This study analyzes the virtues of Non-cruelty and Pity in the Parrot Episode of Mahabharata and interprets whether a short animal fable is extended to the worldview of Yudhisthira. In particular, attention was paid to the fact that the virtue of Non-cruelty reduces social cruelty, and Pity suggests solidarity with social empathy.CONTENTS In the parrot episode dealt with in this study, those with Non-cruelty and the bhakti of devotion as a virtuous person, and their outstanding personality characteristics are defined as ‘Pity’. The reason Bhishma taught the parrot episode to Yudhisthira was that he wanted the relationship between the parrot and the tree to be extended and applied within the relationship between the king and the people. This aids Yudhisthira in establishing the standard for social dharma as a king through the parrot's exemplary case.RESULTS The parrot episode shows the wisdom of peace and happiness, living with Pity in the bond and relationship while taking the moral of Non-cruelty. This narrative examines that Mahabharata pursues a philosophy of consideration for the socially weak and an emotional ethics through two virtues.

AB  - This paper attempted to find out how the spirit of practical science's 'practical(實用)' and 'modernity(近代性)' is incorporated into Dasan's criminal ideology. idea of fertility. Therefore, in the sentence sentence, 'practical' is something that requires efforts to protect the basic human rights of the people and achieve judicial justice. Dasan pointed out the evils of Hyeongjeong and suggested improvement measures. Without such reform, it was considered that practical punishment and the execution of correct punishment would be a long way off. At the same time, he also thought about fostering experts at the Hyeongjeongmun, which was neglected at the time. However, his plan did not come true. This is because his ideas were not reflected in real politics because he was far from central politics. This is also the same reason why the ideas of practical scholars at the time were not properly reflected in the policy. However, it can be said that the concerns and efforts of a real scholar who lived on the land of Joseon in the late 18th and early 19th centuries are very meaningful in Korean criminal history.The era when Dasan lived was set as a modern transition period, but it was still a society with a strong Neo-Confucian ruling order. Dasan is evaluated as a person who founded the ideology of modernity in that he presented the horizon of a new worldview that is fundamentally opposed to it. The modern and pre-modern standards in the criminal government will be indicators of how much interest they have paid to human rights and what efforts they have made to protect them better. Dasan proposed an unreasonable improvement of the criminal justice system at the time and a plan to protect prisoners in a poor environment in prison, and maintained the position of criminal justice, which is the basis of modern criminal law. In addition, the contradiction between the eradication of torture and the association system was pointed out and the unfairness was requested to be improved. This argument became the vanguard of the first Gabo Reform, which included the abolition of the association system, which will bear fruit in the future, and the eradication of torture, which is also proclaimed in our constitution today, has already begun with Dasan. Despite the strong Neo-Confucian order, Dasan had a lot of interest in human rights and worked hard to overcome the social contradictions and protect human rights better. These efforts, Dasan himself did not know what the meaning of "modern" meant, but the basis of modernity was being angry in his criminal thought.

AB  - A base center for this study had established in Jeollabuk-do Province from Mar. to Nov. in 2020, and examined and monitored the pathogenic organs and the incidence frequency of infectious disease vectors, by collecting mosquitoes mediating such diseases, from cattle sheds (cowhouses) in Wanju County, Geumgang Estuary Bird Sanctuary as a migratory bird habitat in Gunsan City. There are total of seven urban areas in Jeonju City, with BG-sentinel traps and black light traps. The resulting number of the population collected was 14,195 (17 species, 7 genera). The highest number (9,006) of mosquitoes was found from cattle sheds in Wanju County, followed by the migratory bird habitat, and then, urban areas in Jeonju city . In all environments, Anopheles spp. (5,809, 40.9%) was most often collected, so it was thought to be dominant species. Each of dominant species by environments is as follows: Anopheles spp. in cattle sheds; Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Gunsan city and Culex pipiens pallens in urban areas. From Sep. to Oct., 23 individuals of Aedes linetopennis were collected from men’s rest rooms. The pathogenic organs were examined to show that the positive Japanese encephalitis viruses were found from one pool at cattle sheds in Wanju County. Quick and efficient measures may be developed, by verifying the incidence density of media, affected by the climate change in Jeollabuk-do Province and whether foreign media were introduced or not.

TI  - 백석의 기행시편과 역사적 상상력
T2  - Journal of korean Culture
M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to expand the scope of Baek Seok's travel poems and examine its historical meaning. He spent most of his life places away from home after starting his literary career. As such, the ‘experience of departing his home’ was revealed throughout his poems. Meanwhile, his poetry was based on the geographical recognition centered on Seoul. In this study, I examined the process by which the historical imagination in his poetry was penetrated and consolidated.First of all, this study verified that the 4th part of 'Deer' is the starting point of the travel poems of Baek Seok. Since he was a literary man entering the 7th year of his debut when he published 'Deer', it is not surprising that his poetry was already changing at that time. And next, this study revealed the fact that the world view of the 4th part of 'Deer' is gradually changing as it reaches a series of "Ham-Ju". The 1930s was a time when passion for national history was burning, and Baek Seok himself lived in Hamnam, the site of successive historical excavations. In addition, Baek Seok's poems during this period showed the expanded horizons of his hometown and his attachment to the lives of Koreans.Finally, I reviewed the reality of colonial Joseon that Baek Seok faced after returning to Seoul. In such a situation, his poems revealed the request for restoration of the denied national history, suggesting the origin of the return of 'the north'. When the total mobilization system put pressure on even the literary people, he left Joseon to Manchuria. However, he put the Joseon-centered worldview into his poetry by naming it ‘the north’, which has nothing to do with the puppet state established by the Japanese imperialists. His poetry showed the historical imagination by making the subject who witnessed the existence of the eternal history. In the last poem he left behind in South Korea, Baek Seok recites a positive outlook for the new reality after liberation from Japanese colonial rule.

AB  - This study aims to reveal the nature of the worldview of the so-called 'Osmanli' through the 17th century traveler Evliya Celebi's Book of Travels. As a travel writer born in Istanbul, Evliya Celebi travelled throughout the Ottoman Empire for over 40 years and wrote a ten-volume travel account, Seyahatname. It was composed of administrative and geographical informations that the writer directly observed and collected, customs, legends, and autobiographical stories of the writer himself, as well as anecdotes he experienced during the trip. This study aims to examine the life and biographical contents of Evliya Celebi through his work and furthermore tries to define the identity of the group to which he belongs. This is an attempt to deal with the self-portraits and perceptions of others who led the Ottoman society in the 17th century through supposing Evliya Celebi as a representative of Istanbul's elite group called 'Osmanli'.Evliya Celebi recognized himself as an elite of the Ottoman Empire and wrote Seyahatname as a monument to the Empire. The fact that this work shows his identity as a 'Servant of Istanbul' is revealed in the fact that he devoted the first volume of his work to describing aspects of his hometown Istanbul, unlike other travelogues. In particular, this paper deals with his perceptions of Christians and Shiites, assuming that the first volume acts as a reference in the recognition and understanding of some others in the Ottoman world in the rest of the work. In the world of Seyahatname, these others existed at different distances and dimensions depending on their relationship with Istanbul. Evliya Celebi’s descriptions of these people show his insight and perspective on the Ottoman world at the time in terms of emphasizing the role and importance of each of them as partners in imperial rule. It is also important in that it also reveals the identity and worldview shared by the Ottoman elite in the 17th century.

AB  - This paper analyzes mythemes in the Altaic creation myths. In the religious conception of the ancient Altai people, the supreme rulers of the trinary universe are Tengri, Erlik and Jer-su. In the pantheon of Altaic shamanism, Ulgen and Erlik act as demiurges. The structure of conflict between Ulgen and Erlik is an important motif in the Altaic mythology.The Altaic creation myths contain such various motifs as earth-diver creation and creation from noting. In all these myths, the confrontation of Ulgen and Erlik brings diversity to the world and complete the process of creation.Creation myths tell about the origin of death and the evil nature of man. There are also motifs of the Flood and the competition of the gods to decide who will be the creator.In Altaic mythology, Erlik appears as the devil. The confrontation between Ulgen and Erlik is the main motif in myths. Ulgen and Erlik express a binary opposition: light and dark, east and west, life and death, good and evil. Despite this, Ulgen and Erlik do not symbolize absolute good and absolute evil. They are in a complementary relationship. Their confrontation is creative. The worldview of Altaic mythology is based not on a binary opposite perception, but on an intergrative perception.

AB  - The Dirichlet Process based on Stick-Breaking (DPSB) model-based clustering algorithm was instigated to Hyperion remote sensing imagery to map alteration minerals related to porphyry copper deposit. The DPSB clustering results were evaluated using Normalized Information Distance (NID), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Modified adjusted Rand index (MARI) methods. Comparing the DPSB results with the geological map of the study area reveals the MARI of 0.2253, NMI of 0.1799 and MARI of 0.2253, respectively. To verify the extent of propylitic, argillic, advanced argillic, propylitic-argillic and sericite alteration zones associated with porphyry copper deposit, a total number of 24 rock samples were measured by a SVC XHR-1024i field portable spectroradiometer. Results derived from the DPSB model-based clustering algorithm show high accuracy in distinguishing propylitic, argillic, advanced argillic, propylitic-argillic and sericite alteration zones. It is advocated that the DPSB model-based clustering algorithm can be broadly implemented to hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing data for detecting alteration zones associated with porphyry mineralization systems in other metallogenic provinces around the world.

AB  - Snow is an essential element in surface climate studies. Snow measurement using remote sensing data gradually has become mainstream with the continuous development of remote sensing technology. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the capability of all-day, all-weather ground observation, and combines high spatial resolution, interferometry, and polarization imaging. C-band SAR images are more sensitive to snow characteristics and are an effective data source for obtaining the spatial distribution of snow in areas with complex terrain. In recent years, the methods of using machine learning and deep learning to invert snow parameters such as snow depth and snow water equivalent have been widely used. In this paper, the study area is the farmland area of Northeast China. The relationship between snow depth and snow parameters is analyzed by a deep learning algorithm and machine learning algorithm using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data, measured snow depth data, and so on. The inversion model based on the type of farmland subsurface is established to invert the snow depth in the farmland area of northeast China and output the map. The aim is to generate surface-based snow depth inversion results with less error and higher accuracy. The average MAE of the model is 2.06cm, RMSE is 2.96 cm, R-2 is 0.72, the maximum absolute error is 10.206 cm, and the minimum absolute error is 0.045cm for the farmland mixed group feature screening dataset.

AB  - H. N. Allen (1858-1932) had read or heard about “Hong Gildong-Jeon” in the 1880s, and translated the text into English and published it in the“his Korean Tales.” The purpose of his translation was to sintroduce “Hong Gildong-Jeon to foreigners. In so” doing, he summarized, elided, added, elaborated, acculturated, adapted, and commented on suchthe work.For instance, Allen has omitted the violence at Hong Gildong’s nativity and the unfair conquest of the Euldo nation only, presenting only good and sound values.His translation of “Hong Gildong-Jeon” becamewas thus the success story of an abused boy, which espoused an inclusive worldview; h His translation thus took a different view from the way that Koreans hadwho lived in the 1880s inviewed Hong Gildong. Because Allen was a foreigner, he had to make an objective observation about Hong Gildong and “Hong Gildong-Jeon,” unlike the Koreans of his days.Allen’s different viewpoint on Hong Gildong and “Hong Gildong-Jeon” thus determine whetherchallenges us to consider we hether our perspective on themse works is correctI also make us and whether veour views on the work have solidified into dogma.

TI  - Attribution of the spatial heterogeneity of Arctic surface albedo feedback to the dynamics of vegetation, snow and soil properties and their interactions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic warming rate is triple the global average, which is partially caused by surface albedo feedback (SAF). Understanding the varying pattern of SAF and the mechanisms is therefore critical for predicting future Arctic climate under anthropogenic warming. To date, however, how the spatial pattern of seasonal SAF is influenced by various land surface factors remains unclear. Here, we aim to quantify the strengths of seasonal SAF across the Arctic and to attribute its spatial heterogeneity to the dynamics of vegetation, snow and soil as well as their interactions. The results show a large positive SAF above -5% K-1 across Baffin Island in January and eastern Yakutia in June, while a large negative SAF beyond 5% K-1 is observed in Canada, Chukotka and low latitudes of Greenland in January and Nunavut, Baffin Island and Krasnoyarsk Krai in July. Overall, a great spatial heterogeneity of Arctic land warming induced by positive SAF is found with a coefficient of variation (CV) larger than 61.5%, and the largest spatial difference is detected in wintertime with a CV > 643.9%. Based on the optimal parameter-based geographic detector model, the impacts of snow cover fraction (SCF), land cover type (LC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil water content (SW), soil substrate chemistry (SC) and soil type (ST) on the spatial pattern of positive SAF are quantified. The rank of determinant power is SCF > LC > NDVI > SW > SC > ST, which indicates that the spatial patterns of snow cover, land cover and vegetation coverage dominate the spatial heterogeneity of positive SAF in the Arctic. The interactions between SCF, LC and SW exert further influences on the spatial pattern of positive SAF in March, June and July. This work could provide a deeper understanding of how various land factors contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of Arctic land warming at the annual cycle.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Grassland plays an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle and is sensitive to environmental stress. Monitoring the dynamic of grassland vegetation is crucial for understanding the vegetation-climate response mechanism. The traditional vegetation index (VI) and the rapidly developing Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are representative satellite data sources for remote sensing monitoring of vegetation productivity, and there are still few systematic comparative studies on the response of grassland vegetation to environmental stress. Focusing on grassland vegetation in the Conterminous United States (CONUS), this study systematically compares and analyzes the response characteristics of SIF and EVI under different drought levels at the monthly and regional scales using U.S. Drought Monitor, EVI, and SIF remote sensing data. The results showed that compared with deciduous broad-leaved forest, grassland vegetation with a simple canopy structure is more sensitive to drought. SIF reveals Gross primary production (GPP) loss better than EVI. As the drought level increases, the greenness index's ability to respond to SIF decreases, and the greenness index of vegetation may not reflect the state of photosynthesis.

TI  - A Deep Transfer Learning Method for Estimating Fractional Vegetation Cover of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important indicator for exploring hydrosphere, pedosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and their interactions. Deep learning (DL) is a potential tool to handle large-scale data and approximate the complex nonlinear relationship between variables. It is, therefore, suitable for FVC estimation. However, few DL-based algorithms have been developed to estimate FVC as it is difficult to obtain a large amount of training data. This letter presents a novel method by means of deep transfer learning to address this issue. The proposed technique consists of two steps. In the first step, a large amount of simulated training samples were generated by a physical model (PROSPECT + SAIL radiative transfer model, PROSAIL). In the second step, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network was pretrained with the simulated training dataset obtained in the first step. Then limited real samples from satellite images were used to fine-tune the pretrained network. Experiments were conducted for the Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images of two areas and the results were compared with those obtained by the traditional the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based method and two machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate that the performance of our method outperforms other advanced FVC estimation methods.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Vegetation Productivity in the Forest From Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating vegetation productivity in the forest areas is important for studying the terrestrial ecosystem and carbon cycles. Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) vegetation production datasets provide new long-term basic products of gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) for monitoring the issues related with carbon exchange and carbon storage. But the coarse spatial resolution of the GLASS GPP/NPP products have limited their application in ecosystem service assessment in regional scales. In this paper, a spatial downscaling method based on GLASS vegetation production datasets and four typical deep learning methods (deep neural network, convolutional neural network, back propagation neural network and recurrent neural network) was proposed to generate high resolution GPP/NPP in the forest areas in the upper Luanhe River basin in the north of Hebei Province in China. Then the downscaled GPP/NPP were validated with ground measurement data and reference high resolution GPP/NPP data, and the accuracy of downscaled GPP/NPP from different deep learning methods was compared. Results of this paper indicated the applicability and feasibility of deep learning methods in downscaling GPP/NPP. Direct validation and cross validation demonstrated that downscaled GPP/NPP using convolutional neural network obtained the highest accuracy.

TI  - Terrain-Guided Flatten Memory Network for Deep Spatial Wind Downscaling
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution wind analysis plays an essential role in pollutant dispersion and renewable energy utilization. This article focuses on spatial wind downscaling. Specifically, a novel terrain-guided flatten memory network (abbreviated as TIGAM) with axial similarity constraint is proposed. TIGAM consists of three elaborately designed blocks, i.e., the similarity block, the reconstruction block, and the denoise block. To achieve long-spatial dependence, the similarity block interpolates low-resolution data to high resolution in an axial attention manner. Meanwhile, the reconstruction block aims to obtain a clearer high-resolution representation in closed form. Taking both of the meteorological prior and network design principle into consideration, this article also proposes a flatten memory module with learnable input for high-resolution denoising. Furthermore, for accurate detail reconstruction, a terrain-guided enhanced loss is presented benefitting from the high-resolution remote sensing data. This loss function integrates wind spatial distribution and terrain elegantly. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TIGAM.

TI  - Genetic diversity of different geographical populations of rice stem borers, <i>Sesamia inferens</i>, in the Sichuan-Chongqing rice region
T2  - Chinese Journal of Applied Entomology
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objectives] To investigate the relative abundance of different species of rice stem borers and the genetic diversity of different geographical populations of the pink stem borer, Sesamia inferens (Walker) in rice growing regions of Sichuan-Chongqing, and provide suggestions for the regional management of borer populations. [Methods] We conducted a field survey during the rice grain-filling stage to determine the relative abundance of different species of rice stem borers in 13 cities in the Sichuan-Chongqing rice growing region and collected S. inferens specimens from 13 geographical populations for genetic analysis. We then sequenced the cytochrome oxidase subunitI(COI) and cytochrome oxidase subunitII(COII) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of S. inferens specimens from different populations and analyzed their genetic diversity sequence varication with MEGA and DNA Sequence Polymorphism. [Results] The species of rice stem borer identified in our survey were Chilo suppressalis, Tryporyza incertulas and S. inferens, and the dominant species were C. suppressalis and S. inferens. A 627 bp segment of COI gene from 60 mature S. inferens larvae was sequenced and analyzed, resulting in the identification of 386 variable sites and 16 haplotypes. Haplotype diversity among different populations in eastern Sichuan was 0.910 57. A phylogenetic tree indicates that, with the exception of the YS population, all other populations from eastern Sichuan grouped into one great clade and all other geographic populations grouped into another great clade. Based on the same 60 DNA samples, the length of the COII gene was 363 bp, and 228 variable sites and 10 haplotypes were identified. Haplotype diversity among different eastern Sichuan populations was 0.715 79. A phylogenetic tree showed that the Chongqing city population, Hangzhou population and ZY population grouped into one clade, whereas all other geographic populations grouped into another clade. [Conclusion] The dominant species of rice stem borer in the Sichuan-Chongqing rice growing region are C. suppressalis and S. inferens. Haplotype diversity based on both COI and COII sequences indicates that there is more haplotype diversity in eastern Sichuan than in other geographical areas. We found little correlation between genetic diversity and geographical populations.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Prediction of Vegetation Index With Deep Recurrent Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation index (VI) derived from remotely sensed images is a proxy of terrestrial vegetation information and widely used in land monitoring and global change studies. Recently, the prediction of vegetation properties has been an interest in related communities. With the accumulation of satellite records over the past few decades, the spatial-temporal prediction of VI becomes feasible. In this letter, we developed deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to predict the short-term VI based on historical observations. The pixel-based fully connected networks GRU and LSTM (FCGRU and FCLSTM) and patch-based convolutional networks (ConvGRU and ConvLSTM) are established and compared with the traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-2 normalized difference VI (NDVI) data sets were used in the experiments. The prediction performance is evaluated globally in different regions, different vegetation types, and different growing seasons. Results demonstrate that the RNN models can predict VI with high accuracy (average root mean square error (RMSE) around 0.03), which is superior to the MLP model. In general, the pixel-based RNN models performed better than the patch-based models especially in regions with a larger proportion of outliers. And the prediction accuracy is stable over different vegetation types and growing seasons.

TI  - Classification of Desertification on the North Bank of Qinghai Lake
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, RS, GIS and GPS technologies are used to interpret the remote sensing images of the north shore of Qinghai Lake from 1987 to 2014 according to the inversion results of vegetation coverage (FVC), albedo, land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture (WET) and other major parameters after image preprocessing, such as radiometric correction, geometric correction and atmospheric correction. On this basis, the decision tree classification method based on landsat8 remote sensing image is used to classify the desertification land in this area, and the development and change of desertification in this period are analyzed. The results show that the fluctuation of desertification land area in this area increased during the study period, but from 2003 to 2014, the land area of mild desertification, moderate desertification and severe desertification land were respectively decreased 0.92, 145.89 and 29.39 km(2), while the area of serious desertification land still has a slow increasing trend. Whether the driving force of desertification change trend in this area is caused by human factors or global change needs to be further studied.

TI  - Similarity Matrix Entropy for Multitemporal Polarimetric SAR Change Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - For cumulative change detection using time-series polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (PolSAR) data, pairwise comparisons using bi-temporal data change detection are often performed over each successive pair of images in the entire time series. In this way, due to the impact of the quality of the difference image (DI) of bitemporal data and the classification accuracy of the DI into the change and nonchange classes, there is a great risk of many false alarms or omissions caused by gradually occurred changes. Therefore, this letter proposes a symmetric similarity matrix based on a likelihood ratio test (LRT), which groups the similarity between any two-time point data in time series. Then, Shannon entropy is applied to the similarity matrix to calculate the DI of the entire time-series data. Finally, an image segmentation method based on Markov random field (MRF) is used to classify the calculated DI into the change and nonchange classes. The experiments using the multitemporal fully polarimetric Radarsat-2 data acquired at three different time points prove the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with some existing methods.

AB  - Ice flow velocity over long time series in Greenland plays a vital role in estimating and predicting the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its contribution to global sea level rise. However, there are few Greenland ice flow velocity products with large spatial coverage available showing the Greenland ice flow velocity pattern before the 1990s. We proposed three methods, including parallax decomposition, grid-based NCC image matching, feature and gird-based image matching with constraints for estimation of surface velocity in East Antarctica based on ARGON KH-5 and LANDSAT imagery, and a systematic compilation method for the ice surface velocity in East Antarctica from the 1960s to 1980s. Based on the above methods and cartographic processes, this study designed a framework for the mapping of the historical ice flow velocity of the Greenland ice sheet. Currently, the early LANDSAT images covering several glaciers in North Greenland and Northwest Greenland have been processed and applied to velocity mapping using the cartographic process proposed in this study, and some preliminary results have been obtained.

TI  - Improving the Gross Primary Productivity Estimate by Simulating the Maximum Carboxylation Rate of the Crop Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current regional-scale process-based photosynthesis models use biome-specified values of maximum carboxylation rate at 25 degrees C (V-m25) in simulating ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP). These models ignore the variations in V-m25 over time and space, resulting in substantial errors in regional estimates of cropland GPP. Thus, to resolve this problem, we used the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate tower-based GPP from five maize flux sites into a process-based mode to obtain the "apparent" value of V-m25 and then modeled this parameter using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The results showed that V-m25 increased during the early growing season and then decreased after reaching a peak value in the middle of the growing season. The coefficient of determination (R-2) root mean square error (RMSE) for satellite-driven coupled photosynthesis and evapotranspiration simulator (SCOPES)-Crop with EnKF-derived varied V-m25 in simulating daily GPP across all site-days increased (decreased) by 0.17 (5.63 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) on average compared to that for the model with fixed V-m25. We used four ML algorithms, namely artificial neural network, random forest, extreme gradient enhancement, and convolutional neural network (CNN), to model the V-m25 of maize. The CNN algorithm yielded the best results. The average of the R-2 (RMSE) values of simulated GPP using CNN-based V-m25 over the three flux sites is 0.93 (1.95 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), higher (smaller) than that using fixed V-m25 This study implies that representing the seasonal variations in V-m25 can facilitate improved estimates of GPP and the ML methods are useful tools for modeling the variation in V-m25.

TI  - An Operational Analysis Ready Radar Backscatter Dataset for the African Continent
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Earth Africa is now providing an operational Sentinel-1 normalized radar backscatter dataset for Africa. This is the first free and open continental scale analysis ready data of this kind that has been developed to be compliant with the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) specification for normalized radar backscatter (NRB) products. Partnership with Sinergise, a European geospatial company and Earth observation data provider, has ensured this dataset is produced efficiently in the cloud infrastructure and can be sustained in the long term. The workflow applies radiometric terrain correction (RTC) to the Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) product, using the Copernicus 30 m digital elevation model (DEM). The method is used to generate data for a range of sites around the world and has been validated as producing good results. This dataset over Africa is made available publicly as a AWS public dataset and can be accessed through the Digital Earth Africa platform and its Open Data Cube API. We expect this dataset to support a wide range of applications, including natural resource monitoring, agriculture, and land cover mapping across Africa.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Autumn Phenology by Including Surface Soil Temperature: Algorithm Development, Calibration, and Validation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology exercises a critical control on annual terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake and indicates interaction between climate and vegetation. Solely vegetation index is insufficient to accurately detect the end of growing season (EOS). Soil temperature (T-s) plays a modulating role in soil microbial functioning and plant growth, while its impact on EOS remains largely unknown. Hence, we compared the potential between T-s and air temperature (T-a) as the indicators of EOS by using flux data from 14 deciduous broadleaf forests, 24 evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), 7 mixed forests, and 23 nonforests over Northern temperate and boreal regions (30 degrees-60 degrees N) for 2001-2014. The widely used NDVI-based double-logistic approach failed to capture EOS variability for these ecosystems, and we derived a new EOS algorithm with a soil temperature-based scaler, which improved the EOS modeling for all plant functional types. We found that T-s at different depths showed varied abilities for EOS modeling, and T-s at the 0-10 cm depth provided the best estimates of EOS in terms of both numbers of significant sites and the correlation coefficients (R). Estimated EOS occurred earlier by on average 2.9 days than the current MODIS phenology product for similar to 56.5% pixels, especially for the ENF ecosystems (similar to 5.5 days). Our study suggests the usefulness of surface soil temperature for autumn leaf senescence phenology modeling, and that combination of environmental variables with the current modeling strategy can improve our understanding of autumn phenology with future climate change.

TI  - Fine-Grained Classification of Urban Functional Zones and Landscape Pattern Analysis Using Hyperspectral Satellite Imagery: A Case Study of Wuhan
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape mapping and pattern analysis of fine-grained urban functional zones (UFZ) are of great research value in the field of urban planning and urban development assessment. Previous studies employing multispectral images have largely enabled only coarse-grained land-use classification of urban areas. By contrast, hyperspectral images can provide very detailed spectral features and have shown some potential to facilitate fine-grained classification of urban areas. In this article, we evaluate and analyze the classification of fine-grained UFZ in the central city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, using GaoFen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral satellite imagery. We first compare the performance of hyperspectral data (GF-5) and classical multispectral data (Landsat 8) for the classification of fine-grained functional zones of cities by employing two classical classification algorithms and two deep learning methods. We also propose the deep learning-based spectral-spatial unified networks combined with a fully connected conditional random field (SSUN-CRF) algorithm for fine-grained UFZ mapping to enable better landscape pattern analysis. We then analyze the landscape pattern of the main urban areas of Wuhan by combining ten landscape indicators based on the precise UFZ classification results. Experimental results illustrate the followings. First, compared to multispectral images, hyperspectral images can allow for a more accurate UFZ classification. Second, deep learning classification algorithms can better exploit hyperspectral image data, with the SSUN-CRF algorithm, in particular, being able to achieve an overall accuracy of 93.86% and a Kappa coefficient of 92.08%. Finally, the landscape pattern analysis demonstrates that hyperspectral remote sensing imagery shows significant potential in mapping fine-grained UFZ. It is beneficial for further urban study and planning.

TI  - From Easy to Hard: Learning Language-Guided Curriculum for Visual Question Answering on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visual question answering (VQA) for remote sensing scene has great potential in intelligent human-computer interaction system. Although VQA in computer vision has been widely researched, VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA) is still in its infancy. There are two characteristics that need to be specially considered for the RSVQA task: 1) no object annotations are available in the RSVQA datasets, which makes it difficult for models to exploit informative region representation and 2) there are questions with clearly different difficulty levels for each image in the RSVQA task. Directly training a model with questions in a random order may confuse the model and limit the performance. To address these two problems, in this article, a multi-level visual feature learning method is proposed to jointly extract language-guided holistic and regional image features. Besides, a self-paced curriculum learning (SPCL)-based VQA model is developed to train networks with samples in an easy-to-hard way. To be more specific, a language-guided SPCL method with a soft weighting strategy is explored in this work. The proposed model is evaluated on three public datasets, and extensive experimental results show that the proposed RSVQA framework can achieve promising performance. Code will be available at https://gitlab.lrz.de/ai4eo/reasoning/VQA-easy2hard.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - This paper proposed the method to generate triple epipolar images in tristereo imaging on the same orbit mode. It generated projection tie points based on double projection surface in object space, and designed conversion model from epipolar images to its corresponding original images on the basis of projection tie points and created the RPC of epipolar images. During stereo matching one stereo image pairs are used as the basic pair and proposed the rapid transformation model between the current matching points and the corresponding point on the third image, which accomplished the combination of epipolar stereo matching and object space geometric constraints. After left/right bidirectional matching and occlusion area checking, a third matching was implemented. The cost of occlusion area will use the smallest one among the three and these areas were revamped. SGM was used as the optimization strategy. Experiments in three typical areas using Pleiades and ZY-3 as data recourses show that the loss of precision is negligible in the proposed epipolar image generation method. The proposed matching method combines the best of both object geometric constraint method and isolate epipolar image pair method, and the computational efficiency significantly better than these two methods. Lastly, the precision of the proposed method is significantly better than these two methods in building area and weak texture area.

TI  - Territorially ecological restoration zoning and optimization strategy in Guyuan City of Ningxia, China Based on the balance of ecosystem service supply and demand
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientifically identifying the territorially ecological restoration zoning is a vital prerequisite for implementing ecological restoration projects and enhancing environmental quality. Based on remote sensing data, we systematically assessed supply and demand for ecosystem service and their relationship in Guyuan City, China by using the InVEST model, coordination degree model, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. We carried out territorially ecological restoration zoning by coupling the ecosystem service supply and demand. Furthermore, the corresponding optimization strategies were put forward according to the regional characteristics of natural resources and socio-economic development. The results showed that the areas with high water yield, carbon storage, soil conservation and habitat quality were mainly located in the southern part of Guyuan City. The areas with high population density, economic development level and high ecological demand were mainly located in the central urban area and the location towns of the county government. The spatial mismatch of supply and demand for ecosystem services in Guyuan City was dominant, as indicated by the fact that the areas with high ecological supply having low ecological demand and low ecological supply having high ecological demand. The average coordination index was 0.5, indicating that the relationship between ecological supply and ecological demand was basically coordinated. Based on the differences between supply and demand of ecosystem services and regional natural geographical pattern, the administrative township units in Guyuan could be classified into six ecological restoration zonings key ecological restoration area, potential ecological restoration area, ecological economic reconstruction area, characteristic agricultural development area, ecological core protection area, and ecological industry construction area. Different management strategies were proposed to provide scientific support for ecological restoration.

A total of 12,512 cases, excluding incomplete data, were analyzed by selecting incidents from the data covering the last three years (2018-2020) of the ‘Patient Safety Report’. For data analysis, cross-tabulation and binary logistic regression were performed using the R 4.2.0 program. Regarding patient safety, there were statistically significant differences in the occurrence of Near Miss, Adverse Event, and Sentinel Event according to gender, age, bed size, medical institution grade, location where safety incident occurred, type of incident, and nurse duty time. These results suggest that it is necessary to develop a customized manual for preventing and managing patient safety accidents and operate a feedback system in accordance with the pertinent level and department of medical institutions to aid in the prevention of patient safety accidents.Key Words: Medical Errors, Risk Factors, Patient Safety, Public Reporting of Healthcare Data, Safety Management

TI  - Evaluation of the Threshold for an Improved Surface Water Extraction Index Using Optical Remote Sensing Data.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In this study, we proposed an automatic water extraction index (AWEI) threshold improvement model that can be used to detect lake surface water based on optical remote sensing data. An annual Landsat 8 mosaic was created using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain cloud-free satellite image data. The challenge of this study was to determine the threshold value, which is essential to show the boundary between water and nonwater. The AWEI was selected for the study to address this challenge. The AWEI approach was developed by adding a threshold water value based on the split-based approach (SBA) calculation analysis for Landsat 8 satellite images. The SBA was used to determine local threshold variations in data scenes that were used to classify water and nonwater. The class threshold between water and nonwater in each selected subscene image can be determined based on the calculation of class intervals generated by geostatistical analysis, initially referred to as smart quantiles. It was used to determine the class separation between water and nonwater in the resulting subscene images. The objectives of this study were (a) to increase the accuracy of automatic lake surface water detection by improvising the determination of threshold values based on analysis and calculations using the SBA and (b) to conduct a test case study of AWEI threshold improvement on several lakes' surface water, which has a variety of different or heterogeneous characteristics. The results show that the threshold value obtained based on the smart quantile calculation from the natural break approach (AWEI≥-0.23) gave an overall accuracy of close to 100%. Those results were better than the normal threshold (AWEI≥0.00), with an overall accuracy of 98%. It shows that there has been an increase of 2% in the accuracy based on the confusion matrix calculation. In addition to that, the results obtained when classifying water and nonwater classes for the different national priority lakes in Indonesia vary in overall accuracy from 94% to 100%.

The esoteric narrative of the film could be analyzed by understanding the symbolic expressions present throughout the film. The unrealistic characters, spaces, and props that appear along with the main character contain a symbolic meaning and adhere to the artist's worldview. These expressions contribute to creating a unique world for the Coen brothers and significantly impacted later films. Coen brothers’ other films <Fargo> and <No Country for Old Man>, similarly display the unrecognizable world that coexists with the real world and the powerful presence that dominates it within the world. This study examines the use of symbolic characters and spacial expressions shown in the representative works of the Coen brothers.

TI  - Range Geolocation Accuracy of C-/L-Band SAR and its Implications for Operational Stack Coregistration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR generally starts with coregistration for the precise alignment of the stack of images. Here, we introduce a model-adjusted geometrical image coregistration (MAGIC) algorithm for stack coregistration. This algorithm corrects for atmospheric propagation delays and known surface motions using existing models and ensures simplicity and computational efficiency in the data processing systems. We validate this approach by evaluating the impact of different geolocation errors on stacks of the C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-2 data, with a focus on the ionosphere. Our results show that the impact of the ionosphere dominates Sentinel-1 ascending (dusk-side) orbit and ALOS-2 data. After correcting for ionosphere using the JPL high-resolution global ionospheric maps, with topside total electron content (TEC) estimated from GPS receivers onboard the Sentinel-1 platforms, solid Earth tides, and troposphere, the mis-registration RMSE reduces by over a factor of four from 0.20 to 0.05 m for Sentinel-1 and from 2.66 to 0.56 m for ALOS-2. The results demonstrate that for Sentinel-1, the MAGIC approach is accurate enough in the range direction for most applications, including interferometry; while for the L-band SAR, it can be potentially accurate enough if topside TEC is available. Based on our current understanding of different error sources, we evaluate the expected range geolocation error budget for the upcoming NISAR mission with an upper bound of the relative geolocation error of 1.3 and 0.2 m for its L- and S-band SAR, respectively.

AB  - This paper attempts to understand the self-identity and reality perception of Chinese youth at the time shown in the Chinese animation <New Gods: Nezha Reborn(哪吒重生)> which was produced targeting young audiences. The research results are as follows.First, from the perspective of the hero narrative, the protagonist Li Wen Xiang has a sharper sense of criticism of reality than his contemporaries, and unlike the older generation with vested interests, he is a young hero who practices for social equality. He wakes up as a hero through his name and performs a mythical ‘being a hero’. This reproduces the self-identity of young people to differentiate themselves from the older generation and the contemporary people.Second, in terms of space-time setting, Donghai City of <Nezha Reborn> has two opposing structures: class conflict represented by capitalists and ordinary people, national conflict between China and the United States extracted as national images. Here, the way to solve the problems of individuals and communities relies on ‘exclusion’ and ‘removal’, revealing distorted perceptions of reality like reflection of a mirror.Third, in terms of the subject’s desire, <Nezha Reborn> attempts to transform the patricide complex, which is the key motif of <Fengshen Yanyi>. In other words, the object of murder is replaced by a person other than the father. Behind it lie the two things: the mainstream ideology not allowing head-on conflict with ‘father’ or ‘father state’, the desire of youth who has been educated in patriotism and traditional nationalism. These are linked to the Confucian hero mechanism persuading and edifying with mainstream ideology without facing one’s inferiority.The first animation hero Nezha(Li Yun Xiang), born in the Fengshen worldview, naturally goes back and forth between myths and reality. However, it is not a reality of the time, but between ‘great myth’ and ‘memory of selected places’ that he is going back and forth. In this respect, he can be said to be a hero who solves abstract and huge class conflicts rather than personal and social problems in real society. These Chinese-style heroes are reproducing the image of the neo-Confucian Communist Party trying to impress others through edification and persuasion.

AB  - The article deals with relations between Alexandr Blok's poem The Twelve (1918) and Henrik Ibsen's "world-historical drama" Emperor and Galilean (1873). Proceed-ing from the Christian paradoxical discourse after the Norwegian playwright, the poet radicalizes it so much that the bounds of traditional Christian worldview are broken down. In the poem, one can notice a rather complex indirect connection with the paradoxical discourse of both Dostoevsky (whose Christian identity is difficult to question) and Ibsen, especially beloved by Blok, in whose system of views it is impor-tant to notice the Lutheran dominant, implicitly referring to some Gnostic views that have quite logically been actualized in European culture of the last two centuries. The similarity between works so different, at first glance, as The Twelve and Ibsen's dou-ble-drama, deserves attention: in both cases, Christ appears ghostly, not in the flesh, in Blok - invisible to all the characters, in Ibsen - as visible only to very few. In both cases, he brings retribution - a theme equally important both in Ibsen's work and in Blok's poem. Both the Norwegian playwright and the Russian symbolist poet inter-pret world history from the standpoint of religious and metaphysical paradoxicalism. Ibsen's hero who renounced Christ begins the most brutal, bloody persecution of the Christian Church in order to destroy Christianity (Blok's Red Guards shooting at both "Holy Russia" and the invisible Christ for them create a kind of parallel for him in this case), but achieves the goal opposite to his intentions - he cleanses Christi-anity and thereby saves it. The same can be said about Ibsen's Julian that was said by Blok about the Red Guard - this is "water" to the mill of the Christian church. We do not know whether Blok think of Emperor and Galilean when working at his poem, but the parallels are obvious and remarkable.

TI  - HUMILITY AND MUTUALITY: AN ANALYSIS OF ETHOS OF CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN ORTHODOXY
T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers humility as one of the key categories in the practical ethos of Russian Orthodoxy. It formulates and discusses sociological and theological problems related to this category. The main emphasis is on the analysis of the relationship in the pair "the one who humbles vs. the one who is being humbled". The formulation of the problem of humility in this form is not obligatory, but it is precisely this problem that has received a certain spread in Orthodox discourse today. The reduction of the fullness of the problem to such a configuration of relations leaves many important subjects out of consideration, but at the same time allows us to concentrate on one problematic point noted in modem Orthodox discourse. To discuss the logic of the ethics of humility, Asceticism according to Orthodox Christian Teaching by S. Zarin was selected. On its basis, the dominant interpretation is characterised, i.e. "humility as acceptance of humiliation". Relying on texts discussing humility both inside and outside the Church, the article shows that one of the central virtues of Russian Orthodoxy is embodied in a practice that has a number of ambiguous consequences. At the same time, the article points out the deep-rootedness of the category of humility in Orthodox ethics and suggests turning to the texts of the New Testament in search of a nuance in the understanding of humility and suggestions for the embodiment of this virtue in practice, capable of minimising these ambiguous consequences. This nuance, i.e. the mutuality, is found in St. Paul's Epistles. By analysing the meaning of humility and the use of this concept in the text of the Epistles, the importance of mutuality of actors is shown. In conclusion, the presence of such an interpretation in the Russian Orthodox tradition, namely in the texts of Feofan the Recluse, is discussed. Thus, the assumption is substantiated that such an interpretation is not alien to the Orthodox worldview. The author suggests that the emphasis on mutuality in understanding and practicing humility could help to remove a number of negative effects that are identified today (and were indentified earlier) both inside and outside the Church.

TI  - CONCEPTUAL MAPPING OF <i>NUR MUHAMMAD</i> ACCORDING TO SUFI AND PHYSIC COSMOLOGY
T2  - AFKAR-JURNAL AKIDAH & PEMIKIRAN ISLAM-JOURNAL OF AQIDAH & ISLAMIC THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - The insight of the 'light of Muhammad' as primordial light and First Creation of Allah SWT has been discussed in the field of Sufism. It is one of the subdivisions of the Wandah al-Wujud (Oneness of Being). However, the debate on the concept of this Sufi cosmology as viewed from scientific knowledge is still scarce. The present study entailed a reexamination of the conceptual mapping of the Sufi cosmology in the scientific framework in which science-based on Divine values. Science, notably the physical cosmology much described in the Western perspective, do not emphasize the Divine aspects so most of them lead to unbelieve in the existence of God. Taken together with an introductory mapping or comparative study between both perspectives namely theology and science, this study tried to shed light on the ontology of the Haqiqat al-Muhammadiyyah (intrinsic, Muhammadan Reality) and on the superiority of Prophet Muhammad PBUH as keys in establishing the relationship of mankind in the diverse aspect of life to the Creator. Although the concept of Nur Muhammad is speculative through the kashf of the Sufis as the Big Bang theory is also not an absolute among Western astrophysicists, the findings from this comparative study open the discourse for future studies related to the concept of Nur Muhammad via deeper science in the Islamic Science worldview through the approach of the Lata'if Qur'aniyah which focuses on the aspect of connectedness between servants and Allah SWT.

AB  - In this study we have verified the algorithms for the Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) retrieval from the data of the Russian satellite microwave imager/sounder MTVZA-GYa. The algorithms are based on the polarization differences (PD), measured by the MTVZA-GYa at the frequencies of 10.6 and 36.7 GHz. Verification is done with the SIC satellite product based on the data of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) produced with an advanced algorithm from PD measurements at 89 GHz. Verification is done using collocated in time and space AMSR2 and MTVZA-GYa measurements taken in 2020. Analysis of additional high resolution Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have shown that the usage of low frequency MTVZA-GYa PD measurements allow avoiding underestimation of SIC for some areas featured to high frequency AMSR2 PD measurements.

TI  - Ultrasound-positive axillary lymph nodes in early breast cancer: can a patient subgroup avoid axillary lymph node dissection? A simple algorithm is suggested
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction National UK guidelines suggest that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is no longer mandatory for selected early node-positive breast cancer patients. Our study aimed to identify patients with early breast cancer and ultrasound (USS)-positive axillary metastasis who possess low burden of axillary disease and can avoid ALND.Methods We conducted a 5-year study of prospectively collected data of patients with clinically T1-2, N0 breast cancer and a positive USS-guided axillary biopsy. Primary outcome was involvement of 1-2 lymph nodes (low disease burden) or =3 lymph nodes (higher axillary disease) on final ALND histology. Tumour type, size, grade, multifocality, receptor status, number of abnormal imaged nodes and presence of lympho-vascular invasion (LVI) were recorded. Data were analysed using chi-squared and Student's t-test.Results One hundred and sixty-six patients underwent ALND for pT1-2 breast cancer. Seventy patients had no clinically palpable lymphadenopathy but a positive USS-guided biopsy. Of 70 patients, 32 women (46%) had low disease burden, whereas 38 women (54%) had higher axillary disease in final histology. LVI and >1 abnormal lymph node on USS were both significantly associated with higher disease burden (p = 0.050 and 0.009, respectively).Conclusion Our study confirms the presence of an important patient cohort, who are clinically node-negative with a positive USS-guided biopsy and a low volume of axillary disease. No imaging modality currently has the accuracy required to identify patients with this low disease burden preoperatively but we propose a simple algorithm for axillary management in this subgroup.

M3  - Article
AB  - One of the brightest representatives of the pleiad of Udmurt writers of the "Sixties" is Egor Egorovich Zagrebin (1937-2015), who left a deep mark on national literature and culture, especially in drama. The article examines the features of E. Zagrebin's creative individuality and dramatic skill based on the material of his most significant, representative plays: the drama "Mynam yaratone tatyn" ("My love is here"), the comedy (vaudeville) "Nastok no Istok" ("Stepan and Nastya"), the tragedy of "Esh-Terek". These plays are characterized by new substantive and formal elements that have become productive for the subsequent development of Udmurt drama. Without setting the task to comprehensively characterize the skill of E. Zagrebin as a playwright, the article attempts to highlight the following components of this issue: the author's worldview, the plot-compositional construction of the analyzed plays; the principles of typification of characters' images, and the structure of artistic conflict. E. Zagrebin's plays combine purely dramatic techniques with those of lyric poetry and prose, and theatrical conventions with real signs of the time. E. Zagrebin was one of the first in the Udmurt dramaturgy of the second half of the XX century who turned to understanding the life of the people through the analysis of everyda life of an ordinary person. A remarkable event in the literary and theatrical life of the republic at the turn of the XX-XXI centuries was the staging of E. Zagrebin's tragedy "Esh-Terek", which reflected the writer's interest in the role of a historical personality in critical epochs. With this play, the author implicitly addressed the topical issues of our time.

TI  - Modelling the Linguistic Worldview: Subject Field Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. The linguistic worldview theory stems from Humboldt's ideas concerning the interdependence of language and its speakers. Since Humboldt's time national linguistic worldviews remain a challenging aspect of linguistic research accounting for a significant number of publications. As linguistic worldview is a multi-faceted phenomenon, studies differ in terms of the facets they investigate and applied methodology. The linguistic worldview research has covered a wide array of linguistic worldview fragments and utilised monolingual material as well as cross-linguistic analysis of worldview fragments. However, so far, little attention has been paid to the analysis of this ever-increasing body of research and quite few studies have attempted to review the literature in this field.Purpose. The subject field scoping review aims to overview the available literature on national linguistic worldviews and answers the three questions: What is a diachronic change of researchers' interest in the issue? What fragments of linguistic worldview have been investigated so far? What are the most frequently used methods of modelling the linguistic worldview?Methods. The literature for the scoping review was retrieved from the three electronic databases: SciVerse Scopus, Web of Science (Core Collection), and Google Scholar. Literature selection was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). To generate a list of current research directions, which rest on the analysis of fragments of linguistic worldview, the visualisation map of authors' key words was created using the VOSviewer software.Results and Implications. The concise scoping review of the previously published literature on linguistic worldview shows that most publications date between 2015 and 2021 and the years yielding most publications are 2018 and 2019. The number of publications mentioning linguistic worldview grew each year within the study period. The analysis of linguistic worldview fragments helped to identify six directions of researchers' interest in the linguistic worldview field which include lexical fragments, linguistic worldview and consciousness, phraseological fragments, reflection of linguistic worldview in different discourses, linguistic worldview in translation and teaching, and grammar fragments. The most frequently used methods of modelling the linguistic worldview are an associative psycholinguistic experiment, a conceptual analysis, and a comparative method.

TI  - Agro Climatic Zoning of Saffron Culture in Miyaneh City by Using WLC Method and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent continuous droughts and decreasing ground water tables have prompted efforts to improve irrigation schedules and introduce crops that need less water. A study was recently conducted to determine suitable zones for saffron in Miyaneh using Landsat-8 images and the weighted linear combination (WLC) method. Climatic and geographical indices for saffron cultivation in the region were for soil type, slope, soil moisture, and soil salinity. Parameters such as 30 years of data on climate, soil, and water conditions were collected from synoptic and climatologic stations such as Tabriz. Then, parameters were weighted using WLC for importance in each region. The data were transferred to expert choice and clustered, rated, and integrated to produce the last layer. The results showed that the southeastern and northwestern regions of Miyaneh, especially the banks of rivers and catchments, were identified as suitable places for saffron cultivation and that 28% of the area is in the suitable class, 36% in the relatively moderately suitable class, 20% in the critical suitability class, and the rest of the area, which covers about 16% of the area, is in the non-suitable class. Therefore, if it is possible to identify favorable areas for saffron cultivation according to the climatic requirements and it is possible in practice to achieve higher performance per unit area, that in itself will contribute to improved economic conditions and levels of income for farmers. Due to the special characteristics of saffron, substituting it for the cultivation of crops with high water requirements, such as onions, potatoes, tomatoes, etc., will help reduce water consumption.

TI  - Deformation Velocity-Based Regularization of Multibaseline SAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) has shown great potential in the monitoring of Earth's surface and detection of the possible slow temporal deformations. Within the framework of multibaseline SAR interferometry, the availability of multiple interferograms obtained from multipass satellite observations can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimated target parameters, i.e., the residual height and the mean deformation velocity. The parameters can be estimated in the maximum likelihood (ML) sense and through the data covariance matrix. However, the presence of artifact and outliers may impair the parameter estimation, specifically when the candidate cells are subject to temporal decorrelation and atmospheric phase noise effects. In this letter, the exploitation of contextual spatial information is proposed to reduce the possible ambiguity and improve the accuracy of ML-based parameter estimation. The proposed approach adds a regularization term (or a constraint) to the ML's model in order to include the information about the scene velocity variation. Hence, the resulted nonconvex optimization is resolved using the graph-cut concept. The method is evaluated using the simulated and two real data sets acquired by Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) and Sentinel-1A sensors over Tehran, Iran; and the results are validated using the global positioning system-based measurements.

TI  - INTERCULTURAL AND LINGUODIDACTIC ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE INTERFERENCE IN TEACHING FOREIGN LANGUAGES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of international contacts, the internationalization of all spheres of life due to the entry of the Republic of Uzbekistan into the world educational and socio-cultural space required the use of intercultural and linguodidactic aspects to the study of interference. For modern linguodidactics, the study of linguistic and cultural interference is also significant due to the intensification of professional activities of specialists of various profiles in close contact with foreign colleagues. In this article, interference is considered as a communicative hindrance due to the imposition of linguistic and cultural codes of the contacting languages.Also, the main postulate of the article is the fact that the growing interest of linguodidactics in the phenomenon of interference, which generates not only inter-linguistic (phonetic, lexico-grammatical, syntactic), but also discourse, socio-cultural interference in intercultural communication. As a result, interference is interpreted in a broad sense as a conflict interaction of cognitive-speech mechanisms, manifested in a secondary linguistic personality in deviations from the linguistic, discourse, sociocultural norms of one linguoculture under the influence of another.Language interference is actualized at all levels of the language system and is implemented in speech regardless of the speaker's consciousness, therefore, until recently, interference research was mainly focused on studying its grammatical, lexical and phonetic aspects. However, interferences arising in intercultural communication often occur not only due to distortions of the grammatical, lexical or phonetic side of foreign language speech, although vocabulary is one of the most important forms of reflection of the ethno-cultural specifics of the worldview. Discourse and sociocultural phenomena that differ in ethnocultures often give rise to misunderstandings, hindrances, failures in intercultural communication, which can be overcome with a purposeful study of communicative behavior and background knowledge of representatives of a foreign cultural community.

TI  - THE LUDIBRIUM OF LIVING WELL A RE-EVALUATION OF THE RELIGIOUS WORLDVIEW OF THE <i>XIANG'ER</i> COMMENTARY TO THE <i>LAOZI</i>
T2  - MONUMENTA SERICA-JOURNAL OF ORIENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present article a new case will be made for the philosophical and religious merit of the Xiang'er commentary to the Laozi. Throughout the text there is a normative emphasis on reaching sagehood and the levels of obedience and cultivation that this entails. The Xiang'er prescribes a preparatory morality that readies Daoist practitioners for the eventual return to the Dao from which everything sprang. While this creates a temporary equilibrium in which commoners are held in check by a matrix of morality, this is but a stepping stone towards the ultimate dismantling of the edifice of human consciousness and the cosmic return to the Dao, as of yet the prerogative of sages. This creates a grim religious worldview in which humans are tasked with muting the clamour of the species in order to restore the original calm and stillness of the cosmic Dao.

T2  - Asia Oceania journal of nuclear medicine & biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Testicular germ cell cancers are the most common solid malignancy among young men at the age ranging between 14 and 35 years. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping using intraoperative injection of radiotracer in nonseminomatous testicular cancer patients with history of orchiectomy who were candidate for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) in post-chemotherapy setting.METHODS: Nine consecutive cases were included in the study. Technetium-99m-labelled phytate was injected in two divided doses in the stump of the spermatic cord, through transabdominal approach. A hand-held gamma probe was used for radio-guided retroperitoneal sentinel lymph node detection intraoperatively and confirming the location of the sentinel lymph nodes.RESULTS: Detection rate and the false negative rate were estimated as the main indices. The detection rate was 6/9 (66%) and the false negative rate was 0/2 (0%). Location of the dissected sentinel lymph nodes were interaortocaval (2 patients), internal iliac (1 patient), external iliac (1 patient), common iliac (2 patients), and paraaortic (1 patient).CONCLUSION: Sentinel lymph node mapping technique seems to be feasible and promising in post chemotherapy non-seminoma testis cancer patients who are candidate for RPLND; however, further larger studies are needed to increase and standardize the detection rate.

AB  - Radar remote sensing has shown a high potential for soil surface parameters estimation in different pedo-climatic context. In the present study, we investigated Sentinel-1 radar signal in order to analyze its behavior as function of soil moisture and soil roughness. In addition, we evaluated the approach combining the modified Integral Equation Model (IEM-B) and the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for estimating soil moisture in western France.Soil surface parameters were acquired over 4 campaigns during which composite soil samples were collected simultaneously to Sentinel-1 acquisition dates. The dates of those campaigns were defined according to the evolution of the soil surface condition, during the agricultural season. The sensitivity of radar signal s0 to soil moisture was studied over the 22 reference fields and over the Thiessen polygons created around the measurement points. Linear relationships are observed between the radar signal and volumetric soil moisture less than 35 vol.% with higher sensitivity for VH polarization (0.41 dB/vol.% in VH against 0.26 dB/vol.% in VV). The best correlation coefficients (R) were observed for the VH polarization with the Zs roughness parameter (R = 0.53 and 0.29 for reference fields and Thiessen polygons, respectively). Following that, a comparison of in situ soil moisture with that predicted based on approach proposed by [1], using Neural network algorithm with a training using the two models IEM-B and Water Cloud Model (WCM) allowed an accuracy with an RMSE ranging between 6.1 and 6.5 vol.% for reference fields and Thiessen polygons respectively. These results confirm that the proposed algorithm is accurate to estimate soil moisture.

AB  - The site of biological and ecological interest (SBEI) Oued Tahaddart, which is the subject of this study, is located on the Atlantic coast of the Tangier Peninsula, in the North-West of Morocco.This study focused on a methodology based on image processing and spatial data analysis techniques using remote sensing and GIS technologies.The use of multidate documents, Landsat satellite imagery (2001, 2010 and 2018), allowed us to qualify and quantify the evolution of land use dynamics.The images were classified and then analyzed using ENVI 5.0 software. The results were verified using a confusion matrix, which indicated overall accuracy rates ranging between 90 and 95%.The results showed notable extension of urban areas at the cost of the vegetation cover, which has decreased with considerably.The modifications that mark the changing dynamics of land use are classified as anthropogenic, linked, in part, to the establishment of a new city, Ibn Batouta, just north of the SBE. With the city came various real estate projects (villas, golf course ... ), and, on the one hand, the construction of a highway and the high-speed rail line, on the other, the growing number of inhabitants villages on the other hand.

AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surface deformation estimates often suffer from tropospheric noise errors. Here we present a method for co-characterizing surface deformation and tropospheric noise from interferogram subsets. Choosing different subsets of all available interferograms allow identification of linear secular deformation, little apparent deformation, transient events, or higher order nonlinear rates. We demonstrate this method using 95 C-Band Sentinel-1 SAR scenes acquired over the Oman Ophiolite and 133 scenes over the Island of Hawaii. In Oman, our method suggests that there is no detectable deformation signal. In this scenario, we averaged subsets of randomly selected interferograms that share a common reference SAR scene. As the subset size increases, at similar to 50, the results converge to accurate estimates of tropospheric noise on the reference date. In Hawaii, our method shows that the observed InSAR phase on the south flank of Kilauea is due to a secular deformation signal, while the phase over Mauna Loa is mostly associated with tropospheric noise. Our approach provides a new way to derive InSAR uncertainty analyses without requiring additional in situ validation or prior knowledge of deformation models.

AB  - A Deep Learning methodology based on ResNet, recently developed to retrieve the wind direction exclusively from the SAR images at 500 m of resolution, produces wind fields with unprecedented spatial details. As a consequence, the classical validation method comparing the SAR-derived with model and in-situ winds is not sufficient because of the natural lack of small scale structures provided by the models and the limited spatial coverage of the in-situ data. This paper proposes a complementary approach to the classical validation, estimating the spatial gradients of SAR-derived wind direction theta and speed U and verifying their compatibility with the typical values obtained from experimental wind time series. Hence getting a consistency test of the spatial information of the SAR-derived wind fields obtained with the ResNet methodology. This analysis on five Sentinel-1 images over the northern Adriatic Sea shows a good compatibility of the local spatial variations of the ResNet SAR-derived wind fields with those derived from experimental time series. These results, together with the statistical agreement with model and in-situ data sets, enforce the reliability of the wind maps obtained with the ResNet methodology, which describe real features of the wind fields.

TI  - Structure of High-Resolution SAR Winds Over the Venice Lagoon Area
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial characteristics at mesoscale gamma of the strongest sea surface winds blowing on the Adriatic Sea and Venice Lagoon, Italy, have been investigated through 500 m x 500 m wind fields extracted, without external information, from the C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images interferometric wide (IW) swath ground range detected high resolution (GRDH) level 1 (L1) by a deep learning method based on a residual neural network (ResNet). The derived SAR wind directions have been used to retrieve the wind speed using the C_SARMOD2 geophysical model function (GMF). The resulting wind fields have been compared with European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and in situ data: the wind direction bias vertical bar beta(theta)vertical bar <= 1 degrees indicates a very good agreement and the value of RMS difference against in situ winds of 16 degrees results smaller than those reported in the literature; the wind speed bias beta(w) = -1.5 ms I with respect to in situ data indicates an underestimation of SAR speed. However, the innovation brought by ResNet results is evident in the study of the spatial structure of the wind fields, showing unprecedented details. The spatial gradients of wind direction and speed obtained (approximate to 6 degrees/km and 0.5 ms(-1)/km, respectively) are well consistent with those derived from previous experimental campaigns. The maps of the atmospheric wind stress curl derived from the ResNet wind fields exhibit the presence of contiguous cells with positive and negative values roughly elongated in the wind direction, not reproducible with such profusion of details by any other existing datasets. ResNet wind fields provide exhaustive coverage of the Venice lagoon, allowing to study their spatial structure: under northeasterly winds, the wind speed increases on average from northern to southern lagoon by 30% in agreement with a case study reported in the literature. Local differences of ResNet wind direction with respect to ECMWF (+/- 30 degrees maximum) generate local differences of wind speed as large as +/- 2 ms(-1).

AB  - During the China's long history, many ethnic groups have developed their own traditions of local music which is an important part of their precious cultures. Meanwhile, each ethnic group developed its own worldview and music culture according to its unique living environment, special lifestyle and mode of production. The clarinet is a Western instrument, and has been influenced to some extent by Chinese minority culture while being introduced to China. Therefore, musicians tried to find ways of using Western musical instruments to express various elements of Chinese minority music. Focusing on two clarinet works 'The Song of Grazing Horses' by Wang Yan and 'The Sound of Pamir Clarinet Concerto ' by Hu Bijing, this paper aims to analyze the musical characteristics of minority groups expressed by the clarinet in two aspects: the formation of the music style, the artistic characteristics conveyed through the works. Specifically, it consists of five parts: ethnic mode and tonality, rhythm, time signature, melody making, and imitation of animals. It also analyzes the cultural characteristics of Tajik and Mongolian music reflected in the two works in combination with living environment, mode of production, life style, and ethnic emotions. This study aims to provide a theoretical basis for composers and performers who want to understand and acquire the musical style of modern Chinese clarinet works. It also helps to find a better way to play traditional Chinese music with Western instruments.

TI  - TS-SHES: Terrain Segmentation in Complex-Valued PolSAR Images Via Scattering Harmonization and Explicit Supervision
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) has attracted extensive attention in the research field of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) terrain segmentation. However, directly using CNN in PolSAR terrain segmentation while ignoring the characteristics of PolSAR images has become the main factor restricting the performance of algorithms. In this article, we propose an efficient PolSAR terrain segmentation algorithm called terrain segmentation in complex-valued PolSAR images via scattering harmonization and explicit supervision (TS-SHES), which integrates the polarization scattering characteristics of PolSAR images and the CNN learning process into a unified architecture. First, considering the intrinsic structure of the complex-valued PolSAR data, TS-SHES transforms the scattering matrix into the form of amplitude and phase components, which preserves the original information maximally. Then, TS-SHES introduces a scattering harmonized encoding (SH-Enc) method to balance the feature contributions of weak and strong scattering regions as well as map the two components into the same representation space. Through the above scattering harmonization operations, the segmentation performance of CNN on weak scattering regions can be improved, and the feature imbalance in amplitude and phase can be alleviated. Furthermore, in view of the implicit states of CNN feature construction, a scattering explicit learning network (SEL-Net) is presented to collect the scattering features of amplitude and phase. Via explicit supervision, SEL-Net avoids incomplete collection of scattering information caused by implicit feature construction, thereby improving the segmentation accuracy. Abundant experiments are conducted on two PolSAR images acquired by the GaoFen-3 satellite, which demonstrates the superiority of our proposed algorithm.

TI  - Statistical Characteristics of Summer Season Raindrop Size Distribution in the Western and Central Tianshan Mountains in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of the raindrop size distribution (DSD) in summer in the western (Nilek) and central (Urumqi) regions in the Tianshan Mountains of China were studied based on three years of second-generation Particle Size Velocity (Parsivel(2)) disdrometer data. The FengYun-2G satellite remote sensing data and the ERA5 reanalysis product were used to reveal the possible thermo-dynamical and microphysical processes that caused the dissimilarities in DSD between Urumqi and Nilek. The DSD in Nilek is significantly different from that in Urumqi. The concentration of mid- and large-size drops is higher in Nilek than in Urumqi. The DSD characteristics for six rain rate classes and two rain types (convective and stratiform) are studied. It is found that the raindrops in Nilek have overall higher mass-weighted mean diameters (D-m) and lower logarithm of normalized intercept parameters (log(10) N-w) than those in Urumqi, which is true for different rain rates and rain types. Convective clusters in Urumqi are similar to maritime clusters, whereas those in Nilek are more similar to continental clusters, according to a classification standard of convective clusters. The radar reflectivity, rain rate relations, and the shape and slope relations for rainfall in Urumqi and Nilek are also different. The DSD variability in the two regions may be attributed to differences in convective intensity that are closely related to the specific terrain of the Tianshan Mountains.

AB  - A campaign has been conducted in Qinghai Lake from July 10 to September 26, 2019. The destination of the campaign was to calibrate and validate the HY-2B and Sentinel-3A/B altimeters. A tide gauge was used to measure the water surface of the lake. A dedicated GNSS buoy was placed at the footprints of the altimeters and the tide gauge location, to measure the water surface difference between them. A static GNSS station was also placed as a reference for the GNSS buoy and then define the datum of the tide gauge. 11 radiosondes were released at the same location with the static GNSS station to achieve the wet troposphere delay (WTD). The WTD difference was 6.40 +/- 5.95 mm compared with the static GNSS station derived ones. At last, the altimeters were calibrated using the tide gauge. The calibration results were + 3.38 +/- 4.46 cm, -1.38 +/- 4.09 cm and +2.88 +/- 4.10 cm for HY-2B, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, respectively. The results showed good agreements with the cross-calibration and other calibration site.

AB  - The Sentinel-3A (S3A) altimeter flies over the Dan'gan island (ascending Pass 309), which was located at the south of Guangdong province, China. The sea level was measured using float type water level gauge and aquatrak 5003 acoustic tide gauge to calibrate the sea surface height (SSH) of altimeters. The EGM 2008 geoid and NAO.99Jb tide model was used for geoid and tidal differences between the in-situ equipment and the footprints of the altimeter in this study. The bias of S3A altimeter was +7.8 +/- 28.9 mm in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode, and +16.0 +/- 38.4 mm in Low resolution mode (PLRM). The results agree well with other calibration sites. The static GNSS stations were also used for validation of microwave radiometers (MWR) in three campaigns. The wet troposphere correction derived from ECMWF and microwave radiometer product minus static GNSS stations were +11.2 +/- 11.6 mm and +4.4 +/- 12.9 mm, with correlation of 0.980 and 0.979.

TI  - Vegetation Growth Monitoring Based on BDS Interferometry Reflectometry With Triple-Frequency SNR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An emerging microwave remote sensing technology, global navigation satellite system interferometry reflectometry (GNSS-IR) shows the excellent application potential in vegetation remote sensing due to its all-weather and high temporal resolution characteristics. Previous studies for GNSS-IR have mainly concentrated on the global positioning system (GPS) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data. Because of the similarity between GPS and Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), the signal of BDS can also be impacted by vegetation, which, however, has not been comprehensively researched. Therefore, this letter acquires the normalized amplitude of the BDS SNR data based on triple-frequency SNR observations collected by two stations with different vegetation types. To reveal the impact of different vegetation growth conditions on the BDS multifrequency signals, we conduct a comparative analysis with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data obtained by Sentinel-2 and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. The outcomes demonstrate that the normalized amplitude of the BDS signal exhibits a strong association with Sentinel-2 NDVI, with correlation coefficients varying from 0.69 to 0.83 and 0.78 to 0.84 at P041 and P105, respectively. In addition, it is the first time discovered that harvesting vegetation around the stations leads to a cliff-like decrease in normalized amplitude. Compared with optical remote sensing vegetation monitoring methods, BDS-IR shows significant temporal resolution and sensitivity advantages. This finding may promote vegetation monitoring, vegetation protection, and other related research fields.

TI  - ECOLOGICAL SECURITY MEASUREMENT BASED ON FUNCTIONALITY-ORGANIZATION-STABILITY IN INLAND OF THREE GORGES RESERVOIR AREA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal heterogeneity of landscape ecological security has been carried out for the Zhong County in this work based on the framework of "functionality-organization-stability" using the multidate Landsat TM image of 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018 as the basic data. During the research period, landscape ecological security situation in Zhong County indicates a trend of deteriorating. The high ecological security zone was constantly shifting to the low ecological security zone from 2000 to 2018. The ratios were 13.40%, 61.32%, 28.34%, and 13.33%. The low ecological security area in research area focuses on the northeast part and middle part, while the high-security area focuses on Yangtze river way and its both sides and Northwest. The main obstacle factor of landscape ecological security transfers into stability from functionality. Therefore it suggests to optimize land use pattern in landscape planning and construction in the future in order to raise the landscape ecological security level.

TI  - Mar Menor lagoon (SE Spain) chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and turbidity estimation with Sentinel-2
T2  - LIMNETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mar Menor is a Mediterranean Coastal lagoon with high environmental and social value, but has suffered important episodes of contamination in recent years due to heavy rains, sediment dragging and polluting substances mainly from agriculture as well as the entry of mining waste, causing an increase in eutrophication. Water quality variables such as chlorophyll-a concentration [Chl-a] and turbidity, can be studied through its optical properties by remote sensing techniques. In this work, a methodology is proposed for monitoring [Chl-a] and the turbidity of the Mar Menor using Sentinel-2 images. For this purpose, an extensive database of both variables was used consisting of data taken on different dates between 2016 and 2019 at 12 points of Mar Menor. The images were atmospherically corrected using Case 2 Regional Coast Color Processor (C2RCC) version for turbid waters (C2X) to obtain the water surface reflectance. Then several arithmetic relations between database and reflectance bands used in the bibliography for [Chl-a] and turbidity were analyzed. Comparing the results of each one of these relations with the in situ data, decided that the best index for [Chl-a] estimation is the relation (R560 + R705)/(R560 + R665) with an RMSE = 2.6 mg/m(3) and a NRMSE = 9.1 % and for turbidity R705*R705/R490 with an RMSE = 1.5 NTU and a NRMSE=10.9 %. Finally, by applying these relationships on different dates, thematic maps of [Chl-a] and turbidity of Mar Menor were obtained. One of these images was some days after September 2019 torrential rains, in which a considerable [Chl-a] and turbidity increase was observed.

TI  - First Quasi-Synchronous Hurricane Quad-Polarization Observations by C-Band Radar Constellation Mission and RADARSAT-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first presentation of quasi-synchronous spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) high-resolution images acquired from C-band Radar Constellation Mission (RCM) and RADARSAT-2 consisting of quad-polarization (HH + HV + VH + VV) wide-swath observations of Hurricane Epsilon. These measurements clearly show that the denoised HV- and VH-polarized normalized radar cross sections (NRCSs) have great consistency. NRCS values at HV- and VH-polarizations are more sensitive to wind speeds and less sensitive to incidence angles or wind directions than those at HH and VV for hurricane force winds. For large incidence angles and high wind speeds, the sensitivity of HH-polarized NRCS to wind speed is higher than that of VV. HH- and VV-polarized NRCSs gradually lose wind direction dependency at high winds. It is notable that the time interval between the two SAR acquisitions is only 3 min. This allows for a direct comparison of HV- and VH-polarized images to investigate the variations in high-resolution backscattering within the hurricane vortex, thereby revealing the most dynamical areas. An asymmetric dynamic is observed around the eye of Hurricane Epsilon, based on positive and negative differences (VH-HV) in the western and eastern parts of the eye. The impacts of rain on quad-polarized NRCS are also examined using collocated rain rates from the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) and wind speeds from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). Significant rain-induced NRCS attenuations are about 1.7 dB for HH and VV, and 2.2 dB for HV and VH, when the rain rate is 20 mm/h. These attenuations are associated with rain-induced turbulence and atmospheric absorption. This work shows that the collocated RCM and RADARSAT-2 hurricane observations provide a unique analysis of synoptic and joint C-band measurements of the ocean surface in quad-polarization; this is noteworthy in view of preparations for the next generation of dual-polarization scatterometer (SCA) onboard second-generation meteorological operational satellite program (MetOp-SG).

AB  - This paper proposes a landslide detection method combining gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and polarization decomposition technique. The proposed method makes full use of the characteristics of the SAR image and combines the polarization information with the texture feature. Landslide candidate areas were identified using GLCM and final landslide areas were determined using polarization decomposition techniques. The data used for evaluation is taken from Guangyuan City, Sichuan, China. The proposed method successfully detects the changes of two SLC sentinel-1A C-band VV and VH dual polarization SAR images before and after the landslide, which proves the effectiveness of this method.

AB  - Due to advances in remote sensing satellite imaging and image processing technologies and their wide applications, intelligent remote sensing satellites are facing an opportunity for rapid development. The key technologies, standards, and laws of intelligent remote sensing satellites are also experiencing a series of new challenges. Novel concepts and key technologies in the intelligent hyperspectral remote sensing satellite system have been proposed since 2011. The aim of these intelligent remote sensing satellites is to provide real-time, accurate, and personalized remote sensing information services. This article reviews the current developments in new-generation intelligent remote sensing satellite systems, with a focus on intelligent remote sensing satellite platforms, imaging payloads, onboard processing systems, and other key technological chains.

AB  - This study maps canopy height (CH) of mangrove forests using multi-sensor remote-sensing observations with deep learning methods. The multi-sensor data include satellite observations of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Landsat-8 optical, and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The study focuses on the south Florida Everglades mangrove forests, which experienced severe damage caused by Hurricane Irma in September 2017. We developed two innovative neural network models to predict CH from SAR and optical data. The models mapped mangrove CH the year following Hurricane Irma with an RMSE of about 3 m. The innovative deep learning methods achieves better accuracy than other traditional machine learning models.

AB  - Fractional snow cover (FSC) mapping with high spatiotemporal resolution is of great significance to the study of surface hydrological processes, agricultural irrigation, and disaster monitoring. In this study, we use the spectral mixture analysis based on automatic endmember extraction (MESMA-AGE) algorithm to retrieve FSC from Landsat-5/7/8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The algorithm can produce FSC product with 30m spatial resolution and 4-day temporal resolution at regional scale, even globally with GEE. The result shows that the accuracy of the FSC product is high with the root mean square error (RMSE) being 0.18 with the comparison of Gaofen-2 imageries.

TI  - Fast and Slow Changes Constrained Spatio-Temporal Subpixel Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subpixel mapping (SPM) is a technique to tackle the mixed-pixel problem and produces land cover and land use (LCLU) maps at a finer spatial resolution than the original coarse data. However, uncertainty exists unavoidably in SPM, which is an ill-posed downscaling problem. Spatio-temporal SPM methods have been proposed to deal with this uncertainty, but current methods fail to explore fully the information in the time-series images, especially more rapid changes over a short-time interval. In this article, a fast and slow changes constrained spatio-temporal subpixel mapping (FSSTSPM) method is proposed to account for fast LCLU changes over a short time interval and slow changes over a long time interval. Both fast and slow changes-based temporal constraints are proposed and incorporated simultaneously into the FSSTSPM to increase the accuracy of SPM. The proposed FSSTSPM method was validated using two synthetic datasets with various proportion errors. It was also applied to oil-spill mapping using a real PlanetScope-Sentinel-2 dataset and Amazon deforestation mapping using a real Landsat-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. The results demonstrate the superiority of FSSTSPM. Moreover, the advantage of FSSTSPM is more obvious with an increase in proportion errors. The concepts of the fast and slow changes, together with the derived temporal constraints, provide a new insight to enhance SPM by taking fuller advantage of the temporal information in the available time-series images.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter affecting environmental processes such as hydrology, ecology and climate. Microwave remote sensing is an effective means of surface soil moisture measurement. Aiming at the influence of vegetation cover in the process of surface soil moisture inversion of winter wheat farmland by microwave remote sensing, a cooperative inversion method using multi-source remote sensing data is proposed in this paper. Thirty-three feature parameters are extracted from Radarsat-2 full polarization SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data, and ten parameters with high correlation with soil moisture are selected to participate in soil moisture inversion by Pearson correlation analysis. Combined with the ground sampling data, four machine learning models, including Random Forest, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Radial Basis Function and Extreme Learning Machine, are used for quantitative inversion of soil moisture to reduce the impact of vegetation and improve the inversion accuracy. The experimental results show that the Random Forest model is the optimal. The average of determination coefficient is 0.63959, and the average of root mean square error is 0.0317 cm(3)/cm(3), which provides a reference for the inversion of soil moisture in farmland using multi-source remote sensing data.

TI  - Fast extraction of winter wheat planting area in Huang-Huai-Hai Plain using high-resolution satellite imagery on a cloud computing platform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - To extract regional winter wheat planting area using higher-resolution satellite imagery still faces many challenges due to large data size and long processing time in traditional remote sensing classification. Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud computing analysis platform based on global geospatial analysis, provides a new opportunity for rapid analysis of remote sensing data. In this study, high-quality Landsat-8 imagery was used to extract the winter wheat planting area from the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in China. The random forest algorithm was used to identify and map the winter wheat sown in 2019 and harvested in 2020, and Sentinel-2 imagery was used to verify the results. The spectral indices, texture, and terrain features of the image were derived, and their contribution to the classification accuracy of winter wheat was evaluated by scoring. Then the top nine features were selected to form an optimal feature subset. Comparing the set of thirty-four features and the optimized feature subset as the input variables of the random forest classifier, the results show that the accuracy difference between the two feature classification schemes is small, but the classification effect of all feature sets is slightly better than the optimal feature subset. The overall classification accuracy of sample plots verification was 86%-95%, the Kappa coefficient was between 0.7 and 0.85, and the percentage error of the total area was 5.42%. The research demonstrates a reliable method for mapping a wide range of winter wheat planting area, and provides a good prospect for exploring the precise mapping of other crops, which is of great significance to crop monitoring and agricultural development.

TI  - The Simultaneous Prediction of Soil Properties and Vegetation Coverage from Vis-NIR Hyperspectral Data with a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network: A Laboratory Simulation Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of land surface mostly obtains a mixture of spectral information of soil and vegetation. It is thus of great value if soil and vegetation information can be acquired simultaneously from one model. In this study, we designed a laboratory experiment to simulate land surface compositions, including various soil types with varying soil moisture and vegetation coverage. A model of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) was established to simultaneously estimate soil properties (organic matter, soil moisture, clay, and sand) and vegetation coverage based on the hyperspectral data measured in the experiment. The results showed that the model achieved excellent predictions for soil properties (R-2 = 0.88-0.91, RPIQ = 4.01-5.78) and vegetation coverage (R-2 = 0.95, RPIQ = 7.75). Compared with the partial least-squares regression (PLSR), the prediction accuracy of 1DCNN improved 42.20%, 45.82%, 43.32%, and 36.46% in terms of the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for predicting soil organic matter, sand, clay, and soil moisture, respectively. The improvement might be caused by the fact that the spectral preprocessing and spectral features useful for predicting soil properties were successfully identified in the 1DCNN model. For the prediction of vegetation coverage, although the prediction accuracy by 1DCNN was excellent, its performance (R-2 = 0.95, RPIQ = 7.75, RMSE = 3.92%) was lower than the PLSR model (R-2 = 0.98, RPIQ = 12.57, RMSE = 2.41%). These results indicate that 1DCNN can simultaneously predict soil properties and vegetation coverage. However, the factors such as surface roughness and vegetation type that could affect the prediction accuracy should be investigated in the future.

AB  - Duyun Maojian tea is a famous tea in China. In this study, the specific-locus amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing method was used to analyze the population structure and conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2 leaf traits of 123 tea plants in Qiannan, China. A total of 462,019 SLAF tags and 11,362,041 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were obtained. The results of phylogenetic tree analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis showed that 123 tea germplasms were clustered into three groups, and the heterozygosity rates for Groups I, II, and II were 0.206, 0.224, and 0.34, respectively. Generally, tea germplasms in a production area are clustered in a group, indicating that tea germplasms in different production areas have certain genetic diversity. The traditional Duyun Maojian tea core production areas, TS and DC-SJ, are clustered into Group I and Group II respectively, while the ZY production area is relatively independent in Group III. Furthermore, based on GWAS analysis, 11 candidate genes related to leaf apex and 7 candidate genes related to leaf shape were obtained. This study clarified the genetic relationship among eight Duyun Maojian tea production areas and obtained candidate genes related to leaf apex and leaf shape development. The results showed that population structure and candidate genes are an effective basis for the breeding of Duyun Maojian tea germplasm.

TI  - Cloud-Free Land Surface Temperature Reconstructions Based on MODIS Measurements and Numerical Simulations for Characterizing Surface Urban Heat Islands
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) data in the thermal infrared (TIR) band measured by the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument are critical for studying surface urban heat islands (SUHIs); however, these acquired TIR LST data are contaminated by clouds, so it is crucial to develop a method to generate cloud-free LST products. In this article, employing Tianjin as the research area, we combined the weather research and forecasting model with a random forest and a spatial optimization algorithm to propose a cloud-free MODIS-like model (WRFFM). The model can reconstruct cloud-free MODIS-like ISTs and SUHIs are studied. The spatial patterns of the WRFFM LSTs and the MODIS LSTs are consistent; the correlation coefficients in July and December range from 0.8 to 0.91 and 0.8 to 0.93, respectively, and the root mean square errors range from 0.5 to 3.8 K and 0.4 to 1.8 K, respectively, indicating that the modeled results are accurate. We use these WRFFM LSTs to study SUHIs and evaluate the deviations between the MODIS SUHIs and WRFFM SUHIs. When the proportion of clear-sky pixels is below 30%, the deviation is above 3 K, and when the proportion of clear-sky pixels is above 80%, the deviation is below 0.6 K. The results indicate that the developed model can be applied to improve the study of SUHIs and that the number of clear-sky pixels for a city is an important factor that affects the bias relative to the actual SUHI.

AB  - Due to the unique imaging mechanism and wide application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), SAR image interpretation has been researched by more and more scholars. The supervised SAR image semantic segmentation methods that based on deep learning require a large number of accurate pixel-level labels, which are very hard to obtain. The lack of labeled samples limits the practical application of deep learning methods in SAR image semantic segmentation. To reduce the requirement of labeled data, we decided to introduce the cross pseudo-supervision network (CPS-Net) into SAR image semi-supervised semantic segmentation and promote the development of semi-supervised learning in SAR image interpretation. The semi-supervised segmentation based on CPS-Net has the following advantages: (1) CPS-Net encourages high similarity between two networks with the same input data, which helps improve the performance. (2) CPS-Net can make better use of the pseudo-supervision of unlabeled data to guide the network training. Experimental results show that CPS-Net achieves excellent semi-supervised semantic segmentation results on Sentinel-1 dual-polarization data with less labeled data. Compared with well-known semantic segmentation methods U-Net and DeeplabV3+, the performance of SAR image segmentation is significantly improved.

AB  - For the on-orbit high resolution satellites, attitude jitter is a common and complex phenomenon which may deteriorate the image quality and mapping accuracy. In this paper, an image-based jitter inversion and estimation model is derived considering time delay integration (TDI) effect, and the attitude is then updated by taking into account the estimated jitter information. The imagery is finally resampled through virtual re-imaging using the updated accurate attitude to improve the image geometric quality. The proposed method is validated by experiments using the Chinese Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite imagery.

AB  - SAR is usually subject to strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) during electronic reconnaissance missions, which will seriously weaken its ability of surveying and mapping. This paper presents a novel method for SAR image interference suppression based on the encoder-decoder network (named as ISEDnet). ISEDnet mainly consists of consecutive feature extraction net (FEN), the additional encoder-decoder network, and the image supervision mechanism. FEN is used to extract the features of interfered SAR images, and the Encoder-Decoder network (EDN) is used to suppress interference of SAR images. The image supervision mechanism is proposed to recover the target features. The network trained with simulation and real measurement data, the effectiveness of ISEDnet are verified by both simulation and the Sentinel-1 satellite SAR images. Compared to the traditional notch filtering method, ISEDnet can successfully suppress different types of SAR interference and improve interference suppression performance.

AB  - Internal solitary waves play an important role in oceanic energy mixing, engineering construction, and will cause convergence and divergence phenomena, leading to tilt changes on the sea surface. The introduction of the X-Bragg model realizes the description of the rough disturbance effect, obtains the angle beta that can characterize the sea surface tilt, and constructs the internal solitary wave-induced sea surface tilt change index Delta beta. The statistical values of sea surface tilt changes caused by internal solitary waves calculated using ALOS PALSAR images range from 0 to 30%.

AB  - Satellite detection has been an advantageous method in wildfire detection for its near-real-time monitoring and large coverage. In this paper, a time scale base wildfire detection is proposed based on himawari-8 satellite data. Firstly, we used adjusted Otsu algorithm to remove the cloud mask. Afterwards, 7 previous data of each 10 minutes before the current time of a pixel is input into a Long Short Term (LSTM) network to predict current data. Finally, the predicted data was compared with the ground truth to determine fire. The result showed a high accuracy in prediction and better performance in determining wildfire compared with traditional dynamic threshold method. The experiment is limited by the time of the selected wildfire data and expected to test the performance over different period.

TI  - Adaptive Multiscale Superpixel Embedding Convolutional Neural Network for Land Use Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, a large number of remote sensing images with different resolutions are available for Earth observation and land monitoring, which are inevitably demanding intelligent analysis techniques for accurately identifying and classifying land use (LU). This article proposes an adaptive multiscale superpixel embedding convolutional neural network architecture (AMUSE-CNN) for tackling LU classification. Initially, the images are parsed via the superpixel representation so that the object-based analysis (via a superpixel embedding convolutional neural network scheme) can be carried out with the pixel context and neighborhood information. Then, a multiscale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) is proposed to classify the superpixel-based images by identifying object features across a variety of scales simultaneously, in which multiple window sizes are used to fit to the various geometries of different LU classes. Furthermore, a proposed adaptive strategy is applied to best exert the classification capability of the MS-CNN. Subsequently, two modules are developed to fully implement the AMUSE-CNN architecture. More specifically, Module I is to determine the most suitable classes for each window size (scale) by applying majority voting to a series of MS-CNNs Module II carries out the classification of the classes identified in Module I for the given scale used in the MS-CNN and, therefore, complete the LU classification of the entire classes. The proposed AMUSE-CNN architecture is both quantitatively and qualitatively validated using remote sensing data collected from two cities, Kano and Lagos in Nigeria, due to the spatially complex LU distribution. Experimental results show the superior performance of our approach against several state-of-the-art techniques.

TI  - Retrieval of Daytime Surface Upward Longwave Radiation Under All-Sky Conditions With Remote Sensing and Meteorological Reanalysis Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) is a key parameter that regulates surface radiation budget balance and matter-energy exchange. However, the state-of-the-art SULR retrieval methods based on remotely sensed data are only effective under clear skies, which mean that the existing methods are unable to generate spatiotemporal continuous SULR product at regional or global scale. Herein, taking the advantage of long-pending abundant ground-based radiation observations, satellite products, and meteorological reanalysis data, a data-driven random forest (RF) method is proposed to retrieve the instantaneous SULR under all-sky conditions. Based on spectral samples of different surface types and simulation results from the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission (MODTRAN), spectral transformation is carried out to transform SULR of various measured domains into the defined 4-100 mu m domain at first. SULR and surface downward shortwave radiation (SDSR) observations from seven stations of the surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) and nine stations of the baseline surface radiation network (BSRN) are used in model's training and testing procedures, and the RF model achieves a high accuracy with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 10.45 W/m(2) on test set. In model evaluation, ground measurements from 14 stations of FLUXNET have been used, and the overall RMSE is 18.40 W/m(2). In the actual application process, SDSR is estimated by remotely sensed data of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). The accuracy of RF model has been validated with the observations from five stations of BSRN in 2021, and RMSEs are 17.00, 10.94, 12.17, 27.89, and 12.54 W/m(2), respectively. Validation result shows that the data-driven method is capable of estimating SULR under all-sky conditions with a high accuracy. Finally, sensitivity analysis has been carried out, and the established RF model keeps robust even though there are great uncertainties among input parameters.

TI  - COMPACT-POL SAR URBAN AREA EXTRACTION WITH EXTENDED POLARIMETRIC CORRELATION PATTERN

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Compact polarimetry synthetic aperture radar (compact-pol SAR) provides relatively rich polarimetric information while maintaining a wide swath, which is quite suitable for the earth observation. Urban area is important observation of remote sensing. However, the backscattering of manmade targets, including urban areas, is sensitive to the relative geometry between target orientation and the radar line of sight, which still makes urban area extraction a challenge. Polarimetric correlation pattern is a tool to mine target hidden information within scattering diversity. This study extends the polarimetric correlation pattern to compact-pol SAR for urban area extraction, which mainly contains three steps. Firstly, pseudo quad polarimetry (qual-pol) data is generated from compact-pol SAR data based on Nord's method. Then, polarimetric correlation pattern features are extended to pseudo quad-pol data. Finally, the urban area is extracted using the superpixel CFAR detection method. Experimental studies are carried out with airborne PiSAR and spaceborne ALOS-2 datasets. Compared with traditional compact-pol features, the proposed extended polarimetric correlation pattern features achieve superior performances.

AB  - As an integral part of the Chinese tradition, ancient Chinese ink culture has its own independent framework. The ink wash painting has its ideological foundation upon this ink culture, and its way of thinking echoes with the typical Eastern holistic worldview, presenting unique artistic conception and affection with ink image, which bears ancient Chinese people’s comprehension and reflection of the order of nature, the truth of life and the charm of culture. The view of drawing form for ancient ink wash painting is based on the visual experience of “traveling sight”, “mindful acknowledging” and location management to portray the shape and spirit of nature and manifest the holistic cosmology of the unity of man and nature in its artistic conception.

TI  - Cloud Detection Method Using CNN Based on Cascaded Feature Attention and Channel Attention
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is of great significance for the subsequent analysis and application of remote-sensing images, and it is a critical part of remote-sensing image preprocessing. In this article, we propose a cloud detection method using convolutional neural networks based on cascaded feature attention and channel attention (CFCA-Net). The CFCA-Net uses cascaded feature attention module (CFAM) to enhance the attention of the network toward important color feature and texture feature. The CFAM cascaded the color feature attention and texture feature attention module in the encoder. The CFAN-Net also uses channel attention to highlight the important information in the channel dimensions. The attention module is based on multi-scale features and uses dilated convolution with different dilation rates to obtain information about multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a loss function combined quadtree and binary cross-entropy (BCE) was also introduced to make the network focus on the edge of cloud area. We validated our CFCA-Net on the Gaofen-1 wide field-of-view (WFV) imagery dataset. The experimental results show that the CFCA-Net performs well under different scenarios, and its overall accuracy reaches 97.55%. Moreover, subjective cloud detection results also prove the effectiveness of our algorithm.

TI  - Improving wheat yield estimates using data augmentation models and remotely sensed biophysical indices within deep neural networks in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation and prediction constitutes a key issue in agricultural management, particularly under the context of demographic pressure and climate change. Currently, the main challenge in estimating crop yields based on remotely sensed data and data-driven methods is how to cope with small datasets and the limited amount of annotated samples. In order to cope with small datasets and the limited amount of annotated samples and improve the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China, this study proposed a method of combining generative adversarial networks (GANs) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for comprehensive growth monitoring of winter wheat, in which the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) and meteorological data at four growth stages of winter wheat during 2012-2017 were generated as the inputs of multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and GAN was employed to artificially increase the number of training samples. Then, a linear regression model between the simulated comprehensive growth monitoring (I) and the measured yields was established to estimate yields of winter wheat in the Guanzhong Plain pixel by pixel. The final results showed when GAN was used to double the size of the training samples, and the simulation values obtained by CNN based on augmented samples using GAN provided a better training (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.05), validation (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.16) and testing (R2 = 0.50, RMSE = 0.14) performance than that just using the original samples. The achieved best pixel-scale yield estimation accuracy of winter wheat (R2 = 0.50, RMSE = 591.46 kg/ha) in the Guanzhong Plain. These results showed that small samples can be enlarged by GAN, thus, more important features for reflecting the growth conditions and yields of winter wheat from the remotely sensed indices and meteorological indices can be extracted, and indicated that CNN accompanied with GAN could contribute a lot to the comprehensive growth monitoring and yield estimation of winter wheat and data augmentation methods are extremely useful for the application of small samples in deep learning.

AB  - To solve the problem of low coverage of MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, this letter proposes a 3-D spatiotemporal interpolation method to predict missing values for time series AOD products. In this study, ordinary Kriging interpolation and 3-D spatiotemporal interpolation are applied to analyze the dynamics of AOD in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTHUA), China, and the performances of the two methods are compared. The results show that the 3-D spatiotemporal interpolation has a better performance in predicting missing data of AOD products. The proposed interpolation method provides a feasible solution for the establishment of long-term MODIS aerosol products with temporal and spatial consistency, and also provides effective data support for the study of urban environmental changes.

TI  - Improving Deep Learning-Based Cloud Detection for Satellite Images With Attention Mechanism
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds in satellite images limit the ability of imagery to extract the ground information, which makes it difficult to the following image analysis tasks. Hence, cloud detection is a changeling but fundamental task in the preprocessing of satellite image processing. In this letter, an encoder-decoder neural network architecture, cloud detection with ACON and attention mechanism (CAA)-UNet, is proposed for cloud detection. CAA-UNet is based on U-Net architecture and incorporates the attention mechanism. The asymmetric encoder and decoder blocks are proposed to discover more discriminative features. Then, a modified attention gate is integrated into each skip connection to highlight salient features. These make our model distinguish between the cloud and noncloud more accurately. Furthermore, the recent new and effective activate function, ActivateOrNot (ACON), is introduced into our model, which allows each neuron to adaptively activate or not, and improves the performance remarkably. Finally, the experiment results on two cloud datasets, Landsat-8 and a high-resolution cloud (HRC) cover validation dataset, show that CAA-UNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially in comprehensive indicators: Jaccard index, F-1 score, and overall accuracy.

AB  - Multiple source satellite datasets, including the Gaofen (GF) series and Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral, are provided to detect and monitor the floods. Considering the complexity of land cover changes within the flooded areas and the different characteristics of the multi-source remote sensing dataset, we proposed a new coarse-to-fine framework for detecting floods at a large scale. Firstly, the coarse results of the water body were generated by the binary segmentation of GF-3 SAR, the water indexes of GF-1/6 multispectral, and Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral images. Secondly, the fine results were achieved by the deep neural networks with noisy-label learning. More specifically, the Unet with the T-revision is adopted as the noisy label learning method. The results demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of water mapping retrieved by the noisy learning method. Finally, the differences in flooding patterns in different regions were also revealed. We presented examples of Poyang Lake to show the results of our framework. The rapid and robust flood monitoring method proposed is of great practical significance to the dynamic monitoring of flood situations and the quantitative assessment of flood disasters based on multiple Chinese satellite datasets.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Prediction of Alpine Vegetation Dynamic Change Based on a ConvGRU Neural Network Model: A Case Study of the Upper Heihe River Basin in Northwest China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and comprehensive vegetation prediction methods are essential for effective agricultural planning and budgeting. Most existing vegetation prediction methods rely on sampling points rather than on overall spatiotemporal characteristics, making it difficult to accurately forecast vegetation changes. Hence, we built a neural network model with encoding and decoding modules based on a convolution gate recurrent unit (ConvGRU) and applied it to spatiotemporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) predictions for the upper Heihe river basin (UHRB) in the Qilian Mountains, China. Based on MODIS NDVI raster data for the UHRB for 2000-2020, the analysis of the region's spatiotemporal characteristics showed that the NDVI varied significantly over time. To avoid the gradient disappearance problem during ConvGRU model prediction, we proposed several numerical scaling methods for preprocessing the data before conducting training and prediction. We then constructed a spatiotemporal prediction model based on the ConvGRU, trained and predicted the numerically scaled data, and used various metrics to evaluate the model. The results showed that the grouping tanh-ln function fitting was the least erroneous, and the ConvGRU model using data scaled by this method performed well across various metrics according to the test-set results. Also, unlike traditional time series prediction methods, the model accounted for spatiotemporal correlation features, and the output data of the prediction model were continuous and intuitive. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for predicting dynamic vegetation changes. The NDVI prediction trend analysis indicated that the vegetation in the UHRB should improve in the future.

TI  - Simulating the Relationship between Land Use/Cover Change and Urban Thermal Environment Using Machine Learning Algorithms in Wuhan City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes of land use/land cover (LULC) are important factor affecting the intensity of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Based on Landsat image data of Wuhan, this paper uses cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict future changes in LULC and LST. The results show that the built-up area of Wuhan has expanded, reaching 511.51 and 545.28 km(2), while the area of vegetation, water bodies and bare land will decrease to varying degrees in 2030 and 2040. If the built-up area continues to expand rapidly, the proportion of 30~35 degrees C will rise to 52.925% and 55.219%, and the affected area with the temperature >35 degrees C will expand to 15.264 and 33.612 km(2), respectively. The direction of the expansion range of the LST temperature range is obviously similar to the expansion of the built-up area. In order to control and alleviate UHI, the rapid expansion of impervious layers (built-up areas) should be avoided to the greatest extent, and the city's "green development" strategy should be implemented.

AB  - Multi-source joint classification has been extensively investigated in single scenario setting; however, for cross scene (CS) classification, few studies have been conducted for evaluating the collaborative performance of multi-sources. In this paper, using hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, we propose a multi-source CS classification method, and build source-related alignment to reduce statistical shift. Both geometrical and statistical alignments are considered to learn common-subspaces of each source with preserving discrimination information. Finally, the aligned features from both sources are integrated for final classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art CS approaches.

TI  - GF-4 Satellite Fire Detection With an Improved Contextual Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GF-4 satellite has a moderate spatial resolution and is capable of high temporal frequency observation. Thus, it can play an important role in the acquisition of information regarding fires. In this article, the characteristics of brightness temperature difference between fire point area and nonfire point area are comprehensively analyzed. Employing the advantages of high-frequency continuous observation of these data, an improved algorithm for joint spatial attribute detection using multitemporal data is proposed. This method is based on the traditional contextual method and incorporates the concept of time sequence, and uses the changes in time phase before and after the fire to reduce the false alarm caused by the high heterogeneity of pixels in a single spatial scene in the traditional method. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, the perfect moderate resolution imaging spectrometer thermal anomaly product is used as the verification data to evaluate the feasibility of the algorithm. At the same time, it is necessary to compare the algorithm in this article with the fire algorithm currently applied to GF-4 with the four typical regions. The improved algorithm shows better drawing ability, and the consistency of fire description of biomass combustion for many days is improved. In the case of the Heilongjiang region on October 30, 2017, the accuracy rate is improved by 62%, compared with the contextual method.

AB  - The inherent speckle generally affects the feature mining in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image terrain classification. In this paper, we propose a polarimetric feature mining method for terrain classification using graph-based low-rank and sparse decomposition, named as PFMGLS, to decompose the effective polarimetric information from speckle and mine the principal discriminative features for terrain classification. Firstly, we segment the PolSAR image into superpixels. Within each superpixel, the data almost belong to a consistent terrain class and the polarimetric features are highly correlated and assumed to be of low-rank structure, with the outliers arisen form speckle constituting a sparse matrix due to its randomness and low correlation. Then, the PFMGLS implements graph-based low-rank and sparse decomposition by introducing a graph regularization which characterizes the feature similarities of multiple superpixels. The classification experiments on Gaofen-3 data demonstrate the PFMGLS can obtain accurate low-rank information of polarimetric features within each superpixel and effectively mine principal discriminative features for classification with the outliers being suppressed in the meantime, thus enhancing the classification accuracy effectively.

AB  - This paper discusses the temperature factors leading to permafrost instability, and explains the causes of permafrost instability from the perspective of land surface temperature (LST). First, the land surface deformation of the typical permafrost area in some period is extracted by the using the dual-track differential interferometry (D-InSAR) technique with Sentinel-1A single look complex(SLC) data. Next, the annual average LST and LST range are calculated using the spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm for MYD11A2 products. Comparing the distribution of land surface deformation and LST, findings show that permafrost regions with lower average annual LST and larger annual temperature range are more unstable and more prone to surface deformation. This research can contribute to unveiling the process where LST affects the freezing and thawing of permafrost.

AB  - Wildfires vary across space and time, precisely and timely mapping on the wildfire affected areas is critical for wildfire management, population and property protection, and environmental impact assessment. In this study, we established a large-scale annotated wildfire burned area dataset based on freely available Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data and Canada Wildfire Burned Area Database. This dataset includes bi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, which allows users to exploit remotely sensed data acquired in both optical and microwave domains. On the proposed dataset, we achieved the highest IoU score of 0.86 on the Sentinel-2 data with Siamese U-Net, and the highest IoU score of 0.80 on the Sentinel-1 data using U-Net with early fusion. The combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 failed to bring significant improvement compared to Sentinel-2 based results, but this dataset may have the potential to boost Sentinel-1 based results with Sentinel-2 data for near real-time wildfire progression mapping.

TI  - Retrieval of the Soil Salinity From Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarized SAR Data Based on Deep Neural Network Regression
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a significant environmental indicator, directly reflecting the land quality and its productivity. In this work, dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data were exploited to retrieve the soil salinity in saline-affected fields based on the deep neural network (DNN) theory. Two polarimetric features gotten from Cloude polarization decomposition, together with six other features, were calculated and selected from ten features according to the feature importance. The DNN regression model for soil salinity (DNNR-S) based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network, quantifying the relationship between the eight feature parameters and soil salinity, was established to retrieve the soil salinity in northeastern China. Compared with other five traditional machine learning regression methods [logistic regression (LOR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression (DTR), and multilayer perceptron regression (MPR)], DNNR-S is the best-performing model with the performance of root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.28, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.21, and r = 0.74. Using the proposed model, the soil salinity was retrieved, and 52.37% was found to be affected by salinization which was in general agreement with the government report. Due to the training criteria in the proposed model, it was a little more computationally intensive than all the others, but the DNNR-S had the advantage of easy spread to other study areas.

TI  - Fusion of All-Weather Land Surface Temperature From AMSR-E and MODIS Data Using Random Forest Regression
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of preceding study of microwave (MW) land surface temperature (LST) downscaling, this letter proposed an all-weather LST fusion method based on random forest (RF) and evaluated it using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) LSTs in four areas of China that represent different landscapes. The results show that the RF method can effectively avoid the problem of oversmoothing patterns derived by the widely used Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method and obtained LSTs more consistent with reality. Taking MODIS LST in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (YGP) region and the border of Shanxi Province and Henan Province (BSH) region as a reference, the accuracy of RF method improved up to 13% and 11% compared with those of BME method under different cloud proportions. Taking field observations in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) and the Naqu area as references, the accuracy of RF-derived LST under cloudy conditions is basically consistent with that of MODIS LST in clear sky, differing by only 0.004-0.067 K. Due to the introduction of environmental variables, the performance of RF method is more stable than that of the BME method under different cloud proportions. In summary, RF is promising for fusing MW and thermal infrared (TIR) LSTs.

AB  - ET processes have been widely assessed through in-situ measuring and modelling methods. However, it is challenging to measure actual ET and upscale it to regional level for karst landscapes. In this study, five plots were built to observe actual ET based on Thermal Dissipation Probes (TDP), re-designed Ventilated-chamber and in-site Micro-lysimeters in a karst watershed in southwest China. Then, three models (Penman-Monteith-Leurning, PML; Remote Sensing-Priestley and Taylor, RS-PT; and Hargreaves) were constructed to upscale ET estimation to the regional level based on Landsat-8 images and MODIS data. The results showed that: 1) The PML model performed better than other models with higher R2 values and smaller RMSE values; 2) Soil thickness exhibited obvious positive control effect (R2 = 0.54) with yearly ET; 3) Ground temperature had a negative correlation with ET. This study is helpful to improve the accuracy of measured and upscaling estimated ET to the regional level.

TI  - SAR4LCZ-Net: A Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network for Local Climate Zones Classification Using Gaofen-3 Quad-Pol SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent local climate zones (LCZ) classification scheme provides spatially fine granular descriptions of inner urban morphology. It is universally applicable to cities worldwide and capable of supporting various urban studies. Although optical and dual-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data continue to push the frontiers of this task, the potential of quad-pol SAR data for LCZ classification is not yet explored. In this article, we propose a novel complex-valued convolutional neural network (CNN), SAR4LCZ-Net, to tackle this challenge. SAR4LCZ-Net improves the state-of-the-art by exploiting two facts of this specific task: the semantic hierarchical structure of the LCZ classification scheme and the complex-valued nature of quad-pol SAR data. To validate the performance of our algorithm, we generate a Chinese Gaofen-3 quad-pol SAR dataset for LCZ which covers 31 cities around the world. Results show that the proposed SAR4LCZ-Net improves 2.4% on overall accuracy (OA) and 4.5% on average accuracy (AA) compared with the real-valued CNN with the same structure. Gaofen-3 quad-pol SAR data also showed its advantage over the dual-pol Sentinel-1 data. It enhanced 5.0% on OA and 7.2% on AA in LCZ classification, under a fair comparison with a model trained by Sentinel-1 of the same area.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatio-Temporal Changes of Non-Cultivated Land via Long-Time Series Remote Sensing Images in Xinghua
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of cultivated land per capita in China is relatively low, and the phenomenon of non-cultivated land (NCL) in recent years has negatively impacted the stability of grain production in China. In this study, long-time series images obtained via satellite remote sensing were used to monitor spatio-temporal changes in NCL at the county scale. Seven-phase images were acquired from 1990 to 2020 (every five years) using medium-resolution Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and Sentinel MSI. Vegetation indices and texture features were extracted for all images. Terrain features such as slope, aspect and elevation were extracted from the DEM data. Combining vegetation index features, texture features, terrain features and multispectral bands, the image classification was performed using the random forest (RF) algorithm. The indices of classification accuracy assessment indices included overall accuracy (OA) and multiclass F-scores (F-m). Zonal statistics were used to calculate the area of cultivated land in towns for 1990 and 2020, and to create grades for the reduction of cultivated land. Finally, indicators including land use dynamic degree (LUDD), land use type change (LUTC) and land use change rate (LUCR) were adopted to reflect the spatio-temporal of NCL in the study area. The results show that RF classification algorithm achieves accurate and efficient land use extraction. The OA were greater than 86%, and the F-m were over 0.88. The cultivated land area in the study area showed decreasing trend. From 1990 to 2020, the ratio of cultivated land decreased from 59.75% to 50.21%. Meanwhile, the dynamic degree of cultivated land increased annually. The conversion of cultivated land into construction land was dominant, accounting for 31.84% of the total change in cultivated land over the past 30 years. This study also reveals that NCL is highly related to local economic and land-use policies. Multi-source remote sensing data have been used to quantitatively analyse the spatio-temporal changes in cultivated land conversion, providing a reference for relevant land management departments to master cultivated land use changes and adjust land management policies.

AB  - The advent of the era of Remote Sensing Big Data has produced a large number of processing and analysis tasks, which require powerful computing capabilities to support. The computational efficiency of distributed computer clusters which are the most commonly used parallel computing architecture for high performance computing can be significantly improved through an effective task scheduling strategy. In this paper, in order to improve data computing efficiency, we propose a dynamic load balancing strategy for remote sensing data processing workflow tasks based on the Hungarian algorithm for heterogeneous distributed computing clusters. We also compare this strategy with the classic load balancing algorithm. We find that the speed-up effect of the strategy proposed in this paper is better, and the speedups become more pronounced as the number of tasks increases.

Our objective is to provide a rapid and straightforward to use method that can tackle the waterline signature extraction from large-scale tidal flats in Sentinel-1 SAR images without re-training or manual interference. The statistical results show this DCNN-based method has appreciable accuracy for efficient extraction of waterline in SAR images even under complex imaging conditions (the mean precision and recall are 0.81 and 0.88, respectively), implying that this method is potential for rapid analysis of tidal flat topography evolution by using the waterline method.

AB  - For the existing hyperspectral image (HSI) band selection (BS) algorithm does not consider the strong correlation between adjacent bands and does not meet the high-precision extraction of single target, a HSI BS algorithm based on Markov clustering and target land-type spectral difference measurement is proposed in this paper. Specifically, when using Markov clustering for band clustering, the inter band correlation information is embedded and the noise or bad channel band breakpoint is set to adaptively divide the optimal band clustering subset. Then, in each cluster, based on the band difference under the supervision of target category, an evaluation criterion function is designed to select the optimal band combination for single target object extraction. The BS algorithm proposed in this paper is called MCLSD for short. Taking ZY-1 02D HSI in Tongnan of Chongqing as experimental data, taking cultivated land as extraction object and the Random Forest as classifier, the classification accuracy of the selected bands is evaluated. In addition, the MCLSD is compared with the improved sparse subspace clustering (ISSC) (Sun et al., 2015), orthogonal projection band selection (OPBS) (Zhang et al., 2018) and sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) (Qin and et al., 2015). Experimental results show that the MCLSD algorithm can select the most suitable band for cultivated land extraction and achieve higher classification accuracy. Especially when the number of bands is less than 5, the MCLSD algorithm has significant advantages over ISSC, OPBS and SNMF. So the MCLSD BS method can meet the demand of the high-precision extraction of target features from HSI data.

TI  - A Geometry-Discrete Minimum Reflectance Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (GeoMRA) for Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Over Heterogeneous Surfaces
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency aerosol observation from a new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite is capable to capture and monitor the spatiotemporal dynamic variation of aerosols, which is of vital significance to environmental research and climate studies. Due to the diversity and complexity of land cover, it is a challenge to retrieve aerosol properties with high accuracy over land, especially over heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, a geometry-discrete minimum reflectance aerosol retrieval algorithm (GeoMRA) has been proposed to retrieve 10-min high temporal resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets for geostationary Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor, aiming at providing universal bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) descriptions for different land surfaces with different heterogeneous extent. The AOD retrievals from GeoMRA demonstrate good consistency against the ground-based AERONET measurements in East Asia from 2015 to 2020, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.883 and approximately 65.6% of matchups falling within the expected error envelope of +/-(0.05% + 15%). Intercomparison between the GeoMRA retrieved AOD and other operational AOD products shows that the GeoMRA AOD retrievals, which generally possess similar spatial distribution and accuracy as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products, have better performances than the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) AOD products by providing more accurate AOD retrievals with higher spatial coverage. Moreover, the AOD bias analyses further demonstrate the robustness of GeoMRA algorithm, and an extreme haze event shows that the continuous GeoMRA AOD images illustrate smoother temporal variations than JAXA AOD products, demonstrating its efficacy and reliability in capturing the process of haze transport and monitoring the continuous spatiotemporal variation of aerosol. The above results suggest the considerable accuracy of GeoMRA algorithm for scientific application requirement and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed BRDF scheme in describing heterogeneous surfaces with diverse reflectance distribution.

TI  - Squeeze-and-Excitation Laplacian Pyramid Network With Dual-Polarization Feature Fusion for Ship Classification in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a squeeze-and-excitation Laplacian pyramid network with dual-polarization feature fusion (SE-LPN-DPFF) for ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. SE-LPN-DPFF offers three contributions: 1) dual-polarization (VV and VH) feature fusion (DPFF); 2) channel modeling by the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) to balance each polarization feature's contribution; and 3) Laplacian pyramid network (LPN) to achieve multiresolution analysis (MRA). Extensive ablation studies can confirm the effectiveness of each contribution. Results on the three- and six-category OpenSARShip datasets reveal the state-of-the-art SAR ship classification performance.

TI  - A Motion State Judgment and Radar Imaging Algorithm Selection Method for Ship
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar imaging for ships is hard because of the unpredictable motion states of ships. Existing ship radar imaging methods usually do not take the effects of different motion states into account, which leads to a degraded imaging result when the utilized imaging algorithm cannot match the target motion state. To solve this problem, a motion state judgment and radar imaging algorithm selection method is proposed, whose keys are to estimate the motion parameters of scatter points on the ship, judge the target motion state based on the space-variant features of the estimated motion parameters, and further choose a proper imaging algorithm to achieve the radar imaging result with higher quality. In this article, the radar imaging model of ship is first constructed, and the spatial variance features of motion parameters are quantitatively analyzed. Next, an improved motion parameter estimation method utilizing generalized Radon-Fourier transform (GRFT) modified by sidelobe-learning particle swarm optimization (SSLPSO) and relaxation (RELAX) technique is proposed, which can solve the performance reduction caused by the unnecessary values introduced by the method based on traditional GRFT and realize accurate motion parameter estimation. Then, based on the estimated motion parameters, a motion state judgment and radar imaging algorithm selection method, which takes the targets' motion state, theoretical resolutions, as well as the effect of high-order phase error into consideration, is proposed to obtain a high-quality and high-resolution radar image. Finally, computer simulation and experimental results of GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite single channel data validate the proposed method.

TI  - Analyzing the Saturation of Growing Stem Volume Based on ZY-3 Stereo and Multispectral Images in Planted Coniferous Forest
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, remote sensing (RS) technology are becoming an increasingly important technology in estimating forest growing stem volume (GSV), and the saturation issue of spectral variables from various optical sensors severely hinders the improvement of mapping forest GSV, especially in the planted forest with high GSV. Forest canopy height is widely considered as one of the major factors to increase the saturation levels in mapping GSV. However, it is rather difficult to invert the forest canopy height without precisely external DEM for large regions. In this study, the canopy height model (CHM) was derived from ZY-3 stereo images with subtracting open-sourced external DEM and the response of saturation levels was analyzed by adding forest height in the planted coniferous forest (Larch and Chinese pine). To further describe the relationships between the forest height and saturation levels, five datasets with five estimation models (Linear, MLR, SVR, KNN, and RF) and three methods of variable selection (Stepwise, LASSO, and Pearson) were applied to estimate the forest GSV using corrected CHM and 49 alternative variables extracted from ZY-3 multispectral images. Meanwhile, a spherical model was employed to quantitatively describe the saturation levels of combined variables. The results showed that values of relative root means square error were decreased from 29.3% to 25% for Larch and from 26.5% to 22.2% for Chinese pine after adding the corrected CHM, respectively. Meanwhile, the saturation level of each combined variable set was successfully determined by the spherical model. The results illustrated that the saturation levels of GSV were significantly increased by adding corrected CHM from open-sourced external DEM. Specially, the averaged saturation levels were increased from 220 m(3)/ha to nearly 300 m(3)/ha for Chinese pine and from 150 m(3)/ha to 220 m(3)/ha for Larch, respectively. It is proved that ZY-3 stereo and multispectral images have great potential for accurate estimation of forest GSV by delaying the saturation levels using extracted CHM with open-sourced external DEM.

AB  - As China's first civilian high-resolution Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar(PolSAR) imaging satellite, Gaofen-3(GF-3) can provide more abundant feature information for ground targets, which has a wide range of applications in water body extraction, shoreline identification, and flood disaster monitoring. This paper uses the data of the Gaofen-3 dual-polarization satellite to construct a polarized false-color composite orthoimage, polarized water body index, and terrain slope element information, which are applied to the research of object-oriented water body information extraction technology. Compared with traditional single-polarization radar, it not only improves the accuracy of water extraction (Kappa value up to 0.952), but also effectively suppresses the interference of hill shadows. The demonstration of flood disaster monitoring application in the waters of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province on July 2020 was carried out, which has shown that the dual-polarization Gaofen-3 has better flood disaster application ability, and can provide important data support and decision-making assistance for emergency disaster reduction departments.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Low-quality digital surface model (DSM) and blurred textures result in poor visualization of building reconstructions. In this paper, an edge-based block decomposition method for building rooftop reconstruction and side walls generation is proposed, which is applied in three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction texture mapping of buildings. The rooftop is decomposed into blocks according to the contour of the building's rooftop in the orthophoto. Each block is combined with the DSM generated by the stereo pair of satellite images to reconstruct the rooftop and interpolate to generate the side walls to obtain a regularized 3D point cloud of the building. For better texture mapping effect, single image super-resolution (SISR) method is used to enhance the texture details of remote sensing images. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better visualization effect than other 3D reconstruction methods based on satellite data.

TI  - Attention-Aware Dynamic Self-Aggregation Network for Satellite Image Time Series Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective network structure is essential for the classification of satellite image time series (SITS). Deep learning models have been widely used for SITS classification and achieved impressive performance, especially the architectures based on self-attention. However, the lack of efficient and comprehensive attention to valuable bands and time series structure hinders the performance to some extent. To address this problem, an end-to-end attention-aware dynamic self-aggregation network (ADSN) is proposed for SITS classification in this work, which combines two main parts: spectral focusing and spectral-temporal feature learning. The core components of ADSN are the channel attention module and dynamic self-aggregation block. Specifically, informative bands in the SITS flowing through the channel attention module can adaptively get a high weight to increase their contributions, while the attentions of some low-efficiency bands are weakened. Besides, the dynamic self-aggregation block, which integrates multiscale dynamic convolution and improved multihead attention in parallel, can simultaneously capture long- and short-distance sequence structures and position relationships to better represent temporal information. Compared with random forest (RF) and seven deep learning algorithms, the proposed model effectively learns spectral and temporal features, and the experimental results confirm that ADSN has achieved superior classification accuracy and generalization ability on two SITS datasets with extremely unbalanced samples.

AB  - China's coastal waters have significant alternating winter and summer monsoons, various meteorological activities are frequent, and marine resources are rich, and the development prospects are broad. Energy such as heat, function, and potential energy has a huge impact on human production and life. Therefore, accurate wind field data is useful for studying the coastal waters of China. This article uses multi-source satellite data, combined with the ERA-5 data provided by the European Weather Forecast Center (ECMWF), and uses classic machine learning methods and traditional interpolation methods to propose a feasible wind field interpolation method. The experiment generated seamless fined wind field data, and the wind field data has good accuracy, which can provide good data support for the construction of offshore areas in China.

TI  - Abundances of lunar heat-producing elements constrained by a 3-D numerical model of titanium-rich basaltic eruption
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing data and returned samples of mare basalts and mafic lunar glasses revealed that their petrogenesis are from lunar mantle and their temporal-spatial distributions can originate from multi-stage volcanism. Hence, these basalts and glasses are believed to be closely related to a long-term thermochemical evolution of the global lunar mantle. The thermochemical evolution is largely controlled by bulk abundances of radioactive heat-producing elements and mechanic properties of lunar solid layers. This study considers the early cumulate mantle overturn and subsequent basaltic volcanism due to re-heated ilmenite bearing lunar mantle. These processes are well-established thermochemical evolution model and provide a viable mechanism for the formation of mare basalts and lunar glasses. We use the observed episodes and distributions of mare basalts to constrain the heat-producing elements abundances and lunar mantle viscosity. To produce reasonable hot mantle anomalies for distributed lunar volcanism and fit in the first mare eruption at 3.9 Ga, our model prefers an estimate of radiogenic heat similar to that of our Earth and a maximum lunar viscosity of 1 X 10(21) Pa . s. Our model also reveals that different internal heat generation does not vary in mantle evolution pattern, but the eruption time scale.

TI  - Comprehensive Assessment of Performances of Long Time-Series LAI, FVC and GPP Products over Mountainous Areas: A Case Study in the Three-River Source Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation biophysical products offer unique opportunities to examine long-term vegetation dynamics and land surface phenology (LSP). It is important to understand the time-series performances of various global biophysical products for global change research. However, few endeavors have been dedicated to assessing the performances of long-term change characteristics or LSP extraction derived from different satellite products, especially in mountainous areas with highly fragmented and rugged surfaces. In this paper, we assessed the time-series characteristics and LSP detections of Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and gross primary production (GPP) products across the Three-River Source Region (TRSR). The performances of products' temporal agreements and their statistical relationship as a function of topographic indices and heterogeneous pixels, respectively, were investigated through intercomparison among three products during the period 2000 to 2018. The results show that the phenological differences between FVC and two other products are beyond 10 days over more than 35% of the pixels in TRSR. The long-term trend of FVC diverges significantly from GPP and LAI for 13.96% of the total pixels, and the percentages of mismatched pixels between FVC and two other products are 33.24% in the correlation comparison. Moreover, good agreements are observed between GPP and LAI, both in terms of LSP and interannual variations. Finally, the LSP and long-term dynamics of the three products exhibit poor performances on heterogeneous surfaces and complex topographic areas, which reflects the potential impacts of environmental factors and algorithmic imperfections on the quality and performances of different products. Our study highlights the spatiotemporal disparities in detections of surface vegetation activity in mountainous areas by using different biophysical products. Future global change studies may require multiple high-quality satellite products with long-term stability as data support.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is a vital parameter at the earth-atmosphere interface. Current method can derive an all-sky SST at resolution up to 6 km by integrating thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing. However, due to the swath gap of the polar-orbit PMW sensors, current TIR-PMW integrated SST are not spatial-seamless (i.e. all-sky available). By integrating GCOM-W1 AMSR2 and FengYun-3B MWRI observations, this paper fills the BT inside the swath gap to reconstruct a spatial-seamless PMW brightness temperature (BT) and then introduces Aqua MODIS SST to estimates a 4-km all-sky SST, the spatial resolution and coverage of which outperforms the current TIR-PMW integrated SST. Results show that the reconstructed BT highly agrees with the original BT and the estimated SST has accuracy of 0.67 K-0.72 K when validated against in-situ SST. This study would be beneficial for associated studies such as climate change on large scales.

TI  - Nearshore Bathymetry Based on ICESat-2 and Multispectral Images: Comparison Between Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Testing Gaofen-2
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric maps are essential to understand marine and coastal ecosystems. With the development of satellite and sensor technology, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) has been widely used to measure the depth of nearshore waters. Employment of physics-based methods requires a series of optical parameters of the water column and seafloor, which limits the application of these methods to shallow-water bathymetry. Due to convenience, low costs, and high efficiency, empirical methods based on in situ measurements and satellite imagery are increasingly used for nearshore bathymetry. These measurements are required to calibrate empirical models, so that reasonable accuracy can be achieved. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), equipped with the advanced topographic laser altimeter system, provides a novel opportunity for nearshore bathymetry. Using the new measurement strategy of photon counting, ICESat-2 can provide accurate bathymetric points from spaceborne observations, which can be used in place of in situ water depth data. In this study, ICESat-2 bathymetric points and multispectral images were used to train four typical models and produce bathymetric maps for Shanhu Island, Ganquan Island, and Lingyang Reef in the Xisha Islands of China. We evaluated the bathymetric results by comparing them with reference depth data from airborne light detection and ranging. All models had a satisfactory accuracy, as well as multimodel and multisource image consistency. With the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, SDB is no longer limited by in situ measurements. Hence, this approach could be extended to a larger scale to obtain nearshore bathymetric maps of coastal areas, surrounding islands, and reefs using free and open-access satellite data.

TI  - Evaluation of BRDF Information Retrieved from Time-Series Multiangle Data of the Himawari-8 AHI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, much attention has been given to using geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) meteorological satellite data for retrieving land surface parameters due to their high observation frequencies. However, their bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) information content with a single viewing angle has not been sufficiently investigated, which lays a foundation for subsequent quantitative estimation. In this study, we aim to comprehensively evaluate BRDF information from time-series observations from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the GEO satellite Himawari-8. First, ~6.2 km monthly multiangle surface reflectances from POLDER onboard a low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellite with good angle distributions over various land types during 2008 were used as reference data, and corresponding 0.05 degrees high-quality MODIS (i.e., onboard LEO satellites) and AHI datasets during four months in 2020 were obtained using cloud and aerosol property products. Then, indicators of angle distribution, BRDF change, and albedos were retrieved by the kernel-driven Ross-Li BRDF model from the three datasets, which were used for comparisons over different time spans. Generally, the quality of sun-viewing geometries varies dramatically for accumulated AHI observations according to the weight-of-determination, and wide-ranging anisotropic flat indices are obtained. The root-mean-square-errors of white sky albedos between AHI and MODIS half-month data are 0.018 and 0.033 in the red and near-infrared bands, respectively, achieving smaller values of 0.004 and 0.007 between the half-month and daily AHI data, respectively, due to small variances in sun-viewing geometries. The generally wide AHI BRDF variances and good consistency in albedo with MODIS show their potential for retrieving anisotropy information and albedo, while angle accumulation quality of AHI time-series observations must be considered.

AB  - Zhengzhou City suffered the strongest rainstorm in history in July 2021, floods and other secondary disasters have greatly endangered the property and safety of local residents in Henan Province, China In this paper, the flood risk of Henan Province was analyzed from the three perspectives of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, and seven factors of rainfall, elevation, slope, distribution density of river network, population, GDP and arable land occupation ratio were selected to create a flood disaster risk evaluation index system. Remotely sensed data and GIS were used to analyze and map the influencing factors, and then the comprehensive risk results of flood disasters in Henan Province were obtained based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Results show that the higher-risk area and high-risk area mainly locate in cities of Xinyang, Luohe, Zhumadian, Zhoukou and Xuchang, as well as the north of Zhengzhou, accounting for 43% of the total area of Henan Province. High risk area is mainly caused by high hazard of the flat terrain and abundant rainfall. The lower-risk area is mainly distributed in Sanmenxia, Jiyuan and Anyang, and the western part of Luoyang, that locate in high-elevation areas, and the vulnerability index of GDP is low in these areas. The rest of the areas are medium-risk areas. This research provides the background information for disaster prevention and mitigation management in Henan Province.

AB  - Change detection is an important topic for the use of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ( PolSAR) images. In this study, we investigate the change detection method based on regions. First we segment PolSAR images with improved simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), then take the averaged coherency matrix as the following change detection unit. The performances of three classical test statistics based on regions and pixels are compared, respectively. Three data sets collected over Langqi Island, Fuzhou, China, by RADARSAT-2 are used for evaluation. Experiments show the region-based method can stably improve the performance of change detection and reduce the false alarms than those of the pixel-based method. Further, the optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement (OPCE) test statistic is not easily affected by spackle noise and provides stable detection results.

AB  - This paper aims to analyze the evolution of land-use patterns and the Eco-Environmental Quality Index (EQI) in major European metropolitan areas. To this end, nighttime remote sensing images will be used to delineate ten major European metropolitan areas with more than 1 million inhabitants and CLC land cover data will be used to reclassify European land occupation types from 2000 to 2018. Based on MODIS satellite remote sensing imagery, the evolution of EQI was studied for the EQI evaluation systems applicable to different periods and different regions. The results show that in Europe, cultivated cover and discontinuous built-up cover occupy the largest part of the land, but the former is shrinking and the latter is expanding. Other land areas are much smaller than the previous two. Among them, grassland has always shown a growing trend, and the fastest growing area is industrial land, while the slow-expanding land includes transportation land, leisure land and water bodies. The overall result of the EQI was estimated to be around 0.59. The average result in 2000 was the highest, with a decrease in 2006, but a small increase since then. The ecological environment of each metropolitan area has experienced both improvement and deterioration. Overall conditions improved in Barcelona, the English central agglomeration, Rome and the diffuse landscape of Northern Italy, London and Naples. But The Belgian/Dutch agglomeration, the lands of Paris and the Rhine-Ruhr, the vast majority of the ecological quality is deteriorating. Madrid's EQI worsened the most.

AB  - Accurate mapping of forest canopy height at national to global scales is essential to quantify carbon stock, understand forest ecosystem processes and enhance environment sustainable development. Airborne LiDAR technology has been utilized in many previous studies to generate unprecedented accurate forest canopy height estimation. However, the high cost of airborne LiDAR data limits its application at national and continental scales. How to use LiDAR data to generate high-resolution canopy height products over a large range remains a challenge. Hence, this study integrated airborne LiDAR data with freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map forest canopy height, by using random forest regression on the Google Earth Engine platform. Finally, this study completed national-scale forest canopy height mapping in the United States, at 25-m spatial resolution. Comparison with canopy height independent validation values demonstrates that the proposed model can predict reliable canopy height estimation (R-2=0.83, RMSE=5.05m, and nRMSE=0.33).

AB  - Red-edge band is an indicator band to describe the health status of crops. In order to explore the impact of the red-edge bands on the accuracy of agricultural drought monitoring, this study used GF-6 WFV and Landsat8 to calculate the Red-edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI705), Vogelmann red-edge index 1 (VOG1), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) to construct temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI), this index integrated vegetation index and land surface temperature information, the soil relative humidity data and the measured drought grade data were respectively used for correlation analysis and classification accuracy verification of the TVDI results. The results showed that dry edge equation fit with red edge bands were higher than that of non-red edge bands. The dry edge equation based on VOG1 index has the highest fit, with a maximum coefficient determination of 0.92; TVDI constructed by the above vegetation index have significant negative correlation with soil relative humidity. The TVDI based on the VOG1 index has a better correlation with the relative soil humidity, with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.85; and realized the dynamic monitoring of peanut drought grade, the overall accuracy rate of peanut drought grade monitoring reached 92.59%, and the result of TVDI classification was in good agreement with the actual drought grade measurement result. The red edge bands of GF-6 satellite can effectively improve the accuracy of peanut drought monitoring and better characterize peanut drought information. This research provides a data reference for the application of GF-6 WFV data in agricultural drought monitoring.

TI  - Historical Evolution of Habitat Suitability of Oriental White Stork Stop over at the Yellow River Delta during Spring Migration.

M3  - Article
AB  - In order to analyze the habitat selection of oriental white stork during spring migration in the Yellow River Delta, and to compare the historical evolution of habitat suitability of oriental white stork during spring migration from 1988 to 2018, Landsat images were used as data sources from satellite tracking data of spring migration of oriental white stork in 2018. Maxent model was used to study the habitat selection of oriental white storks during the 2018 spring migration period in the Yellow River Delta, and to evaluate the habitat suitability of oriental white storks during the spring migration period in 1988 and 2018. The results showed that the distance to meadow and the distance to residential industry and mine were the most important factors affecting habitat selection of oriental white stork. From 1988 to 2018, the suitable habitat area in the Yellow River Delta decreased by 36.1%, of which the sub-suitable habitat area decreased by 16.7% and the highly suitable habitat area decreased by 73.4%. The deterioration of habitat quality was the most serious in the old estuary area in the north and the coastal area of Laizhou Bay in the south. The overall suitable habitat area in the reserve was guaranteed, but the habitat quality was still decreased. From 1988 to 2018, the main habitat structure of oriental white stork during spring migration shifted from natural wetland to constructed wetland. The decrease of natural wetland area and the increase of human disturbance are the main reasons for the deterioration of habitat quality in the Yellow River Delta. It is suggested to strengthen the protection of natural wetland in the future, and focus on how to make constructed wetland sustainable to meet the needs of oriental white stork.

TI  - A D-InSAR method to improve snow depth estimation accuracy
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth is an important parameter that reflects the law of spatiotemporal variation in snow cover and is an indispensable observation variable for studying global and regional climate change and the hydrological cycle. Traditional manual field measurements and ground station observations have limited scopes and cannot fully reflect regional-scale snow conditions. Satellite remote sensing can simultaneously observe surface information over a large area and has been widely used in snow monitoring since the 1970s. Optical remote sensing has difficulty obtaining snow depth information directly through the visible light band and is limited by atmospheric conditions. Microwave remote sensing can penetrate clouds and fog and can effectively capture changes in snow depth. Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) technology uses the differential interferometric phase formed by microwave penetration through the snow layer before and after snowfall to establish a geometric function relationship with the snow depth: it is widely used in regional small-scale snow depth estimation research. However. its estimation accuracy is affected by many factors, such as interferometric image pair coherence, local topography, and snow dielect capability at microwave wavelengths.Based on high-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR data, this study optimizes the snow depth differential interferometric phase unwrapping accuracy by introducing Sentinel-2 optical images and high coherence coefficient regions to select ground control points, which are phase correction benchmarks. Furthermore, introducing field-measured snow parameters such as snow density and satellite local terrain incidence angles based on digital elevation model (DEM) data reduces the error of the differential interferometric phase-slope distance relationship model. thereby enabling estimations of the spatiotemporal distribution of snow depth in the Babao River Basin in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during the 2021 ablation period. Simultaneously, the accuracy of the snow depth estimation ability is evaluated based on the synchronous field measurement data of snow cover satellites. The main factors affecting the accuracy of snow depth estimation are discussed and analysed. Data from 122 ground snow depth measurements (meteorological stations + field measurements) are used to verify the results. The results show that the optimized D-InSAR differential interferometry can improve the snow depth estimation accuracy. The RMSE is 3.9 cm. the MAPE is 20.03%, and the R-2 is 0.92. However, the estimated snow depth is generally underestimated (MBE%=-16.8%). and the maximum underestimation error of the snow depth is 9.1 cm. In addition to the influencing factors of D-InSAR system interferometric decorrelation, the estimations are affected by the penetration ability of microwaves in the snow and snow parameters such as stratigraphy structure, temperature and humidity. This limits the ability of differential interferometry to estimate snow depth and is more suitable for dry and homogeneous snow cover.This method allows for more precise and faster monitoring of centimetre-level snow depth changes; at the same time, the underlying surface of the study is relatively simple. and the influence of forest and other vegetation coverage is not considered. In follow-up research, snow cover should be optimized with multi-property and multi-environment interferometric models. An InSAR scattering model with a layered factor is introduced to improve the propagation information inside the snow layer then combined with the multiangle radar measurement of the ascending and descending orbits; experiments are carried out using the penetration ability of more bands in microwaves to reduce interferometric error sources and improve the accuracy of snow depth estimation. This study can provide a scientific reference for D-InSAR snow depth estimation research.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF DAILY GLOBAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE FROM HIMAWARI-8 PRODUCTS OVER CHINA
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - Daily global surface solar irradiance (SSI) is of great importance parameter in the surface energy balance, climate modelling, and solar energy utilization. However, it is still challenging to extend the estimated instantaneous solar radiation to the daily global SSI from either geostationary satellites or polar-orbiting satellites. In this study, a method for estimating the daily global SSI is proposed based on the Himawari-8 hourly SSI products using pixel-by-pixel Gaussian fitting to simulate the diurnal SSI variation. Compared with ground-based observations, the daily global SSI estimated by Gaussian fitting have higher accuracy under various weather conditions than by the simple accumulation or quadratic polynomials, and the coefficient of determination (R2) between the estimated and observed values exceeds 0.86. The verification results also show different estimation accuracies under different weather conditions. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) under clear-sky and all-sky conditions are 2.36 MJ/m2 and 3.06 MJ/m2, respectively. In addition, experimental results show that the daily global SSI in China has high spatial heterogeneity. For higher-elevation areas with low cloud cover, such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest China, the daily global SSI is higher than other areas. In contrast, the values of daily global SSI is relatively low in the eastern regions of Southwest and Northeast China.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the risk factors of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in patients with endome-trial carcinoma (EC), and to establish a risk nomogram model. Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical data of 79 EC patients who were treated in Zhumadian Central Hospital from January 2019 to January 2021 were ana-lyzed. The patients were divided into SLN positive group and SLN negative group according to the occurrence of SLN metastasis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the factors affecting the occurrence of SLN metastasis in EC patients. The nomogram model predicting the risk of SLN metastasis in EC patients was con-structed. The discrimination, accuracy and clinical benefit rate of the model were evaluated. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that body mass index (BMI) = 24 kg/m2, tumor diameter = 2 cm, low differentiation, and cervical stromal involvement were risk factors for SLN metastasis in EC patients (P < 0.05). And the risk of SLN in EC patients increased with the increase in human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) level (P < 0.05). The constructed nomogram model was tested, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the model was 0.934 (95% CI: 0.878-0.979), the calibration curve obtained a Brier of 0.084. Decision curve results showed that 68 out of every 100 EC patients could benefit without compromising the interests of others, with a benefit rate of 68%. Conclusion: The occurrence of SLN in EC patients is related to their personal general characteristics, pathological characteristics, tumor markers, and other multi-dimensional indicators. The medical staff can evaluate the SLN risk of EC patients by combining multiple indicators.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Downward Shortwave Radiation Using Spectral-Based Convolutional Neural Network Methods: A Case Study From the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is a key parameter in Earth's surface radiation budget. Many satellite products have been developed, but their accuracies need further improvements. This study proposed an innovative deep learning method that combines radiative-transfer (RT) modeling with convolutional neural network (CNN) learning for estimating instantaneous DSR from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations. Unlike traditional CNN methods that rely on spatial contextual information and are not optimal for medium to coarse resolution satellite data, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of both spectral information as well as vertical information. The algorithm first estimates the atmospheric effective optical depth from top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface reflectance by using the lookup table (LUT) created by RT simulations. We then constructed a spectral-wised virtual matrix to train the CNN using surface DSR measurements at 34 baseline surface radiation network sites globally during 2013. The developed CNN was also compared with four traditional machine learning algorithms. The validation results showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the bias were 91.42 and -0.94 W/m2, respectively. This article is the first spectral-wised CNN application to estimate surface biophysical parameters from satellite remote sensing data quantitatively. The comparison with previous LUT and optimization-based algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms by around 10-20 W/m2. We also explored how transfer learning can further improve the DSR estimation. Our results indicate that the universal model with local data transfer learning outperforms either the CNN with local data or the universal CNN by around 10-20 W/m2.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Incident Shortwave Radiation From Geostationary Advanced Himawari Imager and Advanced Baseline Imager Observations Using an Optimization Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface incident shortwave radiation (ISR) is an important component of the surface radiation budget. We refined the optimization method developed for polar-orbiting satellite data [1] and applied it to estimate ISR from the new generation geostationary Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8/9 satellite and Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series. Validation of the AHI ISR estimation at 2-km resolution showed an R-2 of 0.93, bias of 0.52 W/m(2), and RMSE of 106.52 W/m(2) for instantaneous estimates; an R-2 of 0.95, bias of -0.12 W/m(2), and RMSE of 22.49 W/m(2) for daily mean ISR; and a bias of -0.18 W/m(2) and RMSE of 7.72 W/m(2) for monthly mean ISR. Validation of the ABI ISR at 2-km spatial resolution showed an R-2 value of 0.93, bias of 8.71W/m(2), and RMSE of 102.30 W/m(2) for instantaneous estimates; an R-2 of 0.95, bias of -2.38 W/m(2), and RMSE of 27.17 W/m(2) for daily mean ISR; and a bias of 1.40 W/m(2) and RMSE of 14.75 W/m(2) for monthly mean ISR. Our study also demonstrated that AHI and ABI observations have realized much better estimations for hourly and diurnal ISR than previous polar-orbiting satellite data because of their higher frequency of sampling on the atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Remote Sensing Cross-Modal Retrieval by Deep Image-Voice Hashing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image retrieval aims at searching remote sensing images of interest among immense volumes of remote sensing data, which is an enormous challenge. Direct use of voice for human-computer interaction is more convenient and intelligent. In this article, a deep image-voice hashing (DIVH) method is proposed for remote sensing image-voice retrieval. First, the whole framework is composed of the image and the voice feature learning subnetwork. Then, the hash code learning procedure will be leveraged in remote sensing image-voice retrieval to further improve the retrieval efficiency and reduce memory footprint. Hash code learning maps the deep features of images and voices into a common Hamming space. Finally, image-voice pairwise loss is proposed, which considers the similarity preservation and balance of hash codes. The similarity preserving and the balance controlling term of the loss function improve the similarity preservation from original data space to the Hamming space and the discrimination of binary code, respectively. This unified cross-modal feature and hash code learning framework significantly reduce the semantic gap between the two modal data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DIVH method can achieve a superior retrieval performance than other state-of-the-art remote sensing image-voice retrieval methods.

AB  - Trees in flat and wet forest floors and urban targets with small orientation angles can produce strong double scattering. Then, misclassification of trees as urban targets occurs in the PolSAR data decomposition. This study proposed an improved decomposition algorithm for the urban and forest targets classification. First, strong double scattering between forest and urban targets was differentiated, and then forest targets were treated as azimuthally symmetric radar targets in the PolSAR decomposition algorithm. The improved decomposition algorithm was verified by two L-band PolSAR datasets, a UAVSAR dataset northwest New Bern, NC, USA, and one ALOS PALSAR dataset San Francisco, CA, USA. In the datasets, the double scattering was dominant for forested areas. The double scattering dominated some urban areas, but other urban areas had strong volume scattering. Nevertheless, the revised decomposition algorithm correctly delineated both types of targets and extended the usability of the original decomposition algorithm.

AB  - The offshore wind energy has been evaluated in the South China Sea. However, few works focus on the long-term variability of the wind resources, which is vital for regional wind farm planning and construction. In this work, we analyzed combined remote sensing data from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and QuickSCAT, ERA-interim and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of wind resources in the South China Sea. The CSEOF (cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function decomposition) analysis was adopted to show the spatial-temporal patterns of the offshore wind energy. The results indicate that the first modes (annual cycle signals) accounted for about 80% of the total variability in the analyzed datasets, and the second or third mode (depends on the length of the dataset) of CSEOF high correlated with ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation). Significant wind speed variability was observed during the El Nino events.

AB  - The automatic registration of multi-modal remote sensing data (such as optical and SAR) is a challenging task because of the significant non-linear radiation difference between these data, as well as the transformation of rotation and scaling. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a two-step strategy. Firstly, the improved HOPC algorithm is introduced to obtain matching point pairs, and then a weighted strategy is used to calculate the global affine transformation matrix. In the first step, an improved Harris operator is used to extract the points of interest, and the matching accuracy is maintained while the amount of calculation is reduced. Then the matching loss calculated by the HOPC algorithm is used to calculate the contribution weight of the image block, which is utilized to calculate the global transformation matrix. The results show that the method in this paper has strong robustness to complex nonlinear radiation differences, and the two-step strategy greatly improves the accuracy of matching, which is better than similar matching algorithms in performance.

AB  - High Resolution Range Profile is to achieve high-resolution imaging of targets at the radial distance of radar line of sight, which can obtain rich target structure information and is easy to obtain and good in real time. Therefore, characterization of high-resolution one-dimensional distance image and study of target classification and recognition in combination with electromagnetic simulation technology are the key research contents of this paper. To address this idea, a satellite target recognition comparison is proposed to realise the feature extraction by principal component analysis of the 1D distance image data of satellite targets obtained by simulation using FEKO software, and to compare the recognition of different satellite data to verify the recognition effect of satellite targets under different classifiers.

TI  - Assimilation of Wheat and Soil States into the APSIM-Wheat Crop Model: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimised farm crop productivity requires careful management in response to the spatial and temporal variability of yield. Accordingly, combination of crop simulation models and remote sensing data provides a pathway for providing the spatially variable information needed on current crop status and the expected yield. An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation framework was developed to assimilate plant and soil observations into a prediction model to improve crop development and yield forecasting. Specifically, this study explored the performance of assimilating state observations into the APSIM-Wheat model using a dataset collected during the 2018/19 wheat season at a farm near Cora Lynn in Victoria, Australia. The assimilated state variables include (1) ground-based measurements of Leaf Area Index (LAI), soil moisture throughout the profile, biomass, and soil nitrate-nitrogen; and (2) remotely sensed observations of LAI and surface soil moisture. In a baseline scenario, an unconstrained (open-loop) simulation greatly underestimated the wheat grain with a relative difference (RD) of -38.3%, while the assimilation constrained simulations using ground-based LAI, ground-based biomass, and remotely sensed LAI were all found to improve the RD, reducing it to -32.7%, -9.4%, and -7.6%, respectively. Further improvements in yield estimation were found when: (1) wheat states were assimilated in phenological stages 4 and 5 (end of juvenile to flowering), (2) plot-specific remotely sensed LAI was used instead of the field average, and (3) wheat phenology was constrained by ground observations. Even when using parameters that were not accurately calibrated or measured, the assimilation of LAI and biomass still provided improved yield estimation over that from an open-loop simulation.

AB  - Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is one of the famous airports built by reclamation of the sea platform. However, the reclaimed area of the airport, which cost about $9 billion, has shown uneven displacement. Over the past two decades, researchers have used different methods to monitor the deformation of HKIA. As an emerging deformation monitoring technology, Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), has been widely used to monitoring the deformation of HKIA in the last ten years. In this study, different from conventional interferometry, the target of this interference processing is single look complex (SLC) point data, which was extracted by points in the SLC data stacks (filtered by spectrum and backscatter intensity). We used 40 scenes of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR images to generate the differential interferogram point data. After multiple phase regression analysis, the SLC point data interferometric processing model can effectively eliminate baseline errors and atmospheric distortions, obtain highly reliable phase unwrapping results.

TI  - Unsupervised SAR and Optical Image Matching Using Siamese Domain Adaptation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its highly complementary information about remote sensing, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery matching have drawn much attention in recent years. Compared with traditional methods, deep learning-based SAR-optical image matching models largely rely on supervision with ground truths, where the matching accuracy suffers because of unseen image domains. To mitigate loads in burdensome labeling tasks, transferring deep learning models trained with annotated source domains to nonannotated target domains has attracted great concern. Due to the domain gap, the difference between the source and target domains is likely to deteriorate the matching accuracy on target data if the training process is directly conducted without proper domain adaptation (DA). In this research, a Siamese DA (SDA) approach with a combined loss function is developed in the context of multimodality image matching. Then, a novel rotation/scale-invariant transformation module with regression modules is designed to extract rotation/scale-equivariant features. Finally, the causal inference-based self-learning method and the multiresolution histogram matching approach are employed to enhance the unsupervised matching performance. Experimental results on the RadarSat/Planet dataset and the Sentinel-1/2 dataset demonstrate that the developed model can achieve competitive matching performance with a low overlap ratio between domains and little data labeling. By alleviating the domain discrepancy, the developed model drastically reduces the average L2 score of the unsupervised matching from 9.576 to 0.658, while the less-than-one-pixel matching error rate is enhanced from 66.3% to 90.6%.

TI  - Sx00B3;Net: SpectralSpatialSemantic Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification With the Multiway Attention Mechanism
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, it is a great challenge on how to extract key informative spectralx2013;spatial features efficiently and suppress useless features from abundant spectralx2013;spatial information. In this article, inspired by the attention mechanism of the human visual system, we propose a novel spectralx2013;spatialx2013;semantic network (S(3)Net) with the multiway attention mechanism for HSI classification. The S(3)Net consists of a spectral branch, a spatial branch, and a multiscale semantic module. The spectral branch extracts the multiway spectral features with a dense spectral block and a multiway spectral attention module. The spatial branch extracts the multiway spatial features with a multiscale spatial block and a multiway spatial attention module. The multiscale semantic module extracts spectralx2013;spatialx2013;semantic features that are used for classification. In the proposed S(3)Net, the multiway attention modules in spectral and spatial branches are built to enhance the extraction ability of the key informative spectralx2013;spatial features. The multiscale spatial block in the spatial branch is designed to learn strong complementary and related information. The Res2Net in the multiscale semantic module is used to learn multiscale semantic features at a granular level. A large number of experimental results demonstrate that, on the University of Pavia, Kennedy Space Center, and Pavia Center data sets, the proposed S(3)Net achieves higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods on the limited training samples. Remarkably, our S(3)Net also achieves the best performance on the mineral exploration HSI data set, called Huoshaoyun, which is collected by the GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite.

AB  - Previous studies used 50-60 GHz or 118 GHz passive microwave measurements separately for surface pressure retrieval. To improve the retrieval accuracy, a joint retrieval method is proposed in this study to use the 50-60 GHz and 118 GHz passive microwave measurements simultaneously for surface pressure retrieval over oceans. Based on information content analysis and footprint matching, collocated passive observations of the two bands are obtained, and then are used to establish back-propagation neural network retrieval models. Using the 50-60 GHz passive observations of Microwave Temperature Sounder-II (MWTS-II) onboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite and the 118.75 GHz observations of the Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) onboard the FY-3D satellite, joint retrieval experiments are completed. Experimental results show that when using the 50-60 GHz and 118.75 GHz oxygen absorption band together for surface pressure measurements, more surface pressure information and better retrieval accuracy can be obtained than using them separately.

TI  - Intercalibration of Brightness Temperatures From FY-3 MWRI for Surface Snowmelt Detection Over Polar Ice Sheets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface snowmelt is a vital environmental parameter that affects energy exchanges between polar ice sheets and the atmosphere. Due to the difficulties of continuous in situ measurements, passive microwave remote sensing technology has become a major method for obtaining ice sheet surface snowmelt states over large areas. FengYun-3 (FY-3) series satellites, the second generation of Chinese polar-orbiting meteorological satellite missions, have great potential for providing long-term polar ice sheet surface snowmelt state products. In this study, we establish a monthly intercalibration model to synergize brightness temperatures from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) aboard different FY- 3 satellites. Based on the calibrated continuous brightness temperature record, an improved snowmelt algorithm is proposed by using an adaptive thresholding method, which does not rely on in situ observation data. After intercalibration, the consistency of the melt extent obtained by different sensors is considerably better than before, with the bias decreasing from 85 pixels to 3 pixels in the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and from 16 pixels to 6 pixels in the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). Evaluation of the snowmelt result is conducted with the automatic weather station (AWS) air temperature, and a promising accuracy is found with an overall accuracy above 92% in the AIS and approximately 86% in the GrIS. This study provides new possibilities for a long-term continuous snowmelt product by connecting FY- 3B, FY- 3C, FY- 3D, and its successors FY- 3F and FY- 3G. The intercalibration coefficients and FY- 3 crossing times are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20657712.v1.

TI  - Study on Vertically Distributed Aerosol Optical Characteristics over Saudi Arabia Using CALIPSO Satellite Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical characteristics of vertically distributed aerosols over Saudi Arabia were investigated using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data from 2007 to 2019. The study region was divided into three parts (Region I: Tabuk, Makkah, Al Madinah, Asir, Al Bahah, Jizan, Riyadh, Mecca, Medina, the eastern region, Kassim, Hale, Asir, Baha, Tabuk, the northern border region, Jizan, Najilan, and Jufu. Region II: Ar, Al, Ha, Al, and Najran. Region III Al Hudud ash Shamaliyah and Ash Sharqiyah) to understand regional aerosol characteristics by performing interannual and seasonal analysis for nine aerosol types during the day and nighttime. We found that the aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimates were the highest over eastern Saudi Arabia (region III) and were seemingly driven by the presence of an expansive desert in the region. As anticipated, the AOD observations were substantially higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter owing to the frequent occurrence of dust events during the former. Daytime observations exhibited higher AOD values than those at nighttime, which might be related to higher daytime anthropogenic activities. The estimates of the base height of the lowest aerosol layer (HB1) and the top altitude of the highest aerosol layer (TAH) were altered depending on the topography (the higher the altitude, the higher the annual mean value of HB1 and TAH). The aerosol layers (N) were relatively abundant over region III, seemingly due to the relatively stronger atmospheric convection over this region. The volume depolarization ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (VDR1) was considerable during the night due to deposition at nighttime, and VDR1 was relatively substantial in spring and summer. The color ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (CR1) estimates over regions II and III was higher at night. We report a weak positive correlation between the thickness of the lowest aerosol layer (HTH1) and the AOD of the lowest aerosol layer (AOD(1)) in the three regions, a strong positive correlation between TAH and N, and a negative correlation between the AOD proportion of the lowest aerosol layer (PAOD(1)) and N in Saudi Arabia. In this paper, the optical and physical properties of aerosols in Saudi Arabia have been studied for 13 years. Our results could provide references for researchers and the government, and relevant departments with data support on the aerosol layer to help control air pollution in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Monitoring the stability of the Ronne Ice Shelf, particularly the calving event, is an integral and important part of the study of Antarctic ice sheet mass balance and sea-level rise. This paper presents the results of the analysis of the world's largest iceberg (A-76 iceberg), which was formed during a calving event in the Ronne Ice Shelf (RIS) on May 13, 2020, and subsequently broke into three fragments (A-76A, A-76B, and A-76C icebergs). The iceberg development cycle, up to this point, including its formation, separation and drift, was observed and analyzed. The detailed development process of rifts associated with the detachment of the A-76 iceberg in front of RIS before calving was analyzed using remote sensing data from multiple sources (ERS, RADARSAT-1, ALOS PALSAR, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8). In addition, based on a total of 66 Sentinel-1 A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired between May 13, 2021 and March 11, 2022, a multi-scale segmentation approach was applied to continuously track the drift path of A-76 icebergs, A-76A, A-76B, and A-76C. We calculated the average drift velocity of these icebergs and found that A-76C iceberg drifted the fastest, followed by A-76A, and A-76B, from May 30, 2021, to March 11, 2022. Future tracking of other iceberg parameters, such as area, thickness, freeboard, and volume, could help assess the melting rates of the icebergs.

AB  - As the only multi-spectral earth observation data in the 1970s, Landsat MSS plays a significant role in time-series researches. However, as the bands of MSS are much more different compared with the later Landsat TM sensor, the consistency and correction method of reflectance and vegetation indices needs to be studied. In this paper, we use the PROSAIL model to simulate vegetation-covered reflectance profiles and calculate the effective reflectance over the MSS and TM bands. The method of correcting MSS-based NDVI to TM-based NDVI and the method of calculating the MSS-based NDVI after correcting the MSS reflectance to TM reflectance are proposed. A case study in Qinshui, China shows that the correction coefficients of PROSAIL simulated data perform well in the real NDVI image comparison for the vegetation-covered area.

TI  - Large-Scale Crustal Deformation, Slip-Rate Variation, and Strain Distribution Along the Kunlun Fault (Tibet) From Sentinel-1 InSAR Observations (2015-2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale geodetic measurements of crustal deformation in the north-central Tibetan Plateau are crucial for improved understanding of earthquake-cycle processes and long-term seismic hazard assessment. We use GPS velocities and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations (2015-2020) on eight descending and eight ascending Sentinel-1 tracks to map surface motions and their gradients for an area of over similar to 2,000 km x 350 km around the Kunlun-Manyi fault system. The derived line-of-sight (LOS) and 3D velocity fields demonstrate ongoing postseismic transients along the ruptured segments of the 1997 Manyi and 2001 Kokoxili earthquakes, interseismic deformation along locked fault segments, and strain accumulation on a large subsidiary fault (i.e., the Kunlun Pass fault). We use elastic dislocation and analytical postseismic deformation models constrained by our dense InSAR measurements to quantify the interseismic and postseismic contributions, which reveal the along-fault distribution of fault slip rate and locking depth along the entire length of the fault. The results indicate that the slip rate of the Kunlun fault systematically decreases toward the west to the west of the Taiyang Lake fault. We also find that the interseismic strain accumulation rate along the main trace of the Kunlun fault is to first-order spatially constant (0.1-0.15 microstrain/yr), except around its restraining bend. As the historically unruptured segments, especially the eastern segments (from 95 degrees E to 101 degrees E) of the Kunlun fault, have relatively fast slip rates and high locking depths (>15 km), they have the potential to generate large and damaging earthquakes in this region.

TI  - An Operational Land Surface Temperature Retrieval Methodology for Chinese Second-Generation Huanjing Disaster Monitoring Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese second-generation Huanjing disaster monitoring satellite (HJ-2A) was launched on September 27, 2020, and underutilized due to the lack of accurate operational methodologies for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval. In this article, an operational LST retrieval method is proposed to retrieve LSTs from HJ-2A thermal infrared observations. The LST retrieval methodology involves two main steps. The land surface emissivities (LSEs) over all land cover types are obtained with the improved normalized difference vegetation index-based threshold method, and then the LST is retrieved operationally from the adjacent infrared bands.The algorithm coefficients for LST retrieval are from regression analysis of radiative transfer simulations, and LSTs could be retrieved based on thermal images without any additional auxiliary data. The simulation results demonstrated that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of LST retrieval were less than 2.4 K in all subranges, and the minimum RMSE for the two emissivity groups (high- (low-) emissivity group) was 0.16 K (0.20 K) and appeared in the tractable subrange with water vapor content (WVC) varying from 0 to 1.5 g/cm(2) and view zenith angle (VZA) being 0 degrees. Furthermore, an error analysis was performed, the results showed that the LSE, NE Delta T, and atmospheric water vapor uncertainty of 1%, 0.2 K, and 20% caused the LST retrieval errors with 0.88-1.21 K (0.84-1.19 K), 0.1 K (0.09 K), and 0.006 K (0.008 K) for the high- (low-) emissivity group, respectively, with WVC is an element of[0-1.5] g/cm(2) and VZA = 0 degrees. Finally, the retrieved LSTs were applied to seven images of the Wuhai, Geermu, Dunhuang, and Baotou sites from January to March and cross validated by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products. From the cross-validated results, it can be found that the RMSEs of the retrieved LSTs and the MODIS LST products were between 2.3 and 3.7 K, and the mean RMSE value was 2.89 K.

AB  - Impervious surface extraction from remote sensing images has become a promising technology to measure the urban ecological environment and monitor human activity. However, due to the complex characteristics of impervious landscapes, most researches on impervious surface extraction hardly identify the scattered and small objects especially in difficult areas, which severely affect the accuracy of mapping impervious surface. In this work, we propose a channel and spatial attention mechanism (CSAM) to extract impervious surface in difficult areas, which includes a channel attention module to learn the relationship in the multi-channel remote sensing images and a spatial attention module to capture the features of the inconspicuous objects. Experiments with the Sentinel-2 dataset in South Africa demonstrate that CSAM can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Retrieval of Red Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence With TROPOMI on the Sentinel-5 Precursor Mission
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from spaceborne hyperspectral measurements can provide a synoptic perspective on the functioning of photosynthetic active vegetation and algae. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 precursor mission provides data for the retrieval of SIF with an unprecedented resolution in the spatial and temporal dimensions. In this study, we propose an approach for the retrieval of the red SIF peak value (at around 685 nm) over both land and ocean from TROPOMI measurements. This approach exploits the solar Fraunhofer lines located in the spectral window of 669-686 nm to disentangle SIF from the solar radiation reflected by the surface-atmosphere system. First, through simulated TROPOMI-like datasets, we determine the proper parameter settings and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for the red SIF retrieval from TROPOMI data. Then, the approach is applied to real TROPOMI measurements. The red SIF retrieved with the proposed approach for two months' TROPOMI data is compared with another TROPOMI red SIF dataset and the marine normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) product of the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The comparisons display similar spatial distributions over both land and ocean for the weekly global composites. Especially, the comparison of the two red SIF datasets demonstrates good agreement overall, indicating consistency of the two retrieval approaches. The retrieval uncertainty for the weekly global composite is about 13% and 10% of the peak SIF value over land/ocean, respectively, which can be considered as satisfactory error thresholds for global SIF observations.

TI  - Impact of SAR Image Resolution on Polarimetric Persistent Scatterer Interferometry With Amplitude Dispersion Optimization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric persistent scatterer interferometry (PolPSI) takes advantage of polarimetric optimization algorithms that enhance interferogramsx2019; phase quality by adequately combining the available polarization channels (e.g., HH, VV, HV, and VH) into an improved one. Amplitude dispersion is one of the commonly used phase quality metrics for this optimization. The resolution of the images is supposed to have an impact on the performance of -based PolPSI in terms of both pixel density and quality. In this research, this impact is investigated. Specifically, 30 quad-pol RADARSAT-2 images over Barcelona with a resolution around 5 m in both range and azimuth are employed to generate additional data sets with degraded resolutions, ranging from 7.5 to 20 m. The results confirm that, in all cases, the ability of to select high-quality pixels, i.e., persistent scatterers, decreases when the spatial resolution worsens because the loss of resolution increases the number of scatterers present in a resolution cell. In addition, it would be expected that the performance of the polarimetric optimization ofwould tend to decrease when the spatial resolution worsens. However, for all employed resolutions, the polarimetric optimization improves the density and quality of PSs with respect to that of any single polarimetric channel. Moreover, this improvement is more noticeable, in relative terms, as the image resolution degrades.

TI  - Polarimetric Persistent Scatterer Interferometry for Ground Deformation Monitoring with VV-VH Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of the Sentinel-1 satellites, it becomes easy to obtain long time-series dual-pol (i.e., VV and VH channels) SAR images over most areas of the world. By combining the information from both VV and VH channels, the polarimetric persistent scatterer interferometry (PolPSI) techniques is supposed to achieve better ground deformation monitoring results than conventional PSI techniques (using only VV channel) with Sentinel-1 data. According to the quality metric used for polarimetric optimizations, the most commonly used PolPSI techniques can be categorized into three main categories. They are PolPSI-ADI (amplitude dispersion index as the phase quality metric), PolPSI-COH (coherence as the phase quality metric), and PolPSI-AOS (taking adaptive optimization strategies). Different categories of PolPSI techniques are suitable for different study areas and with different performances. However, the study that simultaneously applies all the three types of PolPSI techniques on Sentinel-1 PolSAR images is rare. Moreover, there has been little discussion about different characteristics of the three types of PolPSI techniques and how to use them with Sentinel-1 data. To this end, in this study, three data sets in China have been used to evaluate the three types of PolPSI techniques' performances. Based on results obtained, the different characteristics of PolPSI techniques have been discussed. The results show that all three PolPSI techniques can improve the phase quality of interferograms. Thus, more qualified pixels can be used for ground deformation estimation by PolPSI methods with respect to the PSI technique. Specifically, this pixel density improvement is 50%, 12%, and 348% for the PolPSI-ADI, PolPSI-COH, and POlPSI-AOS, respectively. PolPSI-ADI is the most efficient method, and it is the first choice for the area with abundant deterministic scatterers (e.g., urban areas). Benefitting from its adaptive optimization strategy, PolPSI-AOS has the best performances at the price of highest computation cost, which is suitable for rural area applications. On the other hand, limited by the medium resolution of Sentinel-1 PolSAR images, PolPSI-COH's improvement with respect to conventional PSI is relatively insignificant.

TI  - Study on the Changes of Urban Green Space with Remote Sensing Data: a Comparison of Nanjing and Greater Manchester
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Green space effectively maintains urban ecological environment, improves life quality, and promotes sustainable development. Taking Nanjing and Greater Manchester as study cases, based on the land use data from remote sensing interpretation, this study used a combination of mathematical statistics and GIS spatial analysis methods to analyze the evolution of green spatial patterns in terms of general characteristics, gradient characteristics and evolution characteristics, in order to provide scientific reference for the protection of green space and sustainable urban development in Nanjing. Results showed that the green space has increasingly decreased from 2000 to 2010 in Nanjing, and in Greater Manchester, decreased first, then increased from 2000 to 2011. The area of green space gradually increased from the central area to the suburbs and the suburbs in both cities, and in Nanjing it significantly changed in the suburbs and outer suburbs, while in Greater Manchester the changes were mainly in central and suburban areas. We also found that the new towns were the main transfer areas of cold spots while the central areas are mainly the hot spots transfer areas in Nanjing, and outspread shrinkage was the main evolution model; meanwhile, in Greater Manchester, green space had a lower changing intensity as well as smaller cold & hot spots numbers and more scattered distribution, and the evolution model was dominated by endocytosis-type in construction land. This study argued that Nanjing should improve the compactness of the city and regulate the relationship between construction land and green space through land redevelopment and functional replacement within construction land.

TI  - GCFnet: Global Collaborative Fusion Network for Multispectral and Panchromatic Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among various multimodal remote sensing data, the pairing of multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images is widely used in remote sensing applications. This article proposes a novel global collaborative fusion network (GCFnet) for joint classification of MS and PAN images. In particular, a global patch-free classification scheme based on an encoder-decoder deep learning (DL) network is developed to exploit context dependencies in the image. The proposed GCFnet is designed based on a novel collaborative fusion architecture, which mainly contains three parts: 1) two shallow-to-deep feature fusion branches related to individual MS and PAN images; 2) a multiscale cross-modal feature fusion branch of the two images, where an adaptive loss weighted fusion strategy is designed to calculate the total loss of two individual and the cross-modal branches; and 3) a probability weighted decision fusion strategy for the fusion of the classification results of three branches to further improve the classification performance. Experimental results obtained on three real datasets covering complex urban scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed GCFnet in terms of higher accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods. By utilizing both sampled and non-sampled position data in the feature extraction process, the proposed GCFnet can achieve excellent performance even in a small sample-size case.

TI  - PRIOR INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO MAP FLOODWATER IN URBANIZED AREAS

AB  - Due to the complexity of urban environments, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based mapping of floodwater is impacted by different factors such as water depth, building orientation and the density of built-up areas. Several studies have proven that both SAR multitemporal intensity and interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence data acquired in VV and VH polarizations support the urban flood mapping. We propose a deep learning (DL) based method using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 multitemporal intensity and coherence data combined with prior information to map floodwater in urbanized areas. The proposed method aims at mapping flooded areas in urbanized regions and bare soils/sparsely vegetated areas within the entire frame of a Sentinel-1 image. In this paper, our method is evaluated for the Houston (US) urban flood event in 2017 via a qualitative and quantitative comparison with two established DL models. The proposed method has the lowest number of false alarms in flooded urban areas, indicating that the prior information from the probabilistic urban mask is valuable.

TI  - Urban-Aware U-Net for Large-Scale Urban Flood Mapping Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1 Intensity and Interferometric Coherence
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity of backscattering mechanisms in built-up areas, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based mapping of floodwater in urban areas remains challenging. Open areas affected by flooding have low backscatter due to the specular reflection of calm water surfaces. Floodwater within built-up areas leads to double-bounce effects, the complexity of which depends on the configuration of floodwater concerning the facades of the surrounding buildings. Hence, it has been shown that the analysis of interferometric SAR coherence reduces the underdetection of floods in urbanized areas. Moreover, the high potential of deep convolutional neural networks for advancing SAR-based flood mapping is widely acknowledged. Therefore, we introduce an urban-aware U-Net model using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 multitemporal intensity and coherence data to map the extent of flooding in urban environments. It uses a priori information (i.e., an SAR-derived probabilistic urban mask) in the proposed urban-aware module, consisting of channel-wise attention and urban-aware normalization submodules to calibrate features and improve the final predictions. In this study, Sentinel-1 single-look complex data acquired over four study sites from three continents have been considered. The qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis have been carried out using six urban flood cases. A comparison with previous methods reveals a significant enhancement in the accuracy of urban flood mapping: the F1 score of flooded urban increased from 0.3 to 0.6 with few false alarms in urban area using our method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model trained with limited datasets has strong potential for near-real-time urban flood mapping.

TI  - Comparative Study of Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation Methods Based on Fine Spatial Resolution Images for Three Vegetation Types
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy estimates of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are vital for regional-scale vegetation growth monitoring. In this context, a question worth exploring is whether FVC estimation methods developed at 300-m to 1-km spatial resolution are suitable for finer spatial resolution satellite images. This study compared the performances of three types of algorithms [i.e., the pixel dichotomy model (PDM) based on either the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or an index of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), the gap probability theory (GPT), and linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA)] based on FVC ground measurements and fine resolution reference maps from the Validation of Land European Remote sensing Instrument (VALERI) project and the ImagineS field campaigns. For all vegetation types, the FVC estimates from the GPT method showed the best consistency with ground measurements of FVC [root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.17 and bias (BIAS) = 0.05]. For forest types, the PDM method based on NDVI also showed satisfactory results with ground measurements (RMSE = 0.17 and BIAS = 0.11). For sparse grasses, the PDM method based on NIRv showed better agreement with ground measurements (RMSE = 0.15 and BIAS = 0.01). This study provides a reference for selecting the method of FVC estimation with fine spatial resolution images.

AB  - Long-term continuous monitoring of coal mining activities is conducive to master the development and potential risk factors of the mining area. Radar reflected echo signal contains the intensity and phase information, which is suitable for detecting different types of mining areas. However, relevant coal mining detection research mainly focuses on phase information, which results in the application based on underground coal mines more than open-pit coal mines. In order to take full advantage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, in this paper, a novel mine detection method based on intensity and phase information is introduced to detect the underground and open pit coal mine using the multi-temporal ALOS data in Shenmu County, China. Firstly, Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technology is used to detect the deformation information caused by underground coal mine. Secondly, the coherence information is used to detect the deformation from both underground and open-pit coal mine. Moreover, change detection method based on intensity information is used to detect the open-pit coal mining. Finally, the results of phase, coherence and intensity are combined to detect the underground and open-pit coal mine. The experimental results of Shengdong mine show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - InSAR Constrained Downdip and Updip Afterslip Following the 2015 Nepal Earthquake: New Insights into Moment Budget of the Main Himalayan Thrust
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data spanning 2015-2020 to obtain the post-seismic deformation of the 2015 Mw 7.8 Nepal earthquake. ALOS-2 observations reveal that the post-seismic deformation was mainly distributed in four areas. A large-scale uplift deformation occurred in the northern subsidence area of the co-seismic deformation field, with a maximum uplift of ~80 mm within 4.5 yr after the mainshock. While in the southern coseismic uplift area, the direction of the post-seismic deformation is generally opposite to the co-seismic deformation. Additionally, two notable deformation areas are located in the region around 29 degrees N, and near the MFT, respectively. Sentinel-1 observations reveal post-seismic uplift deformation on the north side of the co-seismic deformation field with an average rate of ~20 mm/yr in line-of-stght. The kinematic afterslip constrained by InSAR data shows that the frictional slip is distributed in both updip and downdip areas. The maximum cumulative afterslip is 0.35 m in downdip areas, and 0.2 m in the updip areas, constrained by the ALOS measurements. The stress-driven afterslip model shows that the afterslip is distributed in the downdip area with a maximum slip of 0.3 m during the first year after the earthquake. Within the 4.5 yr after the mainshock, the estimated moment released by afterslip is ~1.5174 x 10(20) Nm,about 21.2% of that released by the main earthquake.

TI  - Double Propagation Stereo Matching for Urban 3-D Reconstruction From Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stereo matching is one of the popular methods to acquire the depth maps in 3-D reconstruction due to its high accuracy and completeness. However, traditional stereo matching methods are only suitable for general scenes or aerial images instead of urban scenes from large-scale satellite imageries. This article presents a novel double propagation stereo matching (DPSM) for urban 3-D reconstruction from satellite images. To make full use of the geometrical properties of man-made buildings, stereo-rectified satellite images, as input, are initialized to multiple superpixels with geometric models. Then, three similarity metrics are combined to calculate the weighted matching cost. A novel double propagation optimization is developed to optimize iteratively the weighted matching cost under the constraints of region boundaries and geometric models, and the disparity maps can be obtained by minimizing the energy function. Consequently, the corresponding dense 3-D point clouds and digital surface models (DSMs) are calculated by triangulation. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on stereo images captured by Pleiades and WorldView-2 satellites show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the most state-of-the-art stereo matching algorithms in terms of preserving depth discontinuous areas and restoring occlusions.

TI  - Potential of Mapping Global Soil Texture Type From SMAP Soil Moisture Product: A Pilot Study
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture and associated thermal and hydraulic parameters are key to land surface processes. Current global soil datasets are derived from limited soil samples, which are not only very costly but also prone to large uncertainties. While it is difficult to directly retrieve soil properties through satellite remote sensing, this study explores the feasibility of mapping global soil type and thereby corresponding soil texture through the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product without reference to soil samples. Specifically, for each grid-cell, 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil types are first used to drive the Noah-MP land surface model and then the optimal one is obtained by referring to a four-year (2015-2018) SMAP soil moisture time series. The proposed scheme can reasonably map the global distribution of soil types in terms of sand/clay content and porosity that are close to the Global Soil Dataset for Earth System Models (GSDE) dataset and outperform the one used in the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)/Noah model. The result of this pilot study is very encouraging as it purely relies on satellite data, which is especially important for remote areas where few soil samples are available and conventional soil datasets may have large biases. Further improvements may be achieved upon improved soil organic matter parameterization, through land data assimilation, and by considering additional satellite information.

TI  - High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Captioning Based on Structured Attention
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatically generating language descriptions of remote sensing images has become an emerging research hot spot in the remote sensing field. Attention-based captioning, as a representative group of recent deep learning-based captioning methods, shares the advantage of generating the words while highlighting corresponding object locations in the image. Standard attention-based methods generate captions based on coarse-grained and unstructured attention units, which fails to exploit structured spatial relations of semantic contents in remote sensing images. Although the structure characteristic makes remote sensing images widely divergent to natural images and poses a greater challenge for the remote sensing image captioning task, the key of most remote sensing captioning methods is usually borrowed from the computer vision community without considering the domain knowledge behind. To overcome this problem, a fine-grained, structured attention-based method is proposed to utilize the structural characteristics of semantic contents in high-resolution remote sensing images. Our method learns better descriptions and can generate pixelwise segmentation masks of semantic contents. The segmentation can be jointly trained with the captioning in a unified framework without requiring any pixelwise annotations. Evaluations are conducted on three remote sensing image captioning benchmark data sets with detailed ablation studies and parameter analysis. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves higher captioning accuracy and can generate high-resolution and meaningful segmentation masks of semantic contents at the same time.

TI  - Estimation of 1-km Resolution All-Sky Instantaneous Erythemal UV-B with MODIS Data Based on a Deep Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the ground represents a tiny fraction of the total solar radiant energy, it significantly affects human health and global ecosystems. Therefore, erythemal UV-B monitoring has recently attracted significant attention. However, traditional UV-B retrieval methods rely on empirical modeling and handcrafted features, which require expertise and fail to generalize to new environments. Furthermore, most traditional products have low spatial resolution. To address this, we propose a deep learning framework for retrieving all-sky, kilometer-level erythemal UV-B from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We designed a deep neural network with a residual structure to cascade high-level representations from raw MODIS inputs, eliminating handcrafted features. We used an external random forest classifier to perform the final prediction based on refined deep features extracted from the residual network. Compared with basic parameters, extracted deep features more accurately bridge the semantic gap between the raw MODIS inputs, improving retrieval accuracy. We established a dataset from 7 Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) stations and 1 from 30 UV-B Monitoring and Research Program (UVMRP) stations with MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance, solar and view zenith angle, surface reflectance, altitude, and ozone observations. A partial SURFRAD dataset from 2007-2016 trained the model, achieving an R-2 of 0.9887, a mean bias error (MBE) of 0.19 mW/m2, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.42 mW/m(2). The model evaluated on 2017 SURFRAD data shows an R-2 of 0.9376, an MBE of 1.24 mW/m(2), and an RMSE of 17.45 mW/m(2), indicating the proposed model accurately generalizes the temporal dimension. We evaluated the model at 30 UVMRP stations with different land cover from those of SURFRAD and found most stations had a relative RMSE of 25% and an MBE within & PLUSMN;5%, demonstrating generalization in the spatial dimension. This study demonstrates the potential of using MODIS data to accurately estimate all-sky erythemal UV-B with the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Based on the existing geological data and a large amount of research data in the study area, the article compared and analyzed the difference in hyperspectral reflectance between the potential enrichment area and the reference area. The use of Sentinel-2 multispectral images has been investigated to construct the surface recognition model of coalbed methane enrichment areas from two aspects: vegetation covered area and bare areas. Firstly, semi-automatic endmember extraction is implemented by adopting a more pratical spectral unmixing method. And the vegetation research area and mineral research area are separated accordingly. In the vegetation research area, the rich red edge information of Sentinel-2 is used to construct an anomaly recognition model. While in bare soil areas, advanced information processing technology is used to extract weak mineral alteration anomalies. The results are validated with field data.

AB  - The generalized gamma distribution has a preferable fitting ability for sea clutter in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar(SAR) images. However, the constant false alarm rate(CFAR) algorithm based on the generalized gamma distribution achieves the detection of ships by obtaining the global threshold of the sub-images. The result has a high false alarm rate and misses the ships that are within spitting distance in SAR images. Aiming at these shortcomings, a modified generalized gamma CFAR algorithm is proposed in this paper. The modified algorithm has higher accuracy and efficiency by introducing the preprocessor and adaptive clutter-filtering mechanism. The algorithm is evaluated by using the measured data of Gaofen-3 satellite to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

TI  - Improving Deep Subdomain Adaptation by Dual-Branch Network Embedding Attention Module for SAR Ship Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at improving fine-grained ship classification performance under the condition that there is no labeled samples available in SAR domain (target domain) by transferring the knowledge from optical remote sensing (ORS) domain (source domain), which has rich labeled samples. The proposed method improves the original deep subdomain adaptation network (DSAN) by designing a dual-branch network (DBN) embedding attention module to extract more discriminative deep transferable features, thereby improving the performance of the subdomain adaptation. Specifically, we utilized a deep base network (ResNet-50) and a shallow base network (ResNet-18) to build the DBN, and embedded the convolutional block attention module after the first and the last convolutional layer of each branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, which is termed as DSAN++, is feasible and achieves remarkable improvement than the state-of-the-art methods on the task of fine-grained ship classification.

TI  - Impact of Water Level Fluctuations on Landslide Deformation at Longyangxia Reservoir, Qinghai Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of Longyangxia Reservoir has altered the hydrogeological conditions of its banks. Infiltration and erosion caused by the periodic rise and fall of the water level leads to collapse of the reservoir banks and local deformation of the landslide. Due to heterogeneous topographic characteristics across the region, water level also varies between different location. Previous research on the influence of fluctuations in reservoir water level on landslide deformation has focused on single-point monitoring of specific slopes, and single-point water level monitoring data have often been used instead of water level data for the entire reservoir region. In addition, integrated remote sensing methods have seldom been used for regional analysis. In this study, the freely-available Landsat8 OLI and Sentinel-2 data were used to extract the water level of Longyangxia Reservoir using the NDWI method, and Sentinel-1A data were used to obtain landslide deformation time series using SBAS-InSAR technology. Taking the Chana, Chaxi, and Mangla River Estuary landslides (each having different reservoir water level depths) as typical examples, the influence of changes in reservoir water level on the deformation of three wading landslides was analyzed. Our main conclusions are as follows: First, the change in water level is the primary external factor controlling the deformation velocity and trend of landslides in the Longyangxia Reservoir, with falling water levels having the greatest influence. Second, the displacement of the Longyangxia Reservoir landslides lags water level changes by 0 to 62 days. Finally, this study provides a new method applicable other areas without water level monitoring data.

TI  - A Fast and Effective Irregular Stripe Removal Method for Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<SUP>3</SUP>)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) is one of the emerging tools to explore the physical properties and chemical composition of the lunar surface. Moon mineralogy mapper (M3) is the most widely used lunar HSI data set with the widest coverage and the excellent resolution; however, dense and nonperiodic stripes distributed across all bands in M-3 images hinder visual interpretation as well as their use in subsequent applications. In this article, a fast destriping approach for M-3 is proposed using the Hodrick-Prescott decomposition embedded in the low-rank framework (LRHP) to overcome this limitation. The integration of a statistical filter and variational model tackles the problem stemming from a lack of the correct residual information when certain pixels are corrupted in every band, thereby restoring severely degraded hyperspectral images (HSIs). Simulated and real experiments conducted on typical regions on the Moon with various levels of corruption demonstrate that the proposed LRHP rapidly achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Also, expanding tests on interference imaging spectrometer (IIM) data of Chang'E-1 and commonly used terrestrial remote sensing images show that LRHP has good generalization capability. Moreover, the integrated band depth (IBD) maps further verify the necessity of destriping and the high spectral fidelity of LRHP that benefits further applications.

TI  - An Improved Annual Temperature Cycle Model With the Consideration of Vegetation Change
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in land surface processes with strong relationship between surface energy and water exchange. To effectively capture the surface thermal dynamics, the annual temperature cycle model is a good option by depicting the annual variation as a constant term plus a sine function. However, this type model suffers from the assumption of constant surface thermal property which is hardly satisfied due to the changes in vegetation cover. To well address this issue, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is introduced as an indicator to characterize the variation in surface thermal property and added to the original form to propose an improved version. Through comparison between the fitting effects of the proposed model with the original one, the improvement shows good performance in suppressing the annual maximum temperature and elevating the annual minimum temperature with the increase in vegetation cover. The difference in the annual maximum and minimum temperature between the estimates from the proposed model and the original model shows good linear regression with NDVI difference when compared with the annual mean value, with the speed of -3.22 and 4.84, respectively. In addition, the fitting accuracy is also improved with a slight increase in the coefficient of determination (0.002) and a decrease in the root mean squared error (0.018 K). The application of the proposed model also provides reasonable distribution of the annual temperature parameters in the southwest of Europe and part of North Africa, confirming its potential effect in thermal dynamic monitoring.

TI  - Jitter Detection Method Based on Rolling Shutter CMOS Imaging for Space Cameras
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The jitter caused by onboard motion components is an important factor affecting the quality of ultra-high-resolution and super-maneuverability imaging. Given that it is difficult to conduct accurate operational detection and identification of the jitter signal, this paper proposes a jitter detection method based on rolling shutter CMOS imaging for space cameras and verifies and evaluates the method with digital orthophoto map/digital elevation model (DOM/DEM) data by using high-frequency angular displacement and high-precision reference. A Gaofen satellite launched in 2020 is discussed as an example. The analysis results show that the proposed detection method can effectively identify the jitter characteristics in the imaging process of space cameras, and the jitter frequency is mainly concentrated at about 156 Hz. The relative geometric accuracy of panchromatic images after compensation is improved by about 1.2 pixel.

TI  - Teaching Teachers First and Then Student: Hierarchical Distillation to Improve Long-Tailed Object Recognition in Aerial Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data distribution generally exposes the long-tailed characteristic. This will limit the object recognition performance of existing deep models when they are trained with such unbalanced data. In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical distillation framework (HDF) to address the long-tailed object recognition in aerial images. First, we notice that not only student model should learn feature representations from teachers but also teacher models should learn feature representations from each other. Therefore, we build hierarchical teacher-wise distillation (HTWD) to improve the feature representations of the teacher models trained with middle and tail data, which is achieved by distilling the feature representations of the teacher model trained with head data. Second, we notice that the feature representations of the middle and tail classes cannot be effectively distilled from the teacher to the student since too little middle and tail data can be used to learn. Thus, we propose self-calibrated sampling (SCS) learning that enforces the student to strengthen the learning of the middle and tail data, thereby improving the student' feature learning ability. Extensive experiments on two widely used DOTA and FGSC-23 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Contextual-Aware Land Cover Classification With U-Shaped Object Graph Neural Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate land cover mapping with remote sensing images played a huge role in ecosystem monitoring. However, due to the spectral variability and spatial complexity of high-resolution remote sensing images, it is often difficult to find an efficient method to achieve accurate land cover classification. To explore useful contextual and hierarchical features in remote sensing images, this letter proposes a U-shaped object graph neural network (U-OGNN), which is mainly composed of self-adaptive graph construction (SAGC), hierarchical graph encoder, and decoder. For SAGC, the similarity measurement is applied to generate a contextual-aware graph structure, by feeding deep features extracted from convolution and multilayer attention operations. Graph encoder and decoder fuse multilevel information over different scales by capturing hierarchical features of adjacent objects. In this way, the proposed method is able to predict land cover types by considering multilevel contextual information accurately. Experiments on Gaofen image dataset (GID) land cover classification datasets, the overall accuracies of the U-OGNN reach 87.81%.

TI  - Sea Ice Concentration Derived From FY-3D MWRI and Its Accuracy Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) sensors aboard on the Chinese FengYun-3 (FY-3) series satellites have a great potential for long-term study of sea ice distribution. This study corrected the newly released FY-3D MWRI brightness temperature (TB) data with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) TB data and used an Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) dynamic tie points algorithm to derive the sea ice concentration (SIC) from these corrected MWRI TB data. We assessed the accuracy of our MWRI-ASI SIC product by comparing with the published SIC products at different spatial resolution and by validating with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-1 data. We find that MWRI-ASI SIC has the smallest difference with AMSR2-ASI SIC with the mean absolute difference (MAD) of 6.8x0025;, and the differences mainly occur at the marginal ice zone regions. The MWRI-ASI displays the highest difference with Sea Ice Index and OSI-430-b at 25 km with the mean MAD of 11.8x0025;. MADs between MWRI-ASI SIC and SIC products from other sensors are below 10x0025; except for late June to early October, when those are higher. Compared with the MODIS SIC, MWRI-ASI SIC outperforms other SIC products at the same resolution, with the mean bias of x2212;2.1x0025; and mean RMSD of 13.5x0025;. Although MWRI-ASI tends to under-estimate high SIC, it can capture details of large leads, ice edge, and fragmented ice area. Our MWRI-ASI SIC product at 12.5 km is promising to integrate into long-term sea ice records.

TI  - Groundwater potential assessment mapping from GaoFen-6 satellite data by a deep network model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an important fresh water resource, which is very important for human survival. We analyzed groundwater potential assessment (GPA) by using back propagation (BP) neural network model and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model in remote sensing and geographic information system in the north of Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province, China. We have used a variety of factors related to groundwater. These models were based on the relationship between groundwater supply potential and hydrogeological factors. GaoFen-6 remote sensing image was first collected, processed and got lithology, relief, slope, flow accumulation (FA), land temperature, soil humidity and vegetation coverage. Water yield data were collected from 36 well locations. We determined the weight of each index by using BP neural network and AHP. The results were fitted with the actual well water yield. The R-2 of BP neural network and AHP models for GPA were 0.89125 and 0.85946, respectively. The results show that BP neural network model can eliminate the influence of subjective factors on the results. It is BP neural network model that more suitable for the development and utilization of groundwater resources than AHP model. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Red Tide Detection Method for HY-1D Coastal Zone Imager Based on U-Net Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing red tide detection methods have mainly been developed for ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution. Higher spatial resolution satellite images are required for red tides with fine scale and scattered distribution. However, red tide detection methods for ocean color satellite data cannot be directly applied to medium-high spatial resolution satellite data owing to the shortage of red tide responsive bands. Therefore, a new red tide detection method for medium-high spatial resolution satellite data is required. This study proposes the red tide detection U-Net (RDU-Net) model by considering the HY-1D Coastal Zone Imager (HY-1D CZI) as an example. RDU-Net employs the channel attention model to derive the inter-channel relationship of red tide information in order to reduce the influence of the marine environment on red tide detection. Moreover, the boundary and binary cross entropy (BBCE) loss function, which incorporates the boundary loss, is used to obtain clear and accurate red tide boundaries. In addition, a multi-feature dataset including the HY-1D CZI radiance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is employed to enhance the spectral difference between red tides and seawater and thus improve the accuracy of red tide detection. Experimental results show that RDU-Net can detect red tides accurately without a precedent threshold. Precision and Recall of 87.47% and 86.62%, respectively, are achieved, while the F1-score and Kappa are 0.87. Compared with the existing method, the F1-score is improved by 0.07-0.21. Furthermore, the proposed method can detect red tides accurately even under interference from clouds and fog, and it shows good performance in the case of red tide edges and scattered distribution areas. Moreover, it shows good applicability and can be successfully applied to other satellite data with high spatial resolution and large bandwidth, such as GF-1 Wide Field of View 2 (WFV2) images.

AB  - Focusing on joint classification of Hyperspectral image (HSI) and Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, a fractional Fourier image transformer (FrIT) is proposed as a backbone network in this paper. In the proposed FrIT, HSI and LiDAR data are firstly fused at pixel-level. Both multi-source and HSI feature extractors are utilized to capture local contexts. Then, a plug-and-play image transformer FrIT is explored for global contexts and sequential feature extraction. Unlike the attention-based representations in classic visual image transformer (VIT), FrIT is capable of speeding up the transformer architectures massively. To reduce the information loss from shallow to deep layers, FrIT is devised to connect contextual features in multiple fractional domains. At last, to evaluate the performance of FrIT, a new HSI and LiDAR benchmark is provided for extensive experiments, on which the proposed FrIT gains an improvement of 3% over state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Cross-Domain Classification of Multisource Remote Sensing Data Using Fractional Fusion and Spatial-Spectral Domain Adaptation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Limitation of labeled samples has always been a challenge for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. In real remote sensing applications, we encounter a situation where an HSI scene is not labeled at all. To solve this problem, cross-domain learning methods are developed by utilizing another HSI scene with similar land covers and sufficient labeled samples. However, the disparity between HSI scenes is still a challenge in reducing the classification performance, which may be affected by variations in illumination and weather. As a robust supplement to these variations, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data provide stable elevation and spatial information. In this article, we propose a multisource cross-domain classification method using fractional fusion and spatial-spectral domain adaptation to reduce the disparity between scenes. First, the spatial information of HSI is preserved by fractional differential masks. Then, the LiDAR data are utilized for spectral alignment of HSI. The utilization of LiDAR data reduces the pixel-level disparity between scenes. At last, a spatial-spectral domain adaptation network is proposed to reduce domain shift at the feature level and extract discriminative spatial-spectral features. Experimental results on HSI and LiDAR scenes show 5% -10% improvements in overall accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Fractional Gabor Convolutional Network for Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing using multisensor platforms has been systematically applied for monitoring and optimizing human activities. Several advanced techniques have been developed to enhance and extract the spatially and spectrally semantic information in the hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data processing and analysis. However, an abundance of redundant information and sometimes a lack of discriminative features reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of multisource classification methods. This article proposes a fractional Gabor convolutional network (FGCN), focusing on efficient feature fusion and comprehensive feature extraction. First, the proposed FGCN uses Octave convolution layers to perform multisource information fusion and preserve discriminative information. Second, fractional Gabor convolutional (FGC) layers are proposed to extract multiscale, multidirectional, and semantic change features. The completeness and discrimination of the multisource features using different FGC kernels are improved, which yield robust feature extraction against semantic changes. Finally, the fractional Gabor feature and spectral feature are combined with two weighting factors which can be learned during the network training. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art multisource classification methods indicate the effectiveness of the proposed FGCN. With the FGCN, we can obtain an 89.90x0025; overall accuracy on the challenging Muufl Gulfport (MUUFL) data set, with an improvement of 3x0025; over state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - For more than five decades, remote sensing imagery has been providing critical information for many applications such as crop monitoring, disaster assessment, and urban planning. Unfortunately, more than 50% of optical remote sensing images are contaminated by clouds severely affecting the object identification. However, thanks to recent advances in remote sensing instruments and increase in number of operational satellites, we now have petabytes of multi-sensor observations covering the globe. Historically cloud imputation techniques were designed for single sensor images, thus existing benchmarks were mostly limited to single sensor images, which precludes design and validation of cloud imputation techniques on multi-sensor data. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark data set consisting of images from two widely used and publicly available satellite images, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, and a new multi-stream deep residual network (MDRN). This newly introduced benchmark dataset fills an important gap in the existing benchmark datasets, which allows exploitation of multi-resolution spectral information from the cloud-free regions of temporally nearby images, and the MDRN algorithm addresses imputation using the multi-resolution data. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the utility of our benchmark dataset and as well as efficacy of our MDRN architecture in cloud imputation. The MDRN outperforms the closest competing method by 14.1%.

TI  - Estimation of Individual Tree Biomass in Natural Secondary Forests Based on ALS Data and WorldView-3 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual-tree aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation can highlight the spatial distribution of AGB and is vital for precision forestry. Accurately estimating individual tree AGB is a requisite for accurate forest carbon stock assessment of natural secondary forests (NSFs). In this study, we investigated the performance of three machine learning and three ensemble learning algorithms in tree species classification based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) and WorldView-3 imagery, inversed the diameter at breast height (DBH) using an optimal tree height curve model, and mapped individual tree AGB for a site in northeast China using additive biomass equations, tree species, and inversed DBH. The results showed that the combination of ALS and WorldView-3 performed better than either single data source in tree species classification, and ensemble learning algorithms outperformed machine learning algorithms (except CNN). Seven tree species had satisfactory accuracy of individual tree AGB estimation, with R-2 values ranging from 0.68 to 0.85 and RMSE ranging from 7.47 kg to 36.83 kg. The average individual tree AGB was 125.32 kg and the forest AGB was 113.58 Mg/ha in the Maoershan study site in Heilongjiang Province, China. This study provides a way to classify tree species and estimate individual tree AGB of NSFs based on ALS data and WorldView-3 imagery.

AB  - Burned area mapping is an essential task for assessing the damages caused by the wildfires. Optical satellite data have often been used for burned area mapping. However, due to cloud cover and smoke, it is sometimes difficult to use optical data for accurate burned area mapping at global scale. The objective of this research is to evaluate the PALSAR- 2 instrument onboard Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) for burned area mapping at several sites around the world. In this study, a global scale bi-temporal dataset using the L-band PALSAR-2 instrument was created for the research of burned area mapping. Then a U-Net segmentation model was adopted to segment the burned area from the bi-temporal dataset. The results showed that L-Band SAR images can effectively map burned area using the segmentation model. Moreover, ablation study on the impact of different backbones revealed that the average U-Net yielded the best performance while U-Net with Resnext101 as the backbone outperforms U-Net for Grassland and Broadleaf Forest.

AB  - Using the AVHRR OISST data from 1982 to 2019, the spatial and temporal characteristics of SST in the North Pacific Ocean were analyzed. The relationships between SST (Sea Surface Temperature) and SLP (Sea Level Pressure) as well as SSWF (Sea Surface Wind Field) were also discussed based on the ERA5 data. The study showed that the mean value of SST increased slowly at a rising rate of 0.12 degrees C/10yr during 1982-2019. EOF analysis showed that the dominant modes in the North Pacific were ENSO mode, consistent warming mode and dipole mode. There was a positive correlation of 0.58 between SLP and SST in the Aleutian low pressure area, while there was a negative correlation relationship from east Hawaiian Islands to the California seas. SST was mainly influenced by easterly winds in the area north of 36 degrees N, while by southerly winds in the sea south of 36 degrees N.

TI  - The Impact of Climate and Land Use on the Spatio-temporal Changes of NDVI of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative, the change of the normalized differential vegetation index ( NDVI) along the Corridor has a profound impact on the improvement of the local ecological environment. Based on the 1995-2015 AVHRR GIMMS NDVI data set, and in combination with data on the climate and land use types during the same period, the spatiotemporal shifts and trends of the vegetation NDVI of the Corridor, as well as the relationship between climate changes and land uses have been analyzed by using maximum value synthesis methods, the Sen+MK trend analysis and the partial correlation analysis. The results show that : (1) There is relatively poor vegetation coverage along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Over the 20 years period, its overall vegetation NDVI had shown an upward trend, despite some fluctuations; however, the spatial difference is remarkable, showcasing a decreasing trend from the center to the north and south; (2) The vegetation NDVI along the Corridor has been generally improved and kept basically stable. The improved areas are mainly distributed in the northeastern part of Pakistan and the western part of Kashgar of Xinjiang, China, while the basically stable ones are located in the southwestern part of Pakistan and the eastern part of Xinjiang; (3) The average annual temperature and precipitation in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor area demonstrated a fluctuating upward trend from 1995 to 2015, indicating a significant positive correlation with the changes in the vegetation NDVI. The temperature in the research area inhibits the growth of vegetation, whereas the precipitation promotes it. Among all the climate zones of the Corridor, the tropical monsoon climate delivers the highest vegetation NDVI, and with the fastest annual growth rate; precipitation and vegetation NDVI are positively con-elated in all climate zones of the Corridor, but vegetation and temperature are negatively correlated in the tropical desert climate; (4) From 1995 to 2015, there was an increasing trend in the average NDVI of cultivated land, woodland and grassland in the Corridor. Specifically, the NDVI of cultivated land grew at the fastest speed (0.002 4 a-1) , contributing the most to the total increase in NDVI across the entire region. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis and reference for vegetation enhancement and regional ecological environment protection in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

AB  - Remote sensing image data has long been used for variable inversion and environmental monitoring. In this study, we constructed a fire point model using diverse spectral parameters of Himawari-8 images with fire datasets. The model's loss was used to determine the distinction between fire points and non-fire points for various parameters, assisting in the parameter selection for the fire monitoring model. Himawari-8 image data in the visible, near-infrared and infrared bands were inversed to obtain reflectance and brightness temperature. A deep learning fire recognition model is built using selected combination parameters, context-variable parameters, and indices in conjunction with the fire database. The model's accuracy is 97.8%, with a loss and false detection rate for specific fire database of 2.8% and 1.62%, respectively, the latter of which is lower than that of MOD14 product 8.08%. It reduces the number of false fire warnings and improves fire monitoring accuracy.

TI  - Multisource-Domain Generalization-Based Oil Palm Tree Detection Using Very-High-Resolution (VHR) Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing accurate and timely oil palm information on a large scale is essential for both economic development and ecological significance. However, owing to different sensors, photograph acquisition conditions, and environmental heterogeneity, the large volume and the variety of the data make it extremely challenging for large-scale and cross-regional oil palm tree detection. It is computationally expensive to train a model from images covering large heterogeneous regions and all environmental conditions for continuously accumulated multisource remote sensing data. In this letter, we propose a new multisource domain generalization (DG) method, Maximum Mean Discrepancy Deep Reconstruction Classification Network (MMD-DRCN). It learns representations from multiple source domains and obtains inspiring performance in an unknown and "unseen" target domain. Besides classification loss, our MMD-DRCN distills more representative features through reconstruction loss and aligns multisource latent features by MMD loss, both of which effectively enhance the capacity of generalization. MMD-DRCN achieves an average F1-score of 82.70% in all transfer tasks, attaining a 5.83% gain compared to Baseline (a straightforward convolutional neural network (CNN) model). Experimental results demonstrate DG poses a promising potential for large-scale and cross-regional oil palm tree detection without any information of the target domain.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More and more high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image datasets have been available, which promote the applications of SAR images in land cover classification, such as vegetation monitoring, land cover, land use, cartography, etc. A novel algorithm based on the encoder-decoder structure is proposed in this paper. We add the channel attention and spatial attention modules to the algorithm for SAR images land cover classification. And these two modules, which interact with each other instead of being completely independent, can maximize the use of extracted information. Experiments on the high-resolution Gaofen-3 dataset have been carried out. Some classical semantic segmentation algorithms, including SegNet, HR-Net, Deeplabv3+, and GF3-baseline, are utilized to compare with the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the encoder-decoder network with the attention mechanism can get higher accuracy than other encoder-decoder networks.

TI  - Predictive Values of sTREM-1, PCT and CRP for Multiple Trauma- Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Complicated with Pulmonary Infection
T2  - CLINICAL LABORATORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim is to investigate the predictive values of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for multiple trauma-induced acute respira-tory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicated with pulmonary infection.Methods: One hundred and twelve patients with multiple trauma-induced ARDS admitted from April 2019 to April 2021 were selected and divided into infection group (n = 49) and non-infection group (n = 63). Their general data and laboratory test indicators were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to identi-fy the influencing factors for concurrent pulmonary infection. Pearson's analysis was employed to analyze the cor-relations of sTREM-1, PCT, and CRP with other influencing factors. The predictive values of sTREM-1, PCT, and CRP for pulmonary infection in ARDS patients were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Based on the cutoff values, the patients were assigned to low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. Survival curves were plotted by Kaplan-Meier method to compare the 28-day survival.Results: The infection group had significantly higher injury severity score (ISS), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sTREM-1, PCT, CRP, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, longer tracheal intubation time and intensive care unit (ICU) stay time, and lower oxygenation index than those of the non-infection group (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increased ISS, APACHE II score, as well as elevated blood concentrations of sTREM-1, PCT, CRP and MIP-1 alpha were risk factors for concurrent pulmonary infection (p < 0.05). sTREM-1, PCT, and CRP were positively correlated with ISS, APACHE II score, and MIP-1 alpha (p < 0.05). The areas under ROC curves of sTREM-1, PCT, CRP, and their com-bination were 0.795, 0.784, 0.756, and 0.860, respectively (p < 0.001), indicating high predictive values. The surviv-al rate of the high-risk group (46.43%) was significantly lower than those of the low-risk group (89.58%) and me-dium-risk group (75.00%) (p < 0.05).Conclusions: sTREM-1, PCT, and CRP are highly expressed in serum of patients with multiple trauma-induced ARDS complicated with pulmonary infection. The combined detection of three markers is of high predictive value.

TI  - Ice/Snow Surface Temperature Retrieval From Chinese FY-3D MERSI-II Data: Algorithm and Preliminary Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice/snow surface temperature (I/SST) is an essential parameter in many research fields such as the climate change, energy, and matter balance of the South pole regions. Recently, many algorithms have been developed for various satellite observations to derive the I/SST. However, rare studies focus on accurate I/SST retrieval from the observations of Chinese MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-II) instrument onboard the FY-3D satellite with the spatial resolution of 250 m and temporal resolution of about five days, which just bridges the specifications of the Aqua-MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (1000-m pixel size and 0.5-day revisit cycle) and Landsat-Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) (100-m pixel size and 16-day revisit cycle) instruments. In this study, a new method with correction of striping noise and consideration of angular emissivity effect is developed for the MERSI-II data to accurately retrieve the I/SST. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by using both MODIS product and ground I/SST measurements. The results show that the FY-3D I/SST retrieval accuracy is comparable to the MODIS product, with a discrepancy of < 1.6 K. Ground-based validation reveals that the proposed method could be used to accurately retrieve the I/SST with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of < 1.5 K. Overall, this study proposes a method for accurate I/SST retrieval from the FY-3D MERSI-II data with the pixel size of 250 m, implying the possibilities in improving the spatio-temporal resolutions of the current I/SST products. Moreover, the proposed method is also helpful to improve our understandings of the polar regions.

TI  - Comparison of Macro- and Microphysical Properties in Precipitating and Non-Precipitating Clouds over Central-Eastern China during Warm Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The macro- and microphysical properties of clouds can reflect their vertical physical structure and evolution and are important indications of the formation and development of precipitation. We used four-year merged CloudSat-CALIPSO-MODIS products to distinguish the macro- and microphysical properties of precipitating and non-precipitating clouds over central-eastern China during the warm season (May-September). Our results showed that the clouds were dominated by single- and double-layer forms with occurrence frequencies > 85%. Clouds with a low probability of precipitation (POP) were usually geometrically thin. The POP showed an increasing trend with increases in the cloud optical depth, liquid water path, and ice water path, reaching maxima of 50%, 60%, and 75%, respectively. However, as cloud effective radius (CER) increased, the POP changed from an increasing to a decreasing trend for a CER > 22 mu m, in contrast with our perception that large particles fall more easily against updrafts, but this shift can be attributed to the transition of the cloud phase from mixed clouds to ice clouds. A high POP > 60% usually occurred in mixed clouds with vigorous ice-phase processes. There were clear differences in the microphysical properties of non-precipitating and precipitating clouds. In contrast with the vertical evolution of non-precipitating clouds with weaker reflectivity, precipitating clouds were present above 0 dBZ with a significant downward increase in reflectivity, suggesting inherent differences in cloud dynamical and microphysical processes. Our findings highlight the differences in the POP of warm and mixed clouds, suggesting that the low frequency of precipitation from water clouds should be the focus of future studies.

TI  - Induction of multiple subroutines of regulated necrosis in murine macrophages by natural BH3-mimetic gossypol
T2  - ACTA BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophages are critical sentinel cells armed with multiple regulated necrosis pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis followed by secondary necrosis, and necroptosis, and are poised to undergo distinct form(s) of necrosis for tackling dangers of pathogenic infection or toxic exposure. The natural BH3-mimetic gossypol is a toxic phytochemical that can induce apoptosis and/or pyroptotic-like cell death, but what exact forms of regulated necrosis are induced remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrated that gossypol induces pyroptotic-like cell death in both unprimed and lipopolysaccharide-primed mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), as evidenced by membrane swelling and ballooning accompanied by propidium iodide incorporation and lactic acid dehydrogenase release. Notably, gossypol simultaneously induces the activation of both pyroptotic and apoptotic (followed by secondary necrosis) pathways but only weakly activates the necroptosis pathway. Unexpectedly, gossypol-induced necrosis is independent of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, as neither inhibitor for the NLRP3 pathway nor NLRP3 deficiency protects the macrophages from the necrosis. Furthermore, necrotic inhibitors or even pan-caspase inhibitor alone does not or only partly inhibit such necrosis. Instead, a combination of inhibitors composed of pan-caspase inhibitor IDN-6556, RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 and NADPH oxidase inhibitor GKT137831 not only markedly inhibits the necrosis, with all apoptotic and pyroptotic pathways being blocked, but also attenuates gossypol-induced peritonitis in mice. Lastly, the activation of the NLRP3 pathway and apoptotic caspase-3 appears to be independent of each other. Collectively, gossypol simultaneously induces the activation of multiple subroutines of regulated necrosis in macrophages depending on both apoptotic and inflammatory caspases.

CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - The potential safety hazards for the power grid caused by explosion of insulators occur again and again. Thus, the detecting and monitoring of insulators on the transmission towers is vital. In the paper, a novel method was proposed to detect insulators with high resolution satellites images. First, the SuperView-1 (0.5 m) and WorldView-3 (0.3 m) scenes of Yunnan were gathered, and then gram-schmidt method was used to fusion the original images. Second, a wide deep super resolution network (WDSR) is used to enhance the images resolution by 4 times. Third, fake color output and 1% linear stretched were applied to enhance image detail. Then, an object detection neural network based on feature pyramid networks (FPN) was used to detect transmission tower. Finally, a high-resolution network (HR-Net) was used to detect insulators on the tower. For comparison, three different class weight calculation methods and online hard example mining (OHEM) training methods of HR-Net were also proposed. HR-Net-c2-ohem final achieved highest 0.8001 of F1-Score. Therefore, our proposed method is robust to detect the insulators of transmission line tower with high resolution satellites images.

TI  - Orthorectification Model for Extra-Length Linear Array Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The orthorectification accuracy for an extra-length linear array image is restricted by large distortions of the lens and the strong correlation of exterior orientation parameters (EOPs). This article presents an orthorectification model for solving the above problems through dividing the distortion into two zones and modeling the distortions using two different models, as well as two constrains. The first one is the axial vector rotation coplanar, i.e., the axial vector is located in the imaging plane after two rotations, and the second one is the angle consistent, i.e., the angle between the ground space viewing vectors is equal to the angle between the ideal image space viewing vectors. The Beijing-2(BJ2) satellite images with a linear array of 30 076 pixels and the SPOT-HRV with 6000 pixels are used for verification of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that the orthorectification accuracy of the BJ2 image is improved from 1.938 m (about 2.42 pixel) to 1.440 m (about 1.80 pixel), and the orthorectification accuracy of the SPOT image is improved from 14.668 m (about 1.47 pixel) to 8.657 m (about 0.87 pixel). Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed method can achieve a higher accuracy than the traditional orthorectification method does.

TI  - Land Surface Albedo Estimation With Chinese GF-1 WFV Data in Northwest China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo (LSA) is one of the driving factors in the energy balance of surface radiation and the interaction between the earth and atmosphere. LSA is an important parameter that is widely used in surface energy balance, medium- and long-term weather forecasting, and global change studies. GF-1 wide field view (WFV) data provide a spatial resolution of 16 m and temporally intensive land surface observations, but efficient algorithm was still lacking for quantitatively land surface parameters estimation. It is essential to improve the data use ability by generating efficient land surface parameter retrieval algorithms. This study proposed an LSA retrieval algorithm by using GF-1 WFV data. Land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function characteristic parameters were used to represent the non-Lambertian characteristic of land surface. The top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance is simulated by the 6S radiative transfer model by considering non-Lambertian land surfaces. Linear regression is applied in the TOA reflectance, and LSA is simulated with the surface bidirectional reflectance characteristic parameters to build a lookup table. The proposed algorithm can estimate LSA with high accuracy according to the TOA reflectance without the complex multistep inversion process. The validation results of ground measurements in Northwest China for different land cover types show that the algorithm is effective, and the overall root mean square error was 0.036 when compared with field observation. The algorithm also shows great consistency with Landsat albedo data. The proposed algorithm is of great significance for improving GF data utilization.

TI  - Unsupervised Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks for Pan Sharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based pan sharpening has received significant research interest in recent years. Most of the existing methods fall into the supervised learning framework in which they downsample the multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images and regard the original MS images as ground truths to form training samples based on Wald's protocol. Although impressive performance could be achieved, they have difficulties when generalizing to the original full-scale images due to the scale gap, which makes them lack of practicability. In this article, we propose an unsupervised generative adversarial framework that learns from the full-scale images without the ground truths to alleviate this problem. We first extract the modality-specific features from the PAN and MS images with a two-stream generator, perform fusion in the feature domain, and then reconstruct the pan-sharpened images. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid loss based on the cycle-consistency and adversarial scheme to improve the performance. Comparison experiments with the state-of-the-art methods are conducted on GaoFen-2 (GF-2) and WorldView-3 satellites. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can greatly improve the pan-sharpening performance on the full-scale images, which clearly shows its practical value.

TI  - Facing a Real Threat of Death: Dynamic Changes in Death-Thought Accessibility
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study explored the relationship between emotion and death-thought accessibility (DTA) in individuals experiencing true mortality salience (MS), specifically, patients with cancer. Patients and Methods: The study included 255 participants; among them, 132 patients had cancer and represented the MS group, and 123 had dental pain and served as a control group. Participants completed the Projective Diseases Attitude Assessment Questionnaire to induce priming, completed an affect scale, completed one of four calculation tasks as manipulation of cognitive load (all four were done over several sessions), and performed a Pinyin-Chinese characters exercise to measure DTA. Results: MS was associated with strong negative emotional arousal. When these negative emotions are generated, they enter an individual's consciousness and activate proximal defense mechanisms. At this point, DTA can be measured. Patients with cancer had significantly higher levels of DTA in the high-frequency cognitive load condition than in the other three conditions (no task, simple delay task, and single cognitive load task). Patients with dental pain had significantly higher levels of DTA in the no task and simple delay conditions than in the single cognitive load or high-frequency cognitive load conditions. This study also found that negative experiences without MS (specifically, dental pain) are associated with higher levels of DTA. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in addition to death-related events, both negative and stress-inducing events can produce DTA.

TI  - Generalized Linear Spectral Mixing Model for Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion effectively solves the trade-off among spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and spectral resolution of remote sensing sensors. However, most of existing methods focus on the fusion of two of the spatial, temporal, and spectral metrics of remote sensing images. The few spatial-temporal-spectral fusion (STSF) methods available are mainly for fusing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images, which are not suitable for the characteristics of the spaceborne hyperspectral images (HSIs) with low temporal resolution, such as Hyperion, ZY-1 02D, and PRISMA. For this purpose, we proposed a novel generalized linear spectral mixing model for STSF (GLMM-STSF). In the method, the GLMM is introduced into the STSF problem, and the temporal variations of images at different times are transferred to the endmember and abundance matrix variations of images for estimation. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, the STSF task of remote sensing images is handled from the perspective of spectral unmixing. Compared with the existing STSF fusion methods, our method targets the task of fusing spaceborne HSI with low temporal and spatial resolutions with multispectral image (MSI) featured by high temporal and spatial resolutions. Taking the STSF of ZY-1 02D hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 multispectral real datasets as an example, comparisons with related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior fusion performance.

AB  - Hyperspectral target detection (HTD) is one of the vital issues in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing, and has a pivotal role in remote sensing field. However, it is a challenging task due to redundant information, high dimensionality and complexity of background. In this paper, an effective HTD method based on Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) is proposed, which can spot targets from complicated background distribution. Our approach, called constrained energy regularization TRPCA, imposes tensor nuclear norm to describe the low-rank property of background. Considering some target spectra probably lie in the same low-dimensional background subspace, we introduce a constrained energy regularization to enhance the distinction between target and background pixels. Experiments on four datasets illustrate superiority of our method.

TI  - Sea Surface Wind Speed Retrieval From Textures in Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind-induced oriented textures (WIOTs) are commonly used to retrieve sea surface wind directions from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this study, we found that WIOTs are also related to sea surface wind speeds (SSWSs). The entropy values in the gray-level cooccurrence matrices (GLCMs) for SAR images containing WIOTs will become steady with increasing distance between pairs of pixels. Furthermore, these steady values of entropy (SVEs) show a clear linear relationship with SSWSs. As a result, an SSWS retrieval model was developed based on this relationship. We used 2222/2223 Sentinel-1 SAR images (wind speed ranges from 5 to 20 m/s) to fit/validate the algorithm. The retrieved SSWSs were compared with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) SSWSs, Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) SSWSs, and Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean (TAO) buoy measurements, and the root-mean-square differences (RMSDs) were 1.78, 1.70, and 1.78 m/s, respectively. The new model was also tested for SAR images acquired under hurricane conditions. The wind comparisons against stepped-frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) measurements show an RMSD of 1.28 m/s. Our modelx2019;s performance was also tested with the images at different spatial scales in the validation data set. Since the model is based on inherent image patterns, it still works well for SAR images without precise calibration.

TI  - Soil Erosion Driving Factors and Ecological Security Evaluation for Yan' an City from 2000 to 2020
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - As a typical loess hilly and gully region, the intensity of soil erosion in Yan'an seriously affects the ecological environment security of the region. Based on TM and Landsat images, meteorological data, land use and soil texture data, the dynamic changes and spatial patterns of soil erosion in Yan'an in the 20 years from 2000 to 2020 were quantitatively simulated by using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Geodetector model. At the same time, from the ecological service capacity, ecological sensitivity and ecological organizational structure, a comprehensive evaluation system for ecological security was built and an evaluation was conducted. The results show that : (1) The average modulus of soil erosion in 2000 and 2020 were 9 790. 40 and 4 249. 82 t . km(-2) . a(-1), respectively, and the area and intensity of soil erosion showed a double decline trend, and the policy of returning farmland to forest has been effective in the 20 years. However, severe erosion still exists in the eastern part of Zichang County, Yanchuan County and Yanchang County, so the area along the Yellow River basin is currently the priority areas for prevention and governance. (2) The results worked out by geographical detectors show that the main control factors that affect the spatial pattern distribution of soil erosion in the study area is vegetation coverage, followed by the factors of land use type and slope, and the interaction and synergy between vegetation coverage and slope factor is greater than the effect of each single factor on soil erosion. Therefore, the soil erosion area should be comprehensively controlled and prevented by combined consideration on various factors. (3) Compared with the less safe ecological status of Yan'an in 2000, the level of ecological security had been improved to a safe status in 2020. The overall situation of ecological security is showing a trend of overall improvement, partial optimization, but it has not reached to the ideal status of very safe, and the level of ecological security still has a certain potential for improvement. Based on the above research, Yan'an City could be divided into soil erosion control area in the north, water conservation area in the south and the soil erosion sensitive area along the Yellow River, which can provide a scientific basis for soil and water conservation planning and ecological environment construction.

TI  - Geometric Accuracy Verification of GF-7 Satellite Stereo Imagery Without GCPs
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite is the China's first civil optical stereo-mapping satellite with submeter resolution. GF-7 is also equipped with a laser altimeter, which can obtain sparse laser altimetry points (LAPs) to improve the vertical accuracy of stereo images. Verifying the geometric accuracy of GF-7 imagery without ground-control points (GCPs) is of great significance for evaluating the mapping capability of GF-7. In this study, 147 stereo images and 804 LAPs of the GF-7 satellite covering Jiangsu Province, Hebei Province, and Sichuan Province in China were selected as experimental data. Subsequently, 455 high-precision independent check points were used to verify the geometric accuracy of the GF-7 images. The results show that, without GCPs, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) in the horizontal direction of the experimental images in flat, hilly, mountainous, and high-mountainous terrains, and over the entire area were 4.91, 3.81, 4.38, 6.39, and 4.91 m, respectively. The RMSEs in the vertical direction were 3.42, 4.68, 3.00, 4.41, and 3.52 m, respectively. After performing combined block adjustments of the LAPs and stereo images, the RMSEs of the experimental images in the vertical direction decreased to 0.43, 0.66, 0.76, 1.14, and 0.68 m, respectively, whereas those in the horizontal direction saw only minor changes. Therefore, in the absence of GCPs, the geometric accuracy of GF-7 imagery can fully meet the accuracy requirements of China's 1:10 000 scale stereo mapping by using the GF-7 LAPs as control points.

TI  - A Physical-Based Framework for Estimating the Hourly All-Weather Land Surface Temperature by Synchronizing Geostationary Satellite Observations and Land Surface Model Simulations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-frequency all-weather land surface temperature (LST) product generated from the thermal-infrared (TIR) observations of the geostationary meteorological satellite is of great significance to study the diurnal variations in the LST and the land surface energy balance. However, the TIR sensor cannot penetrate the clouds and obtain the desired LST under cloudy conditions. In this study, we developed a physical-based framework for generating high-frequency (hourly) all-weather LST data by synchronizing geostationary satellite TIR observations and simulations of the land surface model (LSM). There are three parts to the developed framework. First, the clear-sky LST was retrieved from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the geostationary satellite Himawari-8 using our newly developed temperature and emissivity separation algorithm. Second, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) observations were assimilated into the Noah land surface model with multiple parameterization (Noah-MP) options' model to generate the all-weather LST. Finally, the retrieved clear-sky AHI LST and Noah-MP assimilated LST were fused using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. In situ measurements from three networks were collected to evaluate the Noah-MP assimilated LST and EnKF fused LST. The bias/RMSE of the Noah-MP assimilated LST and EnKF fused LST were-0.16/3.01 K and 0.15/2.68 K, respectively, under all-weather conditions. Compared to the Noah-MP free-run LST, the absolute values of the bias were reduced by 0.64 K and 0.68 K for the Noah-MP assimilated LST and EnKF fused LST, while the RMSEs were reduced by 0.33 K and 0.65 K, respectively. In addition, the spatial distribution of EnKF fused LST was in good agreement with the retrieved clear-sky AHI LST. The proposed framework in this study was demonstrated to be capable of obtaining accurate high-frequency (hourly) all-weather LST data.

AB  - With the continuous development of Deep Learning (DL), ship detection in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) has become a common approach. CNNs with complex structures have achieved good performance in SAR images, but face challenges such as high time consumption and high false alarm rate, because of the sparsity of ships in the remote sensing images. In this paper, a rotated ship detection network based on the CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) preprocessing is proposed to address these problems. It first uses a CFAR preprocessing to fast narrow down the scope of detection so as to save processing time. Then, a classification network is designed to reduce the false alarm rate. The experiment results based on the Gaofen-3(GF-3) dataset show that the proposed method can reduce the false alarm rate greatly and use much less CPU time.

TI  - Evaluation of Surface Reflectance Products Based on Optimized 6S Model Using Synchronous In Situ Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance (SR) estimation is the most essential preprocessing step for multi-sensor remote sensing inversion of geophysical parameters. Therefore, accurate and stable atmospheric correction is particularly important, which is the premise and basis of the quantitative application of remote sensing. It can also be used to directly compare different images and sensors. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) surface reflectance products are publicly available and demonstrate high accuracy. However, there is not enough validation using synchronous spectral measurements over China's land surface. In this study, we utilized Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric products reconstructed by Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) and 30 m ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) data to adjust the relevant parameters to optimize the Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) model. The accuracy of surface reflectance products obtained from the optimized 6S model was compared with that of the original 6S model and the most commonly used Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model. Surface reflectance products were validated and evaluated with synchronous in situ measurements from 16 sites located in five provinces of China: Fujian, Gansu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. Through the indirect and direct validation across two sensors and three methods, it provides evidence that the synchronous measurements have the higher and more reliable validation accuracy. The results of the validation indicated that, for Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI SR products, the overall root mean square error (RMSE) calculated results of optimized 6S, original 6S and FLAASH across all spectral bands were 0.0295, 0.0378, 0.0345, and 0.0313, 0.0450, 0.0380, respectively. R-2 values reached 0.9513, 0.9254, 0.9316 and 0.9377, 0.8822, 0.9122 respectively. Compared with the original 6S model and FLAASH model, the mean percent absolute error (MPAE) of the optimized 6S model was reduced by 32.20% and 15.86% for Landsat-8 OLI, respectively. On the other, for the Sentinel-2 MSI SR product, the MPAE value was reduced by 33.56% and 33.32%. For the two kinds of data, the accuracy of each band was improved to varying extents by the optimized 6S model with the auxiliary data. These findings support the hypothesis that reliable auxiliary data are helpful in reducing the influence of the atmosphere on images and restoring reality as much as is feasible.

TI  - Detection of Soil Freeze/Thaw States at a High Spatial Resolution in Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The freeze/thaw (F/T) state of the soil is an essential indicator for permafrost monitoring. However, current soil F/T products with a coarse spatial resolution (>1 km) have limited their use on a fine scale. In this letter, a new approach integrating two microwave sensors [i.e., Sentinel-1 and advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR-2)] is developed to identify the soil F/T state at a spatial resolution of 10 m in the Qinghai-Tibet engineering corridor (QTEC). Using a linear regression model to integrate the coarse AMSR-2 data with the finer Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST), the frozen frequency product at a 1-km resolution can be obtained. Then, the high-spatial-resolution F/T map based on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series images can be produced using the threshold extracted from each pixel of frozen-frequency products. We tested soil F/T results via both visual and quantitative evaluations. The overall accuracy of the 10-m soil F/T map achieves 84.63% and 77.09% for ascending and descending orbits based on four meteorological stations, respectively.

TI  - Identifying Soil Freeze/Thaw States Using Scattering and Coherence Time Series of High-Resolution <i>C-</i>Band Synthetic Aperture Radar in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil freeze/thaw (F/T) cycles play an important role in the climate system and human activities. However, the harsh environment in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) poses great challenges for both in-situ observation and remote-sensing monitoring of the soil F/T process. In this article, the time series of scattering and coherence of the high-resolution Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is analyzed to identify the soil F/T state. The time series of scattering, including intensity and decomposition parameters, and coherence, are analyzed based on three typical landcover types (i.e., desert, grassland, and meadow) in the QTP. They are given the mathematical description by second-order and fourth-order Fourier functions, respectively. Based on Fourier functions, the initial F/T time points of the soil are detected in each pixel to draw the F/T map of the entire study area. The experiment results are cross-validated with the initial F/T time points of the soil calculated from the MODIS land surface temperatures, showing that the differences in days are less than one revisit cycle of Sentinel-1 (i.e., 12 days). Furthermore, the possible impacts of environmental factors acquired from the Wudaoliang meteorological station, including air temperature, ground surface temperature, snow depth, and precipitation, on scattering and coherence are discussed. This study explores that Sentinel-1 has great potential for soil F/T monitoring in the QTP, which can indicate F/T states of the surface soil as well as F/T information of the deeper soil with a high spatial-temporal resolution.

TI  - Identification of Soil Texture Classes Under Vegetation Cover Based on Sentinel-2 Data With SVM and SHAP Techniques
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial variability of soil texture classes is essential for agricultural management and environment sustainability. Sentinel-2 data offer valuable vegetation information as proxies for soil properties inference. However, the applications of them in soil texture classification are still limited. This study investigated the usefulness of Sentinel-2 data for predicting soil texture class using an interpretable machine learning (ML) strategy. Specifically, multitemporal Sentinel-2 images were used to get exhaustive vegetation cover information. Basic digital elevation map (DEM) derivatives and stratum were extracted. Three support vector machines with different input parameters (purely DEM derivatives and stratum, purely Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-2 plus DEM derivatives and stratum) were developed. Moreover, in order to improve the transparency in black box ML models, the novel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to interpret the outputs and analyze the importance of individual variables. Results showed that the model with all variables provided desirable performance with overall accuracy of 0.8435, F1-score of 0.835, kappa statistic of 0.7642, precision of 0.8388, recall of 0.8355, and area under the curve of 0.9451. The model with purely Sentinel-2 data performed much better than that with solely DEM derivatives and stratum. The contributions of Sentinel-2 data to explain soil texture class variability were about 17%, 41%, and 28% for sandy, loamy and clayey soils, respectively. The SHAP method visualized the decision process of ML and indicated that elevation, stratum, and red-edge factors were critical variables for predicting soil texture classes. This study offered much-needed insights into the applications of Sentinel-2 data in digital soil mapping and ML-assisted tasks.

TI  - Multilayer Fusion Recurrent Neural Network for Sea Surface Height Anomaly Field Prediction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) is vitally important for climate and marine ecosystems. This article develops a multilayer fusion recurrent neural network (MLFrnn) to achieve an accurate and holistic prediction of the SSHA field, given only as a series of past SSHA observations. The proposed approach learns long-term dependencies within the SSHA time series and spatial correlations among neighboring and remote regions. A new multilayer fusion cell as the building block of the MLFrnn model was designed, which fully fused spatial and temporal features. The daily average satellite altimeter SSHA data in the South China Sea from January 1, 2001, to May 13, 2019, were used to train and test the model. We performed a 21-day ahead SSHA prediction and our MLFrnn model has very high accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.027 m. Compared with existing deep learning networks, the proposed model was superior both in prediction performance and stability, especially on the wide-scale and long-term predictions.

AB  - The rapid and accurate acquisition of crop planting spatial location information using remote sensing is one of the important guarantees to maintain the sustainable development of agriculture. However, the accuracy of crop identification by remote sensing is currently limited by many factors, such as the influence of other ground objects and the lack of time-series data. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes an algorithm named improved artificial immune network crop recognition algorithm based on dispersed vegetation index genetic chain (IaiNet). This algorithm can be combined with multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2 series satellites for crop identification. As a test case, we identified and evaluated 3 different crop recognition scenarios in Henan, China. The results show that IaiNet can accurately identify the spatial distribution of crop planting. In all identification results, the accuracy is higher than 90%, and the kappa coefficient is greater than 0.9. In addition, the crop recognition results of IaiNet are significantly better than the random forest algorithm and support vector machine algorithm.

AB  - In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, there are a large number of dense multi-scale objects, especially dense multi-scale ships docked along the coast. Existing object detection methods are difficult to simultaneously detect dense multiscale objects in complex background. A novel method for dense multi-scale object detection in SAR images based on Feature-Transferable Pyramid Network (FTPN) is proposed in this paper. In the stage of feature extraction, the feature maps of each layer are connected effectively and the feature maps of various scales are extracted. This method can extract the features of dense multi-scale objects more effectively, so as to realize simultaneous detection of dense multi-scale objects in SAR images. Experiments on SSDD dataset, AIR-SARShip-2.0 dataset and Gaofen-3 dataset show that the proposed method can achieve dense multi-scale object detection, and the overall performance is better than the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - RFI Localization via Reweighted Nuclear Norm Minimization in Microwave Interferometric Radiometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency interference (RFI) has become an increasing and challenging problem in microwave interferometric radiometry (MIR). Accurate localization of RFI sources is helpful to provide location information for switching off unauthorized transmitters causing RFI and mitigating the impact of these RFI sources. In this article, we propose a new RFI localization method based on reweighted nuclear norm minimization (RNNM). This method exploits the low-rank property of augmented covariance matrix (ACM) collecting visibility samples in MIR and introduces a singular value weighting strategy to consider different contributions of ACM components. First, ACM is constructed from the original covariance matrix of sparse array, which increases the degree of freedom (DOF) for array processing and hence improves the angular resolution performance. Second, we present a fixed point iteration (FPI)-based RNNM Algorithm, named FRA, to achieve low-rank approximation of ACM involving contribution degrees of ACM components. In this way, the ACM components corresponding to RFI signals are retained well and ones corresponding to background noises are suppressed. Third, we use a subspace-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation approach, i.e., MUSIC algorithm, on the weighted completed ACM (WCACM) (obtained by FRA in the second stage) to locate the potential RFI sources. Retrieved results using synthetic data and real soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) satellite data demonstrate that the proposed RNNM-based method not only has the superiority on improved detection performance, especially for identifying weak sources, but also shows better or competitive localization accuracy and angular resolution, compared with the existing commonly used RFI localization methods in MIR.

TI  - An APMLP Deep Learning Model for Bathymetry Retrieval Using Adjacent Pixels
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallowwater depth plays an important role in marine development, navigation safety, and environmental protection. It is an efficient and economical way to obtain water depth by remote sensing technology. At present, most empirical models based on multispectral image usually obtain water depth by the relationship between the sea surface reflectance (SSR) (a single pixel) and in situ water depth, it is a one-to-one correspondence between the reflectance and depth. However, seafloor substrate and inherent optical properties (IOP) will also have contribution to the SSR. In this article, we propose an adjacent pixels multilayer perceptron model (APMLP) model using adjacent pixels to weaken the influence of seafloor substrate and IOP.Datasets on Oahu Island (Sentinel-2B, LIDAR in situ data) and Saint Thomas Island (Sentinel-2A, LIDAR in situ data) are used to establish and verify the model. The APMLP model are also compared with the multilayer perceptron model (MLP) model, BP neural network model, and Log-ratio model. The overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of APMLP model on Oahu Island is 0.72 m, which is much better than the other three models (MLP 1.07 m, BP 1.05 m, Log-ratio 1.52 m). Similar results are obtained from the Saint Thomas Island dataset, RMSE of APMLP model is 1.56 m, better than the other three (MLP 1.91 m, BP 1.89 m, Log-ratio 2.39 m). The study confirms that considering adjacent pixels in an artificial neural network model can effectively improve the performance of water depth retrieval.

TI  - PKULAST-An Extendable Model for Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of important parameter in the earth energy and water budget. Recently, open-source modules or packages are emerging as all-in-one solutions to speed up the rapid development and critical application of LST from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data. In this article, we developed a python package, dubbed Peking University land surface temperature (PKULAST) model to address the retrieval of LST from TIR remote sensing data with different LST retrieval algorithms, such as single channel algorithm, split window algorithm, and the temperature and emissivity separation algorithm. extendable data structures in the model covers common conceptual models used in LST algorithms implementation, such as spectral response functions, surface spectral libraries (ASTER, ECOSTRESS etc.), atmospheric profiles (NCEP, ERA5, MERRA-2, etc.), making it a convenience to construct the processing chain of developing new LST retrieval algorithms and generating LST products. The ASTER imageries are tested to assess the performance of the PKULAST to derive accurate LST. The LST result is then evaluated using long-term ground-based longwave radiation observations collected at seven sites from 2000 to 2021 under cloud-free scenes, and the result shows that the PKULAST model can obtain LST with an uncertainty of 2.7 K in bias, and 4.4 K in root-mean-square error. With the help of predefined extendable data structures and workflows for different sensors, atmospheric profile libraries and surface spectral libraries, new algorithms for retrieving LST can be developed easily. The PKULAST promises to be a tool that seamlessly interoperates with developing LST retrieval algorithms and generating LST scientific products. The code will be released at https://github.com/tirzhu/pkulast.

TI  - Characterizing, Mitigating, and Comparing the Along-Scanline Noise in Fengyun-3 Series Microwave Humidity Sounders (MWHSs)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese Fengyun 3 (FY-3) polar-orbiting satellites carry Microwave Humidity Sounders (MWHSs), including MWHS and MWHS-2 which are on board FY-3A/B and FY-3C/D, respectively. Understanding the quality of MWHS data is important for data assimilation and other applications. Examination of observed and simulated brightness temperatures and comparison with those of the NOAA-18 Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) reveal that the FY-3C MWHS-2 observations contain significant along-scanline noise. Similar noise exists in the humidity sounder data from FY-3 series satellites. In this study, the principal component analysis (PCA) method is used to identify and characterize the along-scanline noise, and a noise filter is also applied to the FY-3 series MWHS data by combining a PCA with a five-point smoother. The observation minus background or O-B biases of MWHS channels vary more smoothly with scan position after applying the filter, indicating that the along-scanline noise has been effectively reduced. Comparisons of O-B biases among all four FY-3 MWHS instruments show that biases for different channels have different asymmetric scan-angle features. As for along-scanline noise, FY-3A MWHS has the largest noise: 0.16, 0.27, and 0.89 K for channels 3-5, respectively. Noise in the FY-3D humidity channels is the smallest, of the order of 0.06-0.07 K. The along-scanline noise is also strongly correlated between channels.

TI  - Retrieving Wave Parameters From GNSS Buoy Measurements Using the PPP Mode
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) buoys were used to retrieve the significant wave heights (SWHs) and dominant periods of waves in the Qingdao coastal waters off China. The precise point positioning (PPP) and postprocessed kinematic (PPK) techniques were used to obtain the absolute motion of the GNSS buoys. Even though PPP has relatively low absolute positioning accuracy, this accuracy has a minimal influence on the spectrum in the wave frequency band. SWH values calculated from the PPK and PPP modes are nearly identical, with correlation coefficients and symmetric regression slopes both higher than 0.99. The SWH values calculated from PPP also show good agreement with a dedicated wave buoy, with a correlation coefficient of 0.935 and a difference of 0.82 cm x00B1; 4.63 cm. A GaoFen-1 satellite image was used to assess the GNSS PPP wave spectrum via the dispersion relationship; both exhibit wave spectra with two peaks, consistent with the wave characteristics in the area.

TI  - Wind energy assessment analysis of Fujian coastal area based on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - Xiamen Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of wind energy resources in sea-surface wind farms is of great significance to the construction and development of offshore wind farms. In recent years, with the development of remote sensing technology, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has provided a new method for the analysis and evaluation of sea-surface wind energy. Based on 122 Sentinel-1 SAR images of Fujian coastal areas from 2015 to 2019, this study uses fast Fourier transform wind direction inversion and geophysical model function CMOD5.N wind speed inversion to reconstruct SAR winds in the coastal areas of Fujian, and analyzes the offshore wind energy resources in Fujian from the aspects of efficiency, stability and temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of wind energy. Our main results show as following: The effective wind energy in autumn and winter accounts for a relatively high proportion, upto more than 70%. The stability of wind energy in the coastal area of Fujian is good on average for many years, good in spring, autumn and winter, and poor in summer. The wind energy along the coast of Fujian mainly declines from northeast to southwest, and the maximum wind energy appears in the middle of the Taiwan Strait.

AB  - Joint reconstruction and anomaly detection(JRAD) is an effective method for hyperspectral image reconstruction and anomaly detection that uses the tensor kernel norm to characterize the spectral-spatial correlation information, which can better separate abnormal pixels while reconstructing the image. However, with the increasing scale of remote sensing data, JRAD algorithm would suffer from large amount of computation load and high resource consumption on single-machine platforms. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Spark-based parallel implementation for JRAD algorithm. Combining with the characteristics of hyperspectral image data represented by tensors, we propose a parallel processing flow for compressed sensing which is a major procedure in JRAD. In addition, a method for parallel iterative execution of complex tensor groups is also developed for accelerating the reconstruction and anomaly detection process on Spark. Experimental result demonstrate that, compared with the serial JRAD algorithm, the parallel JRAD implemented in this work reduces memory consumption and enhances the computational efficiency in terms of a considerable speedup on Spark. The Spark-based implementation also guarantees image reconstruction and anomaly detection accuracy and related performance metrics.

TI  - Does AGRI of FY4A Have the Ability to Capture the Motions of Precipitation?
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calculating the motion vectors based on the infrared observations can complement the gaps of the passive microwave and radar observations. So, it is an essential step in numerical weather models and other meteorological applications. FengYun-4A (FY4A) geosynchronous satellite was launched in 2016 by the Chinese government. Carrying on board the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI), FY4A can provide instantaneous observations from visible to infrared wavelength. However, the ability of FY4A to capture precipitation motions still needs to be explored, and the optimal scale for generating the motion vectors remains unclear. In this study, a reasonable sliding window strategy is applied to calculate the correlation coefficients (CCs) between two image sequences to determine the motion vectors. Based on this, the China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA) data are recognized as the true precipitation data and are compared with the 10.7-mu m observations of AGRI aboard FY4A. The results in August 2018 show that based on the quantified directions of the motion vectors between the CMPA and FY4A-TBB (the Temperature of Black Body from FY4A), the CC and root mean square error (RMSE) are about 0.64 and 2.1, respectively, which are acceptable at the resolution of 0.5 degrees. The result indicates that FY4A can capture precipitation motions. Meanwhile, as the resolution becomes lower, the probability distributions of the motion vectors in FY4A-TBB are more similar to those in CMPA, and they become stable at 0.5 degrees. Therefore, 0.5 degrees is considered the optimal resolution to generate the motion vectors for FY4A-TBB. The study results have great potentials for precipitation estimate retrieval and fusion for FY4A and also FY4B.

TI  - Investigating Impacts of Ambient Air Pollution on the Terrestrial Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) From Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to the threats to urban human health, impacts of air pollutants on the ecosystem photosynthesis seem to be less concerned. The existence of aerosols could promote photosynthesis by increasing the ratio of diffuse to direct solar radiation; on the contrary, ozone (O-3) could inhibit photosynthesis, as it is detrimental to leaf stomata. However, it is unknown whether these two opposite impacts worldwide cancel each other out. In the current mainstream methods, earth system models may show conflicts with in situ experimental results due to their relatively coarse resolution. In virtue of satellite remote sensing and a global eddy covariance (EC) network, we studied ten years of data to explore the impacts of aerosol and O-3 on photosynthesis by fitting an explainable machine learning model. The impacts of aerosol on gross primary productivity (GPP) were positive in many cases, yet very weak. By means of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to formaldehyde (HCHO) ratio, O-3 was seen with positive impacts on photosynthesis under the NOx-sensitive regime, but the apparent positive impacts correlated with the plant phenology. Under the volatile organic compound (VOC)-sensitive regime, the impacts of O-3 on GPP were not obvious, which was likely due to the prioritized depletion of O-3 by NO2 and VOCs. The impacts of air pollutants depended on many factors and results varied case by case, but the overall net impacts were negative.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing of Daily Surface Ozone in a Mountainous Area
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High levels of surface ozone (O-3) pollution threaten human and environmental health. Chongqing, a mountainous municipality located in southwest China, is exposed to serious O-3 pollution and requires more studies. Due to its complex terrain and always foggy weather, it is difficult to maintain many in situ sites in Chongqing, and chemical transportation model (CTM) simulations are also challenged. The recently launched (in 2017) Sentinel-5p satellite provides O-3 columns with advanced spatiotemporal resolution. Without the dependence on CTMs, we linked O-3 columns and surface monitoring data from 2019 to 2021 in virtue of a deep forest machine learning model. Compared with another widely used machine learning model and previous studies, our results showed great advantages in estimating surface O-3 on a daily scale. Validated against in situ sites in Chongqing, averaged R-2 of cross validations reached 0.9, while the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) were 13.57 and 0.37 mu g/m(3), respectively. We found out that the model performance is associated with the relative height difference between training sites and the test site. The model performed stably when the height difference was lower than 200 m, but obvious performance degradation was seen when the height difference is exceeding 400 m.

AB  - The demands for spectral and spatial quality in remote sensing (RS) images vary from region to region. Saliency detection is an effective tool to distinguish different regions with different demands. In this paper, we introduce saliency detection to satisfy these demands and propose a novel saliency-driven pan-sharpening network to further improve the fusion quality. Firstly, we combine foreground distribution with background prior to generate the initial saliency map, and implement least-square optimization to improve the detection accuracy. Then, we construct a dense spatial attention network trained through a new spatial-spectral-based loss function designed by saliency to meet diverse spectral and spatial needs of different regions. Thus, accurate fused images can be predicted. Experiments on SPOT-5 dataset indicate that our proposal has excellent properties with respect to the unified spatial-spectral quality against state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Skewness-Based Classification and Environmental Indication of Spectral Probability Distribution of Global Closed Connected Waters
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical types of waters are important indicators of water quality and watershed environment. In this study, we proposed a novel classification approach that is based on water's spectral probability distribution (SPD) in satellite images. Using the Landsat-8 images, we processed 690 global water bodies and their SPDs were then classified into seven types in terms of their skewness (SK). We analyzed the statistical features of these water types and their relationships with some environmental factors. The results show that if water bodies are clearer, simpler, more in their raw status, and having less interaction with humans, then their SPD SK is more positive, while if they are more complex, turbid, and highly interacted with human activities, then their SPD SK is more negative. Our study demonstrates that SPD is a good optical parameter and hence with more potential to indicate the quality and environmental properties of water bodies.

TI  - Estimate of Cloudy-Sky Surface Emissivity From Passive Microwave Satellite Data Using Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The derivation of microwave land surface emissivity (MLSE) under various weather conditions from the microwave radiometer plays a crucial role in acquiring land surface and atmospheric parameters. Nevertheless, currently, most existing studies mainly focus on the clear-sky scenarios due to a lack of cloudy-sky land surface temperature (LST) and uncertainties in simulating the scattering and emission properties of atmospheric hydrometeors. Under this background, with satellite observations and the random forest (RF) model, this study proposes a method to estimate the MLSE under cloudy skies. First, clear-sky MLSEs with satisfactory accuracy are retrieved by using the brightness temperatures (BTs) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth sensor, LSTs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and atmospheric profiles from the ERA5 reanalysis. Then, the relation among the clear-sky MLSE and related impact factors is built with the RF and extended to the cloudy-sky environment for generating all-weather MLSEs with a 0.25 degrees. The results show that the input datasets present a considerable impact on the calculation of instantaneous MLSE, and a 5.73 K bias of ERA5 LST may generate a 0.014-0.021 error in the MLSE from 6.9- to 89-GHz horizontal polarization, while the impacts of BT and profile uncertainties on the MLSE are smaller. The retrieved clear-sky MLSE is coincident with the existing MLSE for the spatiotemporal variations, and there is an average difference range from -0.035 to 0.035 in January 2008. Meanwhile, the constructed RF model can successfully apply to cloudy-sky status and recover the MLSE image gaps affected by cloud contamination.

TI  - LAND SUBSIDENCE MONITORING AND ANALYSIS IN FUZHOU BASED ON INSAR AND MULTISPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY

AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has millimeter level measurement accuracy and has great advantages in urban land subsidence monitoring. Meanwhile, multispectral remote sensing technique can also provide a large amount of urban features changes information for analyzing the causes of land subsidence. In this study, SAR and multispectral images are both used to monitor and analyze land subsidence in Fuzhou of China. 115 scenes Sentinel-1 SAR images from May 2017 to May 2021 are used based on the Persistent Scatterers Interferometric (PSI) method to evaluate the land subsidence in Fuzhou, while Sentinel-2 multispectral images are used to evaluate several remote sensing indexes. During SAR data processing, Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) data is used to remove atmospheric errors for higher accuracy land subsidence. In order to analyze the relationship between the land subsidence and land cover changes in urban areas, the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) of the main subsidence areas are obtained based on Sentinel-2 multispectral images from 2016 to 2021. In the end, it is found that the land subsidence in some areas exceeded 12 mm/year in Fuzhou. The time series of four areas with severe subsidence were analyzed, and the cumulative subsidence reached about 60 mm. Besides, the spatial distribution and temporal changes of vegetation, buildings and water bodies in these areas were obtained based on the multispectral data, it is found there is very less relationship between the land subsidence and the urban features. It is concluded that that the main causes of the land subsidence are the changes of land internal components such as groundwater and others.

TI  - Weak Mesoscale Variability in the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST)-AVHRR-Only Version 2 Data before 2007
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale sea surface temperature (SST) variability triggers mesoscale air-sea interactions and is linked to ocean subsurface mesoscale dynamics. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) daily Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) products, based on various satellite and in situ SST data, are widely utilized in the investigation of multi-scale SST variabilities and reconstruction of subsurface and deep-ocean fields. The quality of OISST datasets is subjected to temporal inhomogeneity due to alterations in the merged data. Yet, whether this issue can significantly affect mesoscale SST variability is unknown. The analysis of this study detects an abrupt enhancement of mesoscale SST variability after 2007 in the OISST-AVHRR-only version 2 and version 2.1 datasets (hereafter OI.v2-AVHRR-only and OI.v2.1-AVHRR-only). The contrast is most stark in the subtropical western boundary current (WBC) regions, where the average mesoscale SST variance during 2007-2018 is twofold larger than that during 1993-2006. Further comparisons with other satellite SST datasets (TMI, AMSR-E, and WindSAT) suggest that the OISST-AVHRR-only datasets have severely underestimated mesoscale SST variability before 2007. An evaluation of related documents of the OISST data indicates that this bias is mainly caused by the change of satellite AVHRR instrument in 2007. There are no corresponding changes detected in the associated fields, such as the number and activity of mesoscale eddies or the background SST gradient in these regions, confirming that the underestimation of mesoscale SST variability before 2007 is an artifact. Another OISST product, OI.v2-AVHRR-AMSR, shows a similar abrupt enhancement of mesoscale SST variability in June 2002, when the AMSR-E instrument was incorporated. This issue leaves potential influences on scientific research that utilize the OISST datasets. The composite SST anomalies of mesoscale eddies based on the OI.v2-AVHRR-only data are underestimated by up to 37% before 2007 in the subtropical WBC regions. The underestimation of mesoscale variability also affects the total (full-scale) SST variability, particularly in winter. Other SST data products based on the OISST datasets were also influenced; we identify suspicious changes in J-OFURO3 and CFSR datasets; the reconstructed three-dimensional ocean products using OISST data as input may also be inevitably affected. This study reminds caution in the usage of the OISST and relevant data products in the investigation of mesoscale processes.

TI  - Jitter Detection Method Based on Sequence CMOS Images Captured by Rolling Shutter Mode for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite platform jitter is a non-negligible factor that affects the image quality of optical cameras. Considering the limitations of traditional platform jitter detection methods that are based on attitude sensors and remote sensing images, this paper proposed a jitter detection method using sequence CMOS images captured by rolling shutter for high-resolution remote sensing satellite. Through the three main steps of dense matching, relative jitter error analysis, and absolute jitter error modeling using sequence CMOS images, the periodic jitter error on the imaging focal plane of the spaceborne camera was able to be measured accurately. The experiments using three datasets with different jitter frequencies simulated from real remote sensing data were conducted. The experimental results showed that the jitter detection method using sequence CMOS images proposed in this paper can accurately recover the frequency, amplitude, and initial phase information of satellite jitter at 100 Hz, 10 Hz, and 2 Hz. Additionally, the detection accuracy reached 0.02 pixels, which can provide a reliable data basis for remote sensing image jitter error compensation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne microwave radiometer, as the most important passive microwave remote sensing instrument, plays a significant role on the on-orbit exploration satellites, such as FengYun-3 meteorological, HaiYang-2, and the Change lunar satellite. However, at present, the microwave radiometer in orbit is mainly loaded on polar orbiting satellites. The geostationary microwave radiometer has not been realized and applied. In this paper, a segmented calibration method is proposed to improve the on-orbit calibration accuracy of geostationary orbit microwave radiometer. The curve fitting accuracy in the calibration process is effectively improved when the processing of remote sensing data reaches up to a certain quantitative level. In the process of parameter estimation, the least square method is used to improve the estimation accuracy. The new calibration method is compared with the classical linear and quadratic model calibration schemes. The analysis results of the calibration data of the geostationary microwave radiometer show that the segmented calibration scheme significantly improves the precision and accuracy for later product generation and numerical weather prediction.

TI  - HCNNet: A Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, leaps and bounds have developed spatiotemporal fusion (STF) methods for remote sensing (RS) images based on deep learning. However, most existing methods use 2-D convolution (Conv) to explore features. 3-D Conv can explore time-dimensional features, but it requires more memory footprint and is rarely used. In addition, the current STF methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are mainly the following two: 1) use 2-D Conv to extract features from multiple bands of the input image together and fuse the features to predict the multiband image directly and 2) use 2-D Conv to extract features from individual bands of the image, predict the reflectance data of individual bands, and finally stack the predicted individual bands directly to synthesize the multiband image. The former method does not sufficiently consider the spectral and reflectance differences between different bands, and the latter does not consider the similarity of spatial structures between adjacent bands and the spectral correlation. To solve these problems, we propose a 2-D/3-D hybrid CNN called HCNNet, in which the 2D-CNN branch extracts the spatial information features of single-band image, and the 3D-CNN branch extracts spatiotemporal features of single-band images. After fusing the features of the dual branches, we introduce neighboring band features to share spatial information so that the information is complementary to obtain single-band features and images, and finally stack each single-band image to generate multiband images. Visual assessment and metric evaluation of the three publicly available datasets showed that our method predicted better images compared with the five methods.

TI  - Comparison of lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound and intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the preoperative diagnosis of axillary sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to compare diagnostic efficiency for axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis between lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (LCEUS) and intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ICEUS) in patients with breast cancer. We also examined whether adding ICEUS to LCEUS could improve the diagnostic accuracy of LCEUS.Methods: Sixty-nine patients with breast cancer were recruited preoperatively. All patients underwent LCEUS followed by ICEUS, and the enhancement pattern of one SLN was analysed for each patient. The targeted SLN was marked with wire and excised during surgery. The imaging diagnosis was compared with the histopathological result. Diagnostic efficiency was compared among LCEUS, ICEUS, and the combination of LCEUS and ICEUS.Results: The sensitivity values for LCEUS, ICEUS, and the combination of LCEUS and ICEUS were 86.2%, 82.6% and 93.1%, respectively. Specificity values for the three methods were 95.0%, 92.5% and 87.5%, respectively. Accuracy values for the three methods were 91.3%, 88.4% and 89.9%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for LCEUS was 0.906, and there was no significant difference among LCEUS, ICEUS, and the combination of LCEUS and ICEUS (p = 0.752).Conclusions: LCEUS may represent an accurate method for predicting SLN metastasis preoperatively. Our findings suggest that adding ICEUS to LCEUS for SLN evaluation in patients with breast cancer is unnecessary.Advances in knowledge: This is the first study in which both LCEUS and ICEUS were performed for the same lymph node and the first to compare the diagnostic efficiency of LCEUS, ICEUS, and the combination of LCEUS + ICEUS.

TI  - Inclusive Education as a Tool For Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals on the Basis of Humanization of Society
T2  - PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU
M3  - Article
AB  - The technogenic civilization, despite significant scientific and technical achievements, unfortunately, continues to face problems that entail irreparable consequences. Human activity based on the principle of immeasurable consumption produces an increase in inequality, poverty, hunger, diseases, armed conflicts, and global environmental changes. Weapons of mass destruction pose a global socio-environmental threat. All these trends indicate the need to move to a new level of progress based on sustainability, which in turn requires the formation of a new personality focused on the system of environmental values, and not on the values of the consumer society. Only a society consisting of people with a new worldview will be able to develop sustainably. In this regard, the author's vision of inclusive education is formed in the study, which is understood as a system with a high integration ability, the role of which is reduced to creating a sustainable society with rational moral foundations. A doctrinal model of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is proposed, the core of which is the humanization of society, contributing to moral, economic, social, cultural changes and influencing the life of society, while becoming the driving force of the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development. The author's approach allows us to expand the scientific vision of the essence and content of inclusive education, to determine the role of humanization in ensuring the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The conceptual provisions of the article can be used as the basic foundations of a sustainable development strategy.

TI  - Magic of Words: Lexemes with Semantics 'Spell' and 'to Spell' in Vepsian (Etymological-Semantic and Linguo-Geographical Aspects)
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparative analysis of the Veps language lexemes with the semantics 'spell' (puheg, puitoomine), as well as verbs with the meaning 'to spell; pronounce incantations. The relevance of the study is due to the significance of the spell tradition for the worldview of the Vepsian people and the possibility of identifying the semantic and etymological features of the vocabulary group associated with this sphere of life. The names of the concept of "spell" (puheg. puitoomine) are analyzed, where the lexeme puheg, unlike the Russian term spell (< to spell < to speak), is associated not with speaking. but with a kind of "blowing" words from the mouth in the process of speaking. It is known from the literature, about a similar phenomenon that is characteristic of one of the Russian dialects of the Komi Republic (blowing words), about which the authors of article believe that it may be a kind of tracing paper from the Baltic-Finnish languages, in which such a phenomenon is represented more widely, although they do not exclude and some universality in the development of languages. In the presented author's development. attention is paid to the etymology and semantic nuances of the lexemes sana and vajeh with the meaning 'word', one of which (sana) also intersects with the magic of the words of the world of spells in its semantics. The etymological aspects of the verbs of "magical action" (puhuda, puitelda, otvedaida) are analyzed in the study, where both original stems and borrowings from the Russian language are manifested. Linguistic maps illustrate the breadth of distribution of analyzed terms in the dialects of the Vepsian.

TI  - The Bible Code in Lesya Ukrainka's Dramatic Poem <i>In the Wilderness</i>
T2  - SLAVIA-CASOPIS PRO SLOVANSKOU FILOLOGII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is an attempt to read Lesya Ukrainka's dramatic poem In the Wilderness, using the concept of biblical code, which we understand in the intertextual aspect. It involves the analysis and interpretation of quotations, allusions, and reminiscences to reveal new meanings that such a dialogue with the Book of Books can produce. The dramatic poem In the Wilderness deals with the life of the Puritan community, for whom the Scriptures are an exceptional authority, the only source of Christian doctrines and ethical guidelines. Having this in mind, Lesya Ukrainka structures the work in such a way that the Bible appears in a particular position - as a code that allows you to understand the essence of the inner world of the characters, as well as a basis for understanding the philosophical and ideological issues that concern and disturb the author. The main one among them is the eternal question about the meaning of life. Every character of the dramatic poem seeks answers to these questions within their own worldview paradigm, interpreting the texts of the Scriptures in their own way.

T2  - LIBRI & LIBERI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the influence of state ideology on children, as carried out through state control/supervision of book publishing. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the peculiarities of creating (a new) social reality by means of children's literature in the 1920s and 1930s in Ukraine. The research material is a selection of publications of the Ukrainian specialised publishing houses Ditvydav and Molodyi Bilshovyk. The results of the analysis show that 46% of the books in the corpus contain the following keywords: revolution, civil war, Pioneers, Little Octobrists, Soviet holidays, Lenin, Stalin, collective farms, collectivisation, industrialisation, metallurgy, factory, mines, and so forth, that is, they contain an emphasised ideological component. Soviet society's rejection of the national tradition, even in the face of the policy of Ukrainianisation, is also confirmed. The dominance of Russia and its representatives in comparison with other republics in the USSR and the limitations of gender roles in the constructed worldview are also demonstrated.

AB  - The quantification of uncertainties affecting satellite ocean color products is a fundamental step to ensure their compliance with mission and science requirements. This work investigated a methodology relying on the use of in situ radiometric data with known uncertainties to determine those affecting matching satellite data. By exploiting in situ radiometric data from the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC), an advanced method was applied to radiometric data products from the Ocean and Land Color Instruments onboard the Sentinel-3A satellite (OLCI-A) and the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite onboard the Suomi National-Polar Orbiting Partnership satellite (VIIRS-S). The results from the analysis support the relevance of the method proposed.

T2  - ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal aspects of the habitat suitability of the European souslik (Sper-mophilus citellus L.) in an area of Sredna Gora Mountain (Bulgaria) were studied. We used Landsat satellite imagery data to model changes in the habitat suitability of the species from 1985 to 2018. The obtained results demonstrate that the habitat suitability of the Eu-ropean souslik increased during the studied period, presumably due to raised tempera-tures and the accompanying drought during summertime, as well as the human-caused modifications in pasture livestock breeding. Based on statistical modelling, the employed procedure applies to long-term monitoring and assessment of the role of land cover change because of climate change and human activity on the habitat suitability of the European souslik. This approach can be useful for conservation planning.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - Predicting within-field crop yield early in the season can help address crop production challenges to improve farmers' economic return. While yield prediction with remote sensing has been a research aim for years, it is only recently that observations with the suited spatial and temporal resolutions have become accessible to improve crop yield predictions.Here we developed a yield prediction framework that integrates daily high-resolution (3 m) CubeSat imagery into the APSIM crop model. The approach trains a regression model that correlates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI) from APSIM. That relationship is then employed to determine the optimum date at which the regression best predicts yield from the LAI. Additionally, our approach can forecast crop yield by utilizing a particle filter to assimilate CubeSat-based LAI in the model APSIM to generate yield maps at 3 m several weeks before the optimum regression date. Our method was evaluated for a rainfed site located in the US Corn belt, using a collection of spatially varying yield data. The proposed approach does not need in situ data to rain the regression, with outcomes reporting that even with a single assimilation step, accurate yield predictions were provided up to 21 days before the optimum regression date. The spatial variability of crop yield was reproduced fairly well, with a good correlation against in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 1.69), demonstrating that high-resolution yield predictions early in the season have great potential to meet and improve upon digital agricultural goals.

AB  - We present in this paper a comparative analysis focused on the estimation and removal of the Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) from DInSAR deformation measurements relevant to volcanic areas characterized by significant displacements and topography. These are scenarios where it is often difficult to separate the interferometric phase component due to atmospheric artifacts from the one related to the actual ground deformation. In particular, we investigate the APS correction performance achieved by applying two different approaches: i) the first relying on the exploitation of the external meteorological ERA-5 data, ii) the second based on filtering out atmospheric contributions from the DInSAR time series by exploiting their statistical properties both in space and in time. For the experimental analysis we analyze very large Sentinel-1 datasets acquired over two volcanic areas particularly challenging from the point of view of the APS estimation: La Palma island (Canary, Spain), focusing on the last eruption occurred on 19 September 2021, and Mt. Etna (Sicily, Italy).

AB  - Consciousness and language are the two most important components of the human personality, which can be revealed only through the knowledge of each other, since one determines the development and existence of the other. Consciousness is inextricably linked with language, and arises simultaneously with it. It follows that there is a certain relationship between language and consciousness. Language is a way of existence of consciousness.Language is an integral part of culture, the main tool for its assimilation, it is the reality of our spirit. The language expresses the specific features of the national mentality. On the other hand, culture is included in the language, since all of it is modeled in the text.However, culture cannot be genetically inherited, and in order to pass it on to subsequent generations, a "guide" is needed, in the role of which language acts. The very existence of language as a phenomenon is impossible without culture, just as the existence of culture is unthinkable without language.

AB  - Forests are necessary as well as important for combatting climate change. Forest fires destroy the forest's wealth and affect the environment. They pose a threat, to fauna and flora, seriously. Forest fires are difficult to detect and thus have a long response time which leads to mass destruction. Hence, it has been a prominent research area with the aim of conserving ecology. In this paper, we have created a knowledge base for forest fire risk prediction and detection purposes by extracting different forest-fire-causing factors from Landsat 8 satellite imageries. With increasing forest fires incident everywhere, the main goal of constructing a domain-based knowledge base of forest fires is to have records of forest fires and relevant geographical, environmental, and demographical information systematically, to understand the behavior of forest fires so that they are more predictable eventually leading to quick response time and thus mitigating the loss due to forest fires. In our study, we have extracted texture features such as contrast, energy, entropy, correlation, color feature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land surface temperature (LST) of Landsat 8 satellite images. All these feature extractions will help develop information systems on forest areas which include topographic, weather, vegetation data to predict the risk of forest fire.

AB  - Surface water mapping in satellite images enables flood monitoring, a task with increasing importance under changing climate conditions. Current segmentation methods based on Deep Learning require large, curated datasets for training, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to water segmentation based on established computer vision methods that requires little training and is easy to interpret. We use prior knowledge of typical backscatter intensity to locate seed pixels likely to be in water and land. A preliminary rough segmentation using thresholding guides the selection of two image patches that will be fully labeled using seeded region growing segmentation. Then, we sample small patches within the automatically labeled regions to train a fully connected neural network that, running in sliding windows, scores for the presence of water in the entire image. The approach is tested for mapping surface water during a large flood event in Aude, France. Outputs of the proposed approach are compared to the reference flood delineation map provided online by the Copernicus service. A F1 score of 0.67 suggests that performance of the proposed approach is similar or better than classic thresholding methods used as benchmark.

TI  - INCREASING THE INFORMATIVITY OF MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE IMAGES USING TEXTURE ANALYSIS DATA
T2  - LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the problem of incresing the informativity of multispectral images of medium (10-30 m) and high (1-4 m) spatial resolution obtained from foreign and national satellite remote sensing systems by involving additional textural information from panchromatic satellite images of very high spatial resolution (less than or similar to(1-0.4) m). The images of test sites on the territory of Savvat'yevo forestry (Tver region) from Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 and WorldView 2 satellites equipped with multispectral instruments were an object of this research. Geo-referenced ground survey data were used to validate the calculation results. We used the values of the spectral reflectance in the visible and near-infrared channels normalized to the appropriate integral characteristic as spectral features. Statistical characteristics were calculated in order to extract texture features based on the distribution of the co-occurrence of gray levels (Haralick texture features) within a moving window running the image with a given spatial step. A correlation analysis of textural features was carried out considering changes in distance and angle of adjacency. It was shown that for the selected leading features (autocorrelation, asymmetry, contrast and correlation) the first three can be used with an arbitrary direction of adjacency, while the latter needs to be considered in two different directions. Also we have found that all the considered classification algorithms provide a significant increase of accuracy when both spectral and textural features are used, in comparison with the traditional spectral classification. This result was shown for all images of test sites obtained by different satellites. It is possible to make a preliminary conclusion that the proposed integrated approach of thematic processing can improve the quality of object recognition in the case of using images of both medium and high spatial resolution. Estimates obtained during the thematic mapping of dominant and subdominant forest species showed close classification accuracies for different initial multispectral images (with a scatter of no more than 5 % around the average value of 85 %). Mostly this is due to the presence of specific errors in the ground-based forest inventory data and indicates the necessity of their updating with the use of satellite remote sensing images.

AB  - In this paper, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images including high resolution Gaofen-3 images and medium resolution Sentinel-1 images are used to detect the new buildings, and the detection results of different resolutions were compared and analyzed. The SAR image change detection algorithm based on likelihood ratio change matrix clustering was used, and the new buildings were extracted by threshold from the detected changes. The detection results show that images acquired by the two sensors have good performance on new building detection. However, the noise and geometric distortion in urban area of Gaofen-3 image reduce the detection accuracy, while the resolution of Sentinel-1 is insufficient for the detection of new building with small size.

TI  - Vegetation Mapping in the Permafrost Region: A Case Study on the Central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and detailed vegetation map is of crucial significance for understanding the spatial heterogeneity of subsurfaces, which can help to characterize the thermal state of permafrost. The absence of an alpine swamp meadow (ASM) type, or an insufficient resolution (usually km-level) to capture the spatial distribution of the ASM, greatly limits the availability of existing vegetation maps in permafrost modeling of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). This study generated a map of the vegetation type at a spatial resolution of 30 m on the central QTP. The random forest (RF) classification approach was employed to map the vegetation based on 319 ground-truth samples, combined with a set of input variables derived from the visible, infrared, and thermal Landsat-8 images. Validation using a train-test split (i.e., 70% of the samples were randomly selected to train the RF model, while the remaining 30% were used for validation and a total of 1000 runs) showed that the average overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the RF approach were 0.78 (0.68-0.85) and 0.69 (0.64-0.74), respectively. The confusion matrix showed that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the predicted vegetation map reached 0.848 (0.844-0.852) and 0.790 (0.785-0.796), respectively. The user accuracies for the ASM, alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert were 95.0%, 83.3%, 82.4%, and 86.7%, respectively. The most important variables for vegetation type prediction were two vegetation indices, i.e., NDVI and EVI. The surface reflectance of visible and shortwave infrared bands showed a secondary contribution, and the brightness temperature and the surface temperature of the thermal infrared bands showed little contribution. The dominant vegetation in the study area is alpine steppe and alpine desert. The results of this study can provide an accurate and detailed vegetation map, especially for the distribution of the ASM, which can help to improve further permafrost studies.

AB  - As an essential vegetation structural parameter, leaf area index (LAI) is involved in many critical biochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and precipitation interception. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LAI sequence products have long supported various global climate, biogeochemistry, and energy flux research. These applications all rely on the accuracy of the product's long time series. However, uncontrolled interferences (e.g., adverse observation conditions and sensor uncertainties) potentially introduce substantial uncertainties to time series in product applications. As one of the most sensitive areas in response to global climate change, the Tibet Plateau (TP) has been treated as a crucial testing ground for thousands of studies on vegetation. To ensure the credibility of the studies arising from MODIS/VIIRS LAI products, the temporal quality uncertainties of data need to be clarified. This article proposed a method to revisit the temporal stability of the MODIS (MOD and MYD) and VIIRS (VNP) LAI in the TP, expecting to provide useful information for better accounting for the uncertainties in this area. Results show that the MODIS and VIIRS LAI were relatively stable in time series and available to be used continuously, among which the temporal quality of the MODIS LAI was the most stable. Moreover, the MODIS and VIIRS LAI products performed similarly in both time-series stability and time-series anomaly distribution, magnitudes and fluctuations. The time-series stability evaluation strategy applied to the MODIS and VIIRS LAI can also be employed to other remote sensing products.

AB  - As a global warning, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) permafrost is undergoing degradation, which can be a threat to the high-altitude infrastructure. Multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) is an effective tool to monitor freeze-thaw deformation cycles of permafrost. In this study, we employ small baseline synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS) in the northern Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR), including Tuotuohe, Beiluhe, Wudaoliang and Xidatan regions with 73 scenes of L-band ALOS-2 stripmap SAR images between 2015 to 2020. The experimental results show that the maximum deformation of permafrost from Tuotuohe to Beiluhe area can reach -35 mm/year. Besides we combined optical data (GF-1, GF-2) found that the permafrost of some regions is undergoing degradation, which may cause thermal melting landslides. And our results can provide significant insight for monitoring permafrost deformation in QTP.

AB  - A super- twisting algorithm (STA) based output feedback nonlinear controller is developed for the precision position trackmg control of the electro-hydraulic system (EHS) in this paper. First, a nonl inear extended state observer ( ESO) IS designed to simultaneously estimate the unmeasured states and the lumped disturbance based on extended model of the EHS. The designed nonlinear ESO is finite time stabl e according to the homogeneity theory. Then the STA is employed to make the postion trackmg error as small as possible based on the estimated signals provided by the nonlinear ESO. Moreover to further reduce, the influence of the estimate errors, the desired compensation technology is employed. The proposed controller theoretically guarantees finite time tracking performance in the presence of various uncertainties and disturbances in the sense of Lyapunov theory, which is very important for the output tracking control of EHS. Extensiv e comparative simulation results are obtamed to veri fy the tracking performance of the propos ed control strategy.

AB  - Positioning accuracy is a key indicator that restricts the accuracy of satellite image mapping. Laser altimetry acquires surface height in decimeters or higher accuracy, providing high-accuracy topographic information for satellite photogrammetry. This study proposes a four-step high-accuracy positioning method called laser altimetry data-guided stereo images positioning (LGSP): photon outlier removal, digital surface model (DSM) generation by a variant of the tube-shape semi-global matching (tSGM), fast point cloud alignment, and DSM and rational function model (RFM) refming. First, outliers of the laser altimetry data are filtered out via confidence selection and open access DSM constraints. Second, the DSM around high-accuracy photons is generated via the variant of tSGM. Third, fast point cloud alignment is performed to align the DSM with laser altimetry data. Finally, we propose a highresolution stereo model refinement method based on alignment parameters. Experiments on two satellite stereo datasets with different loads, resolutions, and topographies show that LGSP improved the planimetry accuracy of satellite stereo images after adding laser altimetry data. What's more, LGSP significantly improved the height accuracy of satellite images. Specifically, LGSP reduced the height errors from the original 5.99 m to 1.00 m for the Ziyuan-3 stereo dataset and from the original 20.39 m to 0.83 m for the Gaofen-7 stereo dataset, and slightly outperformed bundle adjustment in which four ground control points were deployed around the four corners of the stereo images. RFM refming based on alignment parameters has been made publicly available at https://mega.nz/file/EFQASJ6A#BKjoupHVshylQR4w CxCid9BDtgO8bhy-_aY-c_ri-Inl-0.

AB  - Accurate on-orbit radiometric calibration is the fundamental to quantitative remote sensing. Based on the thermal infrared radiative transfer model and Double Difference (DD) method, the on-orbit radiometric calibration in the thermal infrared channels of the advanced MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-2) on Chinese Fengyun 3D (FY-3D) are evaluated against the channels of Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on the Himawari 8 satellite. The results shows that the on-orbit radiometric calibration of FY-3D MERSI-2 channel 25 (12.0 mu m) is quite consistent with the AHI channel 15, whereas the radiometric calibration biases (the mean of the double differences +/- standard deviation) in FY-3D MERSI-2 channels 23 (8.55 mu m) and 24 (10.8 mu m) are -0.17 +/- 0.26 K and -0.28 +/- 0.30 K, respectively. The on-orbit radiometric calibration biases are finally corrected by linear fits on the matching observations.

TI  - Factors controlling the spatial distribution of coseismic landslides triggered by the Mw 6.1 Ludian earthquake in China
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution regularity of coseismic landslides is important for mitigation in future earthquakes. Unveiling the controlling factors of the distribution of coseismic landslides is a long-standing unsolved problem. On 3 August 2014, a Mw 6.1 earthquake occurred in Ludian County, Yunnan Province, China, and resulted in a great number of landslides and substantial losses. The coseismic landslide distribution in this earthquake, which was triggered by an unmapped fault, shows a different pattern. This paper conducted a spatial analysis to reveal the controlling factors in the Ludian earthquake. A spatial database of landslides has been built by interpreting the ZY-3 pre-earthquake, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), GeoEye-1 and GF-1 post-earthquake. A total of 1414 landslides were identified after a combination of image interpretation and field investigation in an area of 704.7 km(2). The geological setting of the study area, including the tectonics and lithology, has been mapped in detail. The digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area with a resolution of 30 m x 30 m was presented to address the topographic characteristics. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to analyse the spatial characterization of the landslides. Correlations between the occurrences of landslides and factors, i.e., slope gradient, elevation, slope aspect, intensity, distance to coseismic fault, distance to the epicentre, lithology, distance to non-coseismic faults, distance to rivers and distance to road, were characterized with a spatial analysis in GIS. It can be concluded that the slope gradient and the distance to the coseismic fault are the two most important factors for determining the spatial distribution of coseismic disasters. Some other factors play a role by influencing the slope gradient to a certain extent, and the movement of the coseismic fault is the prone direction of coseismic landslides. Slope cutting fractures the rock mass, increases the slope gradient, and significantly increases the occurrence of coseismic landslides. A statistics analysis indicates that the landslide concentration (LC) generally has an obvious exponential decrease with an increasing distance to the coseismic fault, while it has a good Weibull cumulative distribution with the slope gradient.

AB  - In this study, we propose a new approach to surface soil moisture (SSM) monitoring using the change detection technique applied to Sentinel-1 radar dataset. This involves testing a new reflectivity index (IR) deduced from the Fresnel coefficients, directly linked to soil moisture. It is between 0 and 1, 0 for the driest context (weakest radar signal), and 1 for the wettest context (highest radar signal). Simulations using the Integral Equation Model (IEM) model are proposed to confirm the usefulness of this index before real applications on different sites in Africa. Comparisons are also made with the classical index based on the detection approach habitually used.

TI  - TRADITIONS OF A. N. OSTROVSKY AND A. P. CHEKHOV IN EGOR ZAGREBIN'S PLAY "LEBED' BELAYA [THE WHITE SWAN]"
T2  - EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the specifics of the Udmurt drama. The novelty of the paper lies in the fact that for the first time ever it presents more detailed theoretical considerations of Egor Zagrebin's play "Lebed' Belaya [The White Swan]". Its relevance is based on the use of the comparative historical method which enables us to identify the origins of the Udmurt dramaturgy. We can trace the impact of A. N. Ostrovsky and A. P. Chekhov's theater on the play "Lebed' Belaya [The White Swan]" by E. Zagrebin. On the one hand, Egor Zagrebin's play is focused on the ideological and worldview conflict worked out by Ostrovsky, and on the other hand, it involves the elements of Chekhov's drama (an orientation towards symbolism and reticence is clearly detected in it). The study presents a comparison of the Udmurt play with Ostrovsky's drama "Groza [Thunderstorm]" and Chekhov's comedy "Tchaika [The Seagull]". The system of direct and hidden references to the previous texts has been developed in the process of research, which shows how the culture-bound literature overcomes and creatively transforms the initial trends of the Russian literature. If the Russian drama of the 19th-20th centuries deals with insoluble conflicts (for example, "eternal conflicts" of Ostrovsky and metaphysical conflicts of Chekhov), then the idea of inherent harmony of the world is embodied in the play by E. Zagrebin. Despite the extreme tension of the collision, the dramatic conflict can be resolved; and the victory is won by the normative principle which is deeply rooted in the culture-specific soil. It is crucial that the Udmurt dramaturgy of the second half of the 20th century is under a double influence. On the one hand, it goes back to the tradition of the Russian classical literature (A. Pushkin, N. Gogol, A. Ostrovsky, A. Chekhov, and others); on the other hand, it responds to the current state of the literary process, or rather being influenced by the Soviet dramaturgy (A. Vampilov, A. Volodin, M. Roshchin, and others).

TI  - Cheap, Valid Regularizers for Improved Interferometric Phase Linking
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving a consistent phase history from a multilooked Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) stack depends critically on the accuracy of the (coherence) magnitude estimates. To estimate the magnitudes more reliably, the author proposes three regularization methods: Hadamard, spectral, and Hadamard-spectral regularization. All three are computationally cheap and parameterized such that they are guaranteed to yield valid magnitude matrices. These regularizers achieved relative improvements in the phase history with an accuracy of up to 40% in simulations. The improvements were greatest for low long-term coherences. All three methods performed similarly in the simulations and in a Sentinel-1 stack, for which the local phase dispersion decreased with regularization. Implementation of the regularizers into operational processing chains is expected to improve deformation and uncertainty estimates, especially for local movements over decorrelating terrain.

TI  - The influence of religious and worldview factors on the landscape design in Japan and China
T2  - LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE AND ART
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of religious beliefs and philosophical teachings in the development of traditional landscape design principles and techniques is analyzed in the article. Examples for the analysis of this development were the traditional cultures of two countries of the Far East - Japan and China.In these cultures, animistic beliefs in the supernatural nature of the elements (sun, wind, thunder, rain, lightning), nature as such (worship of sacred trees, water, etc.) were organically combined with later Buddhist canons, which eventually led to the syncretism of religious and philosophical teachings - Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism in China, Buddhism and Shinto - in Japan.The analysis was carried out on the material of traditional gardens most visited by tourists, which are positioned as typical examples of traditional landscape design in both countries.It is proved that the landscape design both in Japan and China developed according to principles similar to the development principles of other types of arts in these countries. In particular, Chinese landscape design was based on the harmonization and improvement of nature, aimed at creating a certain hedonistic space, on the other hand, Japanese landscape design had religious origins from the beginning and was aimed at self-improvement through the observation of nature.

AB  - Although the size of the domestic game market has been steadily growing, many of the games that have been made into mobile games using the existing PC online game IP have been successful, but the influence of the existing IP power has decreased, making it urgent to secure new IP. The game industry has turned its attention to game development using popular webtoon IP. If successful webtoons promote a certain degree of stability, lead existing fandom to games, and develop characters and worldview settings in the original work, positive factors such as shortening the period can be secured. However, popular webtoons do not necessarily result in the success of the game. Contrary to what game users expected from the original webtoon, there are cases where the original webtoon’s attractive characters are not satisfied in the implementation and narrative structure, and there are cases of failure due to the insufficient game system. In this study, five factors were analyzed for the cause based on the case of <God of High School>, which is evaluated as a successful case among the original webtoon gameization cases, and <Denma with Naver Webtoon>, which is evaluated as a contrary case. As a result of the analysis, the results of each problem were derived from six problems: worldview, world map system, character, game design, community, and genre. First, it can be summarized as whether the development was made without reflecting the characteristics of the platform while being transmedia between webtoons and games, second, whether the main character characteristics and composition, story flow and structure were reflected in the original webtoon, third, whether the game genre was adopted, and finally, excessive billing system that interfered with game play. Additional problems include whether to introduce graphics with less damage among 2D and 3D, and whether to differentiate them from existing mass-production game. Webtoons can express various camera works and characters’ emotions unique to 2D media, which will be more advantageous than 3D when adopting game graphics. The design of a differentiated game system that fits the characteristics of the original webtoon is also an important factor. In particular, the most important factor is that the structure and setting of the conflict between the original characters should be gameized without deterioration, and that a game system that can be played while experiencing the original scenario should be designed.

AB  - This paper intends to try a more active approach and interpretation of the impact of Yeom Sang-seop's journalist activities, which have been attracting attention by researchers, on the creation of novels. As a journalist on "fact/object" and "fictional/subjective," which have historically been a debate between journalism and reporting, I would like to analyze Yeom Sang-seop's understanding and judgment, and examine the influence of the artist's creative worldview and work in the mid-1920s, the formation of realism literature. In other words, the starting point of this study is that Yeom Sang-seop's worries due to the tension between "object" and "subject" required by journalism in dealing with specific cases have been transferred to fiction creation. By exploring the process in which "objective" and "subjective" intersect and the position as a reporter and identity as a writer intervene to form a novel, I would like to confirm the "true value" of the journalist-shaped novel and approach the source of Yeom Sang-seop's realism literature.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to interpret the cultural phenomenon in which modern humans wander mentally without a fixed identity in the transcultural era where diverse cultures coexist from a metamodernist perspective, and through this, propose an anthropology that can be effective in the 21st century. To this end, it studies the life and art world of a typical metaxis artist through the example of Roland Barthes, who has lived through the division of the subject due to the discordance between the postmodern ego-ideal of self and the modern ideal-ego.This study introduces how Barthes overcomes mental confusion in the process of growing from a metalinguistic critic to a literary writer and aims to provide a small driving force so that modern people living in the Age of Hyper-Uncertainty can strive to develop a hopeful view of humanity.

AB  - Korean zombies have built narratives in a way that strongly reflects the reality of discrimination and classism.Director Yeon Sang-ho, who is considered a “pioneer of K zombies,” revealed the absurdities of Korean society through zombies, starting with the movie “Train to Busan”(2016). Director Yeon Sang-ho’s unique point in the narrative is that zombie Apocalypse is only the beginning of talking about problems in Korean society and humans. He talks about zombies, but Apocalypse is only the prelude and exposes the ugliness of humans whose real fundamental problems are deeply embedded on the floor.The movie “Peninsula”(2020) shows strangers from “Peninsula” living in other countries voluntarily coming to the peninsula through “discrimination and hatred of humans who are more bored than zombies.” What is emphasized here is that the “Peninsula” people are “others.” “Peninsula” is noteworthy in that it captures the worldview that those who have lived as batters forgive and solidarity with other batters who have alienated them. Through Jun’s words, “Why is it hell when my family was together?” and “The world where I was wasn’t bad,” it is differentiated from existing zombie contents that portrayed zombies’ turmoil and negatively. This strongly reveals the subjectivity that no alienation and violence, not coexistence or confrontation between zombies and humans, can interfere with the protagonists, and that their existence itself will be happy anywhere. In addition, forgiveness and solidarity go beyond “Shinpa” to expand the range of choices of the main characters who have escaped from their obligations of revenge, and to expand the content by forming various stories.This paper aims to reveal that this work shows a creative zombie worldview different from existing zombies by analyzing the elements of Hannah Arendt’s “Human Conditions” in the movie “Peninsula”. Arendt’s view, which places high value on human life and subjectivity, appears in depth in the movie “The Peninsula,” indicating that the work is differentiated from existing zombies and suggests deeper and more intimate otherness and ways to overcome them.The expanded zombie worldview in <Peninsula>, which reveals the darkness of a more essential and deep era through zombies and further contains the affirmation of human subjectivity, is significant in today’s era of hatred.

AB  - The purpose of this study is from <Dogtooth (2009)>, the earliest work of Lanthimos, <The Lobster(2015)>, the first work produced in English, and the recent work <The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017)> are defined as Lanthimos’ ‘Myth Variations Trilogy,’ and the elements of the Greek mythology found in common in the three works are analyzed from the perspective of ‘family disintegration.’ Yorgos Lanthimos is a Greek film director who is attracting attention for his unique worldview and the thematic sense that unfolds in the first half of his work.The detached despair of the Greek tragedy, the nihilism of neoliberal society, and the human history of living by repeating ‘minor mistakes and mistakes in it, the theme of “structural violence, oppression, and family disintegration” is unfolding.Lanthimos’ films are still unfamiliar, shocking, and uncomfortable for domestic audiences. Domestic academic research on director Lanthimos is also incomplete.The protagonists of Lanthimos’ ‘Mythic Variations Trilogy,’ placed in an absurd situation, live their lives against an inexplicable fate. The new and unfamiliar shock experienced through Lanthimos’ films raises fundamental questions about the created world and human nature. This ultimately boils down to the theme consciousness of the narrative of the dissolution of the family in the ‘Mythic Variations Trilogy.’ The audience, ironically, realizes the abnormality of all the norms that make up our family through this process.The film world of Lanthimos is a variation of myth, the source of the long story of man, which eventually touches reality, causing him to doubt convention and awaken consciousness. The modern version of the myth of Lanthimos, based on the ‘Verfremdungseffekt,’ acquires universality in that it makes us realize the yoke of fate between life and death.Lanthimos’ clear theme of the narrative overthrow of heterosexual norms and the dissolution of the traditional Greek patriarchal family, contrary to the Greek cinematic genealogy of the past, has also led to the ‘Greek Weird Wave’ that was triggered after <Dogtooth>. Through this analysis, the discussion of Lanthimos, which has been limited to <The Killing of a Sacred Deer>, is attempted to be expanded from the perspective of the variation of the myth that has been consistently unfolded from his early works to the study of authorism.

AB  - Stories have been studied as an important educational method in Christian education. In recent discussions on religious education, stories are positively evaluated in terms of stimulating children's unique fantasy, as opposed to visual media, and in terms of face-to-face direct communication. Our most profound and passionate orientation to the world is shaped by stories. This is because stories move us by moving us and shape our unconscious to act accordingly. However, the subjects that supply stories to children now are various mass media and consumer culture. The story it tells instills a secular worldview and makes us dream of a world completely different from the kingdom of God. Our children need a story to imagine the kingdom of God. This paper focuses on story-style sermons in children's worship and tries to deal with the Christian educational implications of story-style sermons. To this end, first of all, I would like to treat the Bible as a story according to the approximate concept of the story and the position of literary criticism who approached the Bible as a story. The second will deal with narrative preaching. First, we will look at narrative sermons for adults, and then deal with narrative sermons for children. The two narrative sermons were treated separately in the sense of considering the characteristics of children rather than being separated. Lastly, I would like to draw out the Christian educational implications of narrative preaching.

AB  - Technicism is a unique product of modern technological society. Even before the rise of modern age when human and nature were not much separated, there was technology, but not technicism. Why? In this paper, the authors present the pervasiveness of technology and try to trace the origin of technicism in modern society. Agreeing with the observation of Hans Jonas that the foundation of modern technology was autonomous human reason, the authors present that the predominance of human reason was originated from the complete dichotomic view on human soul and body. Such a view proceeded to objectify the nature, thus resulting in its exploitation. This paper argues the technicism as a modern idol and present some ways to overcome the pit of technicism from the Christian worldview.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide intervention strategies for suicide prevention after suicide attempts, by exploring the factors that affect such attempt experiences in adolescents.The research analyzed the psychosocial process of individuals who have attempted suicide by applying Strauss and Corbin’s (1990) grounded theory approach, and approached the experiences of adolescents who attempted suicide. The results of the study included 70 concepts, 24 subcategories, and 8 upper categories. The central phenomenon is “escape,” which involves logging out of life, extreme selfishness, liberation, and a paradoxical worldview. The causal conditions that create this central phenomenon were found to be “broken compass,” “negative emotions,” “poor relationship,” and “usual triggers.” The contextual condition that affects the central phenomenon was found to be “self-awareness and behavior in the problem situation.” Intervention conditions that work in the central phenomenon are “positive prompts after the suicide attempt,” such as counseling, education, recognition and interest, and voluntary acceptance. “Negative prompts after suicide attempt” are unchanged, isolated, and ideal goals. Action/interaction strategies were strategies for intervention after suicide attempts, and included “seeking interpersonal methods” and “strengthening competence.” The results showed either a positive change: “safe growth;” or negative result of “still on the edge of the cliff.” Based on the results of this study, it is necessary to prevent suicide among adolescents through early intervention in adolescent suicidal behavior, counseling approach to adolescents, active intervention in the educational field, and strengthening the role of the family. It was also suggested that the establishment of a safe protection system for healthy growth after a suicide attempt and institutional change are necessary

AB  - (Background and Purpose) Luxury brand Chanel is a prestigious fashion house that is gaining attention in various fields. In particular, it stimulates the public's desire to own and belong by expressing an unrivaled identity through high-end fashion shows. Chanel's fashion shows, which use distancing strategies to create heterogeneous situations, are linked to the concept of depaysement, a method for expressing surrealism. Thus, the purpose of this study was to derive the characteristics of Chanel fashion using a spatial design. The principle of the concept of depth is thought to serve as an effective medium for deriving the expressive characteristics of Chanel fashion shows’ spatial design because it evokes existing ideas using methods that generate unusual and visual shocks. (Method) This research first examined the concept through a theoretical analysis of depaysement and derived the characteristics of expressions based on the use of depth in the art field. Subsequently, after grasping the design strategy through the value and identity of the brand Chanel, it analyzed the spatial designs of Chanel's fashion shows based on this. Finally, the spatial design expression characteristics of Chanel fashion shows were derived by linking the keywords extracted through case analysis with the expression characteristics of the previously derived depaysement. In addition, the language was systematized by organizing the derived expression characteristics according to specific spatial cases of Chanel. (Results) The characteristics of Chanel fashion shows’ spatial design was derived and systematized by connecting the derived expression characteristics of depaysement and Chanel's spatial keywords. The four characteristics of this were: first, “an unfamiliar stimulus of similar natural creation,” which refers to the difference in imitation through an attempt to project the brand's values in the process of reproducing the image of nature. Second, the realization of a “potential fantasy system” that evokes the ventilation of unconsciousness by creating a fictional reality and exposing it to new stimuli. Third, the “coexistence and immersion of contradictory relationships” that heterogeneously combine objects within the daily range and place them in one scene to induce fresh immersion. Fourth, it was organized as a “simultaneous occurrence of infinite expansion,” which destroyed the absolute concept by expressing time and space at different dimensions as a simultaneous concept. (Conclusions) Chanel fashion shows, which were seen through depaysement, forcibly invade the unconscious world through the shock of the destruction of the audience’s common sense. Thus, a worldview is established that overthrows the thinking system by invigorating fixed views. It is hoped that the potential of the spatial design employed in Chanel fashion shows will present another direction in the spatial design field that induces new experiences and unfamiliar stimuli in the future and develops into a creative methodology.

AB  - In the era of transmedia, it has become normalized to use different media for the same content. The paper of this research is, in such a transmedia era, in order to meet the needs of the public, what elements should be considered when adapting a novel into a game. The study takes the novel “Zhu Xian” and its game adaptation "Zhu Xian Hand Tour" as the research object, focusing on the worldview and characters, analyzing the elements needed for the adaptation, and uses a questionnaire to understand players' satisfaction with the elements of the adaptation. The results show that the audience satisfaction of the worldview and character visualization elements in the adaptation of “The Zhu Xian Hand Tour” is high, but the basic information and appearance elements in the ethnic composition of the worldview and the character visualization elements need to be modified. The study can provide a design suggestion for game planners and designers.

AB  - The research paradigm of two-way symmetrical communication built on a harmonious worldview has dominated the discipline of public relations. As a branch of social science, public relations need to secure diversities and to review its sociopolitical roles at a macro level. Using Luhmann’s reflexive research methodology, this study reviews the macro status of PR based on Laclau and Mouffe’s discourse theory and agonistic democracy. It also explores how to model PR in the hybrid media environment. Agonistic Public Relations Model has been proposed in which organizations and publics compete through production, modification, and acceptance of discourses and concurrently influence each other’s identity and the meta-discursive field itself.

While most of them concentrate on detection tasks for ships with open SAR ship datasets and for aircraft from SAR scenes of airports, there is relatively scarce researches on the detection of SAR ground vehicle targets where several adverse factors such as high false alarm rates, low signal-to-clutter ratios, and multiple targets in close proximity are predicted to degrade the performances. In this paper, a dataset of ground vehicle targets acquired from TerraSAR-X(TSX) satellite SAR images is presented. Then, both detection and instance segmentation are simultaneously carried out on this dataset based on the deep learning-based Mask R-CNN. Finally, this paper shows the future research directions to further improve the performances of detecting the SAR ground vehicle targets."

AB  - Curently, the Korea Meteorological Administration evaluates the meteorological drought by region using SPI6(standardized precipitation index 6), which is a 6-month cumulative precipitation standard. However, SPI is an index calculated only in consideration of precipitation at 69 weather stations, and the drought phenomenon that apears for complex reasons canot be acurately determined. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to calculate and compare SPI considering only precipitation and SDCI (Scaled Drought Condition Index) considering precipitation, vegetation index, and temperature in Gyeongi. In adition, the advantages and disadvantages of the station data-based drought index and the satelite image-based drought index were identified by using results calculated through the comparison of SPI and SDCI. MODIS(MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satelite image data, ASOS(Automated Synoptic Observing System) data, and kriging were used to calculate SDCI. For the duration of precipitation, SDCI1, SDCI3, and SDCI6 were calculated by aplying 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month respectively to the 8 points in 2014. As a result of calculating the SDCI, unlike the SPI, drought paterns began to apear about 2-month ago, and drought by city and county in Gyeongi was wel revealed. Through this, it was found that the combination of satelite image data and station data increased eficiency in the patern of drought index change, and increased the posibilty of drought prediction in wet areas along with existing dry areas.

AB  - This study evaluated the applicability of multi-resolution data fusion for land-coverclassification. In the applicability evaluation, a spatial time-series geostatistical deconvolution/fusionmodel (STGDFM) was applied as a multi-resolution data fusion model. The study area was selected assome agricultural lands in Iowa State, United States. As input data for multi-resolution data fusion,Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite images were usedconsidering the landscape of study area. Based on this, synthetic Landsat images were generated at themissing date of Landsat images by applying STGDFM. Then, land-cover classification was performedusing both the acquired Landsat images and the STGDFM fusion results as input data. In particular, toevaluate the applicability of multi-resolution data fusion, two classification results using only Landsatimages and using both Landsat images and fusion results were compared and evaluated. As a result, inthe classification result using only Landsat images, the mixed patterns were prominent in the corn andsoybean cultivation areas, which are the main land-cover type in study area. In addition, the mixedpatterns between land-cover types of vegetation such as hay and grain areas and grass areas werepresented to be large. On the other hand, in the classification result using both Landsat images and fusionresults, these mixed patterns between land-cover types of vegetation as well as corn and soybean weregreatly alleviated. Due to this, the classification accuracy was improved by about 20%p in theclassification result using both Landsat images and fusion results. It was considered that the missing ofthe Landsat images could be compensated for by reflecting the time-series spectral information of theMODIS images in the fusion results through STGDFM. This study confirmed that multi-resolution datafusion can be effectively applied to land-cover classification.

AB  - This study proposes a marine debris monitoring methods using satellite and dronemultispectral images. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model was applied to detect marine debris usingSentinel-2 satellite image. And for the detection of marine debris using drone multispectral images,performance evaluation and comparison of U-Net, DeepLabv3+ (ResNet50) and DeepLabv3+(Inceptionv3) among deep learning models were performed (mIoU 0.68). As a result of marine debrisdetection using satellite image, the F1-Score was 0.97. Marine debris detection using drone multispectralimages was performed on vegetative debris and plastics. As a result of detection, when DeepLabv3+(Inceptionv3) was used, the most model accuracy, mean intersection over union (mIoU), was 0.68.Vegetative debris showed an F1-Score of 0.93 and IoU of 0.86, while plastics showed low performancewith an F1-Score of 0.5 and IoU of 0.33. However, the F1-Score of the spectral index applied to generateplastic mask images was 0.81, which was higher than the plastics detection performance of DeepLabv3+(Inceptionv3), and it was confirmed that plastics monitoring using the spectral index was possible. Themarine debris monitoring technique proposed in this study can be used to establish a plan for marinedebris collection and treatment as well as to provide quantitative data on marine debris generation.

AB  - The frequency of exposure of field crops to stress situations is increasing due to abnormalweather conditions. In South Korea, large-scale diseases in representative paddy rice cultivation areawere happened. There are limits to field investigation on the crop damage due to large-scale. Satellitebasedremote sensing techniques are useful for monitoring crops in cities and counties, but the sensitivityof vegetation index measured from satellite under abnormal growth of crop should be evaluated. Thegoal is to evaluate satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) retrieved from differentspatial scales using drone imagery. In this study, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites were used and theyhave spatial resolution of 10 and 30 m. Drone-based NDVI, which was resampled to the scale of satellitedata, had correlation of 0.867–0.940 with Sentinel-2 NDVI and of 0.813–0.934 with Landsat-8 NDVI.When the effects of bias were minimized, Sentinel-2 NDVI had a normalized root mean square error of0.2 to 2.8% less than that of the drone NDVI compared to Landsat-8 NDVI. In addition, Sentinel-2 NDVIhad the constant error values regardless of diseases damage. On the other hand, Landsat-8 NDVI haddifferent error values depending on degree of diseases. Considering the large error at the boundary ofagricultural field, high spatial resolution data is more effective in monitoring crops.

AB  - Recently, forest fires have frequently occurred due to climate change, leading to human andproperty damage every year. The forest fire monitoring technique using remote sensing can obtain quickand large-scale information of fire-damaged areas. In this study, the Gangneung and Donghae forestfires that occurred in March 2022 were analyzed using the spectral band of Sentinel-2, the normalizeddifference vegetation index (NDVI), and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) to classify theaffected areas of forest fires. The U-net based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model wassimulated for the fire-damaged areas. The accuracy of forest fire classification in Donghae andGangneung classification was high at 97.3% (f1=0.486, IoU= 0.946). The same model used in Donghaeand Gangneung was applied to Uljin and Samcheok areas to get rid of the possibility of overfitting oftenhappen in machine learning. As a result, the portion of overlap with the forest fire damage area reportedby the National Institute of Forest Science (NIFoS) was 74.4%, confirming a high level of accuracy evenconsidering the uncertainty of the model. This study suggests that it is possible to quantitatively evaluatethe classification of forest fire-damaged area using a spectral band and indices similar to that of the Compact Advanced Satellite 500 (CAS500-4) in the Sentinel-2.

AB  - Turbidity, the measure of the cloudiness of water, is used as an important index for waterquality management. The turbidity can vary greatly in small river systems, which affects water quality innational rivers. Therefore, the generation of high-resolution spatial information on turbidity is veryimportant. In this study, a turbidity retrieval model using the Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3 and -3A(KOMPSAT-3/3A) images was developed for high-resolution turbidity mapping of Han River systembased on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. To this end, the top of atmosphere (TOA)spectral reflectance was calculated from a total of 24 KOMPSAT-3/3A images and 150 Landsat-8 images.The Landsat-8 TOA spectral reflectance was cross-calibrated to the KOMPSAT-3/3A bands. The turbiditymeasured by the National Water Quality Monitoring Network was used as a reference dataset, and asinput variables, the TOA spectral reflectance at the locations of in situ turbidity measurement, the spectralindices (the normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and normalizeddifference turbidity index), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derivedatmospheric products (the atmospheric optical thickness, water vapor, and ozone) were used. Furthermore,by analyzing the KOMPSAT-3/3A TOA spectral reflectance of different turbidities, a new spectral index,new normalized difference turbidity index (nNDTI), was proposed, and it was added as an input variableto the turbidity retrieval model. The XGBoost model showed excellent performance for the retrieval ofturbidity with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.70 NTU and a normalized RMSE (NRMSE) of14.70% compared to in situ turbidity, in which the nNDTI proposed in this study was used as the mostimportant variable. The developed turbidity retrieval model was applied to the KOMPSAT-3/3A imagesto map high-resolution river turbidity, and it was possible to analyze the spatiotemporal variations ofturbidity. Through this study, we could confirm that the KOMPSAT-3/3A images are very useful forretrieving high-resolution and accurate spatial information on the river turbidity.

AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is utilized as an indicator to represent thevegetation condition on the land surface in various applications such as land cover, crop yield, agriculturaldrought, soil moisture, and forest disaster. However, satellite optical sensors for visible and infrared rayscannot see through the clouds, so the NDVI of the cloud pixel is not a valid value for the land surface.This study proposed a real-time correction of the underestimation noise for GEO-KOMPSAT-2A(GK2A) daily NDVI and made sure its feasibility through the quantitative comparisons with ModerateResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI and the qualitative interpretation of time-serieschanges. The underestimation noise was effectively corrected by the procedures such as the time-seriescorrection considering vegetation phenology, the outlier removal using long-term climatology, and thegap filling using rigorous statistical methods. The correlation with MODIS NDVI was higher, and thedifference was lower, showing a 32.7% improvement compared to the original NDVI product. Theproposed method has an extensibility for use in other satellite products with some modification.

AB  - Clouds or shadows are the most problematic when monitoring crops using optical satelliteimages. To reduce this effect, a composite algorithm was used to select the maximum NormalizedDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for a certain period. This Maximum NDVI Composite (MNC)method reduces the influence of clouds, but since only the maximum NDVI value is used for a certainperiod, it is difficult to show the phenomenon immediately when the NDVI decreases. As a way tomaintain the spectral information of crop as much as possible while minimizing the influence of clouds,a Score-Based Composite (SBC) algorithm was proposed, which is a method of selecting the mostsuitable pixels by defining various environmental factors and assigning scores to them when compositing.In this study, the Sentinel-2A/B Level 2A reflectance image and cloud, shadow, Aerosol OpticalThickness (AOT), obtainging date, sensor zenith angle provided as additional information were used forthe SBC algorithm. As a result of applying the SBC algorithm with a 15-day and a monthly period forDangjin rice fields and Taebaek highland cabbage fields in 2021, the 15-day period composited datashowed faster detailed changes in NDVI than the monthly composited results, except for the rainy seasonaffected by clouds. In certain images, a spatially heterogeneous part is seen due to partial date-by-datedifferences in the composited NDVI image, which is considered to be due to the inaccuracy of the cloudand shadow information used. In the future, we plan to improve the accuracy of input information andperform quantitative comparison with MNC-based composite algorithm.

AB  - Cloud removal is an essential image processing step for any task requiring time-seriesoptical images, such as vegetation monitoring and change detection. This paper presents a two-stagecloud removal method that combines conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) withregression-based calibration to construct a cloud-free time-series optical image set. In the first stage,the cGANs generate initial prediction results using quantitative relationships between optical andsynthetic aperture radar images. In the second stage, the relationships between the predicted resultsand the actual values in non-cloud areas are first quantified via random forest-based regressionmodeling and then used to calibrate the cGAN-based prediction results. The potential of the proposedmethod was evaluated from a cloud removal experiment using Sentinel-2 and COSMO-SkyMedimages in the rice field cultivation area of Gimje. The cGAN model could effectively predict thereflectance values in the cloud-contaminated rice fields where severe changes in physical surfaceconditions happened. Moreover, the regression-based calibration in the second stage could improve theprediction accuracy, compared with a regression-based cloud removal method using a supplementaryimage that is temporally distant from the target image. These experimental results indicate that theproposed method can be effectively applied to restore cloud-contaminated areas when cloud-freeoptical images are unavailable for environmental monitoring.

AB  - In this study, the amount of coal waste dump was calculated using six Digital Elevation Models(DEMs) produced between 2006 and 2018 in Jangseong-dong, Taebaek-si, Gangwon-do, and thesubsidence was observed by applying the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric SAR (PSInSAR) techniqueon the Sentinel-1 SAR images. As a result of depositing activities using DEMs, a total of 1,668,980 m3 ofcoal waste was deposited over a period of about 12 years from 2006 to 2018. The observed subsidencerate from PSInSAR was –32.3 mm/yr and –40.2 mm/yr from the ascending and descending orbits,respectively. As the thickness of the waste pile increased, the rate of subsidence increased, and the morerecent the completion of the deposit, the faster the subsidence tended to occur. The subsidence rates fromthe ascending and descending orbits were converted to vertical and horizontal east-west components, and22 random reference points were set to compare the subsidence rate, the waste rock thickness, and thetime of depositing completion. As a result, the subsidence rate of the reference point tended to increase asthe thickness of the waste became thicker, similar to the PSInSAR results in relation to the waste thickness.On the other hand, there was no clear correlation between the completion time of the deposits and the rateof subsidence at the reference points. This is because the time of completion of the deposits at all but 5 ofthe 22 reference points was too biased in 2010 and the correlation analysis was meaningless. As in thisstudy, the use of DEM and PSInSAR is expected to be an effective alternative to compensate for the lackof field data in the safety management of coal waste deposits.

AB  - This study was to analyze the change in albedo by level-2 land cover map for 20 years (2002–2021) using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Also, the difference fromthe MODIS data was analyzed using the 10-year (2012–2021) data of Visible Infrared ImagingRadiometer Suite (VIIRS). For the albedo data of MODIS and VIIRS, daily albedo data, MCD43A3and VNP43IA, of 500 m spatial resolution of sinusoidal tile grid produced by Bidirectional ReflectanceDistribution Function (BRDF) model were prepared for the South Korea range. Reprojection wasperformed using the code written based on Python 3.9, and the nearest neighbor was applied as theresampling method. White sky albedo and black sky albedo of shortwave were used for analysis. As aresult of 20-year albedo analysis using MODIS data, the albedo tends to rise in all land use. Comparedto the 2000s (2002–2011), the average albedo of the 2010s (2012–2021) showed the most significantincrease of 0.0027 in the forest area, followed by the grass increase of 0.0024. As a result of comparingthe albedo of VIIRS and MODIS, it was found that the albedo of VIIRS was larger from 0.001 to 0.1,which was considered to be due to differences in the surface reflectivity according to the time of imagecapture and sensor characteristics.

AB  - This study was conducted to classify tree species and assess the classification accuracy, usingSE-Inception, a classification-based deep learning model. The input images of the dataset usedWorldview-3 and GeoEye-1 images, and the size of the input images was divided into 10 × 10 m, 30 ×30 m, and 50 × 50 m to compare and evaluate the accuracy of classification of tree species. The labeldata was divided into five tree species (Pinus densiflora, Pinus koraiensis, Larix kaempferi, Abiesholophylla Maxim. and Quercus) by visually interpreting the divided image, and then labeling wasperformed manually. The dataset constructed a total of 2,429 images, of which about 85% was used aslearning data and about 15% as verification data. As a result of classification using the deep learningmodel, the overall accuracy of up to 78% was achieved when using the Worldview-3 image, the accuracyof up to 84% when using the GeoEye-1 image, and the classification accuracy was high performance.In particular, Quercus showed high accuracy of more than 85% in F1 regardless of the input image size,but trees with similar spectral characteristics such as Pinus densiflora and Pinus koraiensis had manyerrors. Therefore, there may be limitations in extracting feature amount only with spectral informationof satellite images, and classification accuracy may be improved by using images containing variouspattern information such as vegetation index and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).

AB  - Cheonji Lake, the caldera of Baekdu Mountain, located on the border of the Korean Peninsulaand China, alternates between melting and freezing seasonally. There is a magma chamber beneathCheonji, and variations in the magma chamber cause volcanic antecedents such as changes in thetemperature and water pressure of hot spring water. Consequently, there is an abnormal region in Cheonjiwhere ice melts quicker than in other areas, freezes late even during the freezing period, and has a hightemperaturewater surface. The abnormal area is a discharge region for hot spring water, and its icegradient may be used to monitor volcanic activity. However, due to geographical, political and spatialissues, periodic observation of abnormal regions of Cheonji is limited. In this study, the degree of icechange in the optimal region was quantified using a Landsat -5/-7/-8 optical satellite image and a ModifiedU-Net regression model. From January 22, 1985 to December 8, 2020, the Visible and Near Infrared(VNIR) band of 83 Landsat images including anomalous regions was utilized. Using the relative spectralreflectance of water and ice in the VNIR band, unique data were generated for quantitative ice variabilitymonitoring. To preserve as much information as possible from the visible and near-infrared bands, icegradient was noticed by applying it to U-Net with two encoders, achieving good prediction accuracywith a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 140 and a correlation value of 0.9968. Since the ice changevalue can be seen with high precision from Landsat images using Modified U-Net in the future may be utilized as one of the methods to monitor Baekdu Mountain’s volcanic activity, and a more specificvolcano monitoring system can be built.

AB  - The rise in temperature induced by global warming caused in El Nino and La Nina, andabnormally changed the temperature of seawater. Rainfall concentrates in some locations due to abnormalvariations in seawater temperature, causing frequent abnormal floods. It is important to rapidly detectflooded regions to recover and prevent human and property damage caused by floods. This is possiblewith synthetic aperture radar. This study aims to generate a model that directly derives flood-damagedareas by using modified U-NET and TerraSAR-X images based on Multi Kernel to reduce the effect ofspeckle noise through various characteristic map extraction and using two images before and afterflooding as input data. To that purpose, two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were preprocessedto generate the model’s input data, which was then applied to the modified U-NET structure to train theflood detection deep learning model. Through this method, the flood area could be detected at a highlevel with an average F1 score value of 0.966. This result is expected to contribute to the rapid recoveryof flood-stricken areas and the derivation of flood-prevention measures.

AB  - Due to unpredictable climate change, the frequency of occurrence of water-related disastersand the scale of damage are also continuously increasing. In terms of disaster management, it is essentialto identify the damaged area in a wide area and monitor for mid-term and long-term forecasting. In thefield of water disasters, research on remote sensing technology using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)satellite images for wide-area monitoring is being actively conducted. Time-series analysis for monitoringrequires a complex preprocessing process that collects a large amount of images and considers the noisyradar characteristics, and for this, a considerable amount of time is required. With the recent developmentof cloud computing technology, many platforms capable of performing spatiotemporal analysis usingsatellite big data have been proposed. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a representative platform that providesabout 600 satellite data for free and enables semi real time space time analysis based on the analysispreparation data of satellite images. Therefore, in this study, immediate water disaster damage detectionand mid to long term time series observation studies were conducted using GEE. Through the Otsutechnique, which is mainly used for change detection, changes in river width and flood area due to riverflooding were confirmed, centered on the torrential rains that occurred in 2020. In addition, in terms ofdisaster management, the change trend of the time series waterbody from 2018 to 2022 was confirmed.The short processing time through javascript based coding, and the strength of spatiotemporal analysisand result expression, are expected to enable use in the field of water disasters. In addition, it is expectedthat the field of application will be expanded through connection with various satellite bigdata in the future.

AB  - The reservoir is a major water supply source in the domestic agricultural environment, andthe monitoring of water storage of reservoirs is important for the utilization and management ofagricultural water resource. Remote sensing via satellite imagery can be an effective method for regularmonitoring of widely distributed objects such as reservoirs, and in this study, image classification andimage segmentation algorithms are applied to Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery forwater body detection in 53 reservoirs in South Korea. Six algorithms are used: Neural Network (NN),Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Otsu, Watershed (WS), and Chan-Vese (CV),and the results of water body detection are evaluated with in-situ images taken by drones. The correlationsbetween the in-situ water surface area and detected water surface area from each algorithm are NN0.9941, SVM 0.9942, RF 0.9940, Otsu 0.9922, WS 0.9709, and CV 0.9736, and the larger the scale ofreservoir, the higher the linear correlation was. WS showed low recall due to the undetected water bodies,and NN, SVM, and RF showed low precision due to over-detection. For water body detection throughSAR imagery, we found that aquatic plants and artificial structures can be the error factors causingundetection of water body.

AB  - Recent climate change can increase the frequency and damage of wildfires worldwide. Itcan also lead to the deterioration of the forest ecosystem and increase casualties and economic loss.Satellite-based indices for forest damage can facilitate an objective and rapid examination of burnedareas and help analyze inaccessible places like North Korea. In this letter, we conducted a detection ofburned areas in North Korea using the traditional Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), the NormalizedDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to represent vegetation vitality, and the Fire Burn Index (FBI)and Forest Withering Index (FWI) that were recently developed. Also, we suggested a strategy for thesatellite-based detection of burned areas in the Korean Peninsula as a result of comparing the fourindices. Future work requires the examination of small-size wildfires and the applicability of deeplearning technologies.

AB  - Arriving in the new space age, securing technology for fusion application of KOMPSAT-3Â·3A and global satellite images is becoming more important. In general, multi-sensor satellite imageshave relative geometric errors due to various external factors at the time of acquisition, degrading thequality of the satellite image outputs. Therefore, we propose a fine-image registration methodology tominimize the relative geometric error between KOMPSAT-3Â·3A and global satellite images. Afterselecting the overlapping area between the KOMPSAT-3Â·3A and foreign satellite images, the spatialresolution between the two images is unified. Subsequently, tie-points are extracted using a hybridmatching method in which feature- and area-based matching methods are combined. Then, fine-imageregistration is performed through iterative registration based on pyramid images. To evaluate theperformance and accuracy of the proposed method, we used KOMPSAT-3Â·3A, Sentinel-2A, andPlanetScope satellite images acquired over Daejeon city, South Korea. As a result, the average RMSEof the accuracy of the proposed method was derived as 1.2 and 3.59 pixels in Sentinel-2A andPlanetScope images, respectively. Consequently, it is considered that fine-image registration betweenmulti-sensor satellite images can be effectively performed using the proposed method.

TI  - Performance of Support Vector Machine for Classifying Land Cover in Optical Satellite Images: A Case Study in Delaware River Port Area
T2  - Korean Journal of Remote Sensing

M3  - research-article
AB  - The availability of high-resolution satellite images provides precise information without directobservation of the research target. Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT), also known as the Arirangsatellite, has been developed and utilized for earth observation. The machine learning model was continuouslyproven as a good classifier in classifying remotely sensed images. This study aimed to compare the performanceof the support vector machine (SVM) model in classifying the land cover of the Delaware River port area onhigh and medium-resolution images. Three optical images, which are KOMPSAT-2, KOMPSAT-3A, andSentinel-2B, were classified into six land cover classes, including water, road, vegetation, building, vacant, andshadow. The KOMPSAT images are provided by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), and theSentinel-2B image was provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). The training samples were manuallydigitized for each land cover class and considered the reference image. The predicted images were comparedto the actual data to obtain the accuracy assessment using a confusion matrix analysis. In addition, the timeconsumingtraining and classifying were recorded to evaluate the model performance. The results showed thatthe KOMPSAT-3A image has the highest overall accuracy and followed by KOMPSAT-2 and Sentinel-2Bresults. On the contrary, the model took a long time to classify the higher-resolution image compared to thelower resolution. For that reason, we can conclude that the SVM model performed better in the higher resolutionimage with the consequence of the longer time-consuming training and classifying data. Thus, this findingmight provide consideration for related researchers when selecting satellite imagery for effective and accurateimage classification.

AB  - The development and application of a high-resolution soil moisture mapping method usingsatellite imagery has been considered one of the major research themes in remote sensing. In this study,soil moisture mapping in the test area of Jeju Island was performed. The soil moisture was calculatedwith optical images using linearly adjusted Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarization images andincident angle. SAR Backscatter data, Analysis Ready Data (ARD) provided by Google Earth Engine(GEE), was used. In the soil moisture processing process, the optical image was applied to normalizeddifference vegetation index (NDVI) by surface reflectance of KOMPSAT-3 satellite images and the landcover map of Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). When the SAR image and the opticalimages are fused, the reliability of the soil moisture product can be improved. To validate the soil moisturemapping product, a comparative analysis was conducted with normalized difference water index (NDWI)products by the KOMPSAT-3 image and those of the Landsat-8 satellite. As a result, it was shown thatthe soil moisture map and NDWI of the study area were slightly negative correlated, whereas NDWIusing the KOMPSAT-3 images and the Landsat-8 satellite showed a highly correlated trend. Finally, itwill be possible to produce precise soil moisture using KOMPSAT optical images and KOMPSAT SARimages without other external remotely sensed images, if the soil moisture calculation algorithm used inthis study is further developed for the KOMPSAT-5 image.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study examines the deep meaning of Lee Yeon-ju's poems, which were discussed in the past, which has a dystopian sense of despair in the capitalist world and reproduction of physical diseases from the perspective of Affect. The movement of wind image represented by the manipulation of Affect in Lee Yeon-ju's poem is political in Affect and is shaped as an intense force that collectively 'transmits' the bodies. Lee Yeon-ju repeatedly visualizes the forms of the body damaged by the disease by the 'wind', which is adjusted by the angle of Sadness, while creating various images related to the body that becomes the surface of despair and pain in poetry. In his poetic world, the endless repetitions of sad synthetic relationships with capital are hemorrhaged and accumulated in the habit, persistence, and rhythm of the body. Ritournelle is formed. In Lee Yeonju's poem, disease is the current rhythm of the world that repeatedly protrudes. This works as a major mechanism to form 'Ritournelle' in Lee Yeon-ju's Poetry. On the other hand, the sadness in his poem is manipulated and acts as a bad encounter to the body. Because the body is first direct place where power is exercised, and as a necessity for sub-subjects lives. At this time, capitalists and executors, who are the subjects of power, can be seen as those who manipulate the wind. The poetic subject recognizes the possibility of coordination of Affect. He is an 'aesthetic subject' who understands the principle of manipulation and transmission of Affect, and a person who understands the cause of what forms the relationship between unity and discrepancy in the synthesis of the world-body. Poetic subject dreams of subversive transformation into Joy Affect that will increase the ability of the body to exist. However, the attempt to reverse the world's Affect tendency by spreading Joy Affect in Lee Yeon-ju's poetry is not realized and remains a potential. So he chooses the death of 'Yuda of the Atonement' who saved his body, not all the savior 'Jesus'. He chose the corrupted and polluted ‘life ending’ from the capitalist world. As the previous studies have revealed, this emphasizes that Lee Yeon-ju's poems remain in a dystopian worldview. However, the reason why the subject decided to cut off the body, which is the carrier of Affect, was because he understood the transmission of Affect well. This is paradoxically a way of extreme resistance of the subject toward freedom that will not be driven by Sadness. Also, when he noted the process from the perspective of Affect, he could find that his poems also left room for hope that the possibility of reversing the tendency of the Sadness-spirited in the capitalist world and that such possibility would remain potentially and would happen at any time.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a valuable tool for monitoring floods in a wide area. In particular, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage of the observation capability of penetrating clouds and can perform flood detection under rainy conditions. We conducted a flood detection from Sentinel-1 images using a large database (Flood Extent Detection) provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and deep learning models. A performance test using label and prediction images showed a precision of 0.956, a recall of 0.953, and a Mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) of 0.933. As future work, algorithm developments should be necessary for small flood areas, using Digital Elevation Model (DEM), State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models, and (Super Resolution, SR) techniques.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Weolha Kim Dal-jin’s poems that broadened the domain of the history of Korean contemporary poetry through the active presentation of works in the 1930s-40s in the Japanese colonial era have mainly been investigated centering around the Buddhist worldview and inactive nature by his biographical trajectory. Thus, this study started from the awareness of a problem that it would be necessary to have discussions applying various methodologies, themes, and perspectives on Kim Dal-jin’s poems and looked into Kim Dal-jin’s poetic worldview and imagination related to them, newly, discussing the characteristics and meaning of placeness, which have not been explored in earnest in the studies of Kim Dal-jin’s poems.  The aspects of places in Kim Dal-jin’s poems were divided into a place of stuffed everydayness, a place of ‘space different’ from hometown space, and a place in the Buddhist aesthetic sense. It was found that the place of stuffed everydayness was a place where existential isolation generated as wandering in self-consciousness that could not go to a wider world and the reality of survival ran into each other dwelt in. The place of ‘space different’ from hometown space was discussed by applying Michel Foucault’s concept of heterotopia centering around his homesick poems and poems in the period of Manchuria. It was possible to examine the identity that defined the source of the being of ‘me’ and the world of the consciousness of a Joseon poet in Manchuria during Japanese colonial rule. For the place in the Buddhist aesthetic sense, it was found that he showed Buddhist poetics while internalizing and deepening his own Buddhist metaphysics into poetic thinking and imagination through placeness, not relying on subjective descriptions or techniques of Buddhist subject matters. There is another difference from the pioneers in that he discussed the meaning of place by substituting that by the life of the monks or Buddhist rituals.  It was found that in Kim Dal-jin’s poems, a place often embodied poetic meanings and created tensions. Sometimes, he showed the characters of place by stepping directly on a specific place name or space and sometimes, revealed its looks with a place like the position or location where specific emotions and meanings took place. Poetry on the place became the foundation for a new perspective on Kim Dal-jin’s poems as a key to an understanding of the speaker’s gaze.

AB  - This study aims to understand and enhance the intrinsic meaning of hyeol(穴) through the origin of hyeol. Hyeol is a "cave-shaped house," a residential style, analyzed through etymology. Based on this, if you trace the origin of hyeol, you will arrive at the loess plateau, the center of the Yellow River civilization. Originally, The meaning of hyeol in origin, first, hyeol originated from the Chinese residential style. This is the starting point of fengshui. Second, hyeol is the product of human's unique natural adaptation survival instinct. This meaning later develops into a unique fengshui idea in East Asia. Third, the culture of settlement begins with hyeol. Residence is influenced by the physical and objective environment and the subjective and psychological environment that make up human life. As a result, hyeol becomes a key place in ancient Chinese culture. Fourth, the hyeol becomes the center of the world (universe: time and space). It has a worldview that recognizes the world around the hyeol that humans stay in. Fifth, hyeol stopped moving humans. The hyeol made it possible for humans to settle down and lead a collective life through farming and herding.The meaning of the origin of hyeol is naturally connected with the idea of ​​fengshui. Fengshui essentially inherits the original meaning of hyeol, which is 'the best place for humans to stay', and uses 'hyeol' as its core. Therefore, fengshui started with hyeol. Looking at the evidence that the idea of ​​fengshui originated from the hyeol of the loess plateau, First, Baesan Imsu(背山 臨水), a representative natural geographical location principle of fengshui, originated from the location of the hyeol in the loess plateau. It is said that the mountain where the hyeol is located is regarded as the main mountain(主山) on which the hyeol of fengshui leans, and the field (water) spread out in front of the hyeol is regarded as the myeongdang(明堂) of fengshui. Second, the fact that earth (土) was placed in the center of the five elements was attributed to the idea of ​​hyeol as the center of the world. The formula is established that hyeol is the center of the world (穴=中), hyeol is earth(土) (穴=土), that is, earth(土) becomes center(中) (土=中). Also, the fact that the color that symbolizes the center of the five elements is yellow is derived from the yellow color of the loess plateau, the origin of hyeol. In addition, the shape of tohyeongsan(土形山), which is used in fengshui, also matches the shape of the mountain in the loess plateau. Third, the tomb styles, the Hoenghyeolsik(橫穴式) and the Suhyeolsik(竪穴式), are derived from the Goaesig(靠崖式) and Hachimsig(下沈式), which are the hyeol types of the loess plateau. The customs of Tojang (土葬) are also derived from the hyeol of the loess plateau, the habitation style, and the soil quality of Gwangjung(壙中) is also typical of the soil of the loess plateau.Another meaning of the origin of hyeol is middle(中). The Chinese structure the world by living at the hyeol. Hyeol has a unique value as it becomes the central place of the world. The place is an anthropocentric thinking where human emotions exist. Therefore, hyeol has value as the center of the world to the Chinese and is signified as an idea. It's just a Jung sasang(中 思想). The Jung sasang(中 思想) develops into the core idea of ​​China along with the central concept(中 觀念) of the five elements discussed above. The meaning of the Chinese character(中 字) in China(中國) is also rooted in the Jung sasang(中 思想) originating from hyeol.In summary, hyeol originates from the 'cave-type house', a residential style of the loess plateau, the center of the Yellow River civilization. The Chinese are born at hyeol, live around the hyeol, and die at hyeol. Hyeol is the eternal hometown that transcends life and death for the Chinese, and it is the center of the Five Elements, the center of position, and the center of the world. China's economy, politics, and culture begin from the hyeol, and major ideas originate. The intrinsic meaning of hyeol is very special and meaningful.
