AB  - Remote sensing data has known an explosive growth in the past decade. This has led to the need for efficient dimensionality reduction techniques, mathematical procedures that transform the high-dimensional data into a meaningful, reduced representation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a well-known dimensionality reduction technique used in the field of hyperspectral satellite images. However, PCA suffers from high computational costs and increased complexity, an issue that led to elaborating PCA adaptations capable of running on multi-core computing architectures. This paper proposes a parallel implementation of the geometrical PCA approximation (gaPCA) algorithm. Three parallel implementations are studied: two on multi-core CPUs and a NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPU) CUDA accelerated implementation. Our results show significant speedups of the parallel implementations when applied on hyperspectral image datasets. Our results show that on the Intel Core i5 CPU, Python multi-core implementation is up to 2.01 x faster than its Matlab equivalent. Our GPU PyCUDA implementation is considerably faster than both our Python multi-core CPU implementations: up to 1.76 x faster than Intel Core i5-6200U and up to 5.72x faster than the NVIDIA Jetson Nano quad-core ARM A53 CPU. We performed data analysis on the output data for the three methods and the maxim relative error was less than 0.001%.

TI  - African Environmental Ethics: Lessons from the Rain-Maker's Moral and Cosmological Perspectives
T2  - AFRICAN ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS: A CRITICAL READER
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Can African Environmental Ethics learn anything from folk ecology? Simultaneously, I wonder if the rain-making ceremony and African Ecological accounts from the Rain-makers, are still relevant to prevailing philosophical debates about human relations with the environment. This paper is a retrospective attempt to engage African Environmental Ethics in a conversation with traditional wisdom from 'folk' ecology. In a similar manner with the quest to decolonize African Philosophy in general, I argue that African Environmental Ethics is fundamentally inseparable from the Rain-maker's understanding of reality and the moral status of the environment. In this chapter, I will put the rainmaker's worldview into conversation with African Philosophy's search for a normative Environmental ethics. I hold the argument that the nature of such an ethic ought to be trans-anthropocentric and I make use of the Rain-maker's perspectives to show the intrinsic moral value of non-human forms of life in African Philosophy. The important point to note is that Rain-makers in their time, had an eco-political authority which enabled them to prescribe on various moral and environmental issues in a way which can be argued to depict an African Environmental Ethics. This 'primitive' epistemological epoch cannot thus be sidelined in contemporary discourses about African Environmental Ethics.

TI  - THE SCIENTIFIC, FOLK, AND ARMCHAIR ETYMOLOGY OF CITY NAMES (Based on the Names of the Cities in the Republic of Kazakhstan)
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The etymology of toponyms has long become a favored subject of research and a matter of public curiosity. Geographical names are a mine of information about the history of an object, its location, distinctive features, significant cultural and political events, natural disasters, popular rulers, conquerors, etc. Etymological analysis remains the only way to extract reliable historical and ethnocultural information they contain. In this regard, scientific etymological searchers should be considered on par with naive (popular) etymology that captures people's worldview reflected in the language. The latter manifests itself in folkore and toponymy, gradually eroding in collective memory and reshaping due newly occurred events associated with the past, the way it is seen by later generations. Figuratively, it functions as a "back reflection" of the folklore text. It is important to understand what stands behind that or another folk etymology, what are its social causes and consequences, what cultural meanings it retains. In recent years, the frame of scientific and folk etymology is repeatedly invaded by the so-called "armchair" (false-etymological) conceptions on the origin of toponyms, which are basically counterfactual theories unrelated to the scientific thought. Linguists are obliged to reasonably refute these fallacious views that undermine the credibility of etymological findings. The article discusses Kazakh names of the cities of Almaty, Akmola, Astana, Pavlodar (Koryakov, Kimak, Kereku), Petropavl, Semipalatinsk (Semey), Ust-Kamenogorsk (Oskemen). The authors delve into the history of astionyms to deliver their detailed etymological interpretation which allows them to distinguish between scientific, folk-ethymological, and false-etymological versions of the origin of names.

TI  - Environmental worldview beliefs and CSR advertising
T2  - SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to show how environment-related worldview beliefs, in addition to specific persuasion knowledge, can influence how a consumer responds to ads about corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects.Design/methodology/approach Two experiments manipulated ad copy and consumers' persuasion knowledge to examine the effects of consumers' environmental worldview beliefs on their judgments of a firm's CSR reforestation project.Findings When an ad presented ambiguous information, both consumers' persuasion knowledge and their environmental worldview influenced the attribution of the firm's motives. When an ad presented environment-specific information, however, consumers' worldview did not influence their attribution of motives. Attributions, in turn, predicted attitudes toward the ad and attitudes toward the brand and were associated with intentions for information-seeking and referral behavior.Research limitations/implications A consumer's core beliefs can play an important role in understanding the application of persuasion knowledge, and the reinforcement-of-meaning principle expands the persuasion knowledge model's explanatory power.Practical implications Marketing communications that involve social responsibility projects must take into account how core beliefs can influence the way consumers respond to projects.Social implications This research demonstrates the importance of worldview beliefs in communication that takes place in the public sphere.Originality/value The experiments' results contribute to a more robust understanding of the persuasion knowledge model, particularly as it applies to CSR messages and introduces the reinforcement-of-meaning principle.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed that variations in glacier movement over larger time scales can be explained by the changes in total mass of the glacier, making it an effective indicator of glacier health. It is vital to obtain precise and accurate glacier movement velocity to investigate the glacier health. Satellite based Differential SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques have been used for continuous monitoring of glacier surface movements. However, it is still challenging to employ this method in mountainous regions, such as the Indian Himalaya, due to e.g. severe temporal decorrelation and rapid glacier changes, and complex geological situation. Thanks to a pool of freely available ESA's Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR data with a short time repeat cycle, it is possible to overcome such challenges. This study attempts to assess the applicability of these datasets from its -1a and -1b platforms for estimating surface ice flow velocities in Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). Siachen Glacier, located in Karakoram range of IHR, is chosen as a representative glacier in this study, using which assessment of the dataset is performed and results are presented. 6-day interferometric pair was used for revealing the glacier velocity, estimated to range between 0m/y in some parts of the accumulation zone to 135m/y along the main trunk of the glacier in ablation zone. It is observed that, although datasets from Sentinel-1 mission are applicable for DInSAR processing in IHR, they provide a limited yet valuable opportunity to understand and model surface dynamics of mountain glaciers.

TI  - Influence of land surface parameters on the spatio-seasonal land surface temperature regime in rural West Bengal, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude and causes of changes in the land surface temperature of rural areas have not been extensively studied. The thermal band of Landsat imagery is taken to extract winter, summer, and monsoon season land surface temperature (LST) and relate it to surface parameters over a 30-year period. From the extracted parameters constructed a prospective surface temperature (PST) model using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. The Chandrabhaga river basin in West Bengal of the lateritic Rarh Tract at the Chota Nagpur Plateau fringe was chosen as the study area because it is far from urban influences, to avoid the well-known heat island effect. Over the study period, summer and winter average LST increased linearly by 0.085 degrees C/y and 0.016 degrees C/y respectively. These results were validated with air temperature (RMSE = x and y, respectively). Over time more of the area is in the higher temperature zones, e.g., in April 2011, 4% area exceeded >32 degrees, whereas in 2015 this proportion reached 52%. PST models of all the seasons were moderate to highly correlate (0.57-0.87) with actual LST, showing the value of this model. It also revealed the relative importance of the regional factors. Based on this information factor management is a scientific step to restrict or minimize the temperature rise effect. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A comparative analysis of the precipitation extremes obtained from tropical rainfall-measuring mission satellite and rain gauges datasets over a semiarid region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this research were to compare precipitation extremes obtained from Tropical Rainfall-Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite and those of rain gauges over a semiarid area in Iran. Extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) (i.e., the number of days with a precipitation value over 10 mm, the maximum duration of wet and dry days, the number of days with precipitation over the 95th percentile, total precipitation higher than the 95th percentile, and maximum daily precipitation) were calculated across Fars province, Iran, 2000-2014 on seasonal time scales. The gauges data were interpolated at a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees to match the 3B42 data using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). Then, EPIs from the two datasets were compared with each other. The findings showed that mean values computed from gauges and satellite data did not present any significant differences among all of the extreme indices. Furthermore, their variances presented a good level of congruence. Finally, the majority of indices presented a satisfactory correlation between the two dataset. To evaluate the prediction of extreme events in different temporal and tolerated distances, a fuzzy method was used. The results showed that the percentage of grid cells with useful predictions tripled with spatial tolerance extending by just one pixel. To evaluate methods of eliminating the uncertainty of probable missing rainfall data and the seasonal changes in rainfall averages, probabilistic methods based on Weibull distribution and truncated geometric distribution (TGD) were employed to eliminate uncertainties in estimation of extreme precipitation amounts and extreme wet periods (WPs). The results showed that as to extreme precipitation amounts, a satisfactory method could not be drawn for arid southern regions of Fars, Iran. Similarly, as to extreme WPs, the consistency between gauges and satellite data could not be improved significantly.

TI  - The First Wetland Inventory Map of Newfoundland at a Spatial Resolution of 10 m Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data on the Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems that provide a desirable habitat for a great variety of flora and fauna. Wetland mapping and modeling using Earth Observation (EO) data are essential for natural resource management at both regional and national levels. However, accurate wetland mapping is challenging, especially on a large scale, given their heterogeneous and fragmented landscape, as well as the spectral similarity of differing wetland classes. Currently, precise, consistent, and comprehensive wetland inventories on a national- or provincial-scale are lacking globally, with most studies focused on the generation of local-scale maps from limited remote sensing data. Leveraging the Google Earth Engine (GEE) computational power and the availability of high spatial resolution remote sensing data collected by Copernicus Sentinels, this study introduces the first detailed, provincial-scale wetland inventory map of one of the richest Canadian provinces in terms of wetland extent. In particular, multi-year summer Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 and optical Sentinel-2 data composites were used to identify the spatial distribution of five wetland and three non-wetland classes on the Island of Newfoundland, covering an approximate area of 106,000 km(2). The classification results were evaluated using both pixel-based and object-based random forest (RF) classifications implemented on the GEE platform. The results revealed the superiority of the object-based approach relative to the pixel-based classification for wetland mapping. Although the classification using multi-year optical data was more accurate compared to that of SAR, the inclusion of both types of data significantly improved the classification accuracies of wetland classes. In particular, an overall accuracy of 88.37% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.85 were achieved with the multi-year summer SAR/optical composite using an object-based RF classification, wherein all wetland and non-wetland classes were correctly identified with accuracies beyond 70% and 90%, respectively. The results suggest a paradigm-shift from standard static products and approaches toward generating more dynamic, on-demand, large-scale wetland coverage maps through advanced cloud computing resources that simplify access to and processing of the Geo Big Data. In addition, the resulting ever-demanding inventory map of Newfoundland is of great interest to and can be used by many stakeholders, including federal and provincial governments, municipalities, NGOs, and environmental consultants to name a few.

AB  - Accurate information on evapotranspiration (ET) will provide important information in irrigation systems. Here, we estimated ET spatially using a simple method by combining satellite data and field measurements. Field measurements of ET were conducted in Air Buluh Village, Bangka Belitung Island on seven land cover types (three different palm-oil ages, bare land, agricultural land, reclamation, shrub) by using the Penman-Monteith method (PM). The satellite data that used in this study were Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), spectral reflectance short-wave band (SWIR) from Landsat 8-OLI/TIRS data. The ET spatial was built by using the correlation between satellite data and ET PM. The equation formed by vegetation index and SWIR is: ET=EVI(2.68e(6.14 SWIR)), ET=NDVI(2.67e(4.57SWIR)), ET=SAVI(4.45e(4.07 SWIR)), with P-value < 0.05 for all equations with error 1-2.5 mm/day. Regression analysis shows that the ET model has the highest R-2 with ET PM is 42% and the best combination is EVI and SWIR. ET model shows better results on oil palm cover and reclamation land and has a high deviation on agricultural and shrub. This due to similar index vegetation value, the agricultural and scrub areas was read as oil palm areas in satellite imagery. A negative value on index vegetation causes the ET model has negative value to the water body. ET model only can be applicative to non-water body and on the high and homogenous vegetation cover.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the response of surface water quality to land use/land cover changes studied. We investigate the impact of land use changes on quality of water during three decades in the Razavi Khorasan Province of Iran. Detecting of LULC changes has done using Landsat satellite images belonging to the years 1987 (TM), 2001 (ETM+) and 2015 (OLI). In the study area based on RS and GIS standard techniques, sixteen land use classes were defined: barren, rocky, residential, swamp, water, dunes, salt marsh, irrigated cultivation, garden, dry farming, desert, good rangeland, medium rangeland, poor rangeland, wooded rangeland, and watercourse. Also, the water quality data from 1987 to 2015 in the stream gauge station located at the outlet of the 36 catchments analyzed. In this study, 13 parameters included K, Cl, Ca, Mg, Na, CO3, HCO3, SO4, EC, pH, TDS, SAR, and Hardness investigated. After removing variance, non-parametric tests performed and trends of water quality variables in the time series evaluated. Then, using a multivariate linear regression model was trying to link water quality variables to land use changes. Results demonstrated that the models estimate water quality parameters with an acceptable degree of accuracy (P-value < 0.05) except calcium, potassium, carbonate, and bicarbonate. The results showed the relationship between land use and the water quality indicators that can be applied in environmental protection and land use planning.

TI  - Analysis of The Driving Forces of Urban Expansion in Luxor City by Remote Sensing Monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Luxor in Egypt is a city of great historical importance, rich in archaeological sites and natural resources. To ensure sustainable development in Luxor city, it is essential to understand the driving forces of its growth. Both Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite Remote Sensing (RS) were successfully used to evaluate these overall driving forces. This paper is aimed at monitoring the growth dynamics of the urbanization process that occurred in Luxor city during a 20-year period from 1996 to 2017. The archived time series medium resolution Landsat ETM+ and TM satellite imagery are used to study and analyze spatial patterns of urban in order to improve understanding the impact of driving forces of urban expansion in Luxor. The GIS was not only used to identify the driving forces but also to provide an integrated monitoring of the study area. This offered a unique advantage to simultaneously store and manipulate spatial and attribute data of a large amount. A very significant increase in urban area has taken place in the last decade in Luxor city, which was revealed an important outcome. A net increase of 36.7 km(2) was witnessed in the last 20 years (especially in recent years), in the built-up urban area. The built-up urban area in 2017 saw an increase that was twice that in 1996, with an annual average increase of 1.75 km(2), and an annual change rate of 4.6%. The analysis of this dramatic change revealed that city infrastructure, economic growth, population growth, topographic elements, and city planning, and policies were the major driving forces for the rapid expansion of built-up urban area, albeit with different weights for these different forces. In this study, we explored a method of monitoring parameters related to the architectural heritage of Luxor governorate using "remote sensing big data" to provide data support for the city's urban planning and policy formulation.

TI  - Computing Resource Allocation in LEO Satellites System: A Stackelberg Game Approach

AB  - Past few years have witnessed the compelling applications of the remote sensing satellites in our daily life, ranging from the weather forecast to military surveillance. Due to the computation and power constraints, the LEO satellites have to download the remote sensing data to the ground stations for further processing. However, the long-distance transmission and the ionospheric interference is problematic for supporting the latency-sensitive remote sensing services, such as hotspot detection, hotspot tracing. As a remedy, in this paper, the space stations are introduced to offload the computation task of the remote sensing satellites to reduce the transmission delay. With the space station joining in, a three-tier intelligent remote sensing satellites operation system is constructed. In order to perform well, we study the computation resource allocation strategies in this three-tier system. We model the resource management and pricing problems among three players as a Stackelberg game, where the space stations act as the leaders, the ground stations as the followers, and the LEO satellites as the sub-followers. For searching the Nash equilibrium of this game, we apply 'WoLF-PHC' algorithm for learning the optimal resource management strategies. In addition, some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our architecture and algorithm.

CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Water quality is of great importance for humans and for the environment and hence has to be monitored continuously. One possibility are proxies such as the chlorophyll a concentration, which can be monitored by remote sensing techniques. This study focuses on the trade-off between the spatial and the spectral resolution of six simulated satellite-based data sets when estimating the chlorophyll a concentration with supervised machine learning models. The initial dataset for the spectral simulation of the satellite missions contains spectrometer data and measured chlorophyll a concentration of 13 different inland waters. The analysis of the regression performance indicates, that the machine learning models achieve almost as good results with the simulated Sentinel data as with the simulated hyperspectral data. Regrading the applicability, the Sentinel 2 mission is the best choice for small inland waters due to its high spatial and temporal resolution in combination with a suitable spectral resolution.

AB  - The estimation of fresh snow depth (FSD) using X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is feasible but challenging depending on the hydrometeorological conditions and data availability. In this study, the FSD is computed for the Beas river watershed in the northwestern Himalayas near Manali, India. It incorporates the recent copolar phase difference (CPD) based FSD inversion model. Moreover, the TerraSAR-X and TANDEM-X bistatic data acquired in January 2016 are used as inputs to the model along with the snow density measurements at the Dhundi ground station. Additionally, apart from applying layover and forest masks, the potential uncertainty sources in the complex mountainous terrains are identified using the H-A-ff decomposition and unsupervised Wishart classification techniques. Furthermore, due to the limited number of weather stations, the results are validated using a 3 x3 neighbourhood window surrounding the Dhundi site. Also, the effects of different FSD ensemble window sizes are tested for performing sensitivity analysis.

TI  - Icings of the Indigirka river basin according to the recent Landsat satellite images and historical data
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents methods and results of creation of the digital catalogue of aufeises for the Indigirka river basin made on the basis of Landsat images and historical data. The region under study is the basin before the hydrometric section of GMS Vorontsovo, its area is about 305 000 km(2). Historical data were taken from the Inventory of naleds of the North-East of the USSR territory published in 1958 and topographic maps. It includes the estimated coordinates and characteristics of 897 aufeises with total area of 2064 km(2). The Landsat-based identification of aufeises for 2013-2017 allowed making description of 1213 aufeises over a total area of 1287 km(2). The integrated digital catalogue of the aufeises for the Indigirka river basin based on combination of the above two sources is available at https://issues.pangaea.de/browse/PDI-17699. 10% of the largest aufeises make up about 60% of the total area of all aufeises according to both sources. The largest number of aufeises is at altitudes of 900-1300 m. The interannual variability of area of the aufeises for the period 2001-2016 was estimated by the example of the Bolshaya Momskaya naled and the group of large aufeises in the basin of the Syuryukty River which is the left tributary of the Indigirka. The conclusions cannot be considered unambiguous due to certain limitations of the imagery data but the results of the analysis is indicative of a tendency to decreasing in the area of the Bolshaya Momskaya naled in recent years, while no reduction in the aufeis area is noted in the basin of the Syuryukty River. The main results of this work are the new geo database of the aufeises in the Indigirka river basin, and also the comparison of the satellite observations with historical data performed for two major naleds. It is established that the satellite-estimated total area of aufeises is 1.6 times less than in the Cadastre (1958). At the same time, it was found that more than 600 aufeises recognized by the Landsat images were absent in the Cadastre of 1958. This may suggest that either the Cadastre data is incomplete or that conditions of the aufeis can be significantly changed over the past 50 years.

TI  - "Francesca da Rimini" by Sergei Rachmaninoff in its Connections with the Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Opera Works
T2  - PROBLEMY MUZYKALNOI NAUKI-MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - "Francesca da Rimini" by Rachmaninoff is an opera which still undeservedly remains at the periphery of scholarly attention and producers' interest, not least due to its existing reputation as an unsuccessful musical composition. The article poses the question of the role of intertextuality in the dramaturgy and conception of "Francesca" through the demonstration of the literary and musical parallels with Tchaikovsky's operas, which creates a new context for the comprehension and interpretation of Rachmaninoff's opera. Its genre-related and compositional resemblance to "Iolanta," the plotline and literary interconnections with "The Queen of Spades," the musical references to "Mazepa," "The Maid of Orleans" and "Iolanta" make it possible to perceive "Francesca" as a new stage in the comprehension of the theme of the human being and fate, the issues of making decisions and their tragic consequences, the correlation of human actions with the value system of the religious worldview.The allusions placed into the context of the musical language of the 20th century (the chromatic pitch system, expanded tonality, microthematicism) function in the opera's intonational dramaturgy as symbols which define its semantic density and make it possible to concretize its conception. They create a semantical implication, impressing not as much the storyline, as much the profound philosophical connection between the artistic world of "Francesca" with the conceptual constants of Tchaikovsky's operas, which in themselves are close to Rachmaninoff's world perception.

AB  - Watershed management has become a necessity for the optimum use and sustainability of natural resources. Prioritisation is done to identify and rank the different watersheds in a catchment based on multiple parameters which play a role in the land and water degradation, using various multi-attribute decision-making methods (MADM). In the present study two MADM methods namely, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR), which are based on the measure of 'closeness to ideal' were used for the prioritisation of Netravati catchment, Karnataka, India. The catchment is having an area of 3415 sq. km., and was divided into six watersheds (NET01, NET02, NET03, NET04, NET05 and NET07), using Survey of India (SOI) toposheets (1: 50000) and ALOS PALSAR DEM (12.5m). Morphometric analysis was carried for each watershed. Twelve parameters related to linear, aerial and relief aspects, were considered for ranking of the watershed using the TOPSIS and the VIKOR method individually. Watersheds NET04, NET05 and NET02 were assigned ranks 1, 2 and 3 from the TOPSIS method with closeness to ideal solution values 0.6476, 0.5983 and 0.5805 respectively. Similarly, based on the VIKOR method, watersheds NET03, NET04 and NET05 were ranked 1, 2 and 3 with Q values 1, 0.9632 and 0.8176 respectively. Watershed NET07, which is on the downstream of the catchment attained the least rank from both the methods. Also, the watersheds were further characterised in three categories, based on risk erodibility using the Jenks natural breaks GIS-Classification. The watersheds with a higher risk of erodibility should be given preference for the implementation of soil and water conservation methods in the study area, and thus watersheds were prioritised accordingly.

AB  - In this presentation, a new satellite antenna configuration realized by a TX and a RX reflectarray antenna will be proposed. Each antenna is composed of multiple horns and a single layer flat reflectarray. It radiates scanning beams with different radiation directions in azimuth due to polarization and each scanning beam with different radiation directions depending on frequency covers an elongate area in elevation. Each user in the service area selects the optimum frequency band and polarization determined by the position of the user. If 3 dB gain reduction is allowed, half of the frequency band can be used like the conventional multiple spot beam antenna configuration.

AB  - Remote sensing indices have been widely used for mapping water quality parameters such as the suspended material and chlorophyll-a concentration. This study aims at investigating the spatio-temporal performance of spectral indices for mapping suspended sediments in water using Landsat 8 data. The results show that the normalized suspended material index (NSMI) is the most effective index for multi-temporal mapping of suspended solids. The use of other spectral indices in the visible to shortwave infrared also offers reasonable estimation (R-2 > 0.7; p< 0.05) of water quality parameters. It is recommended that the performance of the tested indices be compared with other indices derived from high resolution data such as the Ziyuan-3 and Sentinel-2 satellites for operational monitoring of inland water bodies.

AB  - Immersion in a creative task can be an intimate experience. It can feel like a mystery: intangible, inexplicable, and beyond the reach of science. However, science is making exciting headway into understanding creativity. While the mind of a highly uncreative individual consists of a collection of items accumulated through direct experience and enculturation, the mind of a creative individual is self-organizing and self-mending; thus, experiences and items of cultural knowledge are thought through from different perspectives such that they cohere together into a loosely integrated whole. The reweaving of items in memory is elicited by perturbations: experiences that increase psychological entropy because they are inconsistent with one's web of understandings. The process of responding to one perturbation often leads to other perturbations, i.e., other inconsistencies in one's web of understandings. Creative thinking often requires the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of thought in response to the ever-changing demands of the creative task. Since uncreative individuals can reap the benefits of creativity by imitating creators, using their inventions, or purchasing their artworks, it is not necessary that everyone be creative. Agent based computer models of cultural evolution suggest that society functions best with a mixture of creative and uncreative individuals. The ideal ratio of creativity to imitation increases in times of change, such as we are experiencing now. Therefore it is important to educate the next generation in ways that foster creativity. The chapter concludes with suggestions for how educational systems can cultivate creativity.

AB  - In astrophysics, a significant role is played by observations. During astronomy classes in the absence of surveillance tools interactive programmes such as an interactive programme for space objects simulation can be used as Universe Sandbox(2). The aim of this work is to implement interactive programmes for effective astronomy teaching, understanding material and increasing cognitive interest. We observe the evolution of stars while using Universe Sandbox(2) during the study of the topic "Evolution of stars". Using this programme students have an opportunity to get acquainted with the existence of stars with different masses, their differences, to observe changes in the physical characteristics of stars such as: mass, temperature, speed velocity, luminosity, radius and gravity. It will help to develop the ability to analyze, to compare, to form scientific worldview, to develop the attraction for research, to raise the interest for studying astronomy.

TI  - Wireless Sensor Networks for Improved Snow Water Equivalent and Runoff Estimates
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We leverage the frontiers of the Internet of Things technology in a recently developed end-to-end wireless sensor network (WSN) system that samples, collects, stores, and displays mountain hydrology measurements in near real-time. At the core of the system lies an ultra-low power, radio channel-hoping, and self-organizing mesh that allows for remote autonomous sampling of snow. Such properties, combined with a rugged weather-sealed design of the devices and multi-level data replication, provides reliable real-time data at spatial and temporal scales previously impractical to achieve in mountain environments. The system was deployed at three 1 km(2) sites across the North Fork of the Feather River basin with a cluster of 12 sensor nodes for each location. Measurements show that existing operational autonomous systems are non-representative spatially, with biases that can reach up to 50%. A comparison between a wet and dry year showed that snow depths exhibit strong multi-scale inter-year spatial stationarity with major rank conservation. Temporally dense analysis using elastic net regression shows that dominant features at the sub km(2) scale are site-dependent and differ from the watershed scale. Newly introduced explanatory variables, based on the nearest neighbor with a Landsat assimilated historical product, consistently explained up to 90% of the variance in the watershed-scale SWE for both years. At two WSN sites, lagged cross-correlation of snowmelt with stream flow measurements showed a significant improvement of up to 100% compared with existing systems, suggesting that WSNs can be instrumental in improving runoff forecasting and water management.

AB  - The research project MuDak-WRM aims at developing a globally applicable model to asses a reservoir's water quality. To reduce the complexity of detailed highly adopted numerically models and to investigate the use of remote sensing data instead of in-situ measurements are the two main objectives of MuDak-WRM. The Sensor Web, an open Geostandard, is designed as the central data hub in this context. This paper describes how the remote sensing data is integrated with the sensor web via an unified endpoint, but dedicated databases for multi-temporal remote sensing data (i.e. array database) and time series in-situ data (i.e. object-relational database).

AB  - The problem of alienation of youth from traditional cultural and moral values is one of the urgent in the modern information world. For a comprehensive solution to this problem in the educational process of the university, it is necessary to determine the risk factors emergence for the moral alienation of students. The article reveals the content of the main risk groups: 1) external risks caused by the general cultural tendencies of the modern world (the sociocultural crisis of the information civilization associated with the loss of a stable worldview by a person); 2) information risks arising from the use of information technology (massive impact of rapidly growing volumes of heterogeneous information; attractiveness of the virtual world); 3) organizational and pedagogical risks caused by negative phenomena in the educational space (low level of professional competence; irrational organization of the educational process); 4) psychological risks associated with factors of causing psychological damage to students in the process of interpersonal relations (professional burnout of a teacher; authoritarian management style; psychological violence, low self-esteem of a student). The results of the study allow us to identify the main areas of pedagogical activity on the prevention of moral alienation of students at a university.

AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) have been computed and their relationships with Land surface temperature (LST) in each season were examined. LST retrieved by thermal data analysis represents the spatial and temporal distribution of surface temperature. NDBI is describing the built-up index and NDVI the proportion of vegetation in the watershed. Relationships of LST with NDBI & NDVI were developed in each season. Correlation results of LST & NDBI has shown strong positive relationship i.e. R-2 = 0.991 in Jan.2016, 0.981 in May 2016 & 0.965 in Oct.2016, where as strong negative correlation were found in between LST & NDVI i.e. R-2 = 0.993, 0.992, & 0.911 in each season. Relationship between NDVI & NDBI was also developed and is showing strong negative correlation i.e. R-2 = 0.979, 0.988, & 0.913.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Understanding local effects of climate change on biodiversity are essential for environmental policy orientation. Lacks of knowledge at regional level have led to the development of a research program: "Climate sentinels" (www.sentinelles-climat.org). A research hypothesis is that the effects can be studied from indicators of species that have weak displacement. These "sentinel" species will be the first to respond to local climatic variations by adaptation or local extinction. In France, New Aquitaine region is a relevant research laboratory. It offers both sensitivity to climate change and a variety of natural ecosystems. The approach to understanding the response of these indicators to climate change is based on observations in a whole region, standardized protocols in relationship with models using mainly abundance data, validated data linked to associated sufficient coverage and relevant observations in connection with time and space scales. In this paper, we will present 3 points characterizing this project: (1) the research-action approach of the program brings together different types of actors (decision makers, naturalists, managers, researchers and the public), within an independent organisation and catalyst "Cistude Nature", (2) themethod of establishing a list of development indicators called "Climate sentinels", (3) the protocols and data analysis of multi-ecosystems, multi-species at different scales that are used to support projections of climate change impacts on biodiversity. The aim is to share feedback on this topic concerning the structuring of the program at the interface between science and society.

TI  - The Impact of Breast Lumpectomy Tray Utilization on Cost Savings
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Right-sizing instrument trays reduce processing and replacement costs, physical strain, and turnover times. Historically, a 98-instrument head and neck tray has been used for breast lumpectomy cases at our institution. Observations revealed that many instruments on the tray were not used during the breast cases. With the significant number of surgical breast lumpectomies performed annually, tray downsizing could significantly reduce costs and physical strain.Methods: Surgical technicians identified instruments needed for a standard breast lumpectomy. Breast surgeons reviewed the list and made final recommendations. Three of 13 existing head and neck trays were converted to breast lumpectomy trays. The number of breast lumpectomies in 2017 was pulled from the institution's health information system. Instrument quantities were verified using instrument management software. Weights were taken on a digital scale, and processing cost was estimated by a consultant.Results: The new breast trays included 51 instruments rather than the standard 98-instrument trays. Reprocessing cost decreased from $49.98 to $26.01. With 449 breast lumpectomies performed at the institution in 2017, the annual reprocessing savings totaled $10,763. The tray weight was reduced from 27 to 16 pounds. Setup time decreased from 7 to 4 mm per use (22.5 h saved annually).Conclusions: Downsizing from a head and neck tray to a specific breast lumpectomy tray demonstrated a reduction in reprocessing cost, tray weight, and setup time. Lighter trays allow for safer handling and transport by surgical personnel. In the current health-care environment, it is important to maximize operating room efficiency and minimize cost.

TI  - Endometrial Carcinoma, Grossing and Processing Issues: Recommendations of the International Society of Gynecologic Pathologists
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic neoplasm in developed countries; however, updated universal guidelines are currently not available to handle specimens obtained during the surgical treatment of patients affected by this disease. This article presents recommendations on how to gross and submit sections for microscopic examination of hysterectomy specimens and other tissues removed during the surgical management of endometrial cancer such as salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and lymph node dissection-including sentinel lymph nodes. In addition, the intraoperative assessment of some of these specimens is addressed. These recommendations are based on a review of the literature, grossing manuals from various institutions, and a collaborative effort by a subgroup of the Endometrial Cancer Task Force of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists. The aim of these recommendations is to standardize the processing of endometrial cancer specimens which is vital for adequate pathological reporting and will ultimately improve our understanding of this disease.

AB  - The significance of forest ecosystems in terms of ecosystem processes and services and impacts on humanity is fully acknowledged. The constant exploitation of natural resources and the increasing anthropogenic pressure on ecosystems continue to put a strain on and irretrievably threaten global forest ecosystems. Global forest health is declining due to climate change, air pollution and increased human activities. Protecting and monitoring the health of forest ecosystems is a vital resource management function. The technological development in the field of remote sensing provides new tools and automated solutions for forest health monitoring. An effective web-based forest health monitoring platform can contribute to ecological, social, and economic aspects. This study aims to design rapid and automated workflows (Spatial Models-SMs) for time-series forest health monitoring with flexible parameterization and user-friendly interfaces ready for feeding WPS web-GIS platforms. Those include: i) SMs that ingest available time-series data and perform preprocessing activities, ii) SMs that calculate time-series of vegetation, soil and water indices from multispectral optical imagery, iii) SMs that create colored composite images from image algebra and SAR polarizations and vi) SMs that extract change detection maps from time-series SAR data. The study area is located in the wider region of the Mouzaki, Greece, where various types of forest species can be found. Sentinel-1 & 2 data were used while the ERDAS IMAGINE software was utilized for the design of the SMs. The results indicate the potential of the designed SMs to feed WPS webGIS platforms promptly and efficiently.

AB  - In the end. XIX - beg. XX centuries in the traditional medical culture of Perm, folk healers, healers, engaged in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases, played an important role. The main, so-called, "activities" of the healers were very closely connected with each other. The main source of medical knowledge was a great popular experience, and special communication mechanisms of transmission from generation to generation contributed to the development of spiritual culture and the livelihood of the Perm ethnos.In this paper, the main aspects of the image of the Komi-Permyak sorcerer (healer, physician) are examined on the basis of ethnographic and literary sources of researchers and their own field materials. It reveals its psychological and social characteristics: role, appearance, as well as a peculiar hierarchy of healers in society, and their significance in the traditional worldview, a place in the religious mythological picture of the world.

M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of artificial intelligence systems raises a number of technical, philosophical, legal and ethical issues related to the admissibility of using artificial intelligence in various fields, and the need to comply with ethical standards in the creation of artificial intelligence systems, as well as the possibility of introducing ethical standards in the decision-making process of artificial intelligence. Since for many people religion is the basis of the worldview, present in public life as ethics, not dogmatics, the study of various aspects of the relationship between religion and artificial intelligence is also extremely important. The author analyzes the ethical and religious problems associated with the creation and distribution of artificial intelligence systems and proposes ways of legal regulation of new social relations associated with the use of artificial intelligence. The author explores the following problems: the ability of artificial intelligence to be a subject of law; liability of artificial intelligence; sacralization of artificial intelligence; the responsibility for harm caused by artificial intelligence systems; the adoption of artificial intelligence decisions concerning the rights and duties of people; increasing stratification and inequality; mass unemployment; intellectual superiority of the carriers of artificial intelligence over man; alienation of people from each other, the loneliness of man; the ability to follow ethical standards when artificial intelligence makes decisions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi is located in the city of Turkestan, Kazakhstan. The mausoleum is a vivid example of medieval monuments, and it was built over the grave of the Turkic poet and Sufi preacher Ahmed Yasawi at the end of the 14th century by the order of Emir Timur. To date, many researchers have put forward different ideas about the mausoleum. The plan, functions of the premises, ornament and the decoration of the structure show the characteristics of the Sufi tariqa of Yasawiya, based on the traditional Turkic worldview. This article will examine the historical and philosophical foundations and functional purpose of the plan and architecture, and as the order of location of the mausoleum's premises. In addition, an analysis of insufficiently researched functions and names of the building's premises, as well as their continuity from the point of view of the pre-Islamic religious beliefs of the Central Asian peoples and the concept of Islam is conducted. Evidence is provided that the worldview concepts of this period are a factor that has been reflected in the architecture of the Middle Ages.

T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the analysis of the Value System which constitutes part of a cultural code from the perspective of culturally oriented lexicography. The analysis is based on the comparison of the Russian and Mongolian languages. The authors of the article discuss a number of closely connected theoretical and practical issues, which include: the essence of the Value System from the point of view of linguistics, culture studies and psychology; the functioning of this system; its influence on the formation of speech behavior and communicative competences; the possibility of using the knowledge about the Value System in the teaching of foreign languages and cultures. The article also touches upon the issues of linguistic lexicography aimed at compiling dictionaries, which explain the culture-specific meanings of its units. The authors give a survey of a culturally-oriented dictionary of Russian language and culture for the citizens of Mongolia where the material will be presented on a comparative basis. The core of dictionaries of this kind will be the Value System as a linguocognitive phenomenon. The idea is illustrated by the analysis of the semantics of three basic human values: health, family and education. The research provides an opportunity to state both similarities and differences in the meaning of the verbalized value orientations in the Russian and Mongolian languages and cultures. The analysis allows us to emphasize the significance of mapping the dynamics of the linguistic worldview as part of the ethnic mentality, which reflects both its cognitive and emotional components. The research develops basic postulates of cognitive linguistics, cultural linguistics, intercultural communication and culture studies.

AB  - In this work, we aim to establish a framework for short term updates to the existing landcover maps to quickly enable efficient planning and monitoring. This paper presents the work on updating the land cover classification maps in the region of Abu Dhabi, UAE. Experiments are carried out using temporal images acquired from Worldview-2 satellite in 2014 and 2016. In the proposed approach, we first perform an automatic change detection using statistical methods such as principal component analysis. Then we make use of Random Forest algorithm applied on the Fully-Connected features obtained from AlexNet framework using the inputs from un-changed locations. The training labels are generated using the baseline maps. Eventually, our aim is to develop a robust classification approach based on automatic change detection to update the baseline maps in short time intervals.

AB  - The evolution behind Agriculture 4.0 relies on the intelligent use of data collected by using advanced technologies mounted on board of tractors, mobile ground robots, unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites. Today a field could be monitored over a season owing to data acquired by using drones and satellite with different spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. Data are used in precision agriculture scenarios to monitor the growth, detect the presence of weeds, identify areas affected by nitrogen/water stress but the common factor is the high demand for updated data. This paper evaluates different data-sources as Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, PlanetScope and UAV on a test-site characterized by areas that have different vigour considering different agronomic management thesis. A comparison over the sub-areas by using different approach enables the understanding of how these heterogeneous data-sources could work together also supporting the decision of agronomists. The evaluation shows that data acquired at a close time could be compared but there are some potential issues that require attention in post-processing as the geometric accuracy to ensure a proper coregistration and georeferencing.

AB  - In this study, we propose a vegetation index for compact polarimetric (CP) SAR data (CpRVI) using a geodesic distance between two Kennaugh matrices projected on a unit sphere, as given in Ratha et. al. This distance is utilized to compute a similarity measure between the observed Kennaugh matrix and the Kennaugh matrix of an isotropic depolarizer. The proposed vegetation index is compared with the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) obtained from RADARSAT-2 full-polarimetric SAR data. We use a time series of simulated compact-pol SAR data (RH-RV) obtained from the RADARSAT-2 data acquired during the SMAPVEX16-MB campaign over the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Manitoba, Canada to assess the proposed vegetation index. Among the various crops grown in this region, only the growth stages of soybean are analyzed in this work. The temporal trend of CpRVI follows the growth stages of soybean. Regression analysis shows that CpRVI correlates better with the Plant Area Index (PAI) and Vegetation Water Content (VWC) than RVI.

The main reason of subsidence in Iran is groundwater overuse which if not managed correctly, it causes irreparable damages. Therefore, the first step in solving this problem is identification of subsidence areas and estimating the rate which will have a significant role in controlling this phenomenon. One of the most suitable methods of identification of subsidence is using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)technique. This method is superior to other detection T in terms of cost, precision, extent of the study area and time and it can provide an accurate estimate of the area. In this research, zone of the Rafsanjan plain has been investigated between 2006 and 2010. In order to calculate subsidence rate, SAR data related to the ASAR sensor in C-band and ALOS PALSAR in L-band were used. Generalized linear models in C-band and L-band with values of 0.91 and 0.89 and RMSE coefficient of 0.37 and 0.61 represented a strong linear relationship. Also the relationship between subsidence and the changes in piezometric levels (groundwater extraction) in the study area showed that for each 4.7 centimeters groundwater level decrease, there has been one centimeter subsidence.

AB  - We present an interactive HPC framework for coupled fire and weather simulations. The system is suitable for urgent simulations and forecast of wildfire propagation and smoke. It does not require expert knowledge to set up and run the forecasts.The core of the system is a coupled weather, wildland fire, fuel moisture, and smoke model, running in an interactive workflow and data management system. The system automates job setup, data acquisition, preprocessing, and simulation on an HPC cluster. It provides animated visualization of the results on a dedicated mapping portal in the cloud, and as GIS files or Google Earth KML files. The system also serves as an extensible framework for further research, including data assimilation and applications of machine learning to initialize the simulations from satellite data.

TI  - Application of land-use/land cover changes in monitoring and projecting forest biomass carbon loss in Pakistan
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Located at the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains, subtropical and moist temperate forests of Pakistan are very rich in flora and fauna. However, due to increased illegal and uncontrolled harvesting of wood, agricultural activities, and urbanization, these forests are fast disappearing. The recent expansion of human activities resulting illegal and uncontrolled harvesting, agricultural activities, and urbanization is a cause for concern. Using Landsat imagery, Markov Chain and Cellular Automata, this study focused on the quantitative assessment of spatiotemporal land use and land cover changes during 1998, 2008, 2018 and a simulation of 2028. In addition, a forest inventory survey of biomass and carbon sink were respectively calculated for these subtropical broad-leaved evergreen, subtropical chirpine and moist temperate forests. Results showed biomass was 560.56 +/- 104.33 Mg ha(-1), 350.95 +/- 104.33 Mg ha(-1) and 153.63 +/- 104.33 Mg ha(-1) in moist temperate, subtropical chirpine and subtropical broad-leaved forests respectively. Meanwhile, carbon was 313.94 +/- 44.78 Mg C ha(-1), 221.34 +/- 44.78 Mg C ha(-1) and 131.77 +/- 44.78 Mg C ha(-1) in moist temperate, subtropical chirpine and subtropical broad-leaved forests respectively. During the study period, land-use and land cover changes showed forest land changed from 40936.77 ha to 36709.23 ha, agricultural land from 4220.46 to 10374.64 ha, and built-up area from 1497.60 to 5395.12 ha. The average annual biomass and carbon loss were respectively 50.34 Gg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 31.33 Gg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The information derived from this study could assist in the development of appropriate sustainable forest management policies in Pakistan. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this context. The investigation of techniques related to remote sensing becomes very important because it provide important information about the Earth's surface. Currently, segmentation is an essential step in applications that make use of satellite images.

Using the index we measure the characteristics of the segmentation and corroborate them with the final visual results. Therefore, we conclude that the addition of this new term allows balancing the elements for each group. As a result we conclude that the new term organizes the elements better because it avoids a fast convergence of the algorithm. Finally, the results show that this new factor generates clusters with lower entropy and greater similarity between the elements.

AB  - The stress-induced additional microwave emission of rock is of great importance and potentialities for studying geo-hazards and monitoring thermal anomalies in seismic prone zones with satellite remote sensing. Many laboratory experiments have illustrated obvious variation of microwave emission in process of rock loading to fracturing, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. By using a C-band microwave radiometer (6.9 GHz) and an open end resonant probe, the variations of microwave brightness temperature (MBT) and microwave dielectric property of rock specimens being axially compressively loaded are experimentally investigated, respectively. The experimental results show 1) the MBT of rock specimen increase obviously with increasing loads at elastic deformation stage; 2) the dielectric constants of rock specimens decreases by 0.03 similar to 0.05 with increasing compressive stress, of which the induced variations of MBT is basically consistent with the results from MBT observations. Therefore the alteration of rock microwave dielectric permittivity at elastic deformation stage is presented to be the basic mechanism of rock microwave emissivity change, and thus lead to the variation of rock MBT. This study provides an electromagnetic base for analyzing stress-induced rock microwave emission and for monitoring crust stress filed alteration process (such as in process of tectonic earthquake preparation) using satellite microwave remote sensing data.

AB  - Image segmentation is widely used in image processing, particularly when there is one or few objects of interest. The segmentation of multi-spectral remote sensing images is more challenging due to the large number and diversity of the objects of interest, and the difficulty in having ground truth to tune the segmentation algorithm parameters and to evaluate the results produced. The Synthetic Image TEsting Framework (SITEF) is a tool to address these issues. As the shape and location of the objects in a synthetic image are known, it provides references to be used for quantitative evaluation of the segmentation results. This paper presents SITEF with an experiment to evaluate the segmentation of a SENTINEL-2 image using the software SNAP.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is becoming a popular choice when acquiring fine spatial resolution images for precision agriculture applications. Compared to other remote sensing data collection platforms, UAS can acquire image data at relatively lower cost with finer spatial resolution with more flexible schedule. In recent years, multispectral sensors that can capture near infrared (NIR) and red edge spectral reflectance have been successfully integrated with UAS, and it is offering more versatility in soil and field analysis, crop monitoring, and plant health assessment. In this study, we aim to investigate the capability of UAS-based crop monitoring system to determine the best management practices for 3 different tomato varieties comparing different planting dates, plant density, use of plastic mulch and fertilization rate. The field and UAS data were acquired during Spring 2016, 2017, and 2018 located in Weslaco, TX. To compare the effect of various treatments in cropping systems, physiological parameters and vegetation indexes (Canopy Cover, Canopy Height, Canopy Volume and Excess Greenness) were extracted from red, green, blue (RGB) data and correlated with final yield data to evaluate practice/treatment to maximize tomato yield. During Spring 2016, we observed highest yield from the early March planting date using white plastic mulch. The results also indicated that the variety yielded higher presented a slow canopy decay towards the end of the season. In Spring 2017, there were differences in yield among the three tomato varieties depending on the fertilization rate, DRP-8551 performed better at low nitrogen level, Mykonos performed better on the two higher nitrogen rates and TAM-Hot-Ty had no significant difference among treatments. Finally, during Spring 2018, it was observed that early March produced the best yields and varieties that were able to slow canopy decay towards the end of season performed better. No significant difference was observed between plant density. It is expected that proposed system can be used to collect reliable data and develop variety and environment specific management practices to increase marketable yield and reduce production cost.

AB  - This investigation affords a novel work in four-dimensional (4-D) reconstruction of the Nepal Earthquake deformation the usage of interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). To this end, the established InSAR techniques are carried out to two repeat passes of Sentinel-1 an images data. Additional, the four-dimensional phase unwrapping is carried out the usage of Flynn's algorithm, four-dimensional best-path avoiding singularity loops (4-DBPASL) algorithm and Pareto ant colony algorithm. The results expose that the Pareto ant colony algorithm achieved precisely in contrast to Flynn's algorithm, four-dimensional best-path avoiding singularity loops (4-DBPASL) algorithm. In conclusion, assimilation of the Pareto ant colony algorithm with 4-DBPASL phase unwrapping produce precisely 4-D surface distortion owing to Nepal earthquake.

AB  - This work presents a new approach for geological copper mining detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In doing so, such an optimization algorithm of Particle Swarm is implemented with involving TanDEM -X satellite data. TanDEM-X with high-resolution spotlight mode of 1 m resolution and X-band with HH polarization are used. The four-dimensional view is reconstructed based on 3-D data obtained from TanDEM-X satellite data and 4-D phase unwrapping algorithm. The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used with a 4-D phase unwrapping algorithm. The study shows that the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to optimize the 4-D reconstruction of copper mineralization after 2000 iterations with RMSE of 0.23. In conclusion, the Particle Swarm Optimization can be used as an automatic tool to monitor the copper mineralization. Further, 4-D visualization using TanDEM-X satellite can be achieved by involving PSO in the 4-D phase unwrapping.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The novelty of this study is the use of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for the automatic detection of hydrodynamic turbulent boundaries overlying coral reefs. The procedure is implemented using sequences of Flock-1 satellite data acquired in the Red Sea. The study demonstrates that implementing Pareto-optimal solutions allows for the generation of accurate coral reef-water interface patterns. This is validated by a Pareto-optimal front and the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Pareto-optimal front indicates a significant relationship between hydrodynamic turbulent boundaries, macroalgae, and coral reefs. The ROC curves confirm the finding of the Pareto-optimal front that hydrodynamic turbulent boundary layers and macroalgae are caused by coral reefs. The performance accuracy is identified with an under-curve area of 90%. In conclusion, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm has the applicability for the automatic detection of hydrodynamic turbulent boundary layers to coral reef studies.

TI  - Electrodes Based on Zeolites Modified with Cobalt and/or Molybdenum for Pesticide Degradation. Part I: Physicochemical Characterization and Efficiency of the Electrodes for O<sub>2</sub> Reduction and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production
T2  - ELECTROCATALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the purpose of obtaining inexpensive electrodes for the degradation of organic pesticides by the electro-Fenton reaction, the required H2O2 being obtained by the 2-electron reduction of dissolved O-2, we have prepared glassy carbon electrodes coated with a mixture of graphite with Mo- and/or Co-modified zeolites. Three zeolites were used, Linde type A (ZA), Faujasite (ZY), and MFI (ZSM5), whose maximum possible cation exchange, directly given by the Al/Si ratio, and their hydrophilicity increases in the order ZSM5 < ZY < ZA. The zeolites were modified with Mo and/or Co by the wet impregnation method and characterized by different techniques. The outer surfaces of the three Mo-modified zeolites showed Mo-containing grains (in ZA) or needles (in ZY and ZSM5), which could be largely washed away with hot water. Electrodes were made by depositing on a disc of glassy carbon (GC) a mixture of graphite, zeolite, and a binder. Quite unexpectedly, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the three Mo-modified zeolites showed at least five pairs of anodic-cathodic peaks, which we assume are due to the presence of the Mo7O246- isopolyoxomolybdate anion, proceeding from the impregnating solution, and anchored on the zeolites' surface. With a rotating ring-disc electrode, the highest efficiency for H2O2 production at -0.2V(RHE), namely, 12.7%, was obtained with the GC/graphite-(CoMo-exchanged ZA) electrode, but this efficiency decreased with time. On the contrary, the three zeolites modified only with Mo were stable in 4-h electrolyses at -0.2V(RHE) and yielded the highest H2O2 concentrations, which we attribute to the Mo7O246- isopolyoxomolybdate anchored on the zeolites. The H2O2 yield was the same for the three Mo-modified zeolites, irrespective of their exchange capacity and hydrophobic/hydrophilic character.

AB  - The plant communities of the sea coasts are formed in the specific conditions of the natural environment. Denudation processes on the sea coast have significant impact to the development of cliff vegetation. This paper presents the results of studies of plant communities' characteristics on the intensively denudated Black Sea coast. There are four main ecotopes marked by the nature of denudation processes and substrate. Seventy seven plant species are detected at the sea cliff of Tuapkhat massif during geobotanical study.July 6, 2012 on the Black Sea coast near Gelendzhik the extreme storm rainfalls took place. Numerous landslides and landfalls were noted on the coast as a result of rain. The most damaged by denudation sites were identified by analyzing of satellite image series (WorldView-2, WorldView-3, GeoEye-1, Pleiades-1). At the second stage, surveys were carried out from the drone, followed by the construction of digital earth models (DEM) and orthophotoplans for test sites. Field geobotanical investigations at the test sites were performed. It is determined that the distribution of landslide cones is irregular. In total the 20 large landslides with a volume more than 100 m(3) were noted. In the course of our research, a significant effect of the past natural extreme phenomenon to the plant communities on the coast was noted. After the extreme rainfall, the new ecotope was formed by landslide bodies. This ecotope is characterized by increased species diversity.

AB  - Retained objects are the most frequent harmful error in US hospitals. Central venous catheter insertion requires the use of a guidewire, which the clinician can forget to remove during the procedure. The guidewire can move into the circulation and to the heart and must be retrieved by an invasive surgical procedure, causing upto 20% mortality. Checklists alone depend upon a robust safety culture at all times, with all individuals, in all circumstances and so are only moderately robust and have been shown to fail in complex and disparate healthcare systems. An engineered solution (WireSafe (TM)), forces the clinician to remove a guidewire before they are able to access the equipment required to complete the procedure, this makes this error all but impossible. The WireSafe (TM) also has design features which facilitates the speed and safety of the routine task which is important when dealing with rare but catastrophic events.

AB  - Landsat 9 is currently under development as a joint effort between NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Landsat 9 is largely a rebuild of Landsat 8 and has the same two sensors, an Operational Land Imager (OLI) and a Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS). The OLI-2 on Landsat 9, being built by Ball Aerospace, has completed its pre-launch characterization and calibration and is scheduled to be delivered in the summer of 2019. The TIRS-2, with improved stray light performance and increased redundancy for improved reliability, is being built by Goddard Space Flight Center. TIRS-2 is undergoing testing through Spring 2019 and is also scheduled for summer 2019 delivery. Several improvements to the characterization of both instruments have been incorporated into the testing plan, including improved spectral and radiometric characterization. The instruments will then be integrated onto the spacecraft being built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems (NGIS). The mission is targeted to launch as early as December 2020 on an Atlas V.

CL  - Funchal, PORTUGAL
AB  - A linear statistic Fy, where F is an f x n matrix, is called linearly sufficient for estimable parametric function K beta under the model M = {y, X beta, V}, if there exists a matrix A such that AFy is the BLUE for K beta. In this paper we consider some particular aspects of the linear sufficiency in the partitioned linear model where X = (X-1 : X-2) with beta being partitioned accordingly. We provide new results and new insightful proofs for some known facts, using the properties of relevant covariance matrices and their expressions via certain orthogonal projectors. Particular attention will be paid to the situation under which adding new regressors (in X-2) does not affect the linear sufficiency of Fy.

TI  - RELIGIOUS ARGUMENTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN THE POLISH SEJM OF THE 8TH TERM. A THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL STUDY
T2  - PRZEGLAD SEJMOWY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the issue of using religious arguments by deputies while considering bills at the sitting of the Sejm. The author critically assesses the so-called doctrine of exclusivism, which postulates a total exclusion of religious arguments from political discourse. Next, he justifies the thesis that appealing to religious reasons by deputies in the course of parliamentary work is not contrary to the constitutional principle of worldview impartiality of public authorities. Finally, based on the empirical study, he presents quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the operationalization of religious rhetoric in the legislative process in the Sejm of the 8th term. It turns out that MPs of all political groups appeal to religious arguments and they do it rather seldom. The state of affairs in which members of liberal and leftist parties themselves - identifying themselves with postulates of the exclusivist doctrine and even regarding them as a legal requirement - use religious argumentation, testifies to their political opportunism and ideological interpretation of the constitutional principle of religious impartiality of public authorities. The author postulates the avoidance of instrumental treatment of religion in the political debate.

AB  - Remote sensing of coastal areas requires multispectral satellite images with high spatial resolution. In this sense, WorldView-2 is a very high resolution satellite, which provides an advanced multispectral sensor with eight narrow bands, allowing the proliferation of new environmental monitoring and mapping applications in shallow coastal ecosystems. The problem of estimating water depths using a radiative model has yielded good results as it considers the physical phenomena of water absorption-backscattering and the relationship between the albedo of the seafloor and the reflectivity of the shallow waters. The sophisticated model developed and evaluated in this study expands the ratio algorithm model allowing for the increased amount of information provided in WorldView-2 imagery to be included in the retrieval of water depth of shallow coastal waters.

TI  - Land-cover classification in the Bananal island region using PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 multi-temporal images
T2  - CONFINS-REVUE FRANCO-BRESILIENNE DE GEOGRAPHIE-REVISTA FRANCO-BRASILEIRA DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-use and land-cover map is fundamental for environmental planning, management, and conservation. Remote sensing data is the information basis for the development of such maps, providing speed and cost-effectiveness. In the Amazon region, the constant presence of cloud cover and smoke makes the use of radar images more adequate for operating independently of these barriers. The present research aims to propose a methodology to classify land use and coverage from PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 multitemporal images in the region of Bananal island. The Bananal island is the second largest fluvial island in the world with approximately 750 km long and 100 km wide. The study area is in the confluence between the Javaes and Araguaia rivers, located in the middle Araguaia river basin. The methodology adopted considers the following steps: acquisition of four multitemporal images Palsar 2/ALOS 2 at processing level 1.5 (L band with resolution of 6.25 meters); (b) Probability Density Component Analysis (PDCA); (c) noise reduction using the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation; and (d) classification by the Support Vector Machine method considering the temporal signatures. The ACDP and MNF combination allowed the formulation of different features that describe the different classes present in the image. Comparatively, the images were processed using the Gamma adaptive filter and the SVM classifier. The Kappa coefficient results were 0.62 on the SVM/CDP-MNF images and 0.57 on the SVM / Gamma images. The main factor for the decrease of the Kappa coefficient was the confusion between the areas of Savana Rupestre and anthropic use (pasture) in the areas adjacent to the Bananal island

AB  - Spectral information provided by multispectral and hyperspectral sensors has a great impact on remote sensing studies. These sensors are embedded in aircrafts and satellites like the Landsat, which has more data freely available but lack the spatial resolution that suborbital sensors have. To increase the spatial resolution, a series of techniques have been developed like pansharpenning data fusion and more advanced convolutional neural networks for super-resolution, however, the later requires large datasets. To overcome this requirement, this work aims to increase the spatial resolution of Landsat spectral bands using artificial neural networks that uses pixel kernels of a single high-resolution image from Google Earth. Using this method, the high-resolution spectral bands were generated with pixel size of lm in contrast to the 15m of pansharpenned Landsat bands. The evaluate the predicted spectral bands the validation measures Universal Quality Index (UQI) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) were used, showing values of 0.98 and 0.16 respectively, presenting good results.

AB  - In this paper I propose a method to solve controversies in scenarios of legal pluralism. Shortly, in scenarios of legal pluralism some of the controversies involve members of culturally differentiated groups who justify their allegations with arguments that only make sense in the culture to which they belong. If the adjudicator does not share the same cultural worldview as the parts under litigation, how can he/she come to make a decision determining the parties' rights and obligations? My answer for this question includes (1) an account of knowledge to culturally differentiated groups, and (2) a method for the evaluation of the culturally-dependent arguments.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present the developed automatic procedure for generation of true orthoimages from very high-resolution satellite images. True orthoimages are an improved version of traditional orthoimages as they are adjusted also for high objects (e.g. high buildings). The automatic workflow encompasses various modules, starting from the extraction of ground control points, through the geometric processing of image blocks, orthorectification and finally generation of true orthoimages. The orthorectification procedure uses a high-resolution digital surface model derived from laser scanning data. The paper presents the results of the geometric correction and the creation of true orthoimages as an important spatial data that can be used directly by end-users.

AB  - We present a flexible methodology to identify forest loss in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) L-hand ALOS/PALSAR images. Instead of single pixel analysis, we generate spatial segments (i.e., superpixels) based on local image statistics to track homogeneous patches of forest across a time-series of ALOS/PALSAR images. Forest loss detection is performed with Support Vector Machines (SVMs)trained on local radar backscatter features derived within superpixels. This method is applied to time-series of ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 radar images over a boreal forest within the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve in Quebec. We evaluate four spatial arrangements including 1) single pixels, 2) square grid cells, 3) superpixels based on segmentation of the radar images, and 4) superixels derived from ancillary optical imagery (e.g. Landsat), Detection of forest loss with superpixels outperform single pixel and regular grid methods, especially when superpixels are generated from ancillary optical imagery. Results are validated with official Quebec forestry data and Hansen forest loss products. Our results indicate that this approach may be applied operationally to monitor forests across large study areas with L-band radar instruments such as ALOS/PALSAR.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Echinococcus multilocularis (Em), a highly pathogenic parasitic tapeworm, is responsible for a significant burden of human disease. In this study, optical and time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is used synergistically to model key land cover characteristics driving the spatial distributions of two small mammal intermediate host species, Ellobius tancrei and Microtus gregalis, which facilitate Em transmission in a highly endemic area of Kyrgyzstan. (2) Methods: A series of land cover maps are derived from (a) single-date Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery, (b) time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data, and (c) Landsat OLI and time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data in combination. Small mammal distributions are analyzed in relation to the surrounding land cover class coverage using random forests, before being applied predictively over broader areas. A comparison of models derived from the three land cover maps are made, assessing their potential for use in cloud-prone areas. (3) Results: Classification accuracies demonstrated the combined OLI-SAR classification to be of highest accuracy, with the single-date OLI and time-series SAR derived classifications of equivalent quality. Random forest analysis identified statistically significant positive relationships between E. tancrei density and agricultural land, and between M. gregalis density and water and bushes. Predictive application of random forest models identified hotspots of high relative density of E. tancrei and M. gregalis across the broader study area. (4) Conclusions: This offers valuable information to improve the targeting of limited-resource disease control activities to disrupt disease transmission in this area. Time-series SAR derived land cover maps are shown to be of equivalent quality to those generated from single-date optical imagery, which enables application of these methods in cloud-affected areas where, previously, this was not possible due to the sparsity of cloud-free optical imagery.

AB  - ContextThe heterogeneous mosaic nature of African savannah vegetation is a key aspect of its ecology. This study evaluates mosaic distributions and characteristics across sub-Saharan Africa, investigating the environmental drivers of mosaic formation.ObjectivesThis study was designed to determine: (1) on a continental scale, how frequent are mosaics in savannahs? and (2) what are the key environmental drivers in the formation of mosaics?MethodsLandsat ETM+ satellite imagery was used to generate land-cover maps for 39 sample areas across sub-Saharan Africa. The spatial complexity of land-cover mosaics at 4628 savannah sub-sites was quantified, and modelled using random forests to identify the relative importance of environmental variables driving mosaic presence.ResultsOnly six sub-sites constituted a single land-cover class, illustrating that mosaic habitats are abundant at the scale analysed (19.6km(2)), although mosaic characteristics varied considerably. Results indicate precipitation is most important in influencing mosaic complexity, followed by evapotranspiration, temperature, lithology and distance to rivers. Fire and ecosystem engineer presence are of lesser importance at this study scale.ConclusionsMosaics are ubiquitous in the African savannahs studied, their presence influenced by multiple environmental drivers, with water being key. The lower importance of fire and large mammal disturbance is likely resulting from these highly individualistic site-based process varying between sites, resulting in no single, coherent, across-Africa disturbance signal, and/or lack of detail in available data at this scale. Therefore, large-scale determinants of savannah mosaics appear climate-driven. Under future global warming scenarios, African savannahs are likely to become more homogenous.

TI  - Snow cover in Hawai'i (1893-1953) and its effect on ground temperature
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow occasionally falls on the highest mountains of tropical Hawai'i: Maunakea, Maunaloa, Haleakala, and Hualalai. We digitized and analyzed monthly Weather Bureau records of snow in Hawai'i from 1893 to 1972. In the half-century 1901-1950, Maunakea had an estimated average of one month of snow cover per year. Snow was especially abundant from 1922 to 1940, but was relatively rare from 1908 to 1921. Snow cover may play a role in the formation and preservation of permafrost. MODIS satellite data are used to measure the albedo of the snow surface as a function of its age. Following winters with snow, the ground temperature at 1 m depth is lower than after a winter without significant snow cover, and hence snow cover favors permafrost conditions.

TI  - Assimilating satellite sea-surface salinity data from SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP into a global ocean forecasting system
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring Sea-Surface Salinity (SSS) from space is a relatively recent technique that relies on L-band radiometry that has evolved to a point where useful information is provided every few days. The impact of assimilating satellite SSS data is investigated using the global FOAM ocean forecasting system. This system assimilates daily satellite SSS products from the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), NASA Aquarius and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions equatorward of 40 degrees N/S, in addition to other observing systems. The data are assimilated using a 3D-Var scheme that includes an observation bias correction scheme to estimate spatially and temporally varying bias estimates for each SSS satellite.The SSS assimilation is tested over 2 years and 3 months covering the 2015/2016 El Nino with assessment focussed on the tropical regions, particularly in the Pacific. Consistent reductions in root-mean-square errors are found in all tropical regions from each of the satellite SSS datasets. The largest improvements of up to about 8%. are found in the tropical Pacific from assimilating both the SMOS and SMAP datasets together. The largest impact is in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) i n the central Pacific during 2015 and early 2016 where the surface salinity is reduced by about 0.03 pss on average, correcting for too little precipitation. A smaller magnitude, large-scale reduction in the SSS is also seen in the tropical Pacific that increases the modelled surface stratification and leads to reduced vertical mixing. Changes to the SSS in the ITCZ lead to changes in the meridional gradients of SSS that affects the sea surface height and surface currents, both of which are improved in the SMOS assimilation experiment compared to externally produced observation-based datasets. The results suggest that assimilation of SMOS and SMAP satellite data is now of an appropriate quality for operational implementation.

TI  - Modelling temporal variation of fire-occurrence towards the dynamic prediction of human wildfire ignition danger in northeast Spain
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Models of human-caused ignition probability are typically developed from static or structural points of view. This research analyzes the intra-annual dimension of fire occurrence and fire-triggering factors in NE Spain and moves forward towards more accurate predictions. Applying the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) and using wildfire data (2008-2011) and GIS and remote sensing data for the explanatory variables, we construct eight occurrence data scenarios by splitting wildfire records into the four seasons and then separating each season into working and non-working days. We assess model accuracy using a cross-validation k-fold procedure and an operational validation with 2012 data. Results report a substantial contribution of accessibility across models, often coupled with Land Surface Temperature. In addition, we observe great temporal variability, with WAI strongly influencing winter models, whereas distance to roads stands out during working days. Model performances stand consistently above 0.8 AUC in all temporal scenarios, with outstanding predictive effectiveness during summer months. The comparison among static-to-dynamic approaches reveals superior performance of simulations considering temporal scenarios, with AUC values from 0.7 to 0.85. Overall, we believe our approach is reliable enough to derive dynamic predictions of human-caused fire occurrence.

AB  - Urban spatial segregation in developing countries is related to the social and economic differences of its population. This study presents an index of urban spatial segregation based on socioenvironmental and demographic data and performs statistical tests to evaluate its consistency. The index is presented with values between 0 and 1, with the highest values indicative of greater urban spatial segregation, thematic classes were derived and mapped at the level of census tracts based on data from the Brazilian census of 2010 and from images of Sentinel 2A and 3 to the urban areas of Uberlandia. The result shows less segregation indices in the South and high indices in the Southeast, North and West portions of the urban spot. The variables of urban infrastructure, economic and demographic conditions explain the groupings of the less segregated classes, on the other hand, the more segregated classes are directly influenced by the income variable. It was concluded that the urban spot shows a behavior of urban segregation of the center-periphery model and that the developed index presented a pattern of consistency.

TI  - From Spirituality Everything is Connected: Revolutions for Living with Equity and Eco-justice
T2  - FEMINIST THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Everything is connected, from galaxies to the smallest particles in our bodies. We need an interpretation of reality that allows us to see the whole as well as the Whole. This new view is a holistic spirituality that experiences God in the whole of life. It is necessary to make an effort to abandon elements that contaminate global life, because they originate in an anthropology of power-submission, man-woman, human-nature, consumption-participation, exploitation-cooperation horizontal ellipsis that justifies the exploitation of nature and of human beings. We need to move from the devouring anthropocentrism we live in to a life-centred worldview. This article reflects on reality as an organic whole, the body of God. Reality is a creative, collective, dynamic and diverse 'body' that we must care for with equity and eco-justice. Our actions must be oriented towards the practice of God's justice in the bodies and lives of women. Thus, we will recover the balance of this world.

AB  - This contribution presents preliminary results of a 1.8-m reflectarray antenna proposed to generate a complete multi-spot coverage for transmission in broadband satellite communications in Ka-band. The antenna is designed according to a recently validated design method of reflectarrays which allows to produce four adjacent beams per feed by discriminating simultaneously in frequency and polarization. The simulations consider 27 dual-polarized feeds to illuminate the reflectarray, so the 1.8-m reflectarray is expected to generate 108 beams separated 0.56 degree at two frequencies and two polarizations. The concept enables a reduction in the number of antennas and feeds required on board geostationary communication satellites to provide multi-spot coverages in Ka-band.

AB  - This contribution proposes the use of single and dual reflectarray configurations to provide multi-spot coverage in Ka-band from a geostationary satellite, using a smaller number of apertures and feeds than conventional reflector systems. First, a 1.8-m parabolic reflectarray antenna has been designed to produce multiple spot beams through the generation of two beams per feed in orthogonal circular polarization (CP) at Tx and Rx frequencies. Moreover, a dual RA configuration has been designed to produce two spot beams in orthogonal CP from a single feed in dual linear polarization (LP). The simulated results are compared for the two designed antennas, showing the feasibility of both configurations and their potential to be used for multiple beam applications in Ka-band.

CL  - Krakow, POLAND
AB  - This contribution studies the use of bifocal dual reflectarray antennas to provide multi-spot coverage from a geostationary satellite operating in Ka-band. A general 3D bifocal technique has been applied to design a multi-beam dual reflectarray antenna in an offset compact-range configuration, considering three different degrees of beam spacing compression (high, low and no compression) with respect to the equivalent monofocal antenna. The results of the design (bifocal phase distributions, radiation patterns, etc.) have been compared for the three cases under study. The use of suitable reflectarray cells will allow to produce independent beams in each polarization (two beams per feed), so that the bifocal antenna will provide adjacent beams in orthogonal polarizations with 0.56 degrees angular spacing.

AB  - Sandwich Town Neck Beach in Sandwich, MA, has experienced substantial erosion and has been the subject of efforts by the town and private landowners to limit the sand loss. Erosion has been particularly dramatic in the past five years with the loss of dwellings. Sandwich's nourishment efforts presented a unique opportunity for scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center to monitor beach morphology and to test new technologies and techniques such as geo-referenced drone imaging. Two bottom lander deployments were performed in Cape Cod Bay at a location that was key to model the fate of waves at Sandwich Town Neck Beach and to support the study of beach morphological evolution. The study period was after the town nourished the beach and during a time when several intense winter storms reshaped the beach and removed much of the nourished sand.A TRDI Workhorse Sentinel V ADCP was used for both deployments. For wave bursts, the instruments collected 2048 samples at 2 Hz every hour. The first deployment during the winter of 2016 returned good quality data. The second deployment during the following winter had gaps throughout the time series from a wiring problem in the external battery pack. The timing of the gaps was random, the duration approximately 100 s. While most of the bursts started at the top of each hour, many had 1-3 gaps within.Time series data with random gaps are problematic for computing spectral density, and thus, wave statistics. This kind of situation is familiar in other scientific disciplines such as astrophysics [1], where techniques exist to find stationary signals in sparse data. One of these methods is the Lomb-Scargle technique for computing periodograms. The most useful feature of the Lomb-Scargle (LS) method is that it allows the spectral analysis of incomplete records, without having to manipulate the record to extrapolate from or replace missing data.We compared the effectiveness of LS against common methods of averaging Fourier transforms such as a simple un-windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Welch's method, and TRDI's Wavesmon software; methods that are commonly used in oceanography for non-gappy data. Synthetic data series that have been artificially modified to introduce gaps were used to evaluate the performance of each method. The LS approach was able to recover spectral density even with several 100-s gaps present. The method was applied here to the gappy and non-gappy data from both Sandwich deployments, and wave statistics were obtained and compared to the wave-buoy data. LS was used to process data that contains gaps that was rejected by Wavesmon, which was approximately 39% of the dataset. Significant wave height and peak period from LS compared well with buoy data. Mean period computed on gappy data using LS produced values biased low, compared with other methods when gaps were filled with the mean value. The LS technique has potential to uncover low-frequency signals such as infragravity waves from gappy records where the non-gappy segments are not long enough to resolve them. It has potential to unlock new information from older data sets.

TI  - Meaning-Making Trajectories of Resilience in Narratives of Adolescents with Multiple Sclerosis
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To date few studies deepen the construct of meaning-making at the base on the resilience process for adolescent with multiple sclerosis. Starting from a mixed-method of analysis our aim is to fill the gap in the literature by qualitatively exploring the narrative articulation of meaning-making processes highlighting specificities and differences within groups of narratives with high/medium/low resilience measured through the CYRM-28. We collected 29 narratives. The qualitative analysis shows five meaning-making processes at the base of the resilience process: Dependence vs Autonomy; Reconstruction of the time lines; Integration of limits; Enlarging personal assumptive worldview; Connecting emotions and thought. Compared to narratives with low/high scores, differences were evident in the way such processes were articulated. We propose a framework of central issues in the lives of adolescents with multiple sclerosis and a way to determine how these issues can be useful for developing practices and trajectories to support resilient processes.

AB  - The WADI project (Water-tightness Airborne Detection Implementation), integrated within the H2020 initiative, is developing an airborne water leak detection surveillance service, based on manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. This service aims to provide water utilities with adequate information on leaks in large water distribution infrastructures outside urban areas. Given the high cost associated with water infrastructure networks repairs, a reliability layer is necessary to improve the trustworthiness of the WADI leak identification procedure, based on complementary technologies for leak detection. Herein, a methodology based on the combined use of Sentinel remote sensing data and a water leak pathways model is presented, based on data-intensive computing. The resulting water leak detection reliability service, provided to the users through a web interface, targets prompt and cost-effective infrastructure repairs with the required degree of confidence on the detected leaks. The web platform allows for both data analysis and visualization of Sentinel images and relevant leak indicators at the sites selected by the user. The user can also provide aerial imagery inputs, to be processed together with Sentinel remote sensing data at the satellite acquisition dates identified by the user. The platform provides information about the detected leaks location and time evolution, and will be linked in the future with the outputs from water pathway models.

TI  - Remote sensing of large reservoir in the drought years: Implications on surface water change and turbidity variability of Sobradinho reservoir (Northeast Brazil)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sobradinho reservoir has been suffering a severe water loss caused by multi-year drought in the Northeast Brazil. This reservoir contributes to the socio-economic development of the semi-arid region, and the monitoring of water shortage is crucial for people living in this climate-vulnerable region. In this study, we evaluate the surface water change and turbidity variability of Sobradinho reservoir during recent drought years (2013-2017). A time-series dataset was created using 109 Landsat-8 OLI images for mapping the water extent in the reservoir. A nonlinear regression between measured turbidity and surface reflectance (red band) was developed and applied for turbidity retrievals. Additionally, we performed a long-term precipitation analysis (17-year) to assess the rainfall deficit over the catchment area. Our results show that the annual precipitation regimes are below the long-term average during 2012-2017 period, except 2013. We also found that negative anomalies occur during 26 out of 36 months between 2014 and 2016, mostly in the rainy season. Since the rainfall regimes and river discharges are the major drivers for water recharge, these drought years have a critical impact on the reservoir level. According to our results, the water surface receded about 2073 km(2) (out of total 3303 km2) during September 2017; this represents a reduction of 62.8% in the total water extent. The surface water change is spatially distinct across the reservoir. For instance, the upper section of the reservoir was almost totally dried during September 2017, and the water coverage was similar to 8% (91.25 km(2) out of 1128 km(2)). Although other sections had a relatively low water change (reduction of similar to 40%), the losses are significant in terms of area (similar to 1035.5 km(2)). The receding of water extent affects the people living near to the reservoir, and local communities are more distant from water (up to 13 km). We also observed that the turbidity is seasonally dependent, and water clarity presents a strong variability between rainy and dry seasons. In general, the turbidity levels vary from clear water (0-20 NTU) during the dry season to turbid condition (> 50 NTU) during the rainy season. A lack of access to clean and safe drinking water in some periods might be harmful to humans, livestock and domestic animals. Finally, this research contributes to the assessment of drought-related impacts in the Sobradinho, the largest reservoir in the Northeast Brazil. The water shortage is a recurring concern in the semi-arid region, and the remote sensing techniques provide spatially explicit information to enhance the livelihood resilience during drought years.

TI  - Combining Unmanned Aerial Systems and Satellite Data to Monitor Phenological Changes in Tropical Forests: A Case Study from Costa Rica
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The migration of vegetation under the influence of climate change is of great interest to ecologists, but can be difficult to quantify-especially in less accessible landscapes. Monitoring land cover change through remote sensing has become the best solution, especially with the use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs; drones) as low-cost remote sensing platforms are able to collect data at high spatial and spectral resolutions. Unfortunately, in the context of climate change studies, the lack of comparative UAS data sets over decadal timescales has been limiting. Here, we describe a technique for the integration of historical, low spatial resolution satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with short-term high-resolution multispectral UAS data to track the vegetation changes in a Costa Rican rainforest over a 33-year time frame. The study reveals the transition of a mixed forest from strongly deciduous to weakly deciduous phenology in the Hacienda Baru National Wildlife Refuge (HBNWR), southwestern Costa Rica. This case study presents an approach for researchers and forest managers to study and track vegetation changes over time in locations that lack detailed historical vegetation data. Vegetation migration due to climate change is not well documented and difficult to monitor, especially in remote or inaccessible locations. This case study presents researchers, students, and forest managers an approach for leveraging freely available satellite imagery and UASs to track these changes over time.

T2  - MUNDO ESLAVO-JOURNAL OF SLAVIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes onomatopoeic syncretism in the Russian language. The study is important due to the anthropocentric approach which nowadays defines the role of the onomatopoeia in the worldview of the Eastern Slavs. Within this approach, the phenomenon of syncretism permits us to observe a more detailed usage of onomatopoeia in the Russian language. In this way, it provides the most complete picture of the present worldview and its perception by the Russian people. The phenomenon of syncretism represents the combination of the features of verbs and onomatopoeic words. These verbs designate the action of instantaneous aspect. Onomatopoeias are words that imitate sounds of nature and the world around the human being, sounds and screams produced by animals, etc. Onomatopoeic syncretic words have a predicate function and at the same time imitate sounds produced during this action. This article studies the main and contextual meanings that can be developed by onomatopoeic syncretic words. This type of word performs different functions in the text: nominative, linguistic, expressive, emotional, communicative, textual, socio-psychological. Due to their high expressive capacity, they are widely used in everyday colloquial speech and in infant literature. Future research may be conducted by comparing this type of onomatopoeia in other Slavic languages or languages from other linguistic family groups.

AB  - Phenotyping via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is of increasing interest for many applications because of their capability to carry advanced sensors and achieve accurate positioning required to collect both high temporal and high spatial resolution data required over relatively limited areas. This paper focuses development of a data analytics based predictive modeling strategy that incorporates multi-sensor data acquisition systems and accommodates environmental inputs. Unsupervised feature learning based on fully connected and convolutional neural networks is investigated. Predictive models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed and implemented to accommodate high dimensional, multi modal, multi-temporal data. Remote sensing data, including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral inputs, as well as weather data, are incorporated in RNN models. Results from multiple experiments focused on high throughput phenotyping of sorghum for biomass predictions are provided and evaluated for agricultural test fields at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) at Purdue University.

AB  - Since the availability of ground data is very sparse, satellite data provides an alternative method to estimate solar irradiation. Satellite data across various spectral bands may be employed to distinguish weather signatures, such as dust, aerosols, fog, and clouds. For a tropical country like India, which is potentially rich in solar energy resources, the study of these parameters is of crucial importance from the perspective of solar energy. Furthermore, a complete utilization of the solar energy depends on its proper integration with power grids. Because of its variable nature, incorporation of photovoltaic energy into electricity grids suffers technical challenges. Solar radiation is subjected to reflection, scattering and absorption by air molecules, clouds, and aerosols in the atmosphere. Clouds can block most of the direct radiation. Modern solar energy forecasting systems rely on real-time Earth observation from the satellite for detecting clouds and aerosols.

AB  - Spatial fire spread models simulate the progression of a wildfire across the land under given meteorological conditions. As such, they can improve the fire-fighting real-time response and the rural planning of fire prone areas. However, fire-spread models require high-resolution information of vegetation, which is often difficult to acquire, as spatially variant growth, but also past fire occurrences impact on the spatial variability of the vegetation. Hence, forests often consist of a patchwork of vegetation in different growth stages, which is impossible to consistently map from the ground. In order to address this problem, the Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) is introduced, here, which is a spatially and temporally continuous proxy for fuel structure derived from Landsat data. Forest age maps are derived by fitting post-fire VSPI time series to an exponential decay curve. The forest age maps derived from VSPI are then used as input into a rate-of-spread model to predict the fire spread of the 2003 Mt Cooke wildfire in Western Australia, as a proof-of-concept.

TI  - The endemic herpetofauna of Central America: a casualty of anthropocentrism
T2  - AMPHIBIAN & REPTILE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The endemic herpetofauna of Central America is of global significance, and currently consists of 623 species, 56.9% of a total herpetofauna of 1,095 species. During the last two years 43 endemic species have been added to this total, and one species has been deleted. The endemic herpetofauna of Central America is distributed unevenly among 10 physiographic regions, ranging from six species in the Yucatan Platform to 254 in the Isthmian Central American highlands. The distributions of close to three quarters of the 623 species are limited to a single physiographic region, and our assessment of their conservation status indicates that about nine-tenths of these species lie within the high vulnerability range of the Environmental Vulnerability Score (EVS). We prioritized the conservation significance of the Central American species by combining the data on physiographic distribution with those of the EVS and recognize 14 priority levels. About eight of every 10 endemic species occupy the first two priority levels, i.e., high vulnerability species limited to one or two physiographic regions. Protecting the endemic component of the Central American herpetofauna is the greatest challenge currently facing conservation professionals working in this region. We conclude that this goal will not be reached until humanity, in general, addresses the issues generated by the widespread adoption of the anthropocentric worldview.

AB  - Training machine learning algorithms for new satellites requires collecting new data. This is a critical drawback for most remote sensing applications and specially for cloud detection. A sensible strategy to mitigate this problem is to exploit available data from a similar sensor, which involves transforming this data to resemble the new sensor data. However, even taking into account the technical characteristics of both sensors to transform the images, statistical differences between data distributions still remain. This results in a poor performance of the methods trained on one sensor and applied to the new one. In this this work, we propose to use the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework to adapt the data from the new satellite. In particular, we use Landsat-8 images, with the corresponding ground truth, to perform cloud detection in Proba-V. Results show that the GANs adaptation significantly improves the detection accuracy.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods cause catastrophic destruction to life and livelihood in South Asia than any other parts of the world. This research assessed long term (2001 to 2015) flood risk at South Asia level using eight-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and subsequently expanded this methodology to identify potential zones for piloting flood index insurance scheme in Bihar, India. Bihar was further assessed for sub-regional segmentation of its 37 districts into four flood risk zones based on k-means clustering and Getis-Ord Gi* analysis of multi-modal dataset consisting of demographics, meteorological, agricultural, flood characteristics and economic loss from floods. Satellite based risk assessment identified parts of Indus basin in Pakistan, Ganges basin in North India and majority of Bangladesh as flood hotspots. Site prioritization for flood index insurance in Bihar identified Madhubani, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi districts as very high flood risk districts by both methods signifying large impact of any potential interventions implemented in these districts.

AB  - ALOS-4 succeeds the concepts of ALOS-2[1] except for improvements in mission performance. ALOS-4 utilizes digital beam forming on receive to improve observation swathwidth [2]. PALSAR-3 on-board ALOS-4 has an on-board digital beam forming processor in order to increase the swathwidth of the 3m resolution Stripmap mode to 200 km. Transmit signal with a wide beam-width in the elevation direction is generated in order to cover the wider swathwidth. The reflected signal from the ground is received by several independent receive channels, which are processed in order to form several antenna patterns. There is an inverse relationship between the beam-width and the antenna length. It is necessary that the antenna length should be short in order to obtain the wide beam-width.One way of downsizing the antenna length is to turn off the Transmit/Receive Modules (TRMs), which are connected to each antenna element of Active Phased Array Antenna (APAA). However, this will cause the NESZ to get worse due to the reduction of transmit power.The phase spoiling technique is utilized to solve this problem. Even with a long antenna, wide beam-width can be obtained with this technique. In this paper, the principle of the phase spoiling technique with various phase distributions and the simulation results applied to APAA installed on ALOS-4 are presented.

AB  - The distribution of ground displacement due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake was obtained from the analysis of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite image and the relationship with damage to the low-pressure gas distribution pipes was investigated. First, we estimated the co-seismic ground displacement with an accuracy of approximately 0.04 m by differential interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) analysis of the PALSAR-2 imagery on the ALOS-2 satellite which observed the affected area before and after the earthquake. Then, we calculated the displacement of the quasi-east-west and the quasi-vertical directions from the combination of two line-of-sight (LOS) displacements estimated from two pair images with different observation conditions and examined the relation with damage ratios of gas distribution pipes. As the results, a correlation between the gradient of the ground displacement and the damage ratio was found and the damage ratio tended to increase as the gradient became larger.

AB  - Satellite data in the thermal infrared range are a powerful source of information for the analysis and determination of city urban area temperature anomalies. The article presents a technique for monitoring the land surface temperature on the basis of combination of "Landsat 8" satellite thermal infrared data with Planet-Scope satellite constellation high resolution data. Such combination of satellite data from several spacecrafts increase the detalization of temperature maps to the level of individual city blocks. Determination of the nature and boundaries of temperature anomalies will help to understand the causes of the unfavorable environmental situation in Krasnoyarsk, where, in addition to high industrial emissions, their influence and atmospheric processes, leading to the fact that impurities are delayed and concentrated over the city. The results shows that the temperature in the places of thermal anomalies is 5-8 higher than the average land surface temperature of the city. Based on the results of the analysis of summer thermal multi-temporal space images, several thermal zones of different nature were outlined on the territory under consideration. This information can be used in planning the development of the city, the design of new urban neighborhoods.

AB  - The conservation of water resources is essential for the sustainable development of rural and urban properties. The objective of this work was the morphometric characterization and the quantification of deforestation in the Rolim de Moura sub-basin. Morphometric characterization was obtained with SRTM. Soil cover was analyzed between 1986 and 2016 with Landsat images. The sub-basin has an area of 2,822.46 km(2), a perimeter of 422.24 km, an average elevation of 245 m, a compactness coefficient of 2.22, a circularity index of 0.19, a sinuosity of 74.92%, a form factor of 0.46, 7th order dendritic drainage pattern, 1.49 km(-2) hydrographic density, 1.62 km km(-2) drainage density and 34.78 h concentration time. There was an increase of the anthropized area from 1986 (35.29%) to 2016 (80.58%). The sub-basin is not subject to flooding, but its extensive anthropic area makes it necessary to recover riparian forests.

AB  - It has been known that the atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) play a major role in shaping up the structure and dynamics of lower, middle and upper atmosphere [1, 2], and relates to various phenomena in the thermosphere. VLF remote sensing is a well-established technique to monitor D-region conditions, including AGWs. We have analyzed various VLF navigation transmitter signals recorded at VLF recording station in North Carolina, USA, called PARI (35.2 N, 82.9 W) for a one-year period from May 2015 to April 2016. The VLF signal (both amplitude and phase) show wave like signature (WLS) in different Transmitter-receiver great circle path (TRGCPs). We have found three event days namely 02 May 2015, 21 January 2016 and 21 April 2016, with periodic variations of 1.2 -3 minutes. One example of observed Wavy signature on VLF transmitter on 21 January 2016 is shown as Figure 1. In general, the period of AGWs is longer than the background oscillations known as Brunt-Vaisala period (BV period) but in the present case observed periods are much lower than the BV periods (similar to 5 minutes). Initial analysis suggests that the probable source of observed WLSs is convective (from lightning discharges/thunderstorm) generated AGWs propagating upward from troposphere. The source regions are identified using lightning location network and satellite data. The more details on the properties and possible source are discussed.

TI  - dtwSat: Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for Satellite Image Time Series Analysis in R
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The opening of large archives of satellite data such as LANDSAT, MODIS and the SENTINELs has given researchers unprecedented access to data, allowing them to better quantify and understand local and global land change. The need to analyze such large data sets has led to the development of automated and semi-automated methods for satellite image time series analysis. However, few of the proposed methods for remote sensing time series analysis are available as open source software. In this paper we present the R package dtwSat. This package provides an implementation of the time-weighted dynamic time warping method for land cover mapping using sequence of multi-band satellite images. Methods based on dynamic time warping are flexible to handle irregular sampling and out-of-phase time series, and they have achieved significant results in time series analysis. Package dtwSat is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contributes to making methods for satellite time series analysis available to a larger audience. The package supports the full cycle of land cover classification using image time series, ranging from selecting temporal patterns to visualizing and assessing the results.

TI  - Decision support framework to identify lakes that are likely to meet water quality targets if external inputs of phosphorus from agriculture are reduced
T2  - LIMNETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - About 40 % of European lakes are failing water quality targets for chemistry that have been set under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). One of the main causes of this problem is excessive inputs of phosphorus (P) to lakes from their catchments, including those from agricultural sources and wastewater treatment works. This study used WFD monitoring data from England and Wales to develop a method of identifying lakes that are failing WFD water quality targets for good status in terms of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and whose problems could be solved by reducing P inputs from agricultural sources. A decision support framework is presented that (1) identifies lakes that are failing to achieve good status due to high TP inputs from agriculture; (2) predicts how in-lake TP concentrations are likely to respond to reduced inputs from agricultural sources, and (3) identifies sites where recovery is likely to be delayed by factors that induce resistance to TP mitigation measures. Through a worked example, we demonstrate how a decision support framework can be used to screen lake WFD monitoring data to identify where expensive restoration measures are likely to be more cost effective. We demonstrate that, in general, reducing the external TP load from agricultural sources would be effective only if introduced as part of a more comprehensive programme of restoration measures targeting other sources of TP, such as waste water treatment works, and taking into account lake-specific factors that affect lake response. The outputs from this decision support framework are designed to enable water managers to identify sites where recovery may be delayed by lake specific biological, chemical or physical characteristics, allowing them to manage expectations of the recovery process better by providing realistic timescales.

TI  - Ice-Gouging Topography of the Exposed Aral Sea Bed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice gouging, or scouring, i.e., ice impact on the seabed, is a well-studied phenomenon in high-latitude seas. In the mid-latitudes, it remains one of the major geomorphic processes in freezing seas and large lakes. Research efforts concerning its patterns, drivers and intensity are scarce, and include aerial and geophysical studies of ice scours in the Northern Caspian Sea. This study aims to explain the origin of the recently discovered linear landforms on the exposed former Aral Sea bottom using remotely sensed data. We suggest that they are relict ice gouges, analogous to the modern ice scours of the Northern Caspian, Kara and other seas and lakes, previously studied by side scan sonar (SSS) surveys. Their average dimensions, from 3 to 90 m in width and from hundreds to thousands of meters in length, and spatial distribution were derived from satellite imagery interpretation and structure from motion-processing of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) images. Ice scouring features are virtually omnipresent at certain seabed sections, evidencing high ice gouging intensity in mid-latitude climates. Their greatest density is observed in the central part of the former East Aral Sea. The majority of contemporary ice gouges appeared during the rapid Aral Sea level fall between 1980 and the mid-1990s. Since then, the lake has almost completely drained, providing a unique opportunity for direct studies of exposed ice gouges using both in situ and remote-sensing techniques. These data could add to our current understanding of the scales and drivers of ice impact on the bottom of shallow seas and lakes.

AB  - The Centre Spatial of Liege (CSL) is involved from more than 10 years in the BTDF/BRRDF metrology of large Lambertian diffusers used for on-board calibration on space instrumentation. In this context, a dedicated automatized BSDF calibration facility has been developed, suitable for calibration of all types of diffusers (from industry to space applications).Accurate calibration of such systems induces constraining requirements on the calibration bench: manipulate large diffusers and mechanisms in class ISO5 environment; incidence beam divergence close to the Sun divergence; large spectral range coverage; measurement of very low diffused signals (highly stable, with low noise, straylight free set-up), high accurate measurement of attenuator and a high knowledge of all calibration properties for BSDF modelling.Based on previous heritage, recent improvements have been implemented in order to correct some defaults like mechanical stabilities (complete new design), specimen alignment (new iterative procedure), absolute error (super stable light bulb, improved filters wheel repeatability, optics to limit diffraction effects in UV, incidence beam non-uniformity compensation.).This paper presents the design of the improved bench, highlights critical parameters for BTDF/BRDF calibration and relates main improvements to reach todays performances. The current bench performances are illustrated by calibration campaigns results performed at CSL for Sentinel 2, Sentinel 3 and Sentinel 4 calibration assemblies.

AB  - The analysis, image recognition, the classification in remote sensing data always up to date is for the insiders a very useful system for the management, planning, protection of our territory. Technological evolution the succession of applications and tools in GIS environment, have refined more and more techniques allowing us to computerize much of the territory bringing an enrichment of geographical data distributed more or less updated, remote sensing, digital orthoimage help us in the areas where the local computerization is not always updated. In this paper I want to demonstrate that an approach based on machine learning applied to territorial analysis using dynamic matrices, provides for the definition of numerical indices assigned to each recognized pattern. The numerical indices will be the elements of recognition where the territorial computerization is insufficient. The data from remote sensing or digital orthoimage are variable matrices where the numerical indices have to express their potential. The goal is to educate the recognition in matrix form to obtain a dynamic topology where the computerization has not been updated.

AB  - All reservoirs are subjected to sedimentation, which disallows to meet the growing needs that reservoirs are intended to serve. Lack of regular and less cumbersome techniques for assessment of sedimentation levels and available capacity poses a challenge for the sustainable management of reservoirs. This study assessed the reservoir sedimentation levels and storage capacity from 2000 to 2018 using remotely sensed data for Namadope Reservoir in Luuka District in Uganda. A methodology to determine the reservoir capacity using a power relationship between remotely sensed surface areas and storage capacities of the reservoir is presented. The loss in reservoir capacity due to sediments increase for 18 years was found as 65,058 m(3), making a sedimentation rate 3,614.3 m(3)/year. The agreement between measured and the remotely sensed reservoir volumes satisfactorily showed that the relationship can be used for assessment of the reservoirs in the catchment area.

AB  - AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate trends in admissions for patients with primary varicella infection in Irishhospitals.MethodsThe Hospital Inpatient Enquiry System was evaluated from Irish hospitals from 2005-2016 for patients with primaryvaricella infection.ResultsThere were 2717 admissions with primary varicella infection. The average annual number of admissions was 226 foran incidence of 4.87/100,000. Average length of stay (ALOS) was 5-days. Sixty-two (2.5%) patients requiredintensive-care with an ALOS of 26-days. The most common secondary diagnoses were cellulitis, volume-depletionand streptococcal infection. The number of admissions due to streptococcal infection and cellulitis significantlyincreased over the period.ConclusionChickenpox places a consistent burden on Irish healthcare, accounting for in excess of 1100 acute and 160 intensivecare bed days annually. This study adds weight to the argument that universal varicella vaccine should beconsidered and provides baseline epidemiology to determine vaccine effectiveness in the future.

AB  - The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has established a Regional Coastal Oceanography with Nanosatellites (ReCON) project which will explore the ability of high-resolution nanosatellites to monitor coastal, estuarine, riverine, and other maritime environments in support of U.S. Navy operations. The project will initially focus on using data from the almost 150+ Planet "Dove" nanosatellites which fly in "flocks" acquiring remotely sensed data from sunlight reflecting off the earth surface. The usefulness of remotely sensed data within our research and operations is determined by the ability to accurately perform atmospheric correction and compute water leaving radiances (Lw), which are then normalized (nLw) and form the basis for the generation of remote sensing reflectance and other inherent and apparent optical property products. These nanosatellites have a single infrared band, although two such bands are typically required to automatically select an appropriate aerosol model during atmospheric correction, prior to estimating nLw. While early in the project, this initial study will assess nanosatellite capabilities to accurately retrieve nLw measurements by specifying the aerosol model selection during the atmospheric correction process. Here we present nLw retrievals for a variety of Planet nanosatellite imagery covering an entire year over a northern island of Venezuela, which covers coastal and open ocean type waters. The nLw retrievals from the nanosatellites using forced aerosol models are compared to coincident nLw retrievals from the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to gauge the potential reliability and accuracy of using nanosatellite imagery as a competent data source for ocean color optics.

AB  - Landsat 9 will continue the Landsat data record into its fifth decade with launch scheduled for December 2020. The two instruments on Landsat 9 are Thelmal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) and Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2). OLI-2 is a nine-channel pushbroom imager with a 15-degree field of view that will have a 16-day measurement cadence from its nominal 705-km orbit altitude. A key aspect of the data that will be produced by OLI-2 is its spectral fidelity which enables countless science applications. The prelaunch test campaign for spectral characterization of OLI-2 was substantially improved relative to the methodology used for OLI: the full spectral response of every detector was characterized with greater accuracy, sampling, and precision. This paper will describe how this was accomplished with a tunable laser-based light source called Goddard Laser for Absolute Measurement of Radiance (GLAMR).

TI  - The Sensitivity of Land-Atmosphere Coupling to Modern Agriculture in the Northern Midlatitudes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern agricultural land cover and management are important as regional climate forcings. Previous work has shown that land cover change can significantly impact key climate variables, including turbulent fluxes, precipitation, and surface temperature. However, fewer studies have investigated how intensive crop management can impact background climate conditions, such as the strength of land-atmosphere coupling and evaporative regime. We conduct sensitivity experiments using a state-of-the-art climate model with modified vegetation characteristics to represent modern crop cover and management, using observed crop-specific leaf area indexes and calendars. We quantify changes in land-atmosphere interactions and climate over intensively cultivated regions situated at transitions between moisture- and energy-limited conditions. Results show that modern intensive agriculture has significant and geographically varying impacts on regional evaporative regimes and background climate conditions. Over the northern Great Plains, modern crop intensity increases the model simulated precipitation and soil moisture, weakening hydrologic coupling by increasing surface water availability and reducing moisture limits on evapotranspiration. In the U.S. Midwest, higher growing season evapotranspiration, coupled with winter and spring rainfall declines, reduces regional soil moisture, while crop albedo changes also reduce net surface radiation. This results overall in reduced dependency of regional surface temperature on latent heat fluxes. In central Asia, a combination of reduced net surface energy and enhanced pre-growing season precipitation amplify the energy-limited evaporative regime. These results highlight the need for improved representations of agriculture in global climate models to better account for regional climate impacts and interactions with other anthropogenic forcings.

CP  - 58th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Radiation-Oncology (ASTRO)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine when the risk of lymphedema is highest after treatment of breast cancer and which factors influence the time course of lymphedema development.Methods and Materials: Between 2005 and 2017, 2171 women (with 2266 at-risk arms) who received surgery for unilateral or bilateral breast cancer at our institution were enrolled. Perometry was used to objectively assess limb volume preoperatively, and lymphedema was defined as a >= 10% relative arm-volume increase arising >3 months postoperatively. Multivariable regression was used to uncover risk factors associated with lymphedema, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate lymphedema incidence, and the semiannual hazard rate of lymphedema was calculated.Results: With a median follow-up of 4 years, the overall estimated 5-year cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 13.7%. Significant factors associated with lymphedema on multivariable analysis were high preoperative body mass index, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and regional lymph node radiation (RLNR). Patients receiving ALND with RLNR experienced the highest 5-year rate of lymphedema (31.2%), followed by those receiving ALND without RLNR (24.6%) and sentinel lymph node biopsy with RLNR (12.2%). Overall, the risk of lymphedema peaked between 12 and 30 months postoperatively; however, the time course varied as a function of therapy received. Early-onset lymphedema (<12 months postoperatively) was associated with ALND (HR [hazard ratio], 4.75; P < .0001) but not with RLNR (HR, 1.21; P = .55). In contrast, late-onset lymphedema (>12 months postoperatively) was associated with RLNR (HR, 3.86; P = .0001) and, to a lesser extent, ALND (HR, 1.86; P = .029). The lymphedema risk peaked between 6 and 12 months in the ALND-without-RLNR group, between 18 and 24 months in the ALND-with-RLNR group, and between 36 and 48 months in the group receiving sentinel lymph node biopsy with RLNR.Conclusions: The time course for lymphedema development depends on the breast cancer treatment received. ALND is associated with early-onset lymphedema, and RLNR is associated with late-onset lymphedema. These results can influence clinical practice to guide lymphedema surveillance strategies and patient education. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The iTClamp in the treatment of prehospital craniomaxillofacial injury: a case series study.
T2  - Journal of injury & violence research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries are very common in both civilian and military settings. Nearly half of all civilian trauma incidents include a scalp laceration and historical rates of CMF battle injuries increased from 16%-21% to 42.2%. The scalp is highly vascular tissue and uncontrolled bleeding can lead to hypotension, shock and death. Therefore, enabling on-scene providers, both military and civilian, to immediately manage scalp and face lacerations, in a manner that allows them to still function in a tactical way, offers operational advantages. This case series examines how effectively a wound-clamp (iTClamp) controlled bleeding from CMF injuries pre-hospital environment.METHODS: The use of the iTClamp for CMF (scalp and face laceration) was extracted from iTrauma Care's post market surveillance database. Data was reviewed and a descriptive analysis was applied.RESULTS: 216 civilian cases of iTClamp use were reported to iTrauma Care. Of the 216 cases, 37% (n=80) were for control of CMF hemorrhage (94% scalp and 6% face). Falls (n=24) and MVC (n=25) accounted for 61% of the mechanism of injury. Blunt accounted for 66% (n=53), penetrating 16% (n=13) and unknown 18% (n=14). Adequate hemorrhage control was reported in 87.5% (n=70) of cases, three respondents reported inadequate hemorrhage control and in seven cases hemorrhage control was not reported. Direct pressure and packing was abandoned in favor of the iTClamp in 27.5% (n=22) of cases.CONCLUSIONS: CMF injuries are common in both civilian and military settings. Current options like direct manual pressure (DMP) often do not work well, are formidable to maintain on long transports and Raney clips are a historical suggestion. The iTClamp offers a new option for control of external hemorrhage from open wounds within compressible zones.

AB  - In preparation for Canada's launch of the RADARSAT-Constellation, this study examines the use of VV-VH intensities to estimate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of corn. LAI is indicative of crop productivity. Two implementations of the Water Cloud Model performed equally well in estimating corn LAI over sites in Poland and Canada with correlation coefficients over 0.8 and Root Mean Square Errors and Mean Average Errors of 0.72-0.73 m(2)m(-2) and 0.47-0.54 m(2)m(-2), respectively. This research will continue to pull in data from other international sites. If results remain robust, a strong case can be made to use an integration of Sentinel-1 and RCM for operational crop condition monitoring.

TI  - Flood mapping by using land surface water index and water flow characterization in the Pantanal, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA VENEZOLANA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study mapped the spatial and temporal variation of flood and characterized the water flow in the Pantanal. By means of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) was calculated with use of data validated from the Logistic Regression Model with the points determined in the field, and in order to contextualize the hydrological periods, the image classification technique of Macalister and Mahaxay (2009) was adapted. LSWI results indicated that up to 67% of the territory can be flooded with a reliability of 96%. In the temporal analysis, December was characterized by flooding, with an average flooded area of 106,842 hectares, which, in March, in the flood period, reached 502,561 hectares, in April, in the ebb period, totalized 343,059 hectares and in the drought, the flooded area was 89,573 hectares, referring only to permanent water courses. The relationship between rainfall and lateral overflow of the rivers of the floodplain was confirmed.

TI  - Landscape Pattern of a Semiarid Mediterranean Area Using Remote Sensing Data- Application to the Wilaya of Saida (West of Algeria)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification, delimitation and spatio-temporal evolution of landscape units is one of the major preoccupations in the Mediterranean region countries. To obtain reliable statistics and to understand the transformation mechanisms of agro-sylvo-pastoral ecosystems, an area selected at the interface of the steppe region and the Tellian region in the north-west of Algeria was chosen. This work aims to implement a landscape mapping approach for a semi-arid Mediterranean area using remote sensing data available through a vicinity analysis and to define the explanatory variables of each segmented landscape units. The landscape metric total core area is used to transform the land cover map from a discrete qualitative image to a continuous quantitative grid for each land cover type. The clustering analysis allows us to automatically identify boundaries between landscape units. The spatial logistic regression method was used to identify the predictive variables of landscape pattern by measuring the degree of correlation between landscape entity (land units) and natural and anthropic landscape factors (explicative variables).These latter represent undergoing landscape processes. The result is a conceptual model of landscape structure which can be considered as a useful tool for assessing landscape structure and process changes due to the ecological and economic context of this region.

AB  - Learning the spatial distribution of soil organic matter content is essential for the planning of land use and environmental protection. Because laboratory measurement of soil samples is time-consuming and costly, a good alternative is required to estimate spatial content of soil organic matter. This problem can be solved by using remote sensing and GIS techniques. In this study, soil organic matter content was estimated from remote sensing data derived from LandSat8 satellite image by generating a multi linear regression model using the backward regression technique. The multiple regression equation between SOM and remote sensing data was significant with R = 0.678. The resulting multi linear regression equation was then used for the spatial prediction for the entire study area. The predicted SOM derived from remote sensing data was used as auxiliary variable using cokriging spatial interpolation technique. Integrate remote sensing data with cokriging method improves significantly the estimates of surface soil organic matter content.

T2  - AFKAR-JURNAL AKIDAH & PEMIKIRAN ISLAM-JOURNAL OF AQIDAH & ISLAMIC THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Islamic Philosophy - defined variously by Muslim scholars - has had tremendous influence on human history, more particularly so on Western history of ideas and philosophies. Through its various manifestations - Kalam, Sufism, peripatetic philosophy and many other areas of thinking such as sociology, psychology etc. - it has left a lasting influence on Islamic societies and the development of its thought manifested in various schools. A review of the bibliographies of studies around Muslim philosophy demonstrates that most of the studies conducted by Muslims and others from the West or East have been about its past history and the contribution it has had on the Medieval West. In most Western writings it was characterized as a phase of western intellectual history and rather unfortunately Muslims started towing the same line. In the meanwhile, very little serious attention was paid to the possible relevance of this philosophy to contemporary man. This paper, endeavours to point to four areas in which philosophy can seriously contribute to the intellectual discourse of contemporary human societies largely characterized by uncertainties and perplexities. It also aims at outlining the way forward by taking philosophy back to the 'Divine world view' that should govern the philosophical thinking, and providing it with an understanding of necessary cooperation between faith and knowledge that insists on the ethical dimension of philosophical inquiry. The Dialectic of "me and the other", which is a very serious issue that the modern man is struggling with, is another area where Islamic philosophy can make an immense contribution that will help the present man and his future.

TI  - Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery using DROP-IN radioguidance: first-in-human translation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Radioguided surgery has been widely used for clinical procedures such as sentinel node resections. In the (robot-assisted) laparoscopic setting radioguidance is realized using laparoscopic gamma probes, which have limited maneuverability. To increase the rotational freedom, a tethered DROP-IN gamma probe was designed. Here we present the first in vivo feasibility study of this technology in prostate cancer patients.Methods Ten patients scheduled for a sentinel node procedure received four injections into the prostate with (indocyanine green-)(99m)Technetium-nanocolloid and underwent preoperative imaging (lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT). The DROP-IN probe was inserted via the assistant port, still permitting the insertion and usage of additional laparoscopic tools.Results The sentinel nodes were resected using the da Vinci (R) Si robot under guidance ofDROP-IN gamma tracing and fluorescence imaging. The surgeon was able to independently maneuver the DROP-IN probe using the ProGrasp (R) forceps of the da Vinci (R) robot and distinguish sentinel nodes from background signal (such as the injection site).Conclusions Overall the DROP-IN design proves to be a valuable tool for robot-assisted radioguided surgery approaches.

TI  - Spatio-temporal modelling of wetland ecosystems using Landsat time series: case of the Bajo Sinu Wetlands Complex (BSWC)- Cordoba- Colombia
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research is focused on the application of water indexes derived from historical Landsat image series to quantify the impact caused by anthropic activities on wetlands. This work is focused specifically on the Bajo Simi Wetlands Complex (BSWC) located on the northern Colombian Caribbean Coast. We modelled the spatio-temporal dynamics of the BSWC in three specific periods (1991, 2003 and 2015) and during two seasons: dry and wet. We used data from Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) (Oli-Tirs) images, based on which we evaluated seven different water indexes in order to select the one which best describes changes in the BSWC.The modelling consisted of the identification of spatio-temporal changes over the BSWC caused by two main pressure factors: (1) anthropic activity in the Sinu River Watershed, which is the main water source of the BSWC and (2) the launch of the Urra Hydroelectric Dam Project located in the upper basin of the Sinu River in 2000.The most suitable water index was found to be the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), based on which we acquired water index images and digital classifications. Reliability of these products was rated in terms of the Overall Classification Accuracy values above 87% and a Kappa index between 0.75 and 0.86.We found that over the 25 year study period, the maximum water storage capacity decreased by 56.2%, the number of the waterbodies reduced by 24.7%, and the average size of the waterbodies decreased by 41%. All the results indicate a deterioration of the water storage capacity in the BSWC.

TI  - Classifying soil stoniness based on the excavator boom vibration data in mounding operations
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The stoniness index of forest soil describes the stone content in the upper soil layer at depths of 20-30 centimeters. This index is not available in any existing map databases, and traditional measurements for the stoniness of the soil have always necessitated laborious soil-penetration methods. Knowledge of the stone content of a forest site could be of use in a variety of forestry operations. This paper presents a novel approach to obtaining automatic measurements of soil stoniness during an excavator-based mounding operation. The excavator was equipped with only a low-cost inertial measurement unit and a satellite navigation receiver. Using the data from these sensors and manually conducted soil stoniness measurements, supervised machine learning methods were utilized to build a model that is capable of predicting the stoniness class of a given mounding location. This study compares different classifiers and feature selection methods to find the most promising solution for this learning problem. The discussion includes a proposition for a meaningful measurement resolution of the soil's stoniness, and a practical method for evaluating the variability of the stone content of the soil. The results indicate that it is possible to predict

TI  - Virological surveillance of influenza in North Greece, 2017/18
T2  - Acta Microbiologica Hellenica
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza is an important issue of public health, due to its yearly outbreaks. The present study presents the results of influenza laboratory testing performed by the National Influenza Centre for N. Greece during the 2017-18 season. From the 40th week 2017 to the 20th 2018 740 specimens were tested. The specimens belonged to ILI patients (Sentinel surveillance system) as well as to patients hospitalised in wards and ICUs.One hundred eighty one positive samples were detected and they were then cultured in MDCK-SIAT cells and in embryonated hen eggs. The detected viral types/subtypes were A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B. Type B Yamagata lineage viruses strongly predominated (75% of positives), while the circulation of A(H3H2) viruses was very small (3.3% of positives).Fifteen fatalities were reported. Out of them, 5 were caused byA(H1N1)pdm09 and 10 by B viruses. The overall mean age was 63.3 years. The specific mean ages were 55 and 67.5 years for A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses respectively. For most of the fatal cases pre-existing medical conditions were reported.The molecular analysis of the haemagglutinin of representative strains was performed in order to investigate the viral evolution and to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness. The revealed mutations and amino acid substitutions indicate an antigenic affinity of the A(H1N1)pdm09 to the vaccine strain and an antigenic divergence of the A(H3N2) strains from it. The strains belonged to Yamagata lineage, which was not included in the trivalent vaccine of the 2017-18 influenza season, thus resulting to low vaccine effectiveness. Furthermore, the molecular analysis revealed two A(H1N1)pdm09 strains having the H275Y mutation leading to viral resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir).As suggested by the WHO, constant surveillance of influenza viruses is necessary at national and global level.

A SVC-HR1024 field spectroradiometer was used and in-band reflectances were determined for medium resolution Landsat 7 ETM satellite sensor. In order to study possible differences of the spectral signature of vegetation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) have been used for the detection of underground military structures. The simulation results show that Vegetation Indices are highly useful and extremely valuable for detection underground infrastructures in Cyprus. In this study, two test areas were identified, analyzed and modelled: Area (a) which is a Vegetation Area covered with vegetation (barley), in the presence of an underground military structure, and Area (b) which is a Vegetation Area covered with vegetation (barley), in the absence of an underground military structure.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present the combined use of Remote Sensing (RS) data and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques for detection of military underground structures in Cyprus. The combination of RS data and GIS tools for detecting these types of structures entails some benefits, such as accessibility, accuracy, easy collection of data, rapid production of maps and better decision-making. In this study, Sentinel-2A satellite images have been used in order to detect underground structures. Atmospheric correction was performed using the Sen2cor plugin in Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). In addition, maps of vegetation indices throughout the plants' phenological development cycle were generated in ArcGIS, for: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), SR (Simple Ratio), DVI (Difference Vegetation Index), GEMI (Global Environment Monitoring Index), RDVI (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). The measurements were taken at two test sites: Area (a) comprises a vegetated area covered with barley, in the presence of an underground military structure, and Area (b) a vegetated area covered with barley, in the absence of an underground military structure.

M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing is considered as an increasingly important technology for military intelligence. New satellite missions, such as Sentinel 2A, may provide systematic datasets for monitoring vast areas of interest. However, there is a great need to understand the information retrieved from such sensors. This paper contemplates the results obtained from a one-year field spectroradiometer campaign, aiming at the detection of underground military structures in Cyprus, covered with crops. The measurements were taken at the following test areas: (a) vegetation area covered with vegetation (barley), in the presence of an underground military structure, and (b) vegetation area covered with vegetation (barley), in the absence of an underground military structure. The ground hyperspectral signatures were resampled to the Sentinel-2A sensor using the appropriate Relative Spectral Response Filters (RSRF). Ten vegetation indices were utilized for the identification of the detection of underground military structures. Results have shown that differences exist between these ten vegetation indices, thus some of them are sufficient to distinguish the two areas. The phenological analysis of these measurements have shown the period of head emergence stage is suitable for monitoring crop marks. Sentinel-2A results were also validated with field spectroradiometer results which were acquired during a simultaneous in-situ campaign.

AB  - Ten, widely-used vegetation indices (VIs), were evaluated for their ability to identify military underground structures. During this study, several ground spectroradiometric campaigns took place, in a fenced military area in Cyprus, cultivated with barley crops, during a complete phenological cycle (2016-2017). A SVC HR-1024 field spectroradiometer was used and in-band reflectances were determined for medium and high resolution satellite sensors, including Landsat 8. The measurements were taken at the following test areas: (a) vegetation area covered with the vegetation (barley), in the presence of an underground military structure (b) vegetation area covered with the vegetation (barley), in the absence of an underground military structure. The test areas were identified, analyzed and modelled under different scenarios. All vegetation indices were evaluated for their separability performance, and the results were presented through image maps.

T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - Catch rates and biological information for Atlantic Cod from the Sentinel Survey Program in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Subdivision 3Ps are updated for 2017, and preliminary results presented for 2018. Temporal trends in gillnet (small 31/4 inch mesh, large 51/2 inch mesh) and linetrawl unstandardized catch rates were similar for all gears, with the highest values at the beginning of each time-series, sharp declines after 1997, and oscillations around or below the series' mean catch rate thereafter. Mean catch rate for small mesh gillnet was consistently higher than that of large mesh gillnet for the entire time-series: peaking at 142 fish per net in 1996, and then averaging 11-36 fish/net; except for its lowest value of 6 fish/net in 2011. Large mesh gillnet yielded the lowest mean catch rate of all gears: declining from 49 fish/net in 1997 to less than 9 fish/net since 2000. Mean catch rate for linetrawl peaked at 223 fish per 1,000 hooks in 1996, and fluctuated around 100 fish/1,000 hooks until 2010 (except in 2006), prior to reaching its lowest value of 62 fish/1,000 hooks in 2014-2015. Sentinel catch rates for large mesh gillnet and linetrawl at control and experimental locations were standardized using Generalized Linear Models. Age-disaggregated standardized catch rates for recent year-classes were generally weaker than those in the past. Age-aggregated catch rates were higher at the beginning of each time-series for both gears, declined over the mid-to-late 1990s, then remained at their lowest levels; decreasing below the series' mean of 6.4 fish/net (large mesh gillnet) in 1999, and 86 fish/1,000 hooks in 2009 (linetrawl). Gillnet and linetrawl catch rates for 2017 were 2.5 fish/net and 47.5 fish/1000 hooks (control sites), and 2.3 fish/net and 53.7 fish/net (experimental sites), respectively. Length frequencies of Atlantic Cod measured in Sentinel surveys indicated that the small mesh gillnet retained small and large fish from multiple length-classes, whereas large mesh gillnet and linetrawl captured larger fish in specific size ranges and few overlapping length-classes. Fish lengths from small mesh gillnet showed several modes ranging between 37-43 cm and 53-60 cm throughout the time-series, while those of fish from large mesh gillnet and linetrawl ranged between 60-68 cm and 42-61 cm, respectively. Indices describing the physiological condition of Atlantic Cod varied at both seasonal and annual scales: the liver (hepatosomatic index) and gutted body condition (Fulton's K condition factor) declined over winter and early spring (while the gonadosomatic index increased), then improved over summer after spawning. These trends varied annually over the time-series, but generally declined in 2004-17. Total annual removals of Atlantic Cod by Sentinel surveys peaked at 38 t (2001), then declined to a minimum of 9.9 t (2016), prior to increasing to 13.3 tin 2017. At least 15 fish species have being recorded as Sentinel bycatch over 2005-17, with American Plaice and Redfish being the most common in gillnet and linetrawl, respectively.

TI  - Identifying the hill torrents and Groundwater Resources for a remote area of District Jamshoro using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System
T2  - Sindh University Research Journal -Science Series
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are the major segments of the sustainable development in any region of the world. The current study identifies the hill torrents and groundwater resourcesin the Kohistan region of district Jamshoro, Sindh province of Pakistan. The study area is a hilly, mountainous range with arid to semi-arid climatic conditions, the high altitude do not allow the source of perennial/canal system, and depending on source of precipitation. Remote sensing data of Alos DEM of 30-meter resolution were obtained throughUSGS earth explorer official website. Shape file was developed through the Google Earth Pro and ArcGIStechnique. HEC-GeoHMS was used to obtain hill torrents through processing tools and the stream definition was automated fixed to delineate the watershed area covering >= 75 km(2). Identified The Groundwater resource into two categories of dug well and deep well. The study showed various ranges in the length of hill torrents 0.12 to 43.30 km, the depth of dug well aquifer 08.23-33.50 and deep well 91.50 to 164 meters in the region. Due to some research limitations the number 52 hill torrents, 33 dug wells and 11 deep wells were identified. Hill torrents carry runoff for the least period of rainy days, the torrential beds percolate the runoff and recharge shallow aquifers in the region, while deep aquifers recharges through adjoining watersheds. Water resourcepotential in the study area could be established by efficient heavy machinery to strengthening the torrential beds, and farms periphery bund structures, channelize watercourses, developed different ranges of ponds and reservoirs to capture floodwater, which enhance the recharge capacity of groundwater and introduce a high efficiency irrigation system in the study area. The spatial variation of water resources through modeling assessment has a major importance in the planning and development. Remote Sensing and GIS techniques enable the analysis with accurate results by consuming short time.

AB  - Earth Stations in Motion (ESIM) technology allows mobile platforms to communicate with the Geostationary orbit fixed satellite service networks in the Ka-band to provide high-power multiple spot beam coverage with very high transmission rates. The results from the numerical simulation of this paper include compatibility assessment to protect current and planned stations of fixed service from Land ESIMs operating with Geostationary fixed satellite service networks in the frequency band 27.5-29.5 GHz using the Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) method. This paper also presents a methodology to quantify the interference effects based on the information on ESIM off-axis transmission levels. Results from computer simulation shows that a separation distance of 33km is required to protect the FS station from the Land ESIM.

TI  - HUMAN ESSENCE: THE NEOCLASSICAL UNDERSTANDING
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the understanding of human essence in three types of philosophical outlook: classical, non-classical and neoclassical. The purpose of this study is to clarify the historical-comparative increase in understanding that there is a human as a human. It is proved in the work that a functional approach has been implemented and is still being implemented to human in the classical and non-classical types, due to the prevalence of absolutist outlook in them and on the basis of identification of human nature and essence. In the neoclassical type, by virtue of a fundamentally different, non-creationist worldview, a distinction between the human essence and humn nature, a non-functional understanding and definition of human essence begins to be implemented, which reveals at least a little of its uniquely understood uniqueness. The latter is manifested through persistent, essential generic signs that there is a human; moreover they are realistic and not yet repeating in anybody in space and the universe accessible to mankind. The gradual overcoming of creationism, the non-identification of human nature and essence, a functional approach, the identification of constant generic characters of the human essence begin to eliminate and reduce the human essence to animal essence, and, which is important, the inadmissible attitude of human to human, human to himself/herself.

AB  - The spacecraft is developing towards ultra-high precision, ultra-high stability and hyper-spectral sensing directions. Micro-vibration in satellite platform can significant degrade the performance of payload, so that the micro-vibration analysis, control, measurement and experiment is very important to all kinds of high performance satellites. Considering the main vibration source on the FY-4 meteorological satellite and the requirement of the sensitive payload, the vibration suppression isolators are adopted to both vibration source and the sensitive payload. The parameters and sensitivity of the isolator unit are studied to give basic vibration suppression design guideline. Based on the isolator unit, the research on the hexapod vibration isolation chasis for flywheel is carried out theoritically and experimentally. For the sensitive payload vibration isolation, a three-point support using isolator and damper is proposed and the vibration isolation performance is studied. The vibration isolation of the interferometer can be seemed as second level isolation and can further reduce the vibration. The low-frequency suspension system and ultra-quiet laboratory are used to fulfill the micro-vibration experiment on ground. The on-orbit vibration measurement system is carried on FY-4 meteorological satellite and the real data show that the micro-vibration level can be suppressed to under 0.1 mg which totally meets the design requirement. The micro-vibration suppression and experiment technique are of great significance and can also be used to other similar satellite.

CP  - International Conference on Technologies and Materials for Renewable Energy, Environment and Sustainability (TMREES)
CL  - Athens, GREECE
AB  - In recent years, the expansion of Harbin's main urban area, the capital city of a northeast province in china, has resulted in the increase of impervious surface, the decrease of green space and the significant change of urban thermal environment. In order to further reveal the comprehensive effects of underlying surface especially green space and impervious surface on urban thermal environment in the severe cold region, this paper adopts remote sensing technology to extract and analyze the Landsat spectral imaging data of Harbin's main urban area in summers and winters from 2004 to 2015, and thus puts forward the regulations of effects of different underlying surface types on land surface temperature (EST). It is found that a large amount of permeable underlying surface like green space in Harbin has been continuously transformed into impervious surface, which has led to a continuous rise of urban land surface temperature in recent years. Urban green space plays a certain role in improving urban thermal environment in both summers and winters. We can fmd especial rules on the distribution of the urban loops and the cooling ranges in summers. As for winters, under the influence of the main heat source and the cooling mode, there is no remarkable regularity. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An Automatic Extraction Method for Lakes and Reservoirs Using Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and reservoirs are important parts of ecosystems and social developments. Separating scientific research on lakes and reservoirs is not conducive to measure water regulation services or defend against natural disasters. Accurate surface water information is of great significance to lake and reservoir management. To address this problem, we proposed a new automated lake and reservoir extraction process (LREP), which applied the modified two-mode (MTM) method to extract water from partial images by calculating thresholds in the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the near-infrared (NIR) band; then, we estimated the segmentation thresholds from a set of NDWI thresholds obtained for the remaining images. Subsequently, a series of feature factors was used to remove rivers, shadows, and ponds. Finally, a new shape parameter called complexity was introduced to describe the edge characteristics of water bodies, distinguishing lakes and reservoirs from paddyfields and remaining ponds. We verified the algorithm using 154 Gaofen-2 images covering three cities: Liaoyuan, Xianning, and Zigong. The results indicated that the new LREP performed well with the overall accuracies of 99.38%, 99.27%, and 98.72% and the kappa coefficients of 0.92, 0.96, and 0.92 in Liaoyuan, Xianning, and Zigong, respectively. This method has the potential to monitor a variety of lakes and reservoirs, including lost lakes, new reservoirs, and surface water quality.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences Lightning Nowcasting and Warning System (CAMS_LNWS) was designed to predict lightning within the upcoming 0-1h and provide lightning activity potential and warning products. Multiple remote sensing data and numerical simulation of an electrification and discharge model were integrated in the system. Two core algorithms were implemented: (1) an area identification, tracking, and extrapolating algorithm and (2) a decision tree algorithm. The system was designed using a framework and modular structure, and integrated warning methods were applied in the warning program. Two new algorithms related to the early warning of the first lightning and thunderstorm dissipation were also introduced into the system during the upgrade process. Thunderstorms occurring in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei during 2016-2017 were used to evaluate the CAMS_LNWS by the low-frequency cloud to ground lightning detection data, and the results showed that the system has good forecasting and warning ability for local lightning activities. The TS score in 0-1h ranged from 0.11 to 0.32, with a mean of 0.20. Operational experiments and promotional work for the CAMS_LNWS are now in progress.

AB  - Modern satellite payloads are generating, a large amount Qf data with very high data rates that brings great challenges to the test and simulation of the multi -channel multiplexer on satellite. Moreover, the development duration of satellite multiplexer is long, so the test of satellite data transmission might be delayed. To solve these problems, a multi-channel multiplexer simulator is designed and implemented on Zynq SoC. The simulator is in the form of standard 31.1 PXle module integrating TLK2711, LVDS and RS422 interfqces. The simulator receives the multi-channel, high-speed and dynamic pi-'load data and sends framed data through two downlink physical channels. In order to improve the efficiency of data multiplexing, the simulator receives payload data that assigns a virtual channel (Tr) for every channel data on the programmable logic (PL). Then, the virtual channel schedule unit uses a virtual channel scheduling algorithm based on the Consultative Committee Pr Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS) protocol on the processing system (PS). The 600Mhps high i'ate frame multiplexer of CCSDS AOS protocol is verified on Zynq SoC in the Closed Loop Testing System. And, the simulator has been applied to a certain satellite ground automatic testing system.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in weather forecast, global ocean circulation and climate change research. In this paper, the NOAA JPSS enterprise algorithm was adapted to retrieve LST from high spatial resolution thermal infrared data of Chinese Gaofen-5. The GF5 land surface emissivity (LSE) was determined by a new scheme. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) thermal radiance was used for cross-calibration of Gaofen-5 thermal data. The enterprise algorithm is tested by simulation data produced using CLAR and TIGR profiles. Moreover, VIIRS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products were used for cross-validation. The evaluation results show that the average bias and RMSE are -0.40 (-0.36) and 1.61K (0.90K), respectively. The validation results show that the bias (RMSE) are between -0.47K (2.18K) and 1.55K (2.59K). This study provides an alternative method to estimate LST from Chinese Gaofen-5 data.

TI  - Estimating Land Surface Temperature from Landsat-8 Data using the NOAA JPSS Enterprise Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in hydrology, meteorology, and the surface energy balance. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Enterprise algorithm is adapted to Landsat-8 data to obtain the estimate of LST. The coefficients of the Enterprise algorithm were obtained by linear regression using the analog data produced by comprehensive radiative transfer modeling. The performance of the Enterprise algorithm was first tested by simulation data and then validated by ground measurements. In addition, the accuracy of the Enterprise algorithm was compared to the generalized split-window algorithm and the split-window algorithm of Sobrino et al. (1996). The validation results indicate the Enterprise algorithm has a comparable accuracy to the other two split-window algorithms. The biases (root mean square errors) of the Enterprise algorithm were 1.38 (3.22), 1.01 (2.32), 1.99 (3.49), 2.53 (3.46), and -0.15 K (1.11 K) at the SURFRAD, HiWATER_A, HiWATER_B, HiWATER_C sites and BanGe site, respectively, whereas those values were 1.39 (3.20), 1.0 (2.30), 1.93 (3.48), 2.53 (3.35), and -0.35 K (1.16 K) for the generalized split-window algorithm, 1.45 (3.39), 1.08 (2.41), 2.16 (3.67), 2.52 (3.58), and 0.02 K (1.12 K) for the split-window algorithm of Sobrino, respectively. This study provides an alternative method to estimate LST from Landsat-8 data.

AB  - Recently, it is still difficult to obtain satellite data with both high spatial resolution and frequent coverage simultaneously and spatio-temporal fusion is an effective way to solve this problem. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), one of the spatio-temporal fusion methods, has been widely used in many applications. In the original STARFM method, the fusion procedure is implemented band by band, which means information from other bands is ignored. To take information from other bands into account, a modified STARFM method was proposed in this study. Instead of using the pixels from one given band, the vectors formed from all bands were used; and the difference between two pixels in the STARFM algorithm was replaced by the distance between two vectors. Five quantitative indices were used to make comparisons between the modified and original STARFM methods. The results show the proposed method can get better fusion accuracies with different band combinations.

TI  - Aspects of traditional Tiv naming practices: A sociocultural account
T2  - SOCIOLINGUISTIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Naming in the African cultural context serves both referential and connotative functions as a unique means of identity construction which contains important cultural meaning and metaphysical presuppositions. Among the Tiv people of Benue State, North-central Nigeria, personal names reflect social relations and reveal major insights into their history, philosophy, language, spirituality and worldview. Naming practices in Tiv are indicative of the community's social existence and redefine the essence of its being. This article explores the interaction of the Tiv people naming system with their sociocultural experience and physical environment. We investigate how naming intersects with social class distinction (wealth vs. poverty), emotions, occupations and topography, and examine their sources, social categorization and socio-onomastic significance. This study is theoretically rooted in Goddard's (2006) ethnopragmatic paradigm which examines the locally relevant construction of cultural and contextual meanings in the interpretation of language. Data for the study were sourced from two Tiv communities of Gboko and Makurdi in Benue State, Nigeria through participant observations, personal interviews and conversations with name-bearers, -givers and -users. We conclude that Tiv personal names reflect the socio-cultural environment and provide prominent sites for the creative expression of the Tiv social universe and lived cultural experiences.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Dr. Izrael Milejkowski (1887-1943), a member of the Jewish-Polish inteligencja, visited the Land of Israel in April 1936 for the First World Congress of Jewish Physicians. At that point, he closely examined his position on Zionism and, at the same time, being a Polish patriot. He struggled to be a citizen of equal rights in Poland while maintaining his Jewish-national pride and working for his own people in several areas. The article discusses mainly Milejkowski's worldview and ideas. He maintained a split identity-Polish and Jewish-a duality that represented a new direction for his people. The article focuses on the relations between the Diaspora and the Land of Israel in Dr. Milejkowski's worldview.

AB  - In this article we are concerned by the problem of detection of noisy terms which arise in image processing as for remote sensing problems, and which are modelled by a nonlinear wave hyperbolic equation. Some data are missing, then the sentinel method of J.-L. Lions (1992) is used; it is a particular least square-like method which permits to distinguish between the missing terms and the pollution terms. In particular, the sentinel theory is given here in its more general and more realistic setting for hyperbolic problems: in this case, the observation and the control have their support in different open sets. The problem of finding a sentinel is equivalent to a non classical null-controllability problem for the wave equation that we solve.- integral(Omega) partial derivative q/partial derivative t (0) (y) over cap (o) dx = integral(Q) (h(o)chi Omicron + W chi(omega))y(tau 0) dxdt

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-1 & 2 time series to derive crop phenology and biomass of wheat and rapeseed: northen France and Brittany case studies

AB  - Crop monitoring at a fine scale is critical from an environmental perspective since it provide crucial information to combine increased food production and sustainable management of agricultural landscapes. The recent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) time series offer a great opportunity to monitor cropland (structure, biomass and phenology) due to their high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, we assessed the potential of Sentinel data to derive Wet Biomass (WB), Dry biomass (DB), water content and crop Phenological Stages (PS). This study focuses on wheat and rapeseed, which represent two of the most important seasonal crops of the world in terms of occupied area. Satellites and ground data were collected over two French temperate agricultural landscapes, in northern France and Brittany. Spectral bands and vegetation indices were derived from the S-2 images and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators from the S-1 images. We used linear models to estimate the Crop Parameters (CP) of wheat and rapeseed crops. Satellite images were then classified using a random forest incremental procedure based on the importance rank of the input features to discriminate PS. Results showed that S-1 features were more efficient than S-2 features to estimate CP of rapeseed while S-2 features were better for wheat. We demonstrated the high potential of S-1 & 2 to predict principal PS (kappa=0.75) while secondary PS were misclassified. For wheat, the succession of PS predicted was consistent, further research is required to confirm the potential of S-1 & 2.

TI  - Reconstructing snow-avalanche extent using remote sensing and dendrogeomorphology in Parang Mountains
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches are some of the most important geomorphic processes that disturb the forests at treeline in the Romanian Carpathians. The occurrence of multiple snow avalanches in the same area leads to the development of the avalanche paths. In Parang Mountains, the spatial extent and the frequency of past avalanche events are poorly documented. In this study we combined remote sensing approach and natural archives based on tree-rings to reconstruct the spatial extent of a past snow avalanche. Dendrogeomorphic reconstruction of past avalanche activity was performed in two avalanche paths based on the following growth anomalies: traumatic resin ducts, compression wood, callus tissue associated with scars and growth suppression. Remote sensing reconstruction was performed in nine avalanche paths including the above mentioned two and relies on the sudden variations of four spectral indices (Normalized Burn Ratio, Normalized Difference Moisture Index, Moisture Stress Index and Disturbance Index) between images acquired yearly from 1984 till 1988. The results of dendrogeomorphic reconstruction pinpoint a severe avalanche event occurred in 1985-1986 winter that affected both avalanche paths. The results of remote sensing reconstruction validate the dendrogeomorphic reconstruction and suggest four other avalanche paths affected by the same avalanche event. The combination of both methods provided a powerful approach to analyze the impact of a snow-avalanche event a regional scale. We consider both powerful methods to further asses the spatial extent of more avalanche events over the entire surface of Parang Mountains.

M3  - Article
AB  - Google Maps are online maps that have a large number of users around the world. Google Maps uses satellite data from many sources, which have different resolutions, varying in each location around the world. For this reason, Google does not have the policy to declare the accuracy of Google Maps data with respect to any specific area. This research conducts a study on the horizontal positional accuracy of Google Maps in Thailand by comparing 3.970 checkpoint coordinates read from Google Maps with corresponding coordinates read from Orthophotos 1:4,000 scale of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives of Thailand. The results reveal an average error of 3.3 meters, with a minimum error of 0.0 meters and the maximum error of 28.6 meters. Readers can view the checkpoint location together with the verified results of each individual checkpoint by following the Google Maps link created in this research.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE 46th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)

AB  - Photovoltaic water pumping systems (PVWPS) are an interesting solution to improve water access in off-grid areas. Irradiance being the main input of PVWPS models, the source (local sensor or satellite database) and temporal resolution of irradiance data strongly influence the accuracy of PVWPS models and the optimal sizing obtained from these models. We show that we can use satellite data instead of data from a local sensor and a temporal resolution of 1 hour without significantly changing the model accuracy and optimization results. These results can allow to intensify the implementation of PVWPS in off-grid areas.

AB  - Correct application of nitrogen fertilizers in crop management on arable land has high importance both from economic and environmental point of view, mainly in the condition of higher spatial variability of farm fields. One of the solutions could be a variable rate application (VRA) of nitrogen fertilizers based on the spatial variability and identification of management zones, which addresses site specific crop changes, soil characteristics and crop requirements. The aim of the study was to compare proximal and remote sensing systems of winter wheat mapping for variable rate application of nitrogen fertilizers. The methodology of the work was based on the collection of spectral data from the ISARIA proximal crop sensor system, represented by the vegetation indices IRMI and IBI, and set of vegetation indices indices from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, both on the trial fields. All experimental work was carried out at the farm company SALIX MORAVA a.s. (locality Zdounky, Kromeriz, Czech Republic) during the year 2018 on the selected fields with winter wheat and total area of 355 ha. Spatial data were processed and analyzed by using geographic information systems and then statistically evaluated the relationships between variables. The study has shown higher level of correlation between the ISARIA vegetation indices and all evaluated indices from Sentinel-2. Highest values of correlation with Sentinel-2 indices were achieved for the ISARIA's IRMI index. The most sensitive Sentinel-2 vegetation indices were EVI, GNDVI and SRI indices, while the lowest correlation values were found for the NRERI, REIP, RENDVI and S2REP indices. Overall, the results of this study indicate high relationship between proximal and remote sensing, thus the use by farmers depends on the practical aspects of their in crop management practices.

AB  - China is experiencing a rapid urbanization process and impervious surface is an important indicator to urban sprawl and its related economic and environmental issues. Multi-temporal remote sensing, with the auxiliary of change detection methods, provides an efficient, consistent and economical means to monitor the impervious surface change. Traditional change detection methods require prior information to produce the change of impervious surface change, which is time consuming and labor cost. To tackle this issue, this paper presents an integrated approach to detect impervious surface change using satellite image (i.e., Landsat 8) and volunteered geographic information (i.e., Open Street Map). The presented approach was applied to map the impervious surface change in the city of Hefei, China. The results show that the presented approach was able to produce a satisfactory compared to supervised classification methods. The presented approach sheds new light to automatically map and estimate impervious surface change in a reliable and efficient way.

AB  - There is an increasing trend at using social media data to map human activity, to the point that some authors have suggested that these data may be even better than Earth Observation (EO) data to map urban areas. This work introduces a novel approach to map urban areas using SAR images from Sentinel-1 data, and exploiting either Twitter or Weibo data for two different cities, Beijing and Taipei. The use of different social media data results into different urban extent maps, and for different cities the same approach provides different accuracy values for the same area, according to the availability of either social media data set. Instead, urban extents obtained by means of EO data only are more stable. Indeed, the adoption of a specific social platform depends on a number of geographical, economic and political factors, while remote sensing is based on physics.

AB  - Landsat 9 is planned for launch in December 2020 to continue the mission of observing changes on the Earth's surface that began in 1972 with the launch of Landsat 1. Like Landsat 8, Landsat 9 will carry two imaging instruments: Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2), designed and built by Ball Aerospace**, and Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2), manufactured by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). As of this writing, both sensors have completed the instrument-level ground testing and are ready for integration into the spacecraft. Data collected during the pre-launch performance testing are analyzed to assess the usability of responses of the video reference pixels (VRPs) located on the focal planes of OLI-2 and Landsat 8 OLI for more accurate detector bias estimates, develop a methodology to correct for nonlinearities in the OLI-2 response and compare it to the OLI correction approach, and determine the spatial performance of TIRS-2.

AB  - The aim of the study was to identify lymph node micrometastases in order to demonstrate the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients staged I and II undergoing curative surgery. We conducted a prospective study on a total of 44 patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer, undergoing radical surgery at the Fifth Department of Surgery of Cluj-Napoca Municipal Clinical Hospital between September 2012 and January 2015. For the identification of micrometastases we used the sentinel lymph node mapping by two techniques, in vivo and ex vivo. In N0 patients we conducted an immunohistochemical study to identify micrometastases. Patients were followed 3 years after surgery to identify possible relapses. The mean age was 63 years, 24 patients were males and 20 (45.5%) women. Ten patients (12.8%) had stage I cancer, 12 patients (27.3%) had stage II cancer, and 22 had stage III cancer. Sentinel lymph node detection rate was similar for the in vivo technique and for the ex vivo technique. The percentage for the detection of micrometastases was 25% in vivo and 33.3% ex vivo. The 3-year postoperative recurrence rate was 25% in overstaged patients. The presence of micrometastases should be considered as a negative prognostic factor in patients with stage I and II colorectal cancer.

AB  - In this study, synthetic aperture radar ocean speckle is exploited to infer information on sea surface wind field. The K-distribution is adopted to model the single look complex vertically/vertically-polarized intensity speckle signal measured over sea surface under different wind conditions, i. e., wind speed and direction. Experiments undertaken on a large set of Sentinel-1 SAR data collected over the northeastern part of the Atlantic ocean, between southern Iceland and northern Scotland, showed that the shape parameter of the K-distribution is sensitive to both ocean wind field and SAR imaging parameters. In particular, it was shown that the shape parameter decreases when increasing wind speed while its variability becomes significant under crosswind relative azimuth angle and at larger incidence angles.

TI  - All-sky satellite data assimilation of microwave temperature sounding channels at the Met Office
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main avenues to improve the skill of a numerical weather prediction system is to increase the accuracy of the initial conditions for prediction through the assimilation of a larger number of observations. This article discusses our work on assimilating cloud-affected radiances from microwave temperature sounding channels of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A (AMSU-A) satellite sensor, which are currently underused by the Met Office operational data assimilation system. Despite their importance, as measured by impact indicators such as the Forecast Sensitivity to Observations Impact (FSOI), most cloud-affected microwave data are discarded so as to avoid detrimental effects, as they are much more difficult to predict than clear-sky radiances. This is due to shortcomings in parametrization schemes (for example, large-scale cloud and precipitation, convection) in both nonlinear and linearized prognostic models, as well as radiative transfer models. As first demonstrated at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), these difficulties can be eased when observation uncertainties for cloud-affected radiances are inflated prior to assimilation as a function of cloud amount present in a given observed or predicted scene. Our results show that cloud-dependent observation uncertainty inflation for cloud-affected radiances provides beneficial effects on forecast skill over two three-month-long "all-sky" (nonprecipitating) data assimilation trials. In particular, root-mean-square error (RMSE) reductions in 500-hPa geopotential height forecasts of about I (1% up to day 2 and in 10-m wind and 2-m temperature forecasts up to day 6 have been demonstrated. Also, our experiments show evidence of significant improvements in the fit between observations and short-range forecasts for lower-peaking humidity- and temperature-sensitive channels.

AB  - This work present a new methodology based on time series and CORINE Land Cover products for identifying the main land processes acting on the territory. Seasonality parameters derived from NDVI obtained from Terra satellite were computed using TIMESAT software. These seasonality parameters include amplitude of the season, base value, length of season, maximum value, left and right derivative and small and large integrated values. In general, among all these seasonality parameters, the maximum value of the season and its large integrated value resulted the most appropriate parameters for identifying land processes. However, thus processes occurring within the same CORINE level1, were not well identified. Therefore, the proposed methodology has been proved as a useful approach for identifying the main land processes occurring in the surface. The integration with multispectral/hyperspectral and thermal imagery could help to improve surface classification.

This paper presents an easy-to-use tool for determining crop water demands using the dual crop coefficient approach and remote sensing imagery. The model was developed using Python as a programming language and integrated into an ArcGIS (geographic information system) toolbox. Inputs consist of images from satellites Landsat 7 and 8, and Sentinel 2A, along with data for defining crop, weather, soil type, and irrigation system. The tool produces a spatial distribution map of the crop evapotranspiration estimates, assuming no water stress, which allows quantifying the water demand and its variability within an agricultural field with a spatial resolution of either 10 m (for Sentinel) or 30 m (for Landsat). The model was validated by comparing the estimated basal crop coefficients (K-cb) of lettuce and peach during an irrigation season with those tabulated as a reference for these crops. Good agreements between K-cb derived from both methods were obtained with a root mean squared error ranging from 0.01 to 0.02 for both crops, although certain underestimations were observed resulting from the uneven crop development in the field (percent bias of -4.74% and -1.80% for lettuce and peach, respectively). The developed tool can be incorporated into commercial decision support systems for irrigation scheduling and other applications that account for the water balance in agro-ecosystems. This tool is freely available upon request to the corresponding author.

AB  - This study used remote sensing tools to quantify spatial dynamics of date palm plantations (DPP) in desert oases of Ziban region (NE Algeria) over the past three decades and understand the impacts of agricultural development on land use-land cover changes. Spatiotemporal changes of DPP (Phoenix dactylifera) were detected using likelihood supervised classification for each of three Landsat satellite images (TM-1984, ETM+-1999 and OLI-2013). The DPP area quadrupled over the last three decades (1984-2013), accounting for about 75.46% of date palm cultivation expansion, while arid rangelands decreased with about 25,932.96 ha as result of political agricultural programs that favored the exploitation of natural habitats into DPP. This study reported the potential of remote sensing imagery processing technique for monitoring and rapidly detecting land change in landscapes of desert oases, with accuracy and a relatively low cost over a long-time period and large scale regions.

TI  - Can People Think Differently?
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper critically observes A.V. Smirnov's idea, according to which the Arab way of thinking is based on their processual worldview, and in it are executed syllogisms based on the causal junction of processes, which is unusual for the substrate thinking of Europeans. Following the author's thought, I show that in both European and Arabic syllogisms logical inference is of the set-theoretic nature. The syllogism demonstrated by the author as an example of a different way of thinking is either based on the same inferential mechanism as the Aristotelian one, or produces a conclusion that is not universal and necessary, but only probable. Along the way, I reveal some vulnerabilities in the idea of special cognitive intuitions that underlie Arabic language and logic. Firstly, the difference in cognitive intuitions is not so great as to make understanding of people of different cultures impossible. Secondly, linguistic intuitions are either innate or acquired in the process of learning. In the first case, differences of grammars can be explained only supposing different genotypes of peoples. In the second case, they are historically contingent and can be changed. Regarding the hypothesis of different logics characteristic of different cultures and based on different cognitive intuitions, I show that both Arabic and European logics are based on the intuition of the existence of objects, classes of objects and the relations between them. The article was written following our personal discussions with A.V. Smimov and has the goal of strengthening and improving his arguments.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article substantiates relevance of study of the Russian language current state from the standpoint of linguo-culturology as complex and interdisciplinary science. Historical and regional language particularities, temporal cultural context of a linguistic situation are considered. The study is conducted within the framework of the contemporary linguistics: cognitive science, sociolinguistics, ethno-linguistics, psycholinguistics, etc. Linguo-cultural description of a situation as theoretical concept and as object of a linguo-cultural analysis contributes to the development of LCS-theory and poses a problem of practical study of specific linguo-cultural cases.Any radical changes in a language are historically and culturally dependent. Directly or indirectly, they reflect socio-political or ideological transformations in the life of a society, and are related to language consciousness and language worldview of native speakers. Hence, space-time circumstances have crucial influence on a particular linguo-cultural situation and require a comprehensive analysis.Youth discourse, being a rapidly changing and constantly updated issue, is affected by the time period and the cultural environment in which it develops. It gives grounds to choosing youth discourse as the main object of study in the description of the current linguo-cultural situation.The linguo-cultural approach to the analysis of youth language (particularly, that of students as large and socially active layer in the modern society) is aimed at enhancing the forecast of some development trends both in the language and in the linguo-cultural situation in the country. Besides, it helps to determine both general regularities of linguo-cultural development and features of LCS as one of key linguo-cultural concepts.

T2  - ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an attempt at using synthetic aperture radar interferometry to determine surface displacement in a region affected by a strong earthquake induced by underground mining operations. It was assumed that the satellite radar data obtained from the Sentinel 1A/B satellites may be used to monitor induced seismicity, i.e. mining tremors. Such seismic activity is observed at much shallower depths, and the surface area affected by such activity is much more limited than in the case of natural seismic events. Research was performed in a region located in the southwest part of Poland, where copper ore is extracted using underground methods. The geological structure of the selected area increases the likelihood of induced seismic events. Moreover, the area is one of the most seismically active regions in this part of Europe. The tremor analysed in this paper occurred on November 29, 2016, and had a magnitude of M(w)4.2. Calculations showed that the seismic event resulted in the creation of a 2.7 km x 2.5 km subsidence basin. The paper demonstrates that it is possible to use data provided by the Sentinel 1A/B satellites to detect surface displacements caused by a mining tremor.

AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the radiative temperature of the Earth's surface measured by an overhead airborne or satellite sensor. LST is widely used in hydrological, agricultural, and meteorological industries. LST products are becoming more sought after which requires data providers to create accurately calibrated data sets. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of building a radiometer to collect ground truth temperature measurements to validate an LST product, specifically the Level 2 product produced by Landsat 8. We designed and fabricated a multi-channel radiometer, that can be flown on an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), to replicate Landsat's Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) bands 10 and 11. Experimental results using a blackbody radiator show the radiometer successfully records accurate temperature measurements and is ready for flight testing with coordinated Landsat collects.

AB  - The article is devoted to the socio-cultural and linguistic analysis of the characteristics of mutual penetration and mutual determination of Christian and Muslim semiotic culture codes in migration discourse of North Caucasus that creates the effect of syncretism of "ours" and "theirs" in speech behavior based on the novel "The 45th Parallel" by Polina Zherebtsova. The story takes place in Stavropol, on the 45th Parallel of the Earth. The documentary novel written in 2005 - 2006 is based on personal diaries of the author, a refugee from Grozny. The aim of this article is to analyze mentalities of Russian (Christian) refugees from the Chechen Republic in the fiction. The research makes it possible to conclude that secondary acculturation of migrants has modified their axiological picture of the world, psychology, lifestyle and sociocultural habits of migrants; together with attributes of their culture, they have preserved relics of the worldview of societies, which they have left. So it is possible to speak about a palimpsest of Christian and Muslim semiotic culture codes "Clothes", "Food", and "Interpersonal relations" in migration discourse of North Caucasus. The main methods of the research are the semiotic analysis and the hermeneutic interpretation of discourse.

AB  - As Human population is increasing, a number of small towns are turning into big cities. But human race has developed itself in technological terms smartly, which is helping human kind to act efficiently and consume the resources appropriately. Collection of urban sprawl statistics of an area has become efficient by using remote sensing. In comparison to the traditional methods, the new method of using remote sensing for the detection and classification of urban sprawl has substantially enhanced. Using this data management has become capable of taking suitable measures for its residents. This work compares six supervised classifiers, i.e Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Distance, Support Vector Machines, Mahalanobis, Parallelepiped and Feed Forward Neural Network for urban classification. The data used is of SPOT 5 and criteria for comparison of classifiers is based on accuracy. Due to the absence of blue band in SPOT imagery the collected data samples for training tend to be complex and overlapping. Training data collected and divided into 10 different samples, show 82.74% accuracy for Artificial Neural Network. In comparison with Artificial Neural Networks, the lowest recorded results are of parallelepiped Classifier.

AB  - This study compares the frequency and severity of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 (A/H1), influenza A/H3N2 (A/H3) and other respiratory virus infections in hospitalised patients. Data from 17 332 adult hospitalised patients admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, with a respiratory illness between 2012 and 2015 were linked with data containing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for respiratory viruses including A/H1, A/H3, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza. Of these, 1753 (10.1%) had test results. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the viruses for clinical outcomes including ICU admission, ventilation, pneumonia, length of stay and death. Patients with A/H1 were more likely to experience severe outcomes such as ICU admission (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.5, P = 0.016), pneumonia (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6-5.7, P < 0.001) and lower risk of discharge from hospital (indicating longer lengths of hospitalisation; HR 0.64 95% CI 0.47-0.88, P = 0.005), than patients with A/H3. Patients with a non-influenza respiratory virus were less likely to experience severe clinical outcomes than patients with A/H1, however, had similar likelihood when compared to patients with A/H3. Patients hospitalised with A/H1 had higher odds of severe outcomes than patients with A/H3 or other respiratory viruses. Knowledge of circulating influenza strains is important for healthcare preparedness.

AB  - An artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, employing several Aqua MODIS infrared channels, the retrieved total cloud visible optical depth, and vertical humidity profiles is trained to detect multilayer (ML) ice-over-water cloud systems as identified by matched CloudSat and CALIPSO (CC) data. The multilayer ANN, or MLANN, algorithm is also trained to retrieve the optical depth and the top and base heights of the upper-layer ice clouds in ML systems. The trained MLANN was applied to independent MODIS data resulting in a combined ML and single layer hit rate of 80% (77%) for nonpolar regions during the day (night). The results are more accurate than currently available methods and the previous version of the MLANN. Upper-layer cloud top and base heights are accurate to +/- 1.2 km and +/- 1.6 km, respectively, while the uncertainty in optical depth is +/- 0.457 and +/- 0.556 during day and night, respectively. Areas of further improvement and development are identified and will be addressed in future versions of the MLANN.

T2  - Current Immunology Reviews
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophages are the phagocytic sentinel cells of our body, with high plasticity required to maintain homeostasis. This incredibly diverse set of cells, in response to various environmental stimuli such as cytokines and other factors, constantly alters their functional state/phenotype. They undergo polarization not only into conventional M1/M2 axis but also undergo a diverse spectrum of macrophage subtypes which play critical roles in various immune functions and homeostasis. In the tumor microenvironment, monocytes polarize along with the alternatively activated macrophages AAM or M2 macrophages associated with pro-tumoral features whereas M1 macrophages exert antitumor functions. Tumor-Associated Macrophage (TAM) infiltration has long been associated with poor prognosis and therefore represents potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarken in solid tumors. Inhibiting the recruitment of monocytes into the tumor microenvironment and targeted deletion of TAMs have shown promising results. Targeting the TAMs towards M1-like macrophages has also demonstrated to be an efficient way to prevent tumor progression and metastasis. Here in this article, we review how TAMs orchestrate different steps in tumor progression and metastasis and the opportunities to target them in the quest for cancer prevention and treatment. Further, we explore how chemotherapies and immunotherapies can target TAM reprogramming and depletion to serve as a strategy for the control of various types of cancers in the future.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Many approaches for land cover classification rely on the spectral characteristics of the elements on the surface using one single multispectral image. Some land cover elements, as the vegetation and, in particular crops, are changing over seasons and over the growing cycle and may be characterized by their spectral temporal variability. In such cases, the spectral temporal variability can be used to model the crop's phenology and predict the crop type using both spatial and temporal spectral data. In this paper we aim to exploit the temporal dimension on the crop type classification using multi-temporal multispectral data and machine learning techniques. The high revisiting frequency of Sentinel-2 satellite opens new possibilities on the exploitation of high temporal resolution multispectral data. In this investigation, we evaluated the K - nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) methods, for mapping 18 summer crops using Sentinel-2 data. Each method was applied to three different combinations of bands: a) all Sentinel-2 spectral bands (except band 10); b) vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI), Water Indices (NDWI, NDWI2, Moisture Index) and Normalized Image Indices and Brightness and c) the combination of the spectral bands and the indices. The best precisions we achieved were 98,6% with KNN, 98,9% with RF and 98.0% using a DT.

AB  - Enterprise Architecture (EA) description frameworks embody a "worldview" which is used by architects to conceptualize the enterprise and its elements. This "worldview" manifests itself in the choice of language constructs and in modeling rules and guidelines, and, whether explicitly or not, reflects some foundational ontological choices. This paper reflects on the practical consequences of some of these choices. We focus on the capability-related elements in EA defense frameworks (DoDAF, MODAF and NAF). In particular, we analyse the support for modeling capabilities in these frameworks from the prism of a fundamental distinction in formal ontology: two-category vs. four-category ontology. By analyzing the current choices in these frameworks and identifying some adverse consequences, we are able to suggest well-founded recommendations for improvements.

In this regard, home alcohol distilling and alcohol consumption were chosen as a criterion illustrating the process of transformation of the peasant worldview. The study was conducted on the example of the Mordovian peasantry, which still had strong community traditions in the first half of the XX century. The source database consists of the documents taken from the Central State Archive of the Republic of Mordovia: the materials of the Ardatovskiy uezd committee of the All-Union Communist Party (b) and the Mokshaleyskiy, Tengushevskiy, Torbeevskiy volost committees of the All-Union Communist Party (b) represented by the protocols of village meetings, resolutions, instructions, reports of the party and Soviet authorities and law enforcement reports. The folkloric and ethnographic data were used in order to recreate the traditional community customs of the Mordovians.

TI  - PHENOMENOLOGIZATION OR NATURALIZATION? BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE
T2  - EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the major approaches towards the integration of philosophical and scientific perspectives on the nature and functioning of subjective consciousness. The project of naturalization of phenomenology is considered as an account of methodological unification of cognitive science and philosophy based on first-person perspective. This alliance is generally thought as an attempt to incorporate the explanatory models of phenomenology into the natural scientific worldview. The proponents of this approach, such as F. Varela, confirm that it can overcome the explanatory gap between the subjective first-person qualitative phenomenological data and third-person neurophysiological data, or at least it can contribute to the project of scientifically informed philosophy of mind, as in S. Gallagher's front load phenomenology. But is it really possible to build a scientific theory of consciousness? It seems that the project of naturalization contains the inevitable shortcomings which render it impossible to take the first person approaches in cognitive science "seriously". Hence, the first-person approach to consciousness cannot become the foundation of natural scientific theory of mind as part of nature. Phenomenological approaches to consciousness in the works of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty reject the primacy of the scientific objectivist world picture, claiming that the transcendental consciousness being the condition of possibility of truth and objectivity cannot be viewed from the objective point of view. Scientific worldview gives the incomplete picture of consciousness, eliminating its transcendental dimension. However, as I try to show, transcendentalism and naturalism as world projects can contribute into each other, retaining the circular relations between them. Phenomenology can integrate both world projects into holistic picture through phenomenologization, or denaturalization of natural science.

AB  - The European Copernicus programme generates massive amounts of Earth Observation (EO) data, with the goal of improving our environmental understanding and management on local, regional, and global level. An initiative of this magnitude comes with a set of challenges, especially pertaining to effective service management once the huge volumes of raster data files are distributed across open data centers and commercial companies.The BigDataCube project responds to this challenge through the concept of federated, analysis-ready datacubes, exposed via the open OGC geo standard interfaces 14 interoperable access and processing, WMS, WCS, and WCPS.Such federated datacube services have been established in the project between the public German Copernicus hub, CODE-DE, and a commercial cloud provider, cloudeo AG, altogether offering access to more than 500 TB. Both data pools are federated in a location-transparent manner, establishing a common information space where users can query and combine datacubes without knowing their location of storage. In this nucleus of a growing federation recently the Alfred Wegener maritime research institute has joined, and further data centers are in the line. The spectrum of functionality available is showcased through several realistic use cases, including a value-adding Sentinel-I SAR product on sea state and wind speed in the North Sea. The platform used is the pioneer datacube engine and OGC reference implementation, rasdaman. We report on the outcomes of the project, lessons learned, and further work foreseen in this area.

AB  - In this research paper author surveys the need of data protection from intelligent systems in the private and public sectors. For this, she identifies that the Smart Information Security Intel processes needs to be the suggestive key policy for both sectors of governance either public or private. The information is very sensitive for any organization. When the government offices are concerned, information needs to be abstracted and encapsulated so that there is no information stealing. For this purposes, the art of skill set and new optimized technology needs to be stationed. Author identifies that digital bar-coded air port like security using conveyor belts and digital bar-coded conveyor boxes to scan switched ON articles like internet of things needs to be placed. As otherwise, there can potentially be data, articles or information stealing from the operational sites where access is unauthorized. Such activities shall need to be scrutinized, minutely. The biometric such as fingerprints, iris, voice and face recognition pattern updates in the virtual data tables must be taken to keep data entry-exit log up to-date. The information technicians of the sentinel systems must help catch the anomalies in the professional working time in private and public sectors if there is red flag as indicator. The author in this research paper shall discuss in detail what we shall station, how we shall station and what all measures we might need to undertake to safeguard the stealing of sensitive information from the organizations like administration buildings, government buildings, educational schools, hospitals, courts, private buildings, banks and all other offices nation-wide. The TO-BE new processes shall make the AS-IS office system more information secured, data protected and personnel security stronger.

AB  - Change detection is the measure of land cover land use (LULC) transformation in a particular region within a period of time. Periodic and precise change detection of earth's surface feature is extremely important for understanding the relationship and interaction between human and earth surface feature for decision making in utilizing the natural resources [1]. Remotely sensed data or Satellite images are widely used for such purposes nowadays. In this study we are focusing on Triveni Sangam region, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India to find the change in water region where The Ganges and The Yamuna used to meet. We continued our research on the data set from Landsat-8 OLI Imagery from the year 2013 to the year 2018. This study will help us to find whether the Sangam region is expanding, shrinking or there is no change at all. If there is continuous expansion in water pixels then there could be situation of flood. No certain pattern of either increment or decrement in water pixels are found but with respect to year 2103 in further years up to 2018 it is observed that water pixels are replaced by majorly forest lands, sandy area and mixed barren lands and this is the novelty find in present work.

AB  - Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imagery) data is used to identify the water of the Ganges and the Yamuna in the Sangam region of Allahabad of Uttar Pradesh, India. Landsat-8 has eleven different bands and each band has its own significance in terms of remotely sensed information. The study exhibits the suitable band from these available eleven bands to classify the water of two rivers in the same class more accurately, either we use supervised or unsupervised classification schemes. The study will help to choose that band which will identify the water in such regions where different sources of water used to meet.

TI  - SPECIES COMPOSITION OF COMMERCIAL FISH CATCHES IN WATER BODIES OF THE STAVROPOL TERRITORY FOR THE PERIOD OF THE LATE XX - EARLY XXI CENTURIES
T2  - SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. The aim of the study is to analyze the species composition of commercial fish catches in water bodies of the Stavropol Territory for two periods from 1986 to the present. Methods. The first period from 1986 to 2003 is conventionally highlighted and the second period from 2009 to 2017. Data on linear and area characteristics of the territorial objects was obtained using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Results. In 2017, in the fish industry of the Stavropol Territory, 10.8 thousand tons of marketable fish were produced, which was about 70% of the best production level in 1990. The share of common carp production was 58%, silver carp -34%, white Amur -5% , other carp fish species -3%, trout and sturgeon -1%. In 2017, 1415 tons of fish seeds were produced bringing the total to 19 million units, which is 4 times less than in 1990. The importance of fish catching in providing the population of the region with fish is not so great in comparison with fish farming. In different periods of the last thirty years, the total annual catch in regional state water bodies (reservoirs) ranged from a maximum of 1065 tons (1990) to a minimum of 82 tons (2016). The average annual catch in all state water bodies for the period 1986 - 2003 amounted to 357 tons; fish productivity was 32 kg, with fluctuations from 2 to 113 kg/ha in eleven water bodies. Over the past 9 years, since 2009, the average annual catch in all state water bodies has decreased and amounted to 285 tons. Conclusion. For the period of 1986-2003, the average annual catch of common carp and silver crucian carp was 94 tons each and 79 tons of silver carp; the total share of these three species in catches was 85%. Over the past 9 years (2009-2017), the total share of these fish in the catches has decreased to 66%. The average annual catch of common carp and silver carps was almost halved, while the catch of less valuable silver crucian carp increased and reached 103 tons.

AB  - To date, there are roughly 1,957 active satellites and 17,494 inactive and debris objects that are currently tracked orbiting the globe. Each satellite's orbit varies by shape, size, and orientation depending on the satellites distinct function. Due to their diverse orbits and quantity, it is not feasible for analysts to simultaneously monitor all satellites; however, machine learning approaches allow for the automation of satellite characterization for space situational awareness (SSA). This project presents preliminary evidence of how machine learning applications can be used to model satellite behavior. Satellite data were modeled using the machine learning approaches of supervised classification, unsupervised clustering, and supervised neural networks. Supervised models were used to determine satellite stability as a critical feature for satellite characterization. Similarly, unsupervised techniques provided insight into satellite characterization by geospatial location and detection of anomalous behavior and maneuvers. Deep learning, using a recurrent neural network (RNN), predicted sequential satellite maneuvers over time. Together, these satellite modeling results have implications for providing surveillance and security in space.

T2  - 2019 IEEE SENSORS APPLICATIONS SYMPOSIUM (SAS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)
CL  - Sophia Antipolis, FRANCE
AB  - Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique for acquiring sparse signals at sampling rates much lower than the Nyquist rate. Traditionally to avoid generation of large sensing matrices for images, the columns or rows are compressed in the sensing phase. This increases the number of matrix multiplication operations and results in a compressed image with a different aspect ratio than the original uncompressed image. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we investigate a 2D deterministic sensing technique that maintains both the aspect ratio and the morphology of the image. We use a linear filtering-based measurement matrix. Through this paper, we demonstrate that deterministic CS will preserve the features and there by enable analysis of the images such as detection and identification of objects in the compressed domain without the need to perform a computationally expensive reconstruction. In order to demonstrate this, images obtained by infra-red electro-optic camera on an airborne platform (low resolution), LandSat (medium resolution) and multispectral images (high resolution) are chosen. Features of chosen objects from an uncompressed image are compared with those of corresponding objects in the compressed image using template matching to demonstrate that image analysis can be done in the compressed domain. Frobenius norm-based structural similarity analysis for the images at different levels of compression is presented to demonstrate the similarity in structure. Robustness of the deterministic CS technique is demonstrated through template matching using SURF algorithm.

TI  - Main Pattern of the Caspian Sea Surface Oil Pollution Revealed by Satellite Data
T2  - Ecologica Montenegrina
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, oil pollution has been the primary environmental problem of the Caspian Sea. In this paper, we present the results of our satellite survey in 2019 of the whole aquatic area of the Caspian Sea. These results reveal the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrocarbon films of various origins on the sea surface. Our primary attention was focused on the main types of petroleum hydrocarbon films polluting the sea surface. They get into the aquatic area via several different ways: (i) from natural marine hydrocarbon emissions from the seabed; (ii) from the mouths of numerous mud volcanoes; (iii) from offshore oil production and transportation; (iv) from oily wastewaters discharged by ships. We mapped the petroleum hydrocarbon pollution of the Caspian Sea surface on the base of satellite data. For each type of pollution, specific manifestation features were revealed, regions of regular pollution occurrence were outlined, and polluted areas were estimated. The relative contribution of every kind of pollution to the total oil pollution of the Caspian Sea is assessed on the base of satellite data. Comparison with the previous results of our long-term survey of the Caspian Sea is made. The problem of reliability of quantitative estimates of surfaced oil volumes on the base of slick areas seen in the satellite images is discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss applications of satellite remote sensing for detection and analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of oil showings on the sea surface due to natural hydrocarbon seafloor seeps in deep waters of the southeastern Black Sea. The study is based on the data obtained in the course of a satellite survey of the study region. The study region includes two areas of the heaviest oil pollution of the Black Sea surface. These are the areas of natural seepages off the Georgian coast near the town of Poti as well as the shelf area off the eastern coast of Turkey near the town of Rize. Our main result is the discovery of significant seasonal variability in the spatial distribution of natural oil films affected by local winds and surface currents prevailing in given periods.Further, we show that meso- and sub-mesoscale processes significantly affect the drift of natural oil spills. In the case of moderate winds and weak currents, the influence of these processes on the oil spills drift becomes paramount. We found that in 10-15 percent of cases, the oil film gets involved in vortical motions after its emersion on the sea surface, which often radically changes the trajectory of the slick propagation. Risks of oil surface pollution due to natural hydrocarbon showing are assessed for the test areas.

The analyzed data consist of a time-series of 38 Sentinel-1A GRD images acquired on a 12-days repeat cycle from July 2017 to October 2018 over Sapone in Burkina Faso. We show that the temporal change of backscatter corresponds to the soil moisture content rather than crops.

AB  - The article examines a promising method, which serves to strengthen reliability verification for methodological procedures in linguo-culturology. The authors have approbated the method for studying linguistic specificity of names of German linguo-cultural concepts SCHADEN-FREUDE, Fernweh and GONNEN. Studying specific or unique meanings of these concepts enabled us to define some peculiarities in the Germans' worldview and outlook compared with Ukrainian, Russian and British linguo-cultures. By verifying ethnic uniqueness of the concepts we also intended to explore their semantic correlates, which the recipients of the compared linguo-cultures understand clearly This point is especially important for the adequate transfer of ethno-unique concepts in cross-cultural communication.

AB  - The paper presents the methodology of free-run simulations for investigation of joint circulation of the Black and Azov Seas with high and ultra-high spatial resolution (4.5 and 1.1 km) and general characteristics of hydrophysical fields based on the results of simulations. Regional configurations used for numerical experiments are almost identical and differ only in spatial resolution with the corresponding tuning of the parameters of lateral turbulent mixing. We analyze the spatial variability of the results as well as water exchange between two basins through the Strait of Kerch. Enhancement of the resolution changes the structure of the basin circulation significantly and has to be validated using high resolution satellite data.

TI  - Dynamics of the Black Sea Upper Layer Based on Satellite Data: Gridded Altimetry versus High Resolution IR Images
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. During more than 20 years, very detailed notions of the sea level variability in the World Ocean and its particular parts have been obtained based on satellite altimetry observations. Their advantage consists in possibility of a fairly rapid assessment of the surface currents' velocities at meso scales. The alternative method for studying surface dynamics is motion estimation using a sequence of visible/infrared (IR) satellite images of the sea surface. The purpose of the present study is to compare the results obtaineds from application of two described methods used to analyze general circulation of the Black Sea surface layer.Methods and Results. The structure of the current fields in the northwestern Black Sea in winter, 1999 is investigated using the results of analysis of the IR image sequence from the NOAA/AVHRR sensors, as well as the gridded sea level anomaly (SLA) data (processing level L4) and the along-track measurements (level processing L3) from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. The surface currents' velocities are estimated based on the sea level field, which is calculated using two versions of mean dynamic topography. To compare the gridded altimetry and the results of the image sequence processing, a simple procedure is proposed for reconstructing the sea level using the current velocities' components.The results of reconstructing the surface circulation features by two methods were compared and demonstrated, in particular, the anticyclonic eddy locations in the northwestern part of the Black Sea. It is noted that the locations of the eddy center in the sea level fields reconstructed from the altimetry data and by processing of the IR image sequence are different. Evolution of the eddy is investigated using the SLA data. It is shown that its motion is rather intermittent in time that can be a result of applying the procedure of optimal interpolation.Conclusions. It is noted that the gridded satellite altimetry product from the CMEMS, being applied to the Black Sea basin, should be used with due regard for the provided information on the mapping errors.

AB  - According to the current main application mode of remote sensing satellites, users obtain the original image data, carries on the complex data processing, and get the required substantive content by filtering results after processing. The poor data timeliness, the large amount of data transmitted from satellite to ground, and the heavy workload of the ground processing system are main drawbacks of such modes. This article presents an intelligent onboard processing and multichannel transmission concept for infrared remote sensing satellites to solve above problems. Through applying cloud detection, fire spot detection, water pollution detection and other algorithms, infrared remote sensing data of the satellite payload is processed onboard, so that typical user-focused events with exact location information are discovered. The event information can be broadcast to the ground immediately through the short message channel of Chinese Beidou Navigation System, which is a real-time data transmission channel, so application users can quickly respond. In addition, there is a mid-speed data transmission channel for slicing images of areas of interest (AOI), as well as a high-speed data transmission channel for complete image data, to meet the needs of different users. In general, this article provides an overview of onboard information extraction and multichannel distribution for infrared remote sensing satellites, which can be used as a reference for satellite applications and engineering development.

AB  - The aim of the study is to develop a script and intelligent technology for collection and processing of heterogeneous data of field measurements and multispectral space imagery in order to identify and assess the state of natural objects. The core principle of the method is adaptive modeling and adjustment of an identification and evaluation technology of the properties of natural objects based on processing of multispectral space imagery, a geobotanical description and field measurements. As an example, we consider the problem of identification and evaluation of tundra vegetation using imagery from Sentinel-2 or Resource-P satellites. The results of the identification and assessment of the state of tundra vegetation are presented by a part of a vegetation map matching territories suitable for grazing deer in different seasons. The identification and assessment are focused on plant community types and possibility to feed reindeer in different seasons of the year. The testing results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed technology for collection and processing of heterogeneous data.

AB  - The goal of this paper refers to the potential in using new Sentinel-2 (S-2) remote sensing imagery and in situ surveying for mapping Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) woodlands in Calabria Region (Southern Italy), comparing them to other satellite platforms such as Landsat 8 operational land imager (L8 OLI). Considering that S-2 spectral bands are particularly suitable for estimating different vegetation cover characteristics, we propose a methodology for mapping the actual consistence of this habitat, using the vegetation spectral reflectance to evaluate cork oak spectral response. A set of different S-2 and L8 OLI scenes where freely downloaded and pre-processed (topographic and atmospheric correction, band anomaly detection) in order to better investigate cork oak spectral signature. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ND Red Edge index where calculated to obtain a high spectral resolution vegetation mask. Digital Elevation Model (DEM), signature training sets, Ground Control Points (GCPs) and ancillary data where used to perform a supervised classification of both S-2 and L8 OLI images. Furthermore, an accuracy assessment was applied to the classified images in order to evaluate user's and producer's accuracies. S-2 provides a great opportunity for global vegetation monitoring due to its enhanced spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics compared with Landsat.

AB  - This study investigated the spatial pattern of Cloud-to- Ground (CG) lightning flash density at the Goldengate highland National Park of South Africa from 2007 to 2017. Spatial statistic techniques were implemented in a Geographic Information System. Overall, CG lightning activity within the park were at its highest during summer month in December and afternoon with maxima times at 15 UTC and 17UTC. Moran I values were greater than zero for all months, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09 indicating positive spatial correlation of clustering of either high or low values of lightning strikes density except in July, 06 UTC and 08 UTC. Average Nearest Neighbour analysis also revealed that spatial pattern of lightning strikes point data was clustered throughout the day and all months. Incremental autocorrelation analysis revealed that clustering of lightning activity occurred over the spatial scale ranging from 1km to 8km. Hotspot Analysis Getis -Ord Gi* identified 23.76% of the park area as cluster of higher values (Hotspot areas) and 13.43% as cluster of lower values (cold spot area). The Lightning Index Map revealed that about 15.46% of the park fell under extreme lightning danger area covering mountainous region of the park. This study can provide useful information needed to guide tourist, protect infrastructure and improve local fire prevention action in the park.

AB  - Cloud segmentation is a vital task in applications that utilize satellite imagery. A common obstacle in using deep learning-based methods for this task is the insufficient number of images with their annotated ground truths. This work presents a content-aware unpaired image-to-image translation algorithm. It generates synthetic images with different land cover types from original images, while preserving the locations and the intensity values of the cloud pixels. Therefore, no manual annotation of ground truth in these images is required. The visual and numerical evaluations of the generated images by the proposed method prove that their quality is better than that of competitive algorithms.

AB  - Cloud detection in satellite images is an important first-step in many remote sensing applications. This problem is more challenging when only a limited number of spectral bands are available. To address this problem, a deep learning-based algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm consists of a fully convolutional network (FCN) that is trained by multiple patches of Landsat 8 images. This network, which is called Cloud-Net, is capable of capturing global and local cloud features in an image using its convolutional blocks. Since the proposed method is an end-to-end solution no complicated pre-processing step is required. Our experimental results prove that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method over a benchmark dataset by 8.7% in Jaccard Index.

TI  - Detection of Glacier Calving Margins with Convolutional Neural Networks: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous and precise mapping of glacier calving fronts is essential for monitoring and understanding rapid glacier changes in Antarctica and Greenland, which have the potential for significant sea level rise within the current century. This effort has been mostly restricted to the slow and painstaking manual digitalization of the calving front positions in thousands of satellite imagery products. Here, we have developed a machine learning toolkit to automatically detect glacier calving front margins in satellite imagery. The toolkit is based on semantic image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a modified U-Net architecture to isolate the calving fronts from satellite images after having been trained with a dataset of images and their corresponding manually-determined calving fronts. As a case study we train our neural network on a varied set of Landsat images with lowered resolutions from Jakobshavn, Sverdrup, and Kangerlussuaq glaciers, Greenland and test the results on images from Helheim glacier, Greenland to evaluate the performance of the approach. The neural network is able to identify the calving front in new images with a mean deviation of 96.3 m from the true fronts, equivalent to 1.97 pixels on average, while the corresponding error for manually-determined fronts on the same resolution images is 92.5 m (1.89 pixels). We find that the trained neural network significantly outperforms common edge detection techniques, and can be used to continuously map out calving-ice fronts with a variety of data products.

AB  - Land reclamation process has a significant negative influence on the coastal environments. Landsat TM and OLI/TIRs data were utilized to detect land reclamation on the Lingding Bay coastal area since 1973 and its impact on LST in a decade interval from 1987 to 2016. VNIR spectral data were used to produce land use, impervious surfaces composition, and vegetation composition analysis; and TIR spectral data were used to retrieve LST of reclamation areas. It was found a total area of 270 square kilometres in Lingding Bay was added to the land surface during the study period. 92.5% of land reclamation areas' land use was for agriculture purposes in 1987, and this percentage decreased to only 58.5% in 2016. For land use in urban areas, the LST over land reclamation areas was increased from 0.11 degrees C in 1987 to 1.3C in 1997, 1.9C in 2007 and reached 2.4C above the water surface temperature average in 2016. To reduce the negative effects of land reclamation on LST, this study is strongly recommended the aqua-agriculture land use as the first option for land use on land reclamation areas. Besides, landscape composition and configuration have to be well considered in urban areas planning, by increasing green spaces, water surfaces, and sky-view.

AB  - Information about land covers is essential for a variety of purposes, such as environmental studies, sustainable development, and regional managements. This study aims to use a novel combination model to generate a land cover map in a part of the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, where there are different kind of land covers, including tea plantation, florification and forest. Because of the high similarity in land covers of the study area, only through satellite imageries with a high spatial and spectral resolution the land covers can be differentiated. We have combined satellite imageries of Sentinel-1 (S1A, GRD, IW) and Landsat-8 (Operational land imager) for the year 2017 as well as different algorithms of Maximum Likelihood (ML), Minimum Distance (MD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results showed that the combination model is an applicable technique for extracting land covers in areas with high similarities in land covers. The overall accuracy of the confusion matrix and the Kappa Coefficient are 98.1984% and 0.9579, respectively, which indicate that it is a robust model for extracting land covers in areas like the Cameron Highlands. The obtained results can be useful for different purposes, including urban and environmental management, change detection, agriculture and many more purposes.

AB  - Accurate quantification of water balance components in large lakes is of great importance in assessing the changes in hydrological components, and subsequent variations in lakes water balance. The water balance of Urmia Lake in northwestern Iran was quantitatively analyzed in the year 2005 using remotely-sensed data (e.g. evapotranspiration and precipitation) and meteorological data. The analysis was based on GIS operations. For this purpose, the estimation of pixel-scaled monthly evapotranspiration (ET) was conducted via the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) using time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and meteorological data; precipitation was derived from the monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations; surface runoff was estimated by the empirical formula; and finally, the computations of recharge were carried out using the water balance approach for the winter months where estimation of ET and surface runoff were subtracted from precipitation. Water balance components were quantified for the lake and the lake basin separately. Results showed that the water balance components calculated by remote sensing were in conformity with the reported figures in the literature. According to the results of the water balance method, Urmia Lake was suffering from a negative water balance of 3443 MCM yr(-1). Findings of this study demonstrated the application of the derived satellite data in estimating lake's water balance components in order to improve the accuracy of the lake water budget calculation.

AB  - Rice is a staple food across the majority of the world's population that is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050 and will require approximately 60% more food. In season and accurate information on the spatiotemporal distribution of rice cultivation, phenology across the region and spatial distribution of yield is of significant importance. This information is used by various stakeholders such as government, policymakers, insurance companies, and agri-input companies. Methods involving manual surveys for developing spatial crop yield are constrained by short harvest window and availability of the skilled human resource. Estimation of regional crop yield with precision and accuracy requires the use of high-resolution remote sensing data. The key contribution of this study is the spatial estimation of rice yield by assimilation of parameters derived from Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 satellite into a process-based Oryza crop growth simulation model. The study has been carried out in four districts of coastal Andhra Pradesh, India viz., Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari and West Godavari during monsoon season locally called KharY' (mid-Jun. to mid-Dec.) 2018. In the study area, rice is transplanted during mid-Jun to Aug. end and harvested from Oct. to mid-Dec. months. The methodology for in-season regional rice area estimation using random forest classifier has been described in our previous work. This study provides insights into the estimation of rice crop phenology and Leaf Area Index (LAI) using early time series of Sentinel-1 SAR observations. The rice phenology parameter such as Start of the Season (SoS) is estimated using Sentinel-1 SAR time series available during Jun.-Sept. 2018. The pixel-wise SoS estimation method comprises finding the local minima from the time series and image compositing. Total of six different SoS estimates is considered to cover early and late transplanted areas. The equation presented in literature has been used to estimate LAI from VH backscatter. Further, to facilitate the compute intensive crop growth simulation task and cover maximum variation, the estimated LAI was categorized into five classes. Other datasets required for crop growth simulation such as weather was obtained from NOAA. A lookup table based approach was used wherein yield simulations were generated considering live SoS classes, live LAI classes, and four weather combinations. The total of 120 yield simulations were finally' mapped to each pixel's SoS, LAI, and weather categories. The plot-wise crop yield data for fifty-two (52) plots was collected for independent validation of yield estimates. The comparison of simulated and actual yield showed Normalized Root Mean Squared Value (NRMSE) of 9.21%. The overall agreement between actual and simulated yield is 83-89%. The results showed that spatialization of crop growth simulation for yield estimation using remote sensing observations provides fairly accurate yield estimates. Also, it is observed that the look-up table based approach reduced the computational complexity and crop growth model simulation time.

AB  - Accurate and reliable information on Spatio-temporal extent of surface water is critical for various agriculture/environmental applications such as drought, flood monitoring, and understanding the availability of surface water for irrigation. Remote sensing (Optical as well as SAR) datasets are extremely useful to monitor surface water at massive scale. In monsoon months the optical remote sensing observations over semi-arid Indian sub-continent are obstructed due to cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a useful alternative for year-round monitoring of the surface water bodies. Sentinel-1A and 1B are very useful to monitor the changes at very high spatial resolution and frequently due to its high spatiotemporal resolution. The main objective is to establish an operational methodology for estimation of spatiotemporal variations in the surface water availability using Sentinel-1A and 1B observations. The study has been carried out in four districts of Coastal Andhra Pradesh, India viz. Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari, and West Godavari. Training data for water vs. non-water (vegetation, forest, settlements, and barren lands) classes have been obtained from field visits and high-resolution Google Map overlay in Google Earth Engine. We divided the dataset into 70% data for model training and 30% for validation and evaluated the performance of tuned random forest classifier on the validation dataset. Results show the classification accuracy of 94.32%. Further, current and historical weather observations such as rainfall were used to assess the validity of spatiotemporal surface water layers. We found a good agreement between the rainfall and surface water availability. We observed the increase in the surface water area during July-August months due to rainfall as well as flooding in the rice fields during transplanting. We propose to use the crop area map, spatiotemporal surface water layers and weather observations for drought assessment i.e., historical drought events and areas prone to agricultural drought.

TI  - Advertisements Shape Our Social Reality: A Study of Apple Advertisements on Promoting PWDs and Inclusion
T2  - INTELLECTUAL DISCOURSE
M3  - Article
AB  - There are persons with disabilities (PWDs) in each society. The inclusion of PWDs by society, as supported by the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs), could be encouraged by advertising. Advertising's influence on one's worldview is obvious with cultivation theory espousing the phenomenon that prolonged viewing of television could fashion audiences' worldview by making them believe that the images projected are accurate depictions of reality. PWDs not only nurture compassion within us but provide us with a wealth of opportunities by coming up with inventions that improve their quality of life. These inventions could empower PWDs by giving them greater independence. The global brand, Apple, through its technological devices, gives PWDs jobs, a platform for expression and dignity. Apple has created a series of video advertisements that depict its embrace of inclusion through its technological innovations. The study examines selected Apple's video advertisements using critical discourse analysis (CDA). The outcome of the study is a framework for brands to use as a guide when incorporating advertising images on the inclusion of PWDs.

TI  - Topographical distribution of sentinel nodes and metastases from T1-T2 oral squamous cell carcinomas
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objective is to investigate the topographical distribution of sentinel nodes (SNs) and lymph node metastases in T1-2cN0 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs).Methods: The study entailed a prospective enrolment of 220 patients with clinical T1-2N0 OSCCs who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) followed by gamma probe- guided sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Patients with positive SNs were treated with completion neck dissection. Excised lymph nodes were grouped into the neck level according to the international guidelines.Results: The SN detection rate by LSG was 99.1%. Patients with midline tumours had bilateral lymphatic drainage on LSG in 15/21 (71.5%). There were 45/199 (22.6%) patients with lateralised tumours that had unexpected bilateral or contralateral drainage patterns on LSG. Fifty-five patients (25.0%) were SLNB positive, and metastases were found in 72/781 (9.2%) of the excised SNs. Metastatic involvement of neck level IV was rare and only observed in patients with anterior tongue cancer. No patients had level V involvement. Eleven patients developed isolated cervical recurrences, with no new primary tumour as origin. The SLNB procedure ensured an overall sensitivity of 83.3% and a negative predictive value of 93.3%.Conclusion: Completion neck dissection of level I-III in SLNB-positive patients might be sufficient in most patients with OSCC except patients with anterior tongue cancer, but further studies are needed to support this potential therapeutic algorithm. Our study showed that SLNB was helpful in clarifying unexpected bilateral or contralateral metastatic drainage patterns. In our cohort, 8/55 patients with occult metastasis would have been missed by elective neck dissection of the ipsilateral neck. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does developers' ownership structure shape their market behavior? Evidence from state owned enterprises in Chengdu, Sichuan, 2004-2011
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Real estate development is a complex speculative endeavor and developer firms take a variety of forms throughout the world. State run development companies are relatively common and China is no exception. State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have played a major role in China's transition to a market-based real estate sector, yet we know relatively little about the housing they build relative to private companies currently. To assess how their performance differs from private companies, we use a comprehensive set of georeferenced housing transactions, joined with remote sensing data and data on neighborhood amenities and transportation infrastructure, to analyze the dynamics of the Chengdu housing market from 2004 to 2011. We observe a drop in the variation in housing price and size, as well as a growing premium for larger units that we connect to changes in government regulations. Importantly, we find that units developed by SOE sell at a discount of roughly 7%. To explain this discount, we draw on literature and examine pricing strategy, difficult to measure quality elements, preferred treatment by local governments, and efforts to fulfill social goals related to housing provision. The study outlines directions for future research and we recommend the Chinese government formalize the relationship between SOEs in national housing policy to facilitate the production of lower-cost housing in a more consistent and equitable manner.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of physical parameters such as soil moisture (SM) is crucial to improve food sustainability and risks mitigation. Because of the spatio-temporal variations in SM, satellite observations are an excellent tool to monitor its dynamic. Among different operational satellite missions, the NASA SMAP mission offers a unique opportunity to monitor SM worldwide thanks to its frequency band of operation (L-band). The main goal of this mission was the disaggregation of brightness temperature (TB) at 36 km to 9km using backscatter images at 3 km. Although the SMAP mission was designed to collect simultaneously radar/radiometer observations, due to a failure in the radar in July 2015, only the radiometer continues working. Among different options to compensate the lack of information from the L-band radar, the exploitation of C-band active information with L-band passive observations to disaggregate TB and produce SM at fine resolution has been proposed. Recently, the NASA SMAP team delivered a new SM product using this approach. However, this new product has not been validated over forested areas yet. In this work, we present the results of implementing a disaggregation algorithm based on the baseline SMAP downscaling approach over a tropical forest located in Southern Mexico, using information from the SMAP radiometer and Sentinel1 images.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In this paper, the problem of the classification of multiresolution and multisensor remotely sensed data is addressed by proposing a multiscale Markov mesh model. Multiresolution and multisensor fusion are jointly achieved through an explicitly hierarchical probabilistic graphical classifier, which uses a quadtree structure to model the interactions across different spatial resolutions, and a symmetric Markov mesh random field to deal with contextual information at each scale and favor applicability to very high resolution imagery. Differently from previous hierarchical Markovian approaches, here, data collected by distinct sensors are fused through either the graph topology itself (across its layers) or decision tree ensemble methods (within each layer). The proposed model allows taking benefit of strong analytical properties, most remarkably causality, which make it possible to apply time-efficient non-iterative inference algorithms.

TI  - A Sentinel-1-based clustering analysis for geo-hazards mitigation at regional scale: a case study in Central Italy
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade satellite remote sensing has become an effective tool for monitoring geo-hazard-induced ground motions, and has been increasingly used by the scientific community. Direct and indirect costs due to geo-hazards are currently rising, causing serious socio-economics and casualty losses. Therefore, creating a priority list turns out to be essential to highlight the most relevant ground deformations and to better focus risk management practices at regional scale. The Sentinel-1 constellation, thanks to the 6-days repeatability and the free availability of the data, allows to easily update the geo-hazard-induced ground motions, compared to other kind of satellite sensors. In this work, a hot-spot-like method is presented by filtering a large stack of Sentinel-1 images processed by means of the SqueeSAR algorithm. Three periods, with six months repetitiveness, have been analysed in order to evaluate the behaviour and evolution of deformation clusters. The target area is Tuscany Region, located in the central part of Italy and affected by a wide gamma of geohazards, ranging from landslides to large subsidence areas. The final output is a geo-database of ground motions that can be used by regional authorities to prioritize and to effectively plan local risk reduction actions.

AB  - Aims To survey and to characterize entomopathogenic fungi as natural enemies of mosquitoes in Central Brazil. Methods and Results Tolypocladium cylindrosporum (Hypocreales, Ophiocordycipitaceae) was isolated for the first time in South America by using Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae) as sentinel larvae in a stagnant mosquito breeding site in a secondary tropical forest. Two isolates were morphologically and molecularly identified, and their activity tested against A. aegypti eggs, larvae and adults. Conclusions Findings emphasize the importance of T. cylindrosporum as a natural fungal antagonist of mosquitoes. Significance and Impact of the Study Both isolates affected larvae and adults but were less effective against eggs; both have potential for development as a mycoinsecticide especially against larvae of A. aegypti the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, Zika and urban yellow fever.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a framework for geocoding error correction of point clouds obtained from Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) in urban areas. The horizontal positioning bias of Persistent Scatterers (PS) is mitigated by applying geodetic and atmospheric corrections to the PS azimuth and range timings. Furthermore, the vertical positioning bias, caused due to the unknown height of the PSI reference point, is estimated and compensated for by the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based Ground Control Point (GCP)s. Experimental results based on cross-heading pairs of TerraSAR-X (TS-X) high resolution spotlight images over the city of Berlin, Germany and in Oulu, Finland are presented. For selected test sites, the localization accuracy of the point clouds is analyzed with respect to a reference LiDAR data, which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed correction approach.

AB  - We present an unsupervised tool for the automatic generation of co-seismic displacement maps by using satellite Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique. The tool relies on the use of Sentinel-1 SLC Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) data and main earthquake information, the latter retrieved from on-line global catalogs. In particular, the tool collects location, depth and magnitude of a seismic event and immediately triggers the data download and the interferometric process over the area affected by the earthquake. The generated DInSAR results (mainly interferograms and displacement maps) are then made available to the Solid Earth scientific community through the EPOS Research Infrastructure. Moreover, the implemented system is also used to serve the Italian Department of Civil Protection in case of main seismic events in Italy. Finally, due to the Sentinel-1 characteristics, the obtained results can contribute to the generation of a global database of DInSAR co-seismic displacement maps.

TI  - SAR and Lidar Temporal Data Fusion Approaches to Boreal Wetland Ecosystem Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a decision-based methodology, focused on data fusion for wetland classification based on surface water hydroperiod and associated riparian (transitional area between aquatic and upland zones) vegetation community attributes. Multi-temporal, multi-mode data were examined from airborne Lidar (Teledyne Optech, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, Titan), synthetic aperture radar (Radarsat-2, single and quad polarization), and optical (SPOT) sensors with near-coincident acquisition dates. Results were compared with 31 field measurement points for six wetlands at riparian transition zones and surface water extents in the Utikuma Regional Study Area (URSA). The methodology was repeated in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) to determine the transferability of the methods to other boreal environments. Water mask frequency analysis showed accuracies of 93% to 97%, and kappa values of 0.8-0.9 when compared to optical data. Concordance results comparing the semi-permanent/permanent hydroperiod between 2015 and 2016 were found to be 98% similar, suggesting little change in wetland surface water extent between these two years. The results illustrate that the decision-based methodology and data fusion could be applied to a wide range of boreal wetland types and, so far, is not geographically limited. This provides a platform for land use permitting, reclamation monitoring, and wetland regulation in a region of rapid development and uncertainty due to climate change. The methodology offers an innovative time series-based boreal wetland classification approach using data fusion of multiple remote sensing data sources.

AB  - This paper explores the spatial relationship between mining and agricultural activities towards meeting the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Northwest Ghana. Agenda 2030 SDGs highlight the importance of poverty reduction, livelihood enhancement, and food security. A state's natural resources include both non-agricultural and agricultural resources. There is a renewed interest in large-scale mining in Ghana, entering into previously underexplored areas in the Northwest, an area dominated by agriculture. With the emergence of mining in this region, this study combines both satellite imagery, covering years 2000,2010 and 2018, and ground truthing data to conduct baseline studies and assess changes in land use over time. We compared known data sets and field knowledge with satellite data to objectively measure changes in the distribution of surface water, farmlands and grasscover over time. The study finds increasing areas of surface water, abundant grasscover and farmlands within leases in the area. These growing abundance of land use and land cover types provide opportunities for commercial livestock keeping, extensive and intensive crop farming. The classified satellite images revealed the existence of more farmlands and potential cultivable areas than reported by agriculture extension offices. Most of these areas overlap with mining concessions and could he modelled for commercial food production and local job creation. The occurrence of mining and agricultural activities in rural subsistence farming communities often indicate conflict. However, a co-exitence of both sectors has a strong opportunity to drive inclusive growth for smallholder farmers; reduce poverty, generate income and uphold sustainable development.

AB  - The quest to achieve industrialisation and economic diversification has brought a new form of thinking current among African leadership, which has implications for geo-space and rural livelihood. Governments are leasing large tracts of rural lands for mineral resource extraction. However, little attention has been given to developing baseline conditions that would facilitate a possible peaceful co-existence between large-scale mining and agriculture which is a basic rural livelihood activity. Hence, this study appraises land use/cover conditions of the Northwest mining region of Ghana to identify the availability of space for farming and large-scale mining exploration activities at the village level. The study uses a combination of Landsat satellite imagery for the years 2000 and 2014, and Participatory Geographic Information Systems to classify the landscape into four major land use/cover types, namely: water, waterlog, vegetation and occupied lands. Occupied lands include farmlands, settlements and hare grounds. It is found that between 2000 and 2014, much of the area is characterised by waterlog features and flood potentials juxtaposed to an increasing large-scale exploration and mining activities interest in local space. Overall, the net gain of space by occupied lands is about 47% of total land cover in the area. Much of this gain is in the Nadowli-Kaleo and Jirapa areas of the study region where exploration leases are wide-spreading. It is also observed that there is an expansion of barelands and settlements in the villages around the exploration and mine sites. This phenomenon is a signal of potential land use conflict between mining and farming in villages nearby and must be addressed before mine commissioning.

TI  - Debris properties and mass-balance impacts on adjacent debris-covered glaciers, Mount Rainier, USA
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The north and east slopes of Mount Rainier, Washington, are host to three of the largest glaciers in the contiguous United States: Carbon Glacier, Winthrop Glacier, and Emmons Glacier. Each has an extensive blanket of supraglacial debris on its terminus, but recent work indicates that each has responded to late twentieth-and early twenty-first-century climate changes in a different way. While Carbon Glacier has thinned and retreated since 1970, Winthrop Glacier has remained steady and Emmons Glacier has thickened and advanced. There are several possible climatic and dynamic factors that can account for some of these disparities, but differences in supraglacial debris properties and distribution have not been systematically evaluated. We combine field measurements and satellite remote sensing analysis from a 10-day period in the 2014 melt season to estimate both the debris thickness distribution and key debris thermal properties on Emmons Glacier. A simplified energy-balance model was then used with debris surface temperatures derived from Landsat 8 thermal infrared bands to estimate the distribution of debris across all three debris-covered termini. The results suggest that differences in summer balance among these glaciers can be partly explained by differences in the thermal resistance of their debris mantles.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of conjunctival melanoma: current insights
T2  - CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in conjunctival melanoma (CM).Methods: This article provides a review of the literature from PUBMED.Results: Data on SLNB in the management of CM are scarce and only two relatively large cohorts have been reported. Although indication criteria for SLNB vary slightly, positive findings can be expected in 11%-13% of CM cases, including small tumors. False negative SLNB findings are rare (< 10%). Failure to identify SLNB has been attributed to the surgical learning curve and recurrent tumors with scar tissue impeding spread of the tracer material. Reported 5-year survival rate following CM management including SLNB, is up to 79%, but there are no comparative cohort studies proving the assumed benefit. Adverse events reported were non-severe and transient.Conclusion: Patients can potentially benefit from SLNB and the procedure can be offered to eligible patients. However, there is not enough evidence to support SLNB as a mandatory part of CM management.

TI  - INDIGENOUS SCHOOL EDUCATION AGAINST EPISTEMICIDE
T2  - PERSPECTIVAS EM DIALOGO-REVISTA DE EDUCACAO E SOCIEDADE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to address school education, especially indigenous school education, considering the latter as an attempt to fight against epistemicide, an education for the survival of diversity among knowledges. By means of a comparison between the curriculum of an indigenous school and an urban school, it is intended to reflect on the intense struggle waged by indigenous peoples in Brazil, through education, a struggle for recognition, a collective right to be and to live according to one's own worldview. Nowadays, one can see in the indigenous villages an educational model that tries to follow a different path from what has historically been traced; a struggle to affirm the different in a world that legitimates only what fits within the capitalist model of society.

AB  - In alteration discovery analysis, image misalignment still remains a pesky issue, although such discovery would be is entirely determined by the accuracy of image registration. If the procedure of alteration detection is done on images that are not aligned properly, problems may accrue in the form of missed or wrong alterations. This, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the correctness of actual change detection. This paper's aim is to propose a methodology about the recognition of change technique that is expected to curtail the influence exerted by improper alignment of images. And to effect this, the method of detecting alternations or changes based on pixel is being advanced, as this suggested method would deal with errors arising out of mis-registration effectively. The technique proposed here involves image stitching by combining two or more images of the same scene as a single larger image. Block matching technique is a way of locating matching blocks in a sequence of image for the purpose of image estimation. To spot the alteration in image, the use of image differencing is being advocated. It is anticipated that the suggested experimental steps would yield a top rate of accuracy.

TI  - Wavelet approach applied to EVI/MODIS time series and meteorological data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the phenology of different types of grasslands from the Pampa and Mata Atlantica biomes in the southern region of Brazil and its relation with meteorological variables, in a time series of EVI/MODIS data using the Wavelet approach (Transform - WT - and Coherence - WC). There is a lack of studies focusing on how climate variability influences the phenology of different Brazilian Pampa grassland typologies. This information is essential to describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of grasslands and contribute to actions of sustainable management and conservation strategies, threatened by crops, forestry, and expansion of overgrazed cattle farms. A series of EVI/MODIS acquired from February 2000 to December 2014, totaling 342 images, were sampled for each of the 10 grassland typologies at the study area. Mean EVI data and the WT indicated when and where changes in the grassland phenological dynamics occurred. The WC, applied to the EVI/MODIS time series with (i) rainfall and (ii) air temperature, helped to identify the correlation between the data. Two well - defined cycles were identified: annual, ranging from 1 to 23 observations, and interannual, from 92 to 184 observations. The different grassland typologies showed similar phenological patterns, although some spatial dependency was observed and related to the different soil and terrain morphometry at the study area. The influence of those abiotic factors on the grassland vegetation, phonological events and their expression on the EVI was also spatially dependent and strongly linked to weather conditions (e.g., the permanence of humidity after rainfall in shallow soils) and climate. The correlation between EVI and air temperature was stronger in the annual cycle for all grassland typologies. For the interannual cycles, El Nino and La Nina events caused higher correlation between EVI data and rainfall.

T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to characterize the average seasonal pattern of the vegetation in southern grassland in Brazil, and the variability found in the time series of vegetation indices. It also sought to identify similarities in the seasonal pattern of different grassland typologies. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) images from Feb to Dec, 2000 to 2014 were analyzed for ten regions. The grassland typologies studied showed EVI and NDVI profiles consistent with the seasonal dynamics of grassland vegetation under the influence of a subtropical climate, with highest values in the indices during the warm seasons of the year (spring and summer) and lowest in the colder seasons (autumn and winter). Considering the values of EVI and NDVI, grassland typologies were allocated to four groups with similar temporal profiles. Among the groups formed from the EVI index it is possible to identify differences between grassland typologies during the autumn and winter, while the NDVI showed differences only in winter as compared to the other seasons.

TI  - The Continental Impact of European Forest Conservation Policy and Management on Productivity Stability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological impact of continental scale land-use policies that influence forest management is often difficult to quantify. European forest conservation began in 1909 with a marked increase in designated areas with the inception of Natura 2000 in the early 1990s. It has been shown that increases in European forest mortality may be linked to climate variability. Measuring productivity response to climate variability may be a valid proxy indicating a forest's ability to bear this disturbance. Net Primary Production (NPP) response to climate variability has also been linked to functional diversity within forests. Using a European specific annual MODIS NPP estimates, we assess the NPP response to climate variability differences between actively managed forests, which experience human interventions and conserved, Protected Area (PA) forests with minimal to no human impact. We found, on the continental scale, little to no differences in NPP response between managed and conserved forests. However, on the regional scale, differences emerge that are driven by the historic forest management practices and the potential speciation of the area. Northern PA forests show the same NPP response to climate variability as their actively managed counter parts. PA forests tend to have less NPP response to climate variability in the South and in older conserved forests. As the time a forest has been designated, as a PA, extends past its typically actively managed rotation length, greater differences begin to emerge between the two management types.

AB  - The hydrographic basins have been adopted as physical units of recognition, characterization and evaluation, in order to facilitate the approach on the water resources. In this context, the present study aims at perform the morphometric characterization of the Enganado River basin, Rondonia. The geometric, relief and drainage characteristics of the Alos satellite, Palsar sensor, with a resolution of 12.5 m and a L band were analyzed. The microbasin has an area of 152.64 km(2), minimum altitude of 255 m and maximum of 582 m, predominantly soft undulating relief (41.45%). The drainage has a sixth order dendritic distribution, with high density and main course considered rambling, and concentration time of 6 h and 26 min. The microbasin is elongated, not subject to flooding, as its relief influences the low runoff speed.

AB  - The brief introduction to this volume begins by introducing the sources, authors and questions with which the subsequent chapters will be dealing, namely the ten 'treatises' (zhi)-histories of technical subjects-now contained in the History of Sui (Sui shu)-a state history of the Sui dynasty (581-618) written in 636-three of which we know to be written by Li Chunfeng (602-670). After that, it explains how the book is structured and the four underlying themes uniting the contributors' chapters: (1) the recycling of sources and the question of reliability and objectivity in pre-modern history-writing; (2) the tug of war between conservatism and innovation as regards generic exemplars; (3) the imposition of the author's voice, worldview and personal and professional history in writing a history of some field of technical expertise in a state history; (4) the degree to which the modern historian is implied in the same cycle of writing histories from older histories to speak to her own milieu and ideological contentions. Lastly, we introduce the conventions, symbols, etc., adopted in the following chapter.

T2  - Movebank Data Repository
M3  - Data study
AB  - The pastoral system in the Far North Region of Cameroon is best described as an open system in which mobile pastoralists have open access to common-pool grazing resources. We hypothesized that there is a self-organizing management system of open access to common-pool grazing resources and predicted that we would find an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) of mobile pastoralists within seasonal grazing areas. In this paper we used mobility data and remote sensing data from two seasonal grazing areas at the end of the dry season in three consecutive years to evaluate that hypothesis. We found evidence of an IFD in the two seasonal grazing areas of the Logone Floodplain and the Lake Maga area. These findings offer further support for our hypothesis that there is a complex adaptive system in which pastoralists distribute themselves effectively over available grazing resources.

TI  - Satellite ocean colour algorithm for <i>Prochlorococcus</i>, <i>Synechococcus</i>, and picoeukaryotes concentration retrieval in the South China Sea
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for retrieval of surface waters cell concentrations (in cell/ml) for three picophytoplankton components, Prochlorococcus (Pro), Synechococcus (Syn), and picoeukaryotes (Peuk) in the South China Sea (SCS), from ocean colour satellite data was developed and tested. Level 3 merged multisensor Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative satellite data is used. Training is performed using in situ data on abundances of the three phytoplankton components. Several predictors derived from satellite reflectance data were tested. The regression form that assures the highest accuracy of the algorithm was chosen based on cross-validation (CV). According to the CV on test data subset, the algorithm performance is characterized by the r value 0.89, 0.72, and 0.73 and MAPD 38, 71 and 51% for Peuk, Pro, and Syn respectively. This is one of the few studies aimed at the Peuk, Pro, and Syn distribution research in the northern SCS using ocean colour satellite data. This is the only research providing algorithm with accuracy estimates of the Peuk, Pro, and Syn concentrations retrieval from the ocean colour data. Analysis of the developed algorithm allows us to conclude that both mechanisms (specific spectral features caused by pigments composition and spectrum features sensitive to general primary productivity, e.g. band ratios in 443-510 nm range and spectrum absolute values) are important for getting accurate information on the picophytoplankton composition.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNICITY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Floyd etal. v The City of New York (2013), the federal district court judge ruled that the New York Police Department (NYPD) was engaging in unconstitutional stop-and-frisk practices that targeted predominately Black and Latino New Yorkers. Among the major decisions made in Floyd (2013), the judge identified "Furtive Movement" as being a weak indicator for establishing the reasonable suspicion needed to justify a Terry stop. Moreover, the judge recognized that "Furtive Movement" is a vague and subjective term, which may be affected by unconscious bias and lead to racial and ethnic disparities in stop outcomes. Building on the judge's concern about unconscious bias, the current study attempts to (1) provide a theoretical framework for understanding how police officers' worldview may contribute to or interact with unconscious biases and to (2) examine whether NYPD officers are more likely to stop Black and Hispanic New Yorkers than their White counterparts for the reason of "Furtive Movement." The latter inquiry is explored using NYPD stop-and-frisk data from 2011, 2013, and 2016. The social scientific implications of this research provide support for (1) the judge's apprehension toward police stops on the basis of furtive gestures and (2) the effectiveness of court-ordered intervention.

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Machine learning has been very actively used in analysis of remote sensing data and for a wide range of applications such as agriculture, land and ice surface change detection, etc. In this paper, we explore use of machine learning methods for forest inventory, since it has great impact on economic and ecological sustainability. Our approach is based on UAV data from hyperspectral and LiDAR sensors. A particular case described in the present paper showcases how aerial survey data achieves high classification accuracy of forest tree species. Moreover, applicability of different data types such as LiDAR and hyperspectral (NIR and VIS) for the task at hand is investigated. In the paper we present the solution in its full scope, starting from remote and in-situ data acquisition and pre-processing, to automatic tree species classification and recognition using machine learning algorithms, as well, as further analysis of the results. In the initial stage, during an expedition to the northern region of Arkhangelsk (Russia), airborne data (LiDAR and hyperspectral) and manually recording of trees locations and species were collected. Afterwards, an object-based classification has been performed by detecting individual tree crowns beforehand with the help of LiDAR data. Various hyperspectral features have been calculated for use in classification algorithms complemented by on-ground spectroscopic benchmark data. In this paper, we prove applicability of the proposed method and workflow in real life application. Results validation was done using data from the observation parcels, where trees were manually labeled. The next step is design of a system with finely tuned filters, which will make possible robust species classification at a cost much lower than hyperspectral imaging.

AB  - within the framework of CAMEVAR project, the CAMELINA Operating Group (OG) performed a screening test to validate the suitability of Sentinel-2B satellite family sensing systems and GreenSeeker handheld device to estimate the production of different varieties of Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz trough the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This agro-environmental monitoring technique allows to follow the evolution of the vigor of the camelina crops and to keep track on the crop during its life cycle. We used this technique to assess and estimate the growing and yield of each one of the varieties before harvesting, and study if they were significant differences that could lead to a prediction in the final seed yield. Statistical results showed that there were significant differences on the NDVI index of each variety and correlation between the acquisition techniques, but there was no correlation between the NDVI index and the final yield of each variety.

TI  - Calculation of the aboveground carbon stocks with satellite data and statistical models integrated into the climatic parameters in the Alborz Mountain forests (northern Iran)
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest ecosystems of northern Iran in the Alborz Mountains with a wide distribution range have variations in the composition and types of the plants, soil, structure, carbon stocks and climatic conditions. This study investigated the use of a satellite database and climatic parameters in estimating the carbon reserves. Three regions were selected for the distribution range of these forests. The data of 4 climatic parameters (MAP, MHR, MAE and MAT) were modelled based on the relationship with an elevation gradient. 5 spectral vegetation indices (RVI, NDVI, SR, NDGI, DVI and TVI) and near-infrared band (NIR) extracted from the satellite data and the aboveground carbon data of these forests were modelled based on a regression analysis. Finally, the best model of the relationship between the climate variables and the carbon stocks and the satellite indices was obtained from the multivariate linear regression equation and the R-2 coefficient. Accordingly, the most influential climatic parameters on the carbon stocks of these forests were precipitation, temperature, and also the most significant indices were NDVI, RVI and NIR band. This research is an attempt to model the calculations of the aboveground carbon in the forests of northern Iran in relation to the climatic parameters using satellite imagery.

AB  - C-band high resolution radar (SAR, for Synthetic Aperture Radar) is the only space-borne instrument able to probe at very high resolution and over all ocean basins the sea surface under extreme conditions. As part of the space component of the European Copernicus program dedicated to Earth observation, the two C-band SAR on board the Sentinel-1 constellation routinely provide high resolution acquisitions in wide swath. Sentinel-1 A & B operate according to acquisition plans defined in the HLOP (High Level Operation Plan) and regularly updated. This paper aims to show how plan can be modified on short notice allows to capture Tropical Cyclones (TC) over the oceans before landfall including open ocean and coastal areas. Examples of Sentinel-1 derived TC parameters used by the science community and TC forecaster in WMO operational TC centres are presented. The benefit of using Sentinel-1 acquisitions in combination with other missions is also discussed.

AB  - With the recent launch of Sentinel-2, the possibilities of image analysis increased especially in the field of land cover and crops mapping. The identification of different crop types is important particularly for agricultural field management and water resource monitoring. This paper aims to select a limited number of acquisition dates, from Sentinel-2 time series, to improve the accuracy of crop mapping method in the Haouz plain Marrakech, Morocco. First, the collected reference data was exploited to build the phenological shifts of the different crops present in the area of interest, namely: Apricot, Citrus, Olive, Cereals, watermelon and bare soil/fallow, using the derived NDVI layers. As a second step, the NDVI profiles were employed to distinguish different periods based on the spectral separability between the thematic classes. Then, crop classification independently for the 20acquired images, per period, was performed and evaluated in order to extract Overall Accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient temporal evolution. The optimal acquisition dates per period were determined, relying on the calculated OA values, and classified based on the corresponding NDVI time series. By minimizing the number of optimal acquisition dates, different combinations were tested and analyzed (3 dates per period, 2 dates per period, 1 date per period). The classification results, proved that the proposed approach found out that three acquisition dates, well distributed through the agricultural season achieve the best differentiation between five crops and bare soil with an OA of 85%.

AB  - The main objectives of this work are to map and characterize network of likely fractures to develop major deposits carbonated in the region. It is a contribution to a better knowledge of the geometry of existing surface fractures networks and their extension in subsurface. For this it appeals to the tool of remote sensing and seismic. Using remote sensing data, our study enabled us to draw up a card lineament, along with tectonic analysis, where we could list 409 lineaments divided into 9 classes according to their directions, among which: the main directions of the NW/SE fracturing are: H (N1300-N1500), G (N1100-N1300) and F (N900-N1100). These three classes are in agreement with the major flaws of the region, which are: the fault of Biskra-Outaya, Ouinet-Morsott-Tebessa and the dextrose form. Of after the deferential work carried out on the South East Constantine area, and the results obtained by the seismic reflection, as well as the well data, summarizes our reservoirs are characterized by a mainly low to medium porosity and low permeability, these tanks are carbonated, and are affected by the majority of vulnerabilities detected on the surface, but these do not contribute to the improvement of the Petrophysical characteristics This can be reported to the clogging of the cracks.

AB  - The concentration of chlorophyll-a is considered a very important water quality parameter due to the role it plays in the eutrophication. It can be estimated by remote sensing using empirical methods and/or semi-analytical methods. The main aim of this paper is to assess the chlorophyll-a concentration, derived from the Sentinel-3 Satellite, with in situ measurements covering the Mediterranean Sea. The Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) was utilized. Two algorithms examined on their efficiency: i) the OC4Me Maximum Band Ratio algorithm, a polynomial algorithm based on the use of a semi-analytical model which uses a maximum band ratio approach of reflectances at 443, 490 and 510 nm, over the 560 nm and ii) a neural net (NN) algorithm, that uses an Inverse Radiative Transfer Model to estimate the water constitutes and estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration. A dedicated data set from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Service (CMES) with in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations was utilized. The parameters of interest were extracted and chlorophyll-a values at different depths were extracted. Also, to assure the accuracy of the in situ measurements the quality control parameters provided by the marine Copernicus were applied. The concentration of chlorophyll-a (C-M) at a penetration depth (Z(pd)) was calculated from the in situ dataset. Then, a comparison was performed using the two algorithms against the in situ data. Statistical indexes were calculated to illustrate the correlation between the two algorithms and the in situ measurements. No significant correlation was observed for OC4Me algorithm. However, examining the time difference among the in situ data and the satellite acquisition the best correlation is observed between a time difference of two hours from the satellite and the in situ dataset. Last but not least, no correlation was observed between the chlorophyll-a calculated from the neural nets and the in situ dataset.

T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As our global environmental malaise has deepened, so has interest in potential contributions by faith communities to sustainability discourses and activities. While several studies have mapped various eco-theologies and worldviews that speak to environmental problems, this research has been largely limited to Judeo-Christian and U.S.-based groups. This study explores the work of a variety of faith-based organizations (FBOs) doing environmental work in Canada, beginning to broaden the scope beyond just Christian groups. Based on interviews, focus groups, document review, and participant observation with 16 FBOs, the study presents five environmental worldview strands: Scriptural/Theological; Traditions, Values, Virtues; the New Cosmology; Nature Experience/Revelation; and Ritual. Sub-strands specific to different faith and cultural communities were also identified. These strands are considered in relation to the activities of the FBOs, and how the nature of tradition, values, and virtues may yield potential avenues for translating worldviews into individual and societal practice.

AB  - In photoacoustic (PA) imaging using commercial ultrasound transducers, two dimensional PA images are produced by commonly used delay-and-sum (DAS) as the reconstruction method. However, the reconstructed image is affected by noise and artifacts. Here, we investigate the performance of a nonlinear (NL) beamforming method for linear-array PA image formation. The proposed algorithm uses the pth root of the recorded signals and imposes a computational complexity in the order of DAS (O(M)). We have evaluated the performance of the proposed method numerically, having a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB and -10 dB. It is shown that at the depth of 15 mm, the NL 3 (NL beamformer with a p=3) outperforms DAS, DMAS and NL 2 for about 26 dB, 11 dB and 11 dB, in terms of level of sidelobe, respectively. In addition, DAS, DMAS, NL 2 and NL 3 lead to a full-width-half-maximum of about 1.4 mm, 1.04 mm, 1.04 mm and 0.86 mm, respectively. The proposed method can be a great choice for sentinel lymph node imaging.

AB  - The rapid expansion of cities globally leads to new challenges related to quality of life and health. The presence and fractional distribution of vegetation within urban cities directly impact the life and health of urban dwellers. This paper presents an approach to map urban vegetation from Sentinel-2 data. The twin Sentinel-2 satellites offer a 5-day revisit time global coverage at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The temporal resolution allows for seasonal aggregation of the input data, thus providing phenological information. By considering seasonally aggregated Normalized Difference Spectral Vector (NDSV), a classification was performed using Random Forest (RF) and compared with Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change monitoring in rapidly urbanizing environments based on spaceborne remotely sensed data and measurable indicators is essential for quantifying and evaluating the spatial patterns of urban landscape change dynamics and for sustainable urban ecosystems management. The objectives of the study are to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of urbanization patterns of Kigali, Rwanda over the last three decades (from 1984 to 2016) using multi-temporal Landsat data and to assess the associated environmental impact using landscape metrics and ecosystem services. Visible and infrared bands of Landsat images were combined with derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) variance texture and digital elevation model (DEM) data for pixel-based classification using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Seven land cover classes were derived with an overall accuracy exceeding 87% with Kappa coefficients around 0.8. As most prominent changes, cropland was reduced considerably in favour of built-up areas that increased from 2.13 km(2) to 100.17 km(2) between 1984 and 2016. During those 32 years, landscape fragmentation could be observed, especially for forest and cropland. The landscape configuration indices demonstrate that in general the land cover pattern remained stable for cropland, but that it was highly changed for built-up areas. Ecosystem services considered include regulating, provisioning and support services. Estimated changes in ecosystem services amount to a loss of 69 million US dollars (USD) as a result of cropland degradation in favour of urban areas and in a gain of 52.5 million USD within urban areas. Multi-temporal remote sensing is found as a cost-effective method for analysis and quantification of urbanization and its effects using landscape metrics and ecosystem services.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) play an important role in producing terrain-related applications such as curvature and contour maps for planning and management of oil palm plantation. Data fusion of DEMs derived from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and interferometric aperture radar (IfSAR) was developed with the intention to increase the accuracy of IfSAR-derived DEM at a lower cost thus, provide a high-quality data for plantation management. In this research, fusion by weights was carried out after applying regression analysis to integrate both TLS and IfSAR data. The results showed a significant reduction in root mean square error (RMSEs) after fusion. RMSEs of both stations reduced from 1.83 m to 0.35 m and from 3.13 m to 0.41 m for Station 1 and Station 2, respectively. In addition, data fusion technique for an area with no TLS data were tested around the stations at 200 m distance. The RMSEs decreased from 2.52 m to 2.33 m for Station 1 but the value increased from 2.09 m to 2.13 m for Station 2. It was concluded that the proposed fusion technique in the extension area could be done in a relatively flat area but not be used in a steep-slope area.

TI  - Mapping of bauxite mineral deposits in the northern region of Saudi Arabia by using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer satellite data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral deposit mapping is very essential for sustainable and eco-friendly exploitation of natural resources. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has abundant natural resources such as natural gas, oil and minerals. It reserves high quantity of minerals such as phosphates, bauxites, copper, gold and other industrial minerals. The red soil regions located in Hail and Qassim provinces of Saudi Arabia have rich amount of bauxite (major aluminum ore) deposits. In order to initiate the focus on mapping of mineral deposits along this area, standardized hyper-spectral analysis has been carried out by using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite data. The spectral signature of gibbsite (major element in bauxite) samples is analyzed with reference to the spectral features of gibbsite in the visible near infrared and short-wave infrared bands electromagnetic spectrum. Advanced hyper-spectral transformations such as minimum noise fraction function and pixel purity index have been performed to identify the target end-member. The existence of the mineral is confirmed by comparing the spectral signatures of the end-member with the predefined spectral plots of ASTER and United States Geological Survey spectral libraries. Finally, the end-members are mapped and their abundance is estimated in 0-1 scale. The study has opened up new areas for mapping of bauxite deposits in the area and leads to eco-friendly exploitation of natural resources. It also validates the high potential of ASTER multispectral satellite data for the exploration and mapping of mineral resources.

AB  - The application of optical communications technology for intersatellite and direct links is increasing in the fields of remote sensing and space explorations. Optical communication experiments have been conducted internationally and there are plans to use related technologies for space operations. However, there are not many experiments or plans for the network of optical ground stations focused on the particular issue of how to avoid cloud blocking in optical links between space and the ground for effective data downlink.In 2015, JAXA reported on a future experimental plan for optical direct communication links from space to ground in order to acquire the fundamental technologies of spatial pointing and tracking with the International Space Station and the experimental concept for the avoidance of cloud blockings by optical ground stations, cloud sensors and network planning systems [3]. To forward the study on flexible optical ground network operations, JAXA began joint research with Tokai University in 2017 and has studied more specific experiment method with ground fiber networks, cloud sensors, network planning systems and meteorological satellite data.This paper presents the research and development approach to realize flexible optical ground network operations for effective data downlink from space to ground.

TEC affects the propagation of radio signal from satellite to receiver, which causes a ranging error. In the case of single frequency user receiver, the prediction of TEC helps to correct the range errors. TEC is measured using TEC unit (TECU), where 1TECU=1x1016electrons/m2. The vertical total electron content (VTEC) of the L1 band is estimated by using data collected from GPS receiver which is installed at the ACSCE station Bangalore. In this work, an ordinary kriging (OK)-based surrogate model algorithm and Matlab code is developed and used to predict the hourly basis ionospheric VTEC. Six parameters such as time, sun spot number (SSN), the solar flux index at 10.7cm (F10.7), Kp and Ap and observed TEC are used to build the surrogate model. These parameters are related to the ionospheric diurnal variations, solar cycle and geomagnetic activities. In order to cover all regions of the world during different solar activity periods six input parameters are collected from low-, mid- and high-latitude regions during low, medium and high solar activity periods. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the OK-based surrogate model ranges from 0.6-3.6 TECU, and the correlation coefficient varies between 0.79-0.99 and range error varies from 0.04654-0.3017244m at three regions.The TEC prediction results from the OK-based surrogate model are compared with results obtained from (i) a genetic algorithm-based neural network (GA-NN), (ii)aback-propagation neural network (BP-NN) and (iii) the IRI-2012 model at the CHAN station. For a typical dataset the RMSE of the OK-based surrogate model is 4.523 TECU and the correlation coefficient is 0.9733. The RMSE values for the GA-NN, BP-NN and IRI-2012 models are 5.3529, 6.2913 and 6.7179 TECU and The correlation coefficients are 0.8343, 0.7869 and 0.7797, respectively. The OK model is also compared with a time series method for the CHAN station; it is observed that, for 3 days (7-1-2008 to 9-1-2008) prediction, the OK model gives a 75% result for TECTECU condition, the time series method gives 39% for the same condition. The results indicate that the OK-based surrogate model is suitable for applications in ionospheric TEC predictions.

TI  - GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM AND IMAGE CLASSIFICATION OF REMOTE SENSING SYNERGY FOR LAND-USE IDENTIFICATION
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic Information System (GIS) is one of the ways to obtain updated information in detail. As the name suggests, GIS can perform detail information about geographical area or place. Moreover, transferring the classified imagery as the result of remote sensing obtained in each period of time (per one year, per two years, per three years, based on the needs) to the GIS database will increase the information resources. This is because; at first, the remote sensing image can cover the entire surface of this earth; second, remote sensing image contains information about the earth's surface. By doing an appropriate image processing procedure, rich information could be collected. For further research, other techniques of classification are necessary to be done so that the results can be compared with the results of the previous techniques. This research produces two different image date resources, i.e. digital maps of land use in watershed of Ciliwung downstream (accommodated raw data by Bakosurtanal/Coordinator for The National Survey and Mapping) and landsat TM image with 30 m resolution using RoI in Ciliwung downstream watershed (accommodated raw data by Geotek LIPI/Indonesian Institute of Sciences for Geological Technology at Sangkuriang, Bandung). Digital intersections of these two resources produce a varied classing land-use.

AB  - Detection, and monitoring of surface mining region have various research aspects. Coal surface mining has severe social, ecological, environmental adverse effects. In the past, semi-supervised and supervised clustering techniques have been used to detect such regions. Coal has lower reflectance values in short wave infrared I (SWIR-I) than short wave infrared II (SWIR-II). The proposed method presents a novel approach to detect coal mine regions without manual intervention using this cue. Clay mineral ratio is defined as a ratio of SWIR-I to SWIR-II. Here, unsupervised K-Means clustering has been used in a hierarchical fashion over a variant of clay mineral ratio to detect opencast coal mine regions in the Jharia coal field (JCF), India. The proposed method has average precision, and recall of 76:43%, and 62:75%, respectively.

AB  - Monitoring and classification of surface coal mine regions have several research aspects, as they have huge impacts on the eco-environment of a region. Mining regions change over time immensely. New potential mines get opened. Whereas, few mines stay active and many of them get closed. Closed mine regions are reclaimed to environment through plantation. In the past, semi-supervised and supervised techniques have been used to detect mine classes and assess the changes of land use and land cover classes. In this work, mine regions are detected in an adaptive manner from satellite images unlike the techniques in the literature. Further, a change detection technique is used to detect active, new, and closed surface coal mines in a region. Detected closed mines are further analysed to evaluate reclamation of that region. Average precision and recall of active, new, and closed mining regions of the proposed technique are found to be [84.7%, 62.8%], [74.2%, 64.5%], and [70.1%, 58.2%], respectively.

TI  - Culture, Education and Mapuche mythology in Argentina (Northern Patagonia). Sociology of acculturation
T2  - REVISTA TEFROS
M3  - Article
AB  - In these pages we propose to visualize the situation of the culture of the Mapuche people in Argentina in terms of ethnic -cultural and educational inequality in relation to the Mapuche people and culture (Mapuche or Mapuce: people of the earth). This culture is in the context of a more globalized world (culturally standardized) and impacted by (transnational) crosscultural elements. This study is led by a socio-historical perspective, moving beyond the colonizing effects and the acculturation of a culture ignored and treated as a subaltern in the post -colonial era, now target of a process of clarification. Socio-historical circumstances that favor the state of discrimination and social and cultural exclusion, of poverty, of judicialization of indigenous conflicts and of postmodern invisibilization that provoke the existence of a Mapuche culture, worldview and mythology that is hardly recognized by and almost unknown to a large part of the population, even the Mapuche people themselves. "Northern Patagonia" (Neuquen, Rio Negro and Chubut), currently Argentina, is called "Puel Mapu" (Eastern land). It is considered that the Mapuche territory is located in Argentina and Chile. Though both countries are separated by the mountain range of the Andes, the territory is referred to, by the Mapuche himself, as one whole: Waj or Wall Mapu (universe or cosmos: Mapuche territory).In mythological and religious terms, the validity of the nguillatim (rogativa) is understood as a religious ceremony, which is still celebrated especially in the month of March, and which means the affection to the land and livestock.

AB  - Changes in land use and land cover play a critical role, especially in the Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP) area, impacting on ecosystem functions. This study was aimed at analyzing the dynamics of land change and the factors influencing the land change in this National Park. The methods used were the GIS technique and a binary logistic regression model. The land changes locating between Sigi Regency and Donggala Regency, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, which consisted of thirteen sub-districts in the LLNP region acquiring from Landsat satellite data acquisition of 1997, 2002, 2013, and 2018. The dynamics of land changes during the period of 1997-2002 has decreased the forest area by 2,643 ha, and the next period, 2002-2013, the decline of forest area has reached 4,265 ha, and the overall the dynamics of land change experiences a significant increase from 1997 to 2018 which declines the forest areas approximately 10,175 ha and followed by a decline of the meadow area in 1,726 ha changing function into the built-up land of 526 ha, mixed gardens of 1,189 ha, fields/moorings of 3,019 ha, rice fields of 1,548 ha and shrubs of 5,619 ha. The factors influencing the land change in this LLNP region based on the results of binary logistic regression analysis are the population density (X5), distance from the settlement (X3), distance from the road (X2), distance from the capital (X4), and topographic conditions (X1). Of these five variables, the population density has the highest negative regression coefficient, which is equal to -0.068. The regression equation is Y = -0.094X1-0.157X2-0.176X3-0.083X4- 0.068X5 and being significant in a level of 0.001 percent that indicates these five factors have influenced greatly high the land change in the TNLL. This situation can be inferred that the free distribution and population growth in the National Park influence increasing the conversion of forest areas.

AB  - As a tropical country, Indonesia has two seasons, where each season (rainy or dry seasons) lasts for 6 months. In Indonesia, the beginning of rice planting time occurs at the beginning of the rainy season, but a high diversity of rainfall causes the beginning of rice planting to become varies in some areas. In the area that have a same rainfall, however, the beginning of planting time can be also vary due to the rotation of irrigation water distribution. Seeing this phenomenon, the beginning of planting time is very important to be identified, since it can be used to estimate when the harvest time comes and also the production. The purpose of this study were to identify the growth phase of rice crops based on reflectance and vegetation index using Sentinel-2A imageries and distribution of growth phase of rice crops. The research method begins with a transformation of digital numbers into reflectance values in order to correct the effect of a light source, sensor, atmospheric. Analysis of reflectance (NIR) and vegetation index (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) values were carried out on 56 samples spread over five phases of rice growth, i.e. wet fallow, vegetative, generative, harvest ing, dry fallow. The results showed that the NDVI can distinguish five phases of rice growth more clearly than EVI, SAVI, NIR. Pattern of reflectance value and vegetation index in the five phases of rice growth shows a quadratic model. Overall accuracy of the composite temporal of NDVI imageries is small (34,30%). The rice crops in harvesting phase is largest (42,04%)

T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the duration and distribution of seasonal snow cover is important for understanding the hydrologic regime in mountainous regions within semi-arid climates. In the headwater of the semi-arid Sugnugur catchment (in the Khentii Mountains, northern Mongolia), a spatial analysis of seasonal snow cover duration (SCD) was performed on a 30 m spatial resolution by integrating the spatial resolution of Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2A images with the daily temporal resolution of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow products (2000-2017). Validation was achieved using in situ time series measurements from winter field campaigns and distributed surface temperature loggers. We found a mean increase of SCD with altitude at approximately +6 days/100 m. However, we found no altitude-dependent changes in snow depth during field campaigns. The southern exposed valley slopes are either snow free or covered by intermittent snow throughout the winter months due to high sublimation rates and prevailing wind. The estimated mean SCD ranges from 124 days in the lower parts of the catchment to 226 days on the mountain peaks, with a mean underestimation of 12-13 days. Snow onset and melt dates exhibited large inter-annual variability, but no significant trend in the seasonal SCD was evident. This method can be applied to high-resolution snow mapping in similar mountainous regions.

TI  - Comparative performance of regression tree and parametric classification of savannah woody cover on SPOT 6 NAOMI imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data potentially can provide ecosystem state indicative data for use in nature conservation. Full realisation of this potential requires robust algorithms that can extract the required ecosystem attributes from imagery. Woody cover is an indicative ecosystem state variable in savannah wilderness areas, whose extraction poses a challenge in reproducing the characteristically discontinuous cover. In this work the performance of the more modern, nonparametric regression tree and Random Forest classifiers in mapping savannah woody cover is compared with the parametric, potentially highly accurate sub-pixel classification approach. Detailed field quantification of % woody cover in 1 ha plots yielded data for the training stage of the two decision tree-based nonparametric classifiers. SPOT 6 NAOMI imagery whose timing excluded grass from the spectral signature of non-senescent vegetation was used. In order to improve the capability to extract woody cover the 6 m resolution of the multispectral bands was enhanced to 1.5 m, using high pass filter pan-sharpening. For the decision tree-based classifiers multiresolution image segmentation was then employed as preliminary step in extracting the woody cover. Objects approximating the 1 ha field plots were delineated at the coordinates of the respective field sampling sites. The univariate decision tree training stage used 60% of the sampling sites. The woody cover classes 0-19%, 20-39%, 40-59% and 60-79% were the labels of recursive partitioning terminal tree leaves. For Random Forest, up to 500 decision trees (Ntree) were specified. For regression tree modelling the 10-fold cross validation approach using the 1-SE rule was used for optimal tree selection, and pruning using 20% of the field sampling sites was accomplished using the cost complexity pruning technique. The remaining 20% of the field sampling sites were reserved for accuracy assessment, for which an additional stratified random sample of coordinates verified using a concurrent high resolution QuickBird image was used. Spectral signatures approximating Gaussian distributions were generated using woody end member sites for sub-pixel classification. Random Forest produced the highest overall accuracy (95.7%), followed by regression tree modelling (90.6%), and sub-pixel classification (73.3%). The two nonparametric classifiers correctly modelled the landscape distribution, occasional continuous formations and discontinuities in the woody cover. Based on the results, nonparametric classifiers appeared more appropriate for mapping the discontinuous savannah woody cover.

AB  - The characteristics of this GPP estimation method correspond to the photosynthesis process. The photosynthesis velocity depends on it ' s capacity and depression because of weather conditions. The depression part is controlled by the stomatal opening and closing and the canopy conductance was calculated using Big-leaf model. From model calculation, the fist highest contribution of canopy conductance's denominator was VPD, and that of numerator was evapotranspiration. In the period of around noon, evapotranspiration was not changed drastically. In the period, the canopy conductance index was considered as the slope of 1/VPD changing as time. In dry area, the surface temperature of around 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. was strongly correlated with VPD of 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., respectively. From this results, it is considered that the slope of 1/VPD changing estimated from surface temperature is one candidate of canopy conductance index. In this study, reproductivity of GPP using the estimation algorithm was examined. From the results, the tendency of GPP changing of the satellite observing times was recalculated using GPP capacity and conductance index. Although when the time of staring daytime depression was earlier than 11 a.m., the amount of depression was underestimated.

TI  - Use of chlorophyll index-green and the red-edge chlorophyll index to derive an algorithm for estimating gross primary production capacity

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing

AB  - We present an algorithm for estimating gross primary production (GPP) capacity based on chlorophyll indexes and light-response curves. Leaf chlorophyll content is a major determinant of GPP capacity. The initial slope of light-response curves and maximum GPP capacity under light saturation were determined using flux and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The initial slope values were fixed for seven plant types. In a previous study, maximum GPP capacity under light saturation was determined based on the linear relationship between chlorophyll index-green CIgreen and GPP capacity at 2000 mu molm(-2) s(-1) (GPP(capacity)(2000)). In the relationship, vegetation was divided into three types: open shrubland, savannah, grassland, and cropland (rice paddy); deciduous and evergreen woody forest except for tropical evergreen forest; and tropical evergreen forest. Open shrublands and grasslands had higher slope values in the relation between CIgreen and GPP(capacity)(2000) than deciduous and evergreen woody forest except for tropical evergreen forest. Global classification results in vegetation types may have errors, and the error may propagate to GPP capacity estimation when the estimation formula is not general in vegetation types. For estimating GPP capacity globally, generic formulae in different vegetation types is better to estimate GPP capacity. Peng et al. (2017) analyzed the relationship between canopy chlorophyll content and vegetation index for maize and soybean using hyperspectral radiometer data, and found that the relationships were the same among crops with different canopy structures under a CI of 740 nm, but not when CIgreen was used. We examined differences in GPP capacity estimations between CIgreen and the red-edge band chlorophyll index (CIred-edge) derived from flux and Sentinal-2/MSI sensor data. CIred-edge at 705 nm had a stronger relationship with GPP(capacity)(2000) than did CIgreen.

AB  - This essay discusses the interaction between totalistic worldviews on one side and biopower and perspectives on purity and impurity, on the other side. It does so by using the concept of totalism, a system of thought defined by its pursuit of the complete reconstruction of society in accordance with its soteriological-simplifying principles. Totalistic worldviews tend to enforce the implementation of what they see as purity and the combating of what they see as impurity by enforcing their ultimate aims on their host society or beyond.

AB  - Sea ice lead area fraction, distribution of lead length and orientation of leads are subject of this study. Leads are classified from dual-band Sentinel-1 SAR data with an automatic supervised learning classification algorithm. Binary maps are combined from scenes acquired within a three-day interval to provide an Arctic-wide composite lead map. Resolution of these binary maps is 80 meters. Based on these binary maps, lead area fraction is calculated on a 12 km grid. Regional maps of lead area fraction for the Beaufort Sea and the Fram Strait are calculated on a 4 km grid. The Hough transform is used to detect linear features on binary lead maps. The lead length distribution and the orientation of leads are calculated for the Fram Strait region and the Beaufort Sea. Most of the detected leads have length below 15 km. Two pronounced peaks on the lead orientation are found at around 50 and 130 degrees.

AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP) has been proposed to facilitate the sustainable use of oceans. To implement MSP in coastal zones, we need to understand the current status of aquaculture, in order to plan for its future. In Japan, coastal aquaculture is based on fishery rights, but it is hard to establish the existing situation as there are so many aquaculture facilities in place. In this study, we used full polarimetric, L-band PALSAR-2 data to identify aquaculture areas. We calculated HH and HV backscattering coefficients, and applied polarimetric decomposition analysis to three-component scattering models. The HV backscattering coefficient successfully discriminated aquaculture areas from the sea surface, while the HH backscattering coefficient was mostly able to discriminate between raft and longline aquaculture areas. The three-component scattering model was then able to discriminate between raft and longline aquaculture types in areas where the HH backscattering coefficient could not. Weather conditions affected the sea surface and therefore influenced the outcomes of our analyses.

TI  - Descriptive analysis of ovine mortality in sentinel sheep flocks in Ireland.
T2  - The Veterinary record
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of sheep mortality or cause-specific mortality, in Ireland or internationally, are relatively scarce but are important in presenting baseline levels and changing trends of endemic disease. This study assessed sheep mortality and cause-specific mortality in 33 sentinel sheep flocks in Ireland.METHODS: Sentinel flocks were requested to submit carcases of all sheep that died to the regional veterinary laboratories (RVLs) of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine during a calendar year (2016). Postmortem examinations were performed on 1247 submissions to Athlone, Kilkenny and Sligo RVLs.RESULTS: The median overall submission rate was 13.8 per cent (range 2.5 per cent-35.8 per cent) per adult female sheep in the flock in January 2016. The median fetal, perinatal, lamb and adult submissions per adult female sheep in the flock in January 2016 were 2.1 per cent (0.0 per cent-15.2 per cent), 3.5 per cent (0.0 per cent-20.0 per cent), 3.0 per cent (0.0 per cent-12.4 per cent) and 2.8 per cent (0.8 per cent-7.1 per cent), respectively. The frequency of detection of categories of postmortem diagnoses in fetuses, perinates, lambs and adults are presented.CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons with existing passive surveillance findings reflect some differences in the relative frequency of detection of certain categories of disease suggesting that sentinel flock surveillance could usefully supplement existing passive animal disease surveillance activities for ovine disease.

AB  - Jabodetabek and Greater Bandung areas experiencing the phenomenon of urban expansion which has caused both metropolitan areas to be more connected and become a mega-urban area by a corridor through a conurbation process. Karawang Regency is part of the region in the Jakarta-Bandung mega-urban corridor. Vegetated lands in Karawang Regency are threatened by land conversion as a result of the Jakarta-Bandung conurbation process and it can cause the region to be prone to anthropogenic disasters such as flooding due to reduced water catchment areas. The aims of this study are to analyze the land cover changes that occured in Karawang Regency during the period 2005-2015 and 2015-2025 & mapping the flood-vulnerability areas in Karawang Regency. Land cover changes analysis is carried out by overlapping Landsat Imagery of land cover in the 2005 and 2015 & 2015 and 2025 based on projection results using CA-Markov method. Mapping the flood-vulnerability areas is carried out by a Weighted Overlay process on variables or factors that are considered influential on the occurrence of floods. Karawang Regency has experienced an increase in land use change, especially changes in vegetated lands to built-up lands continuously. In the 2005-2015 period, a total of around 4,500 ha of vegetated land cover types were converted to built-up land, while in the 2015-2025 around 3,500 ha. Flood-vulnerability areas analysis result in Karawang Regency show that About 94% of the total area of Karawang Regency is an area that has a category of medium and high flood-vulnerability.

AB  - The main problem faced by farmers in Indonesia is the diminishing area of agricultural land due to land conversion. Therefore, farmers must be able to choose the most productive types of agricultural plants based on their capability and land suitability in their agricultural areas. This study aims to develop an agroecosystem zone in Temanggung Regency based on remote sensing image processing and geographic information systems (GIS) for evaluating land suitability. The stages of this research are: (1) inventory of land biophysical conditions using primary data (interpretation of multispectral satellite images) and secondary (maps, statistics, results of previous studies); ( 2) study of agroecosystem components to map agroecosystem zone in the research area; and (3) evaluation of land suitability to determine the most productive types of agricultural crops for each agroecosystem zone. This research uses quantitative empirical methods based on landscape ecological approaches. The field sample was determined by stratified random sampling. Data used include: Sentinel-2 image, geological map, soil map, slope map, rainfall data, and land suitability tables for various types of agricultural crops. Image processing techniques begin with the process of rectification, sharpening, and multispectral classification to produce landform maps and land uses. Agroecosystem zones were produced from the overlay process of the agroecosystem components resulting from image and map analysis. Field surveys on predetermined samples were used for obtaining information about the bio-geophysical conditions of the land and the existing conditions of agricultural crops and their productivity, as material for preparing the land suitability map of the research area.

AB  - Crop classification is an important information for agriculture monitoring. Crop classification using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been performed in many studies, but for agricultural areas like in India that are very fragmented, it becomes difficult to distinguish between two crop types that lie next to each other. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt has been made to classify sugarcane and paddy crops based on object based crop phenology approach for which object based segmentation is explored. The proposed methodology is developed and tested on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. It is observed that the proposed methodology has a potential to classify the crop types with an accuracy of 82%.

AB  - This research study demonstrates the potential of simple two stage classification algorithm based on polarimetric descriptor alpha angle to categorize forests into different forest dynamic states. The forest dynamics states such as maturity, disturbance and regeneration/afforestation are discussed in this study. Three group of species - Eucalyptus, Teak and Mixed plantation were selected, and sample plots representing different forest dynamic states were analyzed. The trend analysis formed the basis for two stage classification, which categorized the forest into different forest dynamic states. An accuracy assessment of the algorithm was performed using ground truth data, yielded an overall accuracy of 79.15% and kappa coefficient of 0.74. Alpha angle (a) time series shows high potential to characterize the forests, and stratify it qualitatively into different carbon dynamic fragments.

AB  - Quantifying the magnitude and significance of climate change variables over space and time in Africa is challenging due to sparse distribution of weather stations and poor quality of existing data. Time series climate data generated from remote sensing platforms could provide plausible alternative for measuring the trends of climate change in data limiting context. This study utilise time series remote sensing data for rainfall, maximum temperature and minimum temperature to investigate the magnitude and significance of spatial-temporal trends over six countries in West Africa. A modified Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen's slope are utilised to test the significance and the magnitude of trends respectively for period between 1981 and 2017. June to September rainfall along the Sahel, Sudan and northern Guinea savanna agro-ecological zones revealed a significant increase (0.1 - 3 mm yr(-1)) that peaked in August. Extreme temperatures for period between August and October remained stable while significant positive trend (0.005 - 0.07 degrees C yr(-1)) was observed in rest of months. Areas experiencing significant drying and warming trends are earmarked as priority for targeting appropriate climate smart agricultural technologies. The widespread significant increase of extreme temperatures justifies increased investments in measures to cope with heat stress.

AB  - Gunungsewu is a karstic region in the southern part of Java Island, Indonesia. That area has a various type of archaeological evidences including human remains, animal remains, bone artifacts, stone artifacts, and shell art ifacts which found in prehistoric caves, that show evidence of occupation caves as sustain of prehistoric human communities. In order to enhance the future of archaeological research, MaxEnt Model used to estimate Prehistoric occupation cave sites in the karstic region of Gunung Sewu. The objectives of this research are: (1) (1) Assessing the ability of DEM Alos Palsar, Sentinel-2a images and GIS data to extract environmental parameters related to prehistoric occupation cave sites. (2) Preparing a spatial model to estimate prehistoric occupation cave sites using DEM Alos Palsar imagery, Sentinel-2a imagery, and GIS data for input model MaxEnt (maximum entropy). (3) the accuracy of MaxEnt model to predicting location of prehistoric occupation caves. Primary data consist of environmental variables and caves variables analyzed by MaxEnt Model. Those variables extracted from 12.5-meter resolution DEM Alos Palsar, Sentinel- 2A images with 10 meters resolution, and GIS data. Environmental variables assessed by several maps such as valley-hill classification (OBIA), distance of valley, elevation, slope, aspect, distance of lineament, lineament density and distance from water sources. Input data used 68 location prehistoric cave sites and 8 environmental variables with AUC value of 0. 715 in good performance. Modeling process results are the jackknife test, response curve of the environmental variables, and probability map. Based on the probability map, this research is able to obtained prehistoric cave location data. Therefore, the ability of MaxEnt model as a method to locate archeological sites becomes reliable.

TI  - A Search for Snail-Related Answers to Explain Differences in Response of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> to Praziquantel Treatment among Responding and Persistent Hotspot Villages along the Kenyan Shore of Lake Victoria
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following a 4-year annual praziquantel (PZQ) treatment campaign, the resulting prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was seen to differ among individual villages along the Kenyan shore of Lake Victoria. We have investigated possible inherent differences in snail-related aspects of transmission among such 10 villages, including six persistent hotspot (PHS) villages (<= 30% reduction in prevalence following repeated treatments) located along the west-facing shore of the lake and four PZQ-responding (RESP) villages (> 30% prevalence reduction following repeated treatment) along the Winam Gulf. When taking into account all sampling sites, times, and water hyacinth presence/absence, shoreline-associated Biomphalaria sudanica from PHS and RESP villages did not differ in relative abundance or prevalence of S. mansoni infection. Water hyacinth intrusions were associated with increased B. sudanica abundance. The deeper water snail Biomphalaria choanomphala was significantly more abundant in the PHS villages, and prevalence of S. mansoni among villages both before and after control was positively correlated with B. choanomphala abundance. Worm recoveries from sentinel mice did not differ between PHS and RESP villages, and abundance of non-schistosome trematode species was not associated with S. mansoni abundance. Biomphalaria choanomphala provides an alternative, deepwater mode of transmission that may favor greater persistence of S. mansoni in PHS villages. As we found evidence for ongoing S. mansoni transmission in all 10 villages, we conclude that conditions conducive for transmission and reinfection occur ubiquitously. This argues for an integrated, basin-wide plan for schistosomiasis control to counteract rapid reinfections facilitated by large snail populations and movements of infected people around the lake.

AB  - Lakes are one of the primary sources of fresh water, and theirsize variations provide information critical to their sustainable management in the backdrop of seasonal and climatic changes. Satellite-based optical images and radar altimetertogether have provided significant advances in monitoring inland water bodies like lakes and reservoirs, and asses its water storage capacity. Optical imageries are usually good for identifying the extent of lakes with a certain margin of error, whereas Satellite radar altimetry is helpful in monitoring temporal variations in water surface heights.This study focuses on the method used to monitor MancharLake's surface area along with its volume. Time series altimetry data provided by European satellite Sentinel 3and optical data of Landsat 8 (30m spatial resolution) were used to calculate area, while temporal analysis wasperformed to generate lake boundaries usingNormalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The lake volume was estimated by using water level variation from altimetry and surface area. Further, a relationship between Rating curves and volume was developed in order to calculate water flow at different outlets of Manchar Lake.

AB  - Deep water bodies constitute the strategic water reserves of Morocco. These natural resources are used in many activities such as irrigation in agriculture, and, more importantly, they are the source of fresh drinking water for the local population. However, these resources are vulnerable to anthropogenic and natural phenomena due to ongoing climate change and the increase in population growth. To contribute to the recent initiative for the protection of the karstic environment of water springs in the Tabular Middle Atlas of El Hajeb, the present research work aims to characterize different karst landforms in Liassic carbonate rocks of the Tabular Middle Atlas in the Causse of El Hajeb, where pollution identified in water samples in this region originates. Satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat, Terra-ASTER, ASTER-GDEM) and GIS tools were used. Based on surface reflectance of dolomite and limestone, especially in shortwave infrared, we delineated the extent of carbonate rocks and areas with intense human activities. Fractures affecting these Liassic rocks were extracted mechanically and manually after the application of Sobel operator filter in N, S, NE and SW main directions. The results show an improvement and a better understanding of the hydrogeological system of this karst environment, in particular the location of new faults identified in NE-SW and NW-SE fault systems which involve infiltration of surface water and groundwater drainage respectively. The percolation of slightly acidic water through these fractures has gradually created cavities and sinkholes which are believed to be the origin of turbidity observed during the analysis of the water springs.

TI  - IMAGE OF HUMAN IN THE POSTMODERN EPOCH
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Based on the study of philosophical anthropological concepts, to highlight the project of personality in different historical periods, to reveal the meaning of humanistic issues in the postmodern epoch, to identify the essential features of the image of human of the second half of the XX - the beginning of the XXI century. Theoretical basis. The methodological basis of the article is the principles of historicism, integrity, objectivity regarding the mastery of the issue of person's image in postmodernism. The research applied comparative-historical, culturological, analytical, axiological approaches to reveal the problem of individuality in the second half of the XX - the beginning of the XXI century. The theoretical basis of the article consists of scientific works in the field of philosophical anthropology, history, cultural studies, and aesthetics. Originality. The author revealed the peculiarities of transformation of the personality model from antiquity to postmodernism, specified the image of man of the second half of the XX - the beginning of the XXI century. Conclusions. The analysis of anthropological ideas of Western philosophy of different ages shows the variety of views about understanding the nature of the person, its complexity and ambiguity. In the epoch of postmodernism humanistic issues are of particular relevance, which is connected with social and political uncertainty, domination of mass consciousness, loss of national and cultural identity. The image of a person of this period is deprived of a solid foundation, it is blurred and relative. The destruction of faith in the absolute in the context of the second half of the twentieth century contributed to the formation of confidence in the interdependence of all things (including certain historical periods), raised the problem of the personality image to a new ontological level. Orientation in the achievements of European civilization, perception of its anthropological experience, intercultural dialogue contribute to the productive use of the achievements of mankind in order to understand the modern person and to form its adequate image. In its essence, postmodernism does not set the goal to realize a retrospection of subject type. However, separating from the cultural memory the excerpts of ideas about a person, by certain styles and directions, it builds on their formations its own eclectic image of the individual.

AB  - Earth Observation techniques have demonstrated their capacity in mapping flooded areas, especially with the exploitation of SAR-C band data which the Sentinel-1 constellation satellites acquires. In flood emergency situations, geo-information related to widespread and/or severe events are provided in rush mode to the European Commission's (EC) Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC), to Civil Protection organizations, international organizations and NGOs within Copernicus Emergency Management Service - Rapid Mapping. In the case of lower intensity events, based on the exploitation of Sentinel-1 and local data, flood geo-information can also be provided to regional and local actors in charge of flood and environment management, filling a gap in local user needs. Such a downstream service has been set up in North-Eastern France and complements Copernicus EMS mapping activities as illustrated by the monitoring of the January 2018 flooding events in France.

TI  - Decipherment of potential zones for groundwater occurrence: a study in Khatra Block, Bankura District, West Bengal, using geospatial techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is considered as one of the most valuable natural resources as it supports human civilization. Freshwater is considered as an important natural resource which occurs partially on the surface and dominantly beneath the surface. The resource is declining drastically owing to the rapid increase in population and its management in an improper way. The occurrence of groundwater in hard rock terrain still behaves as enigmatic. Various terrain parameters control the movement and storage of groundwater. Accordingly geoscientists are using various techniques to explore the potential zone amongst which multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique seems to be more precise. Application of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) has come out as very effective tools in deciphering groundwater potential zone by modeling terrain features specially in hard rock arid regions. The present study is aimed to find out groundwater potential zones in Khatra Block of Bankura District, West Bengal, India characterized by hard granitic terrain and semi-arid climatic condition. In the present study various thematic maps viz., geomorphology, geology, lineament density, drainage density and slope have been prepared. For these, IRS Resources at LISS-4 with 5.8m spatial resolution digital data, CARTOSAT-1 digital elevation model, CartoDEM with 2.5m spatial resolution, along with other data sets such as Survey of India toposheets (73J/13, 73I/16, 73I/12), GSI Map have been used. Digitized vector maps relating to chosen parameters, were converted to raster data using 30mx30m grid cell size. Different theme weight and class rank have been assigned to these raster maps. Each theme weight has been multiplied by its respective class rank and all the raster thematic layers have been summed up in a linear combination equation in Arc GIS Raster Calculator module. Similarly, the weighted layers have been statistically modeled to get the areal extent of groundwater prospects. This integrated approach, helped in classifying the groundwater availability in the study area into five categories, viz. very good, good, moderate, poor and very poor. Finally, it can be stated that the modeling assessment method proposed in this study forms an effective tool for delineating groundwater potential zones for proper development and management of groundwater resources in hard rock terrains.

AB  - In order to reduce speckle noise effects in forest cover change analysis, two types of SAR processing approach have been proposed so far. One is a type of object-based segmentation approaches and another is pixel-based processing approaches using speckle noise filtering such as Lee and Frost filter. This paper proposes a methodology of the pixel-based algorithm for forest change detection using PALSAR-2 ScanSAR data. Frost filter is applied to reduce speckle noise and normalization filter is implemented to reduce ground moisture effects. In case of Peru and Paraguay, the user's accuracy of developed algorithm was almost same as those of JJ-FAST version-2 while the producer's accuracy was 3 times better than JJ-FAST latest version (version-2).

TI  - Changings in Woman's Role in Socio-Economic and Political Life of Dagestan in 1930s
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The question of changings in a woman's role in Dagestan after the Great October revolution is considered. It is noted that in the new society gender equality was one of the key problems, the attitude to which in the territory of Dagestan has not lost its relevance for a long time after the establishment of Soviet power. It is shown that women's participation in the socio-political life of the region was a topical issue due to a variety of objective and subjective factors, among which the factor of domination of the Islamic religious worldview in all social spheres of Dagestan society stood out, taking into account the fact that the power of its influence in the first post-revolutionary years was not lost. With the help of archival materials, the author examines the gender policy pursued by the Soviet government, in particular, the training of Dagestan women in literacy, their involvement in socio-economic and political activities, etc. It is indicated that the policy of increasing the social status of Dagestan women met with misunderstanding and rejection in society up to the use of violence against socially active women. The author concludes that due to the purposeful policy of the Soviet power by the end of 1930s it was possible to achieve significant results in the nomination of women in various structures of power.

AB  - The Conjugate Gradient (CG) is frequently used iterative methods to solve Systems of Linear Equations (SLEs). The CG has a faster convergence rate and higher accuracy. It is widely used for many scientific applications such as meteorology, groundwater flow problems, studying satellite data, ocean circulation modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, real-time power quality assessment, and a neural robot controller, etc. It can be implemented on CPUs, GPUs and in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs have been shown to provide an order of magnitude to speed up for various computation-intensive applications. However, a Hardware Description Language (HDL) based FPGA implementation for all the arithmetic modules requires considerable development time and the designer needs to be knowledgeable in hardware design as well as in HDL programming. Using IP cores can reduce the development time and design complexity. Prominently, CG has basic three computational kernels and amongst them, Matrix-Vector Multiplication (MVM) is the most computationally intensive kernel. Optimizing MVM kernels with higher throughput can reduce the computation time required for each iteration of CG. In this research, three basic kernels of CG are implemented on FPGAs using floating-point IP cores. The results show that with an FPGA-based implementation of CG we achieved a significant order-of-magnitude over the software implementation (Intel Xenon (R) CPU E5-2650 V2, 2.60 GHz) of the CG using Arria 10 1150 GX.

AB  - Active remote sensing technologies, including airborne laser scanning (LIDAR), interferometric radar (InSAR) have the capability to provide accurate information relating to three-dimensional forest canopy structure over extensive areas of the landscape. Detailed mapping of forests height and terrain features is now possible through 3D remote sensing. Consequently, forest inventory parameters are evaluated through point cloud and normalized surface models. Practically, forest resource mapping is carried out through Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS). In the modern age, ALS achieve considerable popularity in alternative 3-D techniques along with the apace-borne and air-borne sensors. Point clouds are generated through radargrammetry, photogrammetry and interferometry. Photogrammetric point clouds are derived through airborne stereo imagery while radargrammetry and interferometry utilize very-high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Similarly, high resolution optical data is also used for forest inventory. ALS has the ability of mapping tree heights and terrain in even mixed forest scenarios, which is advantageous over SAR data or aerial imagery. To put it simply, in the forest scenarios, height of the canopy, single tree heights and canopy density can be mapped. Forest zoning, crown density, crown height and forest area has been mapped out using these different datasets in comparison.In this paper, first we review experiences of the use of ALS data in estimation of forest inventory parameters in Lubrecht forest in California, and we compare techniques to SAR and optical imagery. In addition, on the basis of our experiences, we aim to present new implications

AB  - This study presents that temporal variations in ice flow velocities for Shirase Glacier and its surrounding landfast ice in Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica were estimated using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Phased Array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) onboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) in 2015-2018. The images were analyzed using image correlation. The flow velocity at the 20 km downstream from the grounding line (GL) of Shirase Glacier is mean of 2.32 km a(-1) in 2015-2018, which show that flow velocity is considered to be less related to the landfast ice stability. However, the flow velocity around 50 km downstream from the GL show changes related to landfast ice condition. The flow velocity is more increasable of 0.3 km a(-1) under the unstable landfast ice condition than the stable landfast ice condition. Therefore, our results show the velocity of Shirase Glacier are associated with the condition of landfast ice stability or instability.

TI  - REMOTE ESTIMATION OF WHEAT YIELD BASED ON VEGETATION INDICES DERIVED FROM TIME SERIES DATA OF LANDSAT 8 IMAGERY
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation prior to harvest is an important for planning and taking various policy decisions. The recent development in satellite remote sensing technologies with their increased spatial and temporal resolution enabled their enormous application for many users with low cost. The current study was planned based on time series Landsat 8 remote sensing data for real time estimation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield based on vegetation indices and ground-truthing wheat yield data for growing season 2015-16 in district Chakwal, Pakistan. Wheat yield data were collected from an area of 10 m x 10 m at 43 sites along with GPS positions at farmer's field from district Chakwal to develop regressional model. Different indices like, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Wide Dynamic Ratio Vegetation Index (WDRVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were derived from time series Landsat 8 imagery throughout the growing season (2015-16). Linear regression models fitting were developed between all the indices and ground truthing wheat yield data were analyzed based on Coefficient of Determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results revealed that EVI index showed higher values for the month of March 2016, compared with other months. This showed that crop was at the booting and anthesis stage in these months. The EVI and GNDVI indices showed better accuracy and precision with coefficient of determination (R-2) 0.89 and 0.82 values with RMSE value of 203.83 and 224.67 respectively for the month of March-2016. This indicated that Landsat 8 imagery can be used for reliable estimation of wheat yield prior to harvest which can be useful for planning and maintaining national food security stock timely.

TI  - Mapping forest aboveground biomass with a simulated ICESat-2 vegetation canopy product and Landsat data
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) can contribute to reducing uncertainties associated with the amount and distribution of terrestrial carbon. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICE-Sat-2) was launched on September 15th, 2018 and will provide data which will offer the possibility of assessing AGB and forest carbon at multiple spatial scales. The primary goal of this study was to develop an approach for utilizing data similar to ICESat-2' s land-vegetation along track product (ATL08) to generate wall-to-wall AGB maps. Utilizing simulated daytime and nighttime ICESat-2 data from planned ICESat-2 tracks over vegetation conditions in south-east Texas, we investigated the integration of Landsat data and derived products for AGB model and map production. Linear regression models were first used to relate simulated photon-counting lidar (PCL) metrics for 100 m segments along ICESat-2 tracks to reference airborne lidar-estimated AGB over Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in south-east Texas. Random Forest (RF) was then used to create AGB maps from predicted AGB estimates and explanatory data consisting of spectral metrics derived from Landsat TM imagery and land cover and canopy cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Using RF, AGB and AGB uncertainty maps produced at 30 m spatial resolution represented three data scenarios; (1) simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product without the impact of noise (no noise scenario), (2) simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product from data with noise levels associated with daytime operation of ICESat-2 (daytime scenario), and (3) simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product from data with noise levels associated with nighttime operation of ICESat-2 (nighttime scenario). The RF models exhibited moderate accuracies (0.42 to 0.51) with RMSE values between 19 Mg/ha to 20 Mg/ha with a separate test set. The adoption of a combinatory approach of simulated ICESat-2 and Landsat data could be implemented at larger spatial scales and in doing so, ancillary data such as climatic and topographic variables may be examined for improving AGB predictions.

The blooms of Cyanobacteria are not always helpful and traditional approaches to monitoring are often limited by the need of data collection, which is time consuming, expensive and non-continuous. The main goal of this study is to analyze some environmental parameters in the reservoir in a period of five years, from 2014 to 2018. We aim at forecasting the concentration of some physico-chemical parameters, which are indicators of Cyanobacteria presence, by using satellite imagery reflectance in connection with neural and fuzzy neural regression models. Both Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite images are used to predict concentrations of Chlorophyll-a, Algae and Turbidity level. The experimental results prove that the predicted values have good accuracy, therefore suggesting that satellite sensors and fuzzy neural networks are suitable tools for real-time monitoring of water reservoirs.

AB  - Investigation of radar and optical data indices that contain a lot more information on landscapes and vegetation dynamics can be useful to identify opportunities and challenges in agricultural activities. In addition, the potential of synchronous implications of radar and optical data will be an effective method for agro-environmental monitoring and management to promote economic and environmental sustainability as monitoring programs. Crop discrimination as an agricultural monitoring system is a critical step regarding to estimate the area allocated to each crop type, computing statistics for crop control of area-based subsidies or crop production forecasting, environmental impact analysis and some other applications. Integrating both optical (reflectance) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (backscatter) multi-temporal features provides some advantages in terms of a more reliable crop map. We utilize multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Sentinel-2 optical datasets in order to investigate the performance of the sensors backscatter and reflectance for temporal crop type mapping and the sustainable management of agricultural activities. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1, C-band VV and VH polarized SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data were acquired simultaneously by in-situ measurements for the study area. As preliminary results, it is concluded that the classification accuracies were improved results (5%) with using combinations of sensors. Classification accuracies of 93% were achieved in this study with integration use of SAR and optical data.

AB  - Spatially explicit near-surface soil moisture (theta) patterns at high temporal resolution play a very important role in environmental modelling for improving risk assessment and for quantifying the effects of climatic seasonality and land use/land cover change on ecosystem services and functions in Mediterranean catchments. Remote sensing data from the European Copernicus mission are highly acknowledged to serve as fast, reliable, and available suppliers for the derivation of area wide, high grid-resolution information (20 m x 20 m) on near-surface soil moisture patterns acquired at a regular temporal resolution (satellite overpass is every six days). To reliably map theta from remote sensing radar (i.e., Sentinel-1) satellite products, robust calibration with gridded ground-data is needed and use of either sporadically measured or continuously monitored theta is of crucial importance for Validation procedures. This study integrates remote- and ground-based monitoring of local- to field-scale theta in the Alento hydrological observatory situated in southern Italy. This Critical Zone Observatory was recently established in the Mediterranean Region and equipped with a multi-sensor network infrastructure. The final aim of this study is to develop site-specific calibration functions to relate spectral measurements to gridded topographic features to estimate near-surface soil moisture patterns. Estimation performance will be evaluated by comparing remote sensing-based (Sentinel-1) with ground-based soil moisture measured during satellite overpass. The soil moisture transfer relations will eventually support high temporal catchment-based hydrological modeling of groundwater and surface water fluxes under consideration of the climatic variability and in feedback with the vegetation.

TI  - Urban heat islands in relation to green land use in European cities
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenomenon of increased temperature in cities compared to their rural environs, also referred to as urban heat island, is one of the most evident anthropogenic climatic modifications. Introducing green spaces and vegetation is the fastest, simplest, and a highly effective way of mitigating and adapting urban temperature conditions. The primary goal of the presented research is to identify the interrelationship between urban heat island magnitude (UHIM) and urban green infrastructure extent, shape, and distribution on European scale comparing different green space planning traditions - planning families (PFs). The UHIM for the European cities was calculated based on a reconstructed MODIS LST dataset of a period of ten years.The reasons for the arrangement of UHIMs according to PFs and green land use are not easily explained and are certainly influenced by a number of various conditions in different PFs. UHIM increases with the longitude of cities. In some of the PFs, the relation between the UHIM and land use proportion is characteristic for certain land uses, but a considerable difference between PFs regarding land use proportion with significant impact on UHIM can only be noted in case of a forest. The configuration and composition of the forest correlate with UHIM with statistical significance, but the share of the forest does not affect UHI in all PFs in the same way. While a higher proportion of forest, higher largest patch index, higher mean patch area, higher edge density and higher proportional landscape core is associated with a lower UHIM in the New member and Mediterranean PFs, the relationship in other PFs is reversed.Information on general patterns of UHIM occurrence in relation to urban green infrastructure characteristics could help urban planners and politicians introduce changes on the local level, which would help providing nature-based solutions for the mitigation of the UHI phenomenon.

In this paper, we report initial results using the dataset for the active volcano in the Pacific Ocean, Nishinoshima. We observed the island frequently for three months from three identical orbits including left observation and recovered three dimensional deformation of the volcanic island continuously. Experimental results revealed several small events in the volcano and showed the possibility of the method.

AB  - In the field of plant disease protection many approaches exist, but all acknowledge the necessity of fast and accurate identification of the source in order to make the most efficient applications. In this work, a remote sensing approach for the detection of Verticillium dahliae in olive fields is presented. A model was created that calculates a spectral index based on Sentinel-2 data and uses it to assess the levels of stress in olive trees in the region of Chalkidiki, Greece. The derived map provides an overview of the situation concerning stress levels in olive fields across a large area and in a small amount of time. Additionally, because of the constant flow of data from the Sentinel satellites, a time series of calculations can be used as an anomaly indicator for regions of interest. This model can be implemented in an e-Infrastructure as a cloud service to further enhance its usability by relevant parties, such as agricultural advisors and scientists.

AB  - In mineral exploration, remote sensing tools are important and cost effective. Minerals occur in a variety of genetic associations but commercial deposits of minerals are limited in genetic types and modes of occurrences which forms the basis of modern concept based prospecting and is also responsible for the significant role of remote sensing in exploration. Remote sensing data can help to differentiate melogenic provinces/belts/sides and mineral guides in a larger terrain. Keeping In view the importance of RS Tools, digitally enhanced OLI Landsat 8 images are applied to find alteration zones and for geological mapping of North Waziristan Pakistan. The territory is rough with sparse vegetation; the exposure of the Waziristan ophiolite, related sedimentary-igneous lithologies and inaccessibility to the area made the utilization of Landsat information helpful in this investigation. Spectral signatures recorded by Landsat 8 data were used to differentiate different rock units and alteration zones. RS tool i.e. band ratios, band combinations, principal component analysis and image classification are helpful in this regard; multispectral images were prepared and investigated for this study. Final detection of the lithology and alteration zones is based on correlation between classes generated in the thematic map and the referenced geological map. On the basis of the image classification techniques; unsupervised classification, band ratios, five principles lithological units and alteration zones with highest percentage of clay and iron ratios are identified which are giving satisfactory results with overall accuracy 63.07 % in comparison with referenced geological map using confusion matrix analysis. The results are subject to discussion and need to examine about the utility and confinements of remote sensing strategy on the investigation zone.

AB  - River flow is the main source of dissolved and suspended substances entering to the sea, including products of anthropogenic pollution. Coming from the river to the sea, the continental waters form submesoscale structures adjacent to the estuary, distinguished by low salinity and temperature different from the surrounding, and also, increased turbidity, high content of suspended matter and dissolved organics. Such structures are called "Plumes". Traditionally, we can divided two research methods - contact (in-situ/ship measurements) and non-contact (remote sensing data). But, basically the joint use of in-situ measurements and remote sensing data in existing scientific works - is nominally, each source of information is used separately, and more often direct (in-situ) measurements are preferred, and remote sensing data is used as an auxiliary method for qualitative descriptive works. And there is still no reliable information on the extent to which quantitative estimates can be trusted, obtained from remote sensing data, especially in such difficult estuary areas. In this paper, we present the results of verification satellite data in the optical range with the aim of comparing quantitative data in the river-mouth area obtained by contact (field measurements near river mouth in northeastern part of Black sea) and contactless methods.

TI  - Cropland Mapping Using Fusion of Multi-Sensor Data in a Complex Urban/Peri-Urban Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture (UPA) has recently come into sharp focus as a valuable source of food for urban populations. High population density and competing land use demands lend a spatiotemporally dynamic and heterogeneous nature to urban and peri-urban croplands. For the provision of information to stakeholders in agriculture and urban planning and management, it is necessary to characterize UPA by means of regular mapping. In this study, partially cloudy, intermittent moderate resolution Landsat images were acquired for an area adjacent to the Tokyo Metropolis, and their Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was computed. Daily MODIS 250 m NDVI and intermittent Landsat NDVI images were then fused, to generate a high temporal frequency synthetic NDVI data set. The identification and distinction of upland croplands from other classes (including paddy rice fields), within the year, was evaluated on the temporally dense synthetic NDVI image time-series, using Random Forest classification. An overall classification accuracy of 91.7% was achieved, with user's and producer's accuracies of 86.4% and 79.8%, respectively, for the cropland class. Cropping patterns were also estimated, and classification of peanut cultivation based on post-harvest practices was assessed. Image spatiotemporal fusion provides a means for frequent mapping and continuous monitoring of complex UPA in a dynamic landscape.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel approach to improve accuracy of weakly-supervised change detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The method is based on the idea to use an initial small size labeled dataset for synthetic training data generation (STDG) using an Ensemble of Self-Organizing Maps (ESOM). The resulting synthetic data set substitutes the initial small set of labeled authentic data and it is used to train a simple deep neural network (DNN) classifier. The proposed DNN architecture consists of 6 layers: an input layer, two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, and three Fully Connected (FC) layers. The proposed method is evaluated on a TerraSAR-X image acquired in the Fukushima region, Japan, before and after tsunami. We have used only 200 labeled data (100 for the "change" class and 100 for the "no -change" class). As benchmark method, we have considered a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - Advances in space-based geospatial remote sensing technologies, especially interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), have enabled precise monitoring of land surface deformations due to geologic and human processes such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and mining. The success of infrastructure monitoring using InSAR techniques is sometimes limited because a distinguishable radar target is not located at the specific point of interest. To overcome this limitation corner reflectors (CRs) are typically employed to provide detectable, measurable targets at the desired locations. However, CRs are cumbersome three-dimensional structures that are difficult to install and align on infrastructure in an inconspicuous manner that also preserve the aesthetic and structural integrity of the installation site. In this research we developed and tested a two-dimensional Van Atta (VA) array retro-reflector to replace the conventional CR in InSAR remote sensing applications. The two-dimensional retro-reflective array can be discreetly flush mounted onto new or existing infrastructure, thereby preserving the aesthetics of the installation site, and will be less vulnerable to vandalism or damage from the elements (rain, snow, wind).A novel antenna element composed of micro-strip patches and Substrate Integrated Waveguides (SIW) was developed and used in the VA array design. Electromagnetic modeling and simulation using the FEKO code was performed to streamline the design process. To investigate array performance versus Radar Cross Section (RCS), a reconfigurable array, based on an elemental (16 x 16 element) array panel, was employed. Increasing or decreasing the number of panels used to assemble the array increased or decreased the RCS.We designed and fabricated nine VA arrays which were assembled into various multi-panel VA geometries. RCS and retroreflective beam pattern were measured in the lab to confirm that they met the design specifications. Field validation was performed on the VA arrays, in addition to a reference corner reflector, custom designed for this project. Multiple high resolution TerraSAR-X satellite images have been acquired, processed, and analyzed using existing COTS software and routines developed at SwRI. Results indicate that the Van Atta arrays are a viable alternative to CRs and can be potentially employed in a variety of applications including military, hazard reduction and climate change.

AB  - The pine biome is of great importance for the Mediterranean flora, because it forms natural forest stands from low altitudes up to the timberline in the Mediterranean Basin, which are capable of exhibiting large ecological adaptation toward climatic amplitudes. For Bulgaria, the significance of the pine forests is related to their role in reduction of soil erosion, through slowing the water runoff and thus helping to provide a year-round supply of water in the ecosystems. Such plantations become vulnerable to damages from natural and anthropogenic origins, such as wind-throws, snow breakages, wet snowfalls, fires. We have tested different sensors and platforms for relevant data collection in order to allow for an improved identification and understanding of the changes occurring in forest cover, forest structure, and disturbance regimes in mountain forests affected by snowfalls. For the purpose of the study, radar and optical satellite images from the sensors Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2 (ESA), Landsat 8 and MODIS (NASA) were used. Composite raster images from the Sentinel 2, Landsat 8 and MODIS sensors were obtained. Two types of polarization were used in order to recognize areas covered by wet snow. Thematic maps for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the consequences of snowfalls and snow breakages have been generated. Based on the satellite, GPS and terrain data, the areas of severe damages in forests have been successfully identified and assessed.

AB  - Commercial very high-resolution (VHR) Earth observing (EO) satellites have grown into constellations with global repeat coverage that can support existing NASA EO missions with stereo and multispectral capabilities. Sub-meter data from these instruments exceeds petabytes per year and the cost for data, storage systems and compute power have all dropped exponentially. Concurrently, through agreements with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, NASAG-oddard Space Flight Center is acquiring VHR EO imagery from DigitalGlobe's WorldView-1, 2, 3 Quickbird-2, GeoEye-1 and IKONOS-2 satellites. To enhance the utility of these data we are developing an Application Program Interface (API) to produce on-demand user defined science ready products to support NASA's EO missions. These enhancements include two primary foci: 1) surface reflectance 1/2 degrees ortho mosaics - multi-temporal 2 m multispectral imagery that can be used to investigate biodiversity, horizontal forest structure, surface water fraction, and land-cover landuse at the human scale; and 2) VHR digital elevation models (DEMs) - derived with the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline. These enhanced products benefit Earth surface studies on the cryosphere (glacier mass balance, flow rates and snow depth), hydrology (lake/waterbody levels, landslides, subsidence) and the biosphere (vertical forest structure, tree canopy height and cover) among others. Here we present current API capabilities and recent examples of derived products used in NASA Earth Science projects.

TI  - Fact of the matter: Rawls, political ideals, and worldview consensus
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I argue that the fact of reasonable pluralism (FRP) - a famous Rawlsian assumption about the intellectual demographics of liberal democracies - is not as self-evident as is sometimes thought. The problem with the FRP is that in Political Liberalism Rawls is treating the freedoms and burdens story as being sufficient - in itself - to explain the demographics of reasonable pluralism. The inadequacy of the freedoms and burdens story is an indication that the FRP is empirically underdetermined as a way of glossing the belief demographics of liberal democracies. And it is a reason to wonder whether pluralism is as permanent as Rawls thinks. But worldview disagreements are not necessarily so incorrigible. In response to the FRP, it can be asserted that there is nothing that is inherent in the idea of a liberal democracy to preclude the choice by the citizens of a common worldview.

TI  - Integration of Landsat-8 Thermal and Visible-Short Wave Infrared Data for Improving Prediction Accuracy of Forest Leaf Area Index
T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) has been investigated in multiple studies, either by means of visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared or thermal infrared remotely sensed data, with various degrees of accuracy. However, it is not yet known how the integration of visible/near and shortwave-infrared and thermal infrared data affect estimates of LAI. In this study, we examined the utility of Landsat-8 thermal infrared data together with its spectral data from the visible/near and shortwave-infrared region to quantify the LAI of a mixed temperate forest in Germany. A ﬁeld campaign was carried out in August 2015, in the Bavarian Forest National Park, concurrent with the time of the Landsat-8 overpass, and a number of forest structural parameters, including LAI and proportionofvegetationcover,weremeasuredfor37plots. Anormaliseddifferencevegetationindex threshold method was applied to calculate land surface emissivity and land surface temperature and their relations to LAI were investigated. Next, the relation between LAI and eight commonly used vegetation indices were examined using the visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared remote sensing data. Finally, the artiﬁcial neural network was used to predict the LAI using: (i) reﬂectance data from the Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) sensor; (ii) reﬂectance data from the OLI sensor and the land surface emissivity; and (iii) reﬂectance data from the OLI sensor and land surface temperature. A stronger relationship was observed between LAI and land surface emissivitycomparedtothatbetweenLAIandlandsurfacetemperature. Ingeneral,LAIwaspredicted with relatively low accuracy by means of the vegetation indices. Among the studied vegetation indices, the modiﬁed vegetation index had the highest accuracy for LAI prediction (R2CV = 0.33, RMSECV = 1.21 m2m2). Nevertheless, using the visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared spectral data in the artiﬁcial neural network, the prediction accuracy of LAI increased (R2CV = 0.58, RMSECV = 0.83 m2m2). The integration of reﬂectance and land surface emissivity signiﬁcantly improved the prediction accuracy of the LAI (R2CV = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.63 m2m2). For the ﬁrst time, our results demonstrate that the combination of Landsat-8 reﬂectance spectral data from the visible/near-infrared and shortwave-infrared domain and thermal infrared data can boost the estimation accuracy of the LAI in a forest ecosystem. This ﬁnding has implication for the prediction of other vegetation biophysical, or possibly biochemical variables using thermal infrared satellite remote sensing data, as well as regional mapping of LAI when coupled with a canopy radiative transfer model.

TI  - Assessment of LST and NDMI indices using MODIS and Landsat images in Karun riparian forest
T2  - Journal of Forest Science (Prague)
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian forest plays a significant role in ecosystems. Also, research on land surface temperature and soil moisture is essential in earth science and forest studies. Because measuring methods are difficult to apply in large areas and especially in dense forests, in this study normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and land surface temperature (LST) were estimated using the infrared thermal method by data of Landsat 8 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Karun riparian forest that is of ecological importance in the Khuzestan province of Iran. The results showed that the accuracy for estimated NDMI and LST was appropriate (root mean square error = 3.45). In addition, the used polynomial support vector machine algorithm for classification by four classes (forest, agriculture, river, and others) and the validity of classification in these areas were suitable (overall accuracy = 95%, kappa coefficient = 0.93). Also, the NDMI index was dependent on changes in LST and Pearson coefficients were 0.94 and 0.84 for Landsat 8 and MODIS data, respectively. The average temperature of the area was obtained as 43.22 and 42.77 for Landsat 8 and MODIS, respectively. Finally, more protection of this forest against LST enhancement and reduction in soil moisture is necessary.

TI  - The African background of Pentecostal theology: A critical perspective
T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - African Traditional Religion (ATR) represents a primal worldview that encapsulates a certain culturally-innate sense of the world of transcendence and involves belief in a sacramental 'enchanted' universe in which the physical is indicative of spiritual realities, in contrast to western Christianity, that to a certain extent abandoned belief in malevolent powers. The assumption is that Africans live in an 'intentional world' where nothing happens by chance; all events have spiritual causes. Negative events can be resisted by imprecatory prayers and curses. Sacred and secular realities are inseparable. For this reason, it is argued that pneumatic Christianity is close to the grain of African culture and its worldview resonates with the indigenous worldview. In this article, the African background of Pentecostal theology is investigated. By operating within a worldview that allows ample space for the invisible world determining what happens in the visible world, African Pentecostalism was endeared to Africans. For Africans, what happens on earth is directly interrelated with what happens in the dimension of the spiritual, agreeing with the cosmic principalities and powers that provide the mystical causality of a worldview found in the New Testament. The African Pentecostal narrative is concerned with the solution of personal and societal problems that is interpreted in terms of the African view of rulers, authorities, evil powers, cosmic powers, and spiritual forces in the heavenly realm that focuses on how the spirit world impinges on the visible world to hinder or foster human flourishing. Pentecostalism's pneumatic spirituality is discussed from a critical theological perspective.

TI  - The Reflection of the Hierarchy of Values in the Proverbial Fund of the Russian and French languages
T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the research focused on the reflection of Russian and French basic values in proverbs language units that most clearly demonstrate the value systems. Based on the fact that each nation has a certain hierarchically organized set of values, which partially coincide with other cultures but can have their own characteristics, it is important to identify both their universal and culture-specific features. This will allow us not only to build the hierarchy of values of a certain nation but also to conduct a comparative analysis of different languages and cultures from an axiological perspective. To get a general idea of the reflection of values and their hierarchy in proverbs, we have conducted our research on the basis of Russian and French lexicographical material. According to our hypothesis, the thematic classification of proverbs in dictionaries and the corresponding category titles enable us to reveal directly or indirectly the values of a particular nation, and the quantitative correlation of proverbs within each theme can give us an idea of the hierarchy of values: a bigger or smaller number of proverbs on a certain topic indicates the degree of their importance in the consciousness of native speakers of a corresponding linguistic community. The paper presents the preliminary data of the research carried out on a limited material in order to test the methodology chosen by the authors. The research was based on the card index of 2400 Russian and French proverbs elicited from specialized lexicographic sources by means of continuous sampling. The emphasis was made on the French practical material, and the Russian material served as a background for comparative analysis. The paper presents the number of proverbs within each topic, the data giving a general picture of the hierarchy of values (the topics are listed in the descending order of the quantitative indicator). It also contains the results of the comparative analysis. The research has confirmed the possibility of identifying basic values, building their hierarchy and determining the dominant value based on the analysis of the proverbial bank, in particular, the headings of the thematic classification indicated in the lexicographical sources, and the number of units in each topic. The results make it possible to clarify the understanding of the Russian and French linguistic worldviews and can be used in the process of the linguistic and axiological analyses of different languages.

AB  - The latest generation of geostationary satellites carry sensors such as the Advanced Baseline Imager (GOES-16/17) and the Advanced Himawari Imager (Himawari-8/9) that closely mimic the spatial and spectral characteristics of widely used polar orbiting sensors such as EOS/MODIS. More importantly, they provide observations at 1-5-15 minute intervals, instead of twice a day from MODIS, offering unprecedented opportunities for monitoring large parts of the Earth. In addition to serving the needs of weather forecasting, these observations offer new and exciting opportunities in managing solar power, fighting wildfires, and tracking air pollution. Creation of actionable information in near realtime from these data streams is a challenge that is best addressed through collaborative efforts among the industry, academia and government agencies.

AB  - The application of space techniques to geological studies is an important source of information for geological mapping. The optimal exploitation of high spatial resolution satellite imagery can contribute to the improvement of the geological map, particularly when it comes to mapping in arid and desert areas where outcrops are often inaccessible. Indeed, the region of Djanet, main object of our study, is characterized by rather important reliefs and this made the access difficult or sometimes even impossible in certain zones. The study area is located at the northeastern end of East Hoggar. It covers the terrane of Djanet and part of the terrane of Edembo. In addition, this region is probably one of the least explored areas of the Hoggar. This is why different remote sensing techniques have been used to make geological mapping faster and more efficient. The obtained images were subject to various treatments ranging from contrast enhancements to spectral enhancements, and using images in 742 RGB color compositions and calculation processing of bands (3/1, 5/4, 7/5) and the (5/7, 2/1, 4/2), Thus, the analysis of the processed Landsat-7 ETM + images from the Djanet area allowed us to establish a tele-analytical lithological map. The correlation of this map with the field data allowed us to check the validity and the correspondence of the different facies and especially to clarify the lithological contours derived from the analysis of Landsat satellite data.

AB  - Snow water equivalent (SWE) quantifies the amount of water present in a snowpack. Water in a snowpack is dependent on its depth, density, type of snow, previous freezing-thawing cycles, recent precipitation events, etc. This study deals with estimation of snow depth (HS) and snow density (RHO) from remotely sensed data using empirical relationships developed elsewhere and thereby generation of SWE maps and assessing the usability of such approach for non-instrumented eastern Himalayan watersheds. Remotely sensed data: digital elevation model (DEM), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land surface temperature (LST), snow albedo, fractional snow cover and precipitation were used as inputs. Models were developed to find out the RHO, HS and SWE at pixel level. Finally, the SWE maps were generated for the dominating snow months of the year 2013. Results showed that RHO increased from January to May with its peak in the month of May having considerable amount of ripened snow. HS and SWE were found to follow the same trend as SCA (Snow Covered Area), which increased from January to peak in February and then decreased till May. The estimated RHO, HS and SWE were found acceptable in comparison to other published data collected from relevant research works on the Himalayan region and SWE from Global Land Data Assimilation Systems NOAH Land Surface Model (GLDAS NOAH LSM) simulation.

TI  - Discriminating native and plantation forests in a Landsat time-series for land use policy design
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Warren River Catchment of south-western Australia is an area of high biodiversity threatened by the loss of native vegetation and dryland salinity. Over the last 20years, it has been the target of a series of policies that encourage conversion of agricultural land to plantation forest. Remote sensing has a key role in measuring trends in the area of plantation forest observed across the landscape and hence the effectiveness of policy initiatives. Despite its importance to land use policy, accurate data on historical land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics of two spectrally similar but ecologically distinct forest types - such as native forest and plantation forest - are not readily available for south-western Australia, largely due to prohibitive data delivery costs. However, we argue that regular low-cost monitoring of long-term change in the spatial distribution of plantation forest through remote sensing is a critical input into environmental policy for the catchment. To this end, a 35-year time-series of Landsat imagery was acquired, and three different classifiers were tested (Support Vector Machines - SVM; Random Forests - RF; and Classification and Regression Trees - CART) on spectral and textural indices applied to four spectral bands. The six major LULC classes considered were agriculture, water, native forest, sand dunes, plantation forest and harvested native forest. In classifying the imagery the SVM and RF outperformed the CART across all classes. However, the SVM classifier gave a slightly higher F-score for most individual classes than the RF. Eucalypt dominated plantation forest reaching full canopy cover was subject to the highest rates of misclassification inasmuch as it shares spectral properties with the Eucalypt dominant native forest. When applied to Landsat time-series imagery, SVM classifier combined with four bands held in common between the four Landsat sensors, and derived textures metrics are valuable in classifying plantation and native forest, particularly where these have a similar species composition. The differences in prediction accuracy when including additional Landsat bands were not statistically significant, as demonstrated by the McNemar test. Thus, we achieved a trade-off in reducing processing time without significantly impacting on classification accuracy (86%). The relatively high accuracy of the proposed method enables the effects of past policy initiatives to be observed, and hence the efficient design of environmental and conservation policy in the future.

Consequently, systematized ideas about the past (historiography), from an epistemological point of view, is not a science. Therefore, the claims of historians for the possession of reliable objective knowledge are not justified. History should be viewed not as a science, but as a synthetic kind of outlook, in which scientific rationality is combined with religious, mythological, everyday and artistic views of the worldview.

The aim of the project was to link EU Copernicus services -- namely Sentinel remote sensing data -- with a marine biogeochemical model system (HBM-ERGOM). Additionally, the contribution of nitrogen from atmospheric deposition to the marine nitrogen budget was to assess. Two scientific questions were derived for the second project focus:- What contribution does atmospheric nitrogen deposition in total and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from shipping and agricultural activities have to the nitrogen budget in the marine surface layer of the western Baltic Sea?- What is the impact of the spatial resolution of nitrogen deposition data on the biogeochemical model predictions in highly structured coastal areas in the western Baltic Sea region?To deal with these questions, the model system HBM-ERGOM was extended by a nutrient tagging/tracing approach and model simulations with tagged atmospheric nitrogen compounds were performed at the North-German Supercomputing Alliance (HLRN, project id: mvk00054, zulassung.hlrn.de/kurzbeschreibungen/mvk00054.pdf).

AB  - Poverty is one of the most burning issues of today. A lot of surveys of both Russian and foreign scientists are devoted to examining its nature and determining its triggers. A great number of researches have been done on the phenomenon of poverty from the point of view of economic, demographic, and social challenges mostly. This paper does not set objectives to study all theoretical approaches to the observation of the poverty phenomenon in detail but considers the most representative social nature of its occurrence conceptually. The paper touches upon various concepts of an approach to assessing the population's poverty as a socio-economic feature of the society, reveals the methods and techniques so that to study living standards and poverty measurement in Russia. The purpose of this study is to determine the sociocultural characteristic properties of the phenomenon of poverty in Russia, justify the priority guidelines in order to overcome it. The authors used such methods during the research as structural-functional, contrastive, and system-based and component evaluation. It is noted that poverty is not only one of the most complicated socio-economic issues, but also a complex marker of the social development. The authors review the objective conditions that cause indigence in the Russian society. The authors specify that the socially deprived, as a particular social group that is worth to be shown some special attitude, are moving into the background on the fringes of the fellow citizens. consciousness. And this implies that helping the poor is being moved away from the, agenda. more often which is considered to be the urgent one for the most segment of the national population. It is proved that poverty is a factor of social stress. It is adequately supported that a split in the social field is accompanied by a worldview split, which threatens the national integrity in fact. The strategic factors that provide joint relations of members of social interaction as well as stable and well-balanced functioning of the society are the principles of development and economic policy making based on the national traditions and value system.

AB  - The application of remote sensing and GIS technology has shown a great promise, over the years, and offered opportunities for improving identification of areas that are likely to be locations of lineament and mapping. Based on the ability to identify geological features, Landsat ETM-7 satellite data images were used and band-5 was found as the most suitable for lineament delineation. Parameters such as drainage patterns, previously mapped faults, lineaments, and lithological contact layers were used in this study, to produce a fault potential prediction map using the overlay model technique. The generated fault density map classifies the study area into 5 potential zones, thus, very low, low, moderate, high, and very high potential zones. 33 faults, which may represent new faults in the area of investigation were obtained from the correlation between fault segments and faults data collected from field work. NW-SE is the general orientation of the fractures and N100-1100E was the major trend obtained from fault analyses. Poly-phase ductile-brittle structures such as shear zone and faults in the study area were confirmed by our findings. Iron mineralization in the area is controlled by those structures since they form pathways for mineralizing fluids.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of human activities on deforestation and sustainability of water resources and livelihoods in the Congo Basin. It mainly aimed to assess forest degradation in the Yoko reserve from 1976 to 2015 and investigate the compatibility of Landsat imagery for forest monitoring. Digital Image processing for unsupervised classification was done using ENVI software while supervised classification was done by means of ArcGIS 10. Results show that forest landscape faced large scale human induced fragmentation over the last 40 years. If these trends continue, they will affect the sustainability of water resources and livelihoods in the Congo Basin of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Hence, policy makers need to look at key drivers and address impacts that may threaten the future of Hydrological Ecosystems Services, including water and land resources in the Congo Basin. Authorities have to apply an Integrated Management of Water, Land and Ecosystems.

TI  - Integrating Landsat 7 and 8 data to improve basalt formation classification: A case study at Buon Ma Thuot region, Central Highland, Vietnam
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cenozoic basalt regions contain various natural resources that can be used for socio-economic development. Different quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to understand the geological and geomorphological characteristics of basalt formations. Nowadays the integration of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) has become a powerful method to distinguish geological formations. In this paper, authors combined satellite and fieldwork data to analyze the structure and morphology of highland geological formations in order to distinguish two main volcanic eruption episodes. Based on remote sensing analysis in this study, different spectral band ratios were generated to select the best one for basalt classification. Lastly, two spectral combinations (including band ratios 4/3, 6/2, 7/4 in Landsat 8 and 3/2, 5/1, 7/3 in Landsat 7) were chosen for the Maximum Likelihood classification. The final geological map based on the integration of Landsat 7 and 8 outcomes shows precisely the boundary of the basalt formations with the accuracy up to 93.7%. This outcome contributed significantly to the correction of geological maps. In further studies, authors suggest the integration of Landsat 7 and 8 data in geological studies and natural resource and environmental management at both local and regional scales.

T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR Interferometry (InSAR) is a technique to measure land subsidence and can build a subsidence map on a large spatial scale with high accuracy. The study presented the application of PSInSAR for determining the subsidence of the central area of Hanoi through Terrasar-X data set from 2010 to 2015, with 23 images. The result shows that some area has the high subsidence in the districts of Hanoi such as Hoang Mai, Ha Dong and the slow subsidence such as Dong Da, Hai Ba Trung with subsidence velocity is less than -10mm/year. Besides, the correlation between ground subsidence measured by PSInSAR and subsidence monitoring of building CC02 Van Quan in Ha Dong district for the same period was computed with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.94. The PSInSAR technique can detect and estimate subsidence phenomena effectively with X-band.l.

TI  - Synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing image fusion for flood monitoring in the Vietnam lower Mekong basin: a prototype application for the Vietnam Open Data Cube
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood monitoring systems are crucial for flood management and consequence mitigation in flood prone regions. Different remote sensing techniques are increasingly used for this purpose. However, the different approaches suffer various limitations, including cloud and weather effects (optical data), and low spatial resolution and poor colour presentation (synthetic aperture radar data). This study fuses two data types (Landsat and Sentinel-1) to overcome these limitations and produce better quality images for a prototype flood application in the Vietnam Open Data Cube (VODC). Visual and quantitative evaluation of fused image quality revealed improvement in the images compared with the original scenes. Ground-truth data was used to develop the study flood extraction algorithm and we found a good agreement between our results and SERVIR Mekong (a joint initiative by the US agency for International Development (USAID), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam) maps. While the algorithm is run on a personal computer (PC), it has a clear potential to be developed for application on a big data system.

TI  - Developing land-cover driver model for estimating the intensity of surface urban heat islands using landsat 8 satellite imagery
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of utmost importance to understand and monitor the impact of urban heat islands on ecosystems and overall human health in the context of climate change and global warming. This research was conducted in a tropical city, Hanoi, with a major objective of assessing the quantitative relationships between the composition of the main land cover types and surface urban heat island phenomenon. In this research, we analyzed the correlation between land cover composition, percentage coverage of the land cover types, and land surface temperature for different moving window sizes or urban land management units. Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) satellite data was utilized for preparing land-cover composition datasets in inner Hanoi by employing the unsupervised image clustering method. High-resolution (30 m) land surface temperature maps were generated for different days of the years 2016 and 2017 using Landsat 8 TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images. High correlations were observed between percentage coverage of the land-cover types and land surface temperature considering different window sizes. A new model for estimating the intensity of surface urban heat islands from Landsat 8 imagery is developed, through recursively analyzing the correlation between land-cover composition and land surface temperature at different moving window sizes. This land-cover composition-driven model could predict land surface temperature efficiently not only in the case of different window sizes but also on different days. The newly developed model in this research provides a wonderful opportunity for urban planners and designers to take measures for adjusting land surface temperature and the associated effects of surface urban heat islands by managing the land cover composition and percentage coverage of the individual land-cover types.

AB  - Wildfires are getting more severe and destructive. Due to their fast-spreading nature, wildfires are often detected when already beyond control and consequently cause billionscale effects in a very short time. Governments are looking for remote sensing methods for early wildfire detection, avoiding billion-dollar losses of damaged properties. The aim of this study was to develop an autonomous and intelligent system built on top of imagery data streams, which is available from around-the-clock satellites, to monitor and prevent fire hazards from becoming disasters. However, satellite data pose unique challenges for image processing techniques, including temporal dependencies across time steps, the complexity of spectral channels, and adversarial conditions such as cloud and illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel wildfire detection method that utilises satellite images in an advanced deep learning architecture for locating wildfires at pixel level. The detection outputs are further visualised in an interactive dashboard that allows wildfire mitigation specialists to deeply analyse regions of interest in the world-map. Our system is built and tested on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-16) streaming data source. Empirical evaluations show the superior performance of our approach over the baselines with 94% F1-score and 1:5 times faster detections as well as its robustness against different types of wildfires and adversarial conditions.

TI  - Spatial distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation in An Chan coastal waters, Phu Yen province using the PlanetScope satellite image
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seaweed and seagrass form marine submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), which plays an essential role in economic development and ecological protection in coastal areas. In this study, PlanetScope (PS)imaging data was combined with in situ samplings to demonstrate their ability to map SAV distribution in An Chan commune, Tuy An district, Phu Yen province, Central Vietnam. Thanks to data pre-processing by Lyzenga's algorithm and the masking in PS image allow us to remove partly the signals of spectral noises from sun glint effect as well as other random noises. The analysis and accuracy assessment of SAV classification by four different techniques: DII, enhanced DII, BRI and enhanced BRI were alternately performed. The overall accuracy in the accuracy assessment of SAV classification by the above techniques were alternately 83.33%, 88.58%, 86.17%, and 92.52% respectively. Kappa coefficients in the accuracy assessment of SAV classification by the above techniques were alternately 0.77, 0.84, 0.81 and 0.90 respectively. The results of SAV classification by enhanced BRI technique provided the best accuracies and will be chosen for assessing the distribution of Submerge Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) canopies in An Chan coastal waters from PS satellite image. The seagrass beds in An Chan is spread along the coast as well as lie close to the coast of islets. Whereas, the seaweed meadows lie in deeper waters and in the foot of the reefs in 3-4m deep. The total seagrass area in An Chan region was approximately 12.22 ha, with 10.93 ha seagrasses in My Quang, 1.18 ha in Hon Chua and 0.11 ha in Hon Dua. The total seaweed area in An Chan region was approximately 50.32 ha, with 20.20 ha seaweed meadows in My Quang, 22.8 ha in Hon Chua, 5.72 ha in Hon Dua and a small part of 1.60 ha in underwater small reefs.

AB  - The combining of the hyperspectral visible/near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) data with the hyperspectral thermal infrared (TIR) data has been recognized to be an effective way for the detailed identification and classification of minerals. However, what are the effects of introduction of multispectral TIR data on the minerals identification and classification and how those effects are, are not well studied in the background of the majority of multispectral TIR data. To fully evaluate the effects of the combining of the hyperspectral VNIR-SWIR reflectivity with the multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity, this paper tries to use the real data to testify the practicability of introduction of multispectral TIR data for the accuracies of mineral identification and classification. Four classifiers are selected in the experiment. Compared with the results using hyperspectral data alone, the introducing of multispectral TIR data in identification and classification has improved accuracies. However, the overall accuracies are improved about 1-5% by using different classifiers. Although those improvements are not well obvious due to the low spatial resolution, where the spectral mixture of various minerals exists, and the retrieval error of land surface emissivity, the multispectral TIR data are still effective supplements for hyperspectral VNIR and SWIR data in mineral identification and classification.

In this paper, SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and gross primary productivity (GPP), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture and precipitation are used to investigate vegetation stress in six areas of Yunnan Province in China. The results illustrate that SIF, NDVI, and GPP all decrease in the condition of water stress and increase when recovering towards a healthy condition; LST increases under stress conditions and decreases gradually during recovery conditions. Then, analyses of long time-series for SIF, GPP, NDVI, and LST from 2010 to 2017 are conducted. These performances demonstrate SIF is much more sensitive than GPP, the NDVI, and LST during drought conditions. When vegetation is in the condition of water stress, SIF has earlier responses than other parameters. Last, the relationships between SIF and soil moisture in 2010-2016 yield significant results, with the correlation coefficient r=0.56, 0.71, 0.75, 0.74, 0.62, 0.52 and 0.47, sequentially. The correlation coefficients are used to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables. This work demonstrates that SIF is a good way to monitor water condition change, and may play a great role in drought monitoring in the future.

TI  - Sentinel lymph nodes in vulvar cancer: Management dilemmas in patients with positive nodes and larger tumors
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Although sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been routinely used in the treatment of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), questions still remain regarding the management of patients with positive nodes, as well as its use in patients with larger tumors.Methods. Retrospective study of all patients at a single institution with primary vulvar cancer who had SLN biopsy (2008-2015). Patient and tumor characteristics were collected from hospital records. For patients with positive SLN and for those with tumors >= 40 mm, recurrence rates and location were specifically recorded.Results. SLN biopsy was successful in 159 patients (245 groins). Median follow-up was 31 months. 120 patients (187 groins) had a negative SLN without an inguinofemoral lymph node dissection (IFL); there were 6 ipsilateral groin recurrences (5%).7 patients had micrometastasis (<= 2 mm) in the SLN and were treated by radiotherapy. There were no recurrences in the irradiated groins.19 patients with a positive unilateral SLN had bilateral IFL. One (5.3%) had a positive node in the contralateral groin. 9 patients with positive unilateral SLN had subsequent ipsilateral IFL; there were no groin recurrences in the contralateral groin.20 patients had tumor size >= 40 mm. 11 patients had a negative SLN biopsy, and thus no IFL; of these patients, 1 had an isolated groin recurrence (9%).Conclusion. These data suggest it is reasonable to omit a full groin dissection for micrometastatic disease in the SLN, and to perform a unilateral groin dissection in patients with unilateral SLN metastasis. SLN alone in larger tumors may have a higher groin recurrence rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - REMI (Reduced Envelope Multispectral Imager) is a new instrument developed by Ball Aerospace specifically for the Sustained Land Imaging (SLI) program. The goal of REMI is to meet the current Landsat mission requirements with a much smaller volume, lower cost payload. A lower single unit recurring cost enables economies of scale on multiple builds by leveraging non-recurring engineering costs. This lower cost enables multiple copies on-orbit at the same time for improved temporal sampling, an innovative approach to space segment reliability, and more frequent technology on-ramps. REMI achieves miniaturization through use of a common aperture for all spectral bands. REMI features a pointing mechanism that compensates for platform and ground motion while using cross-track, step-stare pointing to produce contiguous ground coverage in all spectral bands. The status of the REMI development and airborne flight testing will be presented.

AB  - In this work, we present a methodology to estimate 3D moisture structures in atmosphere based on the use of SAR interferometry (InSAR), and a Numerical Weather Prediction model (NWP). Maps of propagation delay in atmosphere with sub-kilometer spatial resolution are obtained by assimilating high resolution Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) maps into the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model using the WRF Data Assimilation (WRFDA) System. The PWV maps are obtained by interferometrically processing of Sentinel-1 images. The comparison of WRF modeling of atmosphere parameters, before and after the assimilation is used to study the response of the model to the InSAR information and assess the physical consistency of atmosphere parameters modeled by the system. The visualization of moisture structure in atmosphere is carried out in terms of the 3D spatial distribution of atmosphere refractivity, hydrometeors, thermodynamics quantities and wind patterns. The proposed procedure is applied to the visualization of Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGW) and Convective Systems (CS), two examples of moisture structures in atmosphere.

TI  - BUILDING DAMAGE ASSESSMENT FROM POST-EVENT POLSAR IMAGE BASED ON OPCE AND TEMPLATE MATCHING

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Timely detection and identification of building damage is vitally important for rescue planning after a catastrophic earthquake. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for monitoring large-scale damage and can provide quick response. Compared with single-polarization SAR, fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) provides richer backscatter information of targets, making it possible to assess building damage with only post-event SAR data. In this study, we propose a novel building damage assessment method from post-seismic PolSAR image. This method combines the optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement (OPCE) algorithm and the template matching thoughts to build a new building damage detector. The Radarsat-2 PolSAR image acquired in affected areas after the 2010 Yushu earthquake is used to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the detection rate of serious building damage areas can up to 83.2%.

TI  - Evaluating renewable-energy-relevant parameters of COSMO-REA6 by comparison with satellite data, station observations and other reanalyses
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy-meteorology applications have recently started to make intensive use of reanalysis data. Due to their higher spatial resolution, regional reanalyses (RRA) are especially suitable for a wide range of applications concerning wind- and solar-energy generation. This study evaluates the wind speed from various European reanalyses by comparing reanalysis wind fiel s against near-surface wind speed from more than 200 German station observations. For the evaluation of solar irradiance, reanalysis fiel s are compared with two satellite datasets, SARAH-2 (Surface Solar Radiation Data Set - Heliosat - Edition 2) and HelioMont. We show that, for the 10-m wind speed, the maximum peak correlation between observations and regional reanalyses is reached at a weekly timescale. The investigated European RRA have significantly higher correlations than the global reanalysis ERA-Interim. The biases of the reanalyses strongly depend on the location of interest, the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model used, and the wind speed. The lowest mean absolute error of 0.69 m/s, averaged for stations below heights of 500 m, is achieved by COSMO-REA6 (Consortium of small scale modelling - Reanalysis - 6 km). Using a decomposition scheme, the mean square error (MSE) with respect to tower measurements shows, on the one hand, that the error increases with higher temporal scales due to decreasing correlation. On the other hand, on monthly and longer time scales, the MSE is dominated by the bias between the observations and reanalysis. The comparison of the solar irradiance of the reanalyses with satellite datasets reveals a negative bias for the reanalysis systems based on the NWP model COSMO, while other European regional reanalysis products show an overestimation of solar irradiance. Over the Alpine region, all RRA show high positive anomalies against the SARAH-2 dataset, which vanish when using a second high-quality satellite reference dataset HelioMont, which is especially useful for snow-covered regions.

TI  - Flood Hazard and Flood Risk Vulnerability Mapping Using Geo-Spatial and MCDA around Adigrat, Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - MOMONA ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ethiopia, urban floods incidents are becoming a serious problem in recent years. They are mainly associated with poorly designed urban drainage system and land use planning. Combined to it, lack of early warning system and organized flood disaster mitigation measures at national and local level further increases the gravity of the problem. Adigrat is one of the north Ethiopian towns which is frequently attacked by these floods. To understand and address the issue, a study was conducted around Adigrat town with the aim to spatially delineate the flood hazard and risk with the help of geo-spatial and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools. Baseline maps were developed using Landsat satellite images, DEM, aerial photographs, rainfall data and census population data. Different variables like slope, elevation, rainfall, water table, flow direction and flow accumulation, LULC, population density, building density and road density were considered for developing a model. After the data is collected and organized, Erdas Imagine and ArcGIS software were used to process and prepare the model, and finally weighted overlay model was adopted to stimulate the prototype. Each baseline maps was weighted against its impact since all factors have no the same importance. Accordingly, slope, LULC, elevations; and population density, flood hazard and LULC were found the most important factors. The flood risk areas are delineated based on flood hazard, LULC, population density, road and building density. The results indicate that the Kebeles03, 04 and 05 (center of the town) with flat slopes, low altitudes, more population and significant amount of built up area are found to be the most vulnerable for flood hazard. On the other hand, the Kebeles 01, 02 and 06 lying southwest and west of the study area are least affected by flood due to steep topography and high altitudes. It is suggested that similar type of inter-disciplinary studies are essential to minimize the damages and assure sustainable urban development.

AB  - Cervical cancer patients with stage IA1 disease with lympho-vascular involvement, IA2 or IB1 disease, or squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous histology require a sentinel lymph node navigation surgery (SNNS) via sentinel lymph node biopsy. Bilateral detection rates are high in tumors smaller than 2 cm, and such tumors are the most favorable for SNNS. Utilization of this technique increases the detection rate of lymph node micrometastasis by identification of the target node outside the usual field dissected using formal systematic lymphadenectomy and/or by ultrastaging and has the potential to decrease morbidity associated with standard lymphadenectomy, particularly lymphedema. Sentinel lymph node mapping utilizing both radioisotope and blue dye is the most effective. In more recent years, indocyanine green has emerged as an equally useful tracer compared to the traditional dual tracer technique. Indocyanine green may be particularly useful during laparoscopic or robotic surgery. In order to decide whether or not to omit systematic lymphadenectomy intraoperatively, convenient strategies for intraoperative micrometastatic diagnosis, such as cytokeratin 19 mRNA detection, need to be established.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of canopy-forming kelp on a complex coastline: A novel procedure using the Landsat image archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Kelp forests are highly productive and diverse coastal marine ecosystems which have high variability in extent and biomass spatially and through time. Mapping and monitoring their distribution is integral to understanding the ecology of kelp forests and to inform marine protected area planning. Canada's Pacific coast presents specific challenges to mapping canopy forming kelp with thousands of kilometers of coastline, complex topography, and a large tidal range. While in situ methods and manual interpretation of aerial photography are commonly used to map canopy-forming kelp at local or regional scales, these methods are prohibitively expensive for continued large-area application. Historical and current available inventories of kelp extent are therefore incomplete for Canada's Pacific Coast. The advent of Google Earth Engine, a cloud-computing platform with a repository of Landsat imagery, provides an opportunity to apply Landsat image archive analyses and integrate temporal compositing and filtering to obtain unprecedented data on historical and current kelp extents. However, the effects of the spatial resolution and temporal coverage for mapping canopy-forming kelp in regions with complex coastlines and large tidal ranges are unknown. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) develop a tool within Google Earth Engine to automate the detection of kelp using the Landsat satellite image archive, and (2) quantify the associated limitations for mapping the surface extent of canopy-forming kelp by comparing Landsat derived kelp extent with extents derived from WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The results indicate that the overall accuracy of the developed method is high at 80% and very close in accuracy to WorldView-2 data, but no detection is feasible within approximately one 30 m pixel from the shoreline. The interaction between the spatial resolution, kelp bed size, and bed configuration affected the detected kelp extent, as did the tide level during image acquisition. For both sensors, a 2 m increase in tide resulted in a 40% decrease in kelp extent detected. The Google Earth Engine kelp mapping tool presented provides an efficient and transferable method for mapping canopy kelp extent, and the only currently available method to reconstruct coast wide kelp development for the past three decades. The presented tool has applications in conservation and management planning, for example in creating a baseline of past kelp extent and examining trends in kelp forest variability.

TI  - PROBLEMS OF METAPHILOSOPHY - A VIEW FROM ASIDE
T2  - EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses several problems of metaphilosophy that were explored in the philosophical literature in Russia. Metaphilosophy tries to understand what is philosophy, what problems philosophers are dealing with, which methods they employ in their investigations, the nature of philosophical statements and so on. Philosophers in Russia tended to think of philosophy as a special type of worldview that exists together with the ordinary worldview and religious worldview. The author defines worldview as a collection of basic beliefs about the surrounding world, society, human being, the relations existing between individuals and society, about values and ideals. It is underscored that a worldview is always somebody's worldview (it belongs either to an individual or a social group). The worldview problems explored by philosophers remain the same throughout thousands of years; what changes is how they are stated in different times. Every human being faces these problems if she has realized herself as an autonomous being and the reality splits for her into the I and the non-I. All philosophical problems revolve around three basic questions: what is the non-I (i.e. nature and society)? - this is the ontological question; what is I? (the anthropological question); what relations exist between the I and the non-I (the epistemological, axiological, ethical and other questions). The author also explores several stages of a philosophical investigation: an internal dissatisfaction with existing solutions, a search for a new perspective (meaning, idea, interpretation), development of the found solution. The author points at a number of characteristics that make philosophy different from science: philosophical statements and conceptions cannot be verified or refuted by experience, they are not universal. It is argued that the notion of truth in its classical interpretation cannot be applied to philosophical statements because the latter cannot be true or false. The author concludes that philosophical statements or conceptions express the subjective opinion of a given philosopher about the world and the human being. An obvious evidence for this is the existing pluralism of philosophical systems, schools, and trends.

TI  - Sociology as a resource of "intelligent power" in the globalization era
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The current state of the global social system assumes a compulsory external impact on the national communities of a complex of factors defined in social science as "globalization". Together with the creation of the general economic, social, cultural space that intensifies the international interaction, globalization increases vulnerability of separate social systems. In recent decades, the strategies of J. Nye have become the most popular paradigms of the international competition: hard, soft, smart and intelligent power. The essence of the theoretical conceptualization of the "intelligent power" is that it is based mainly on internal resources and allows to focus on developing the national worldview platform consolidating basic meanings of social system and goals of its development. The possibilities of sociology as a resource of "intelligent power" are in its expert, scientific-educational, innovative and discursive potential. Unfortunately, despite its extensive and powerful network of the scientific-educational institutions financed from the budgetary funds, sociology still does not work in national interests. Sociology is the only social science with a full set of theoretical and methodological tools to gather and analyze social information, to predict social processes, and to work for the following spheres of "intelligent power": think tanks with the participation of sociologists can provide authorities with necessary information, consult them on important decisions, stimulate interest in obtaining new data and starting new studies, serve as a platform for the interaction with professional researchers of social life; introducing educational programs competitive at the international level and based on the production of new knowledge and its effective use in the educational process; critical evaluation of foreign ideologies and conceptions with the subsequent development of one's own ideas and new social paradigms taking into account national interests.

AB  - Monitoring the near-shore environment is always a challenging task. A very detailed representation of the relief is necessary to understand and properly characterize many of coastal processes. Traditional in situ measurements with topographic equipment provide spatially sparse datasets and they could not map in detail the spatial variability in wave and current fields, the shallow water bathymetry and the beach morphology. As an alternative solution to the in situ measurements remote sensing data and particularly high resolution satellite data and airphotos have benn used in coastal monitoring in order to assess the morphological evolution of the coastline or to measure volume changes in the coastal area. More recently, the use of airborne LIDAR systems has been of high interest in coastal area mapping due to the very high accuracy that can be achieved but on the other hand, the very high campaign costs are dissuasive in the use of LIDAR over small study areas. As high-resolution digital surface models (DSMs) and orthophoto maps became a necessity in order to map with precision all the variations in coastal environments unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) photogrammetry offers an alternative solution to the acquisition of high accuracy spatial data along the coastline. The UAVs present serious capabilities such as: almost real-time applicability, flexible survey planning, acquisition of high resolution data, low operational cost, and capability of data collection in difficult accessible environments. This paper presents the feasibility of the use of a small commercial UAV and an unmanned surface vehicle ( USV) for coastal monitoring and shallow water mapping. Optical and acoustic remote sensing data were acquired and processed and the results are presented.

AB  - PROBA-V mission was conceived, and launched by ESA in 2013, to ensure continuity to the SPOT-VGT longterm data series of global daily land observations, started in 1998, bridging the gap to Sentinel-3. Nowadays, thanks to the successful and smooth operations of the PROBA-V satellite, a >20 years consistent data record of land surface reflectances, is available to the scientific community. This long-term dataset has clear relevance for trend analysis, anomaly detection and climate related applications. Despite this obvious interest, the exploitation of this dataset is still limited and mostly focused to near-real time applications, using the SPOT-VGT archive as a background average to detect anomalies, e.g., in NDVI time series. In order to fill this gap, and to exploit the full potential of this dataset, ESA has funded a new project called CISAR@MEP, whose primary goal is to set the stage for the generation of a global 20 years long-term data record of surface reflectance and aerosol properties from analysis of SPOT-VGT and PROBA-V observations. For this purpose, a recently developed algorithm, called CISAR and developed by Rayference, will be used, allowing the joint retrieval of aerosol and surface reflectance properties, together with the associated retrieval uncertainties. This new long-term data record will eventually fulfill current Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirements for the generation of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), such as surface albedo and aerosol optical thickness, being 5% and 10%, respectively. Such data set can support the needs of both the atmospheric and land surface research communities and it can contribute to Copernicus operational service and ESA Climate Change Initiatives (CCI) activities. The CISAR@MEP project started during Q1 2019 with expected 2 years duration. The aim of this paper is to present this ESA funded project, to illustrate the objectives and the methodology and to provide some preliminary results. Furthermore, the technological implementation approach will be detailed, which makes full use of the PROBA-V Mission Exploitation Platform (MEP), a scalable processing environment, providing direct access to both SPOT-VGT and PROBA-V full mission archive together with the required resources and tools.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel method for estimation of snow/no-snow labels for cloud-obscured pixels in order to enable an accurate mapping of the snow-covered area (SCA) in time series. The proposed method leverages the embedded information in multitemporal correlation between the presence/absence of snow and environmental factors including the topographical elevation, date of acquisition, and the cloud obscuration duration. The proposed method is built upon three main steps: i) classification of single date images into three classes (snow, no-snow, and cloud), ii) estimation of conditional probabilities of class-transition in relation with the environmental factors, and iii) prediction of the snow/no-snow labels for the cloud-obscured pixels. We validated the proposed method on daily MODIS images acquired over 10 years in a mountain area located in Italy and Austria. The proposed method yielded SCA improved maps compared to a standard method of assigning labels beneath the clouds.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on exploring the meteorological factors behind dust emergence and spread over Baluchistan in the post-monsoon season, as much of the existing research has been done on spring episodes. With the integration of remote sensing and meteorological methods, efforts were made to explore the relationship of dust storms with land-atmospheric conditions like surface temperature and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the selected season. To map dust spatial distribution, a cloud-free product of brightness temperature difference (BTD) composite from MODIS terra level 1B emissive bands was prepared and classified using maximum likelihood technique. Two case studies of October 2004 and December 2011 exhibited the short-term cooling effect on the surface due to increased AOD. Dominant synoptic patterns of cold trough front formation with low-pressure centre development over eastern Iran were found as a significant feature of dust mobility towards warmer Baluchistan. Back trajectory analysis revealed that dust from south western Kazakhstan and eastern Europe converged over land of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, which may have instigated its uplift over Helmand Basin. Evidence of a dominant effect of air masses from Middle East, Iran and Iraq was found in post-monsoon dust episodes.

TI  - Using Geospatial Technologies in Mapping the Distribution and Quality of Ecosystems

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the context of present environmental changes, human society is continuously looking for ways to evaluate the status of ecosystems and determine human-induced modifications on their structure and functionality. A clear overview of ecosystems is fundamental in choosing the appropriate measures in our search for sustainability and improving the quality of life. The aim of the chapter is therefore to underline how geography can respond to the need of mapping the distribution and quality of ecosystems. This is easily done by using geospatial technologies, helping to a better understanding of the relation between the spatial distribution and management of ecosystems. The chapter presents the main types of data required by geospatial technologies and the data sources for mapping ecosystems. Challenges in gathering reliable data are also presented besides various methods of overcoming the difficulties. There is a strong emphasis on differentiating the available geospatial technologies for mapping the distribution of ecosystems and for representing their quality. The use of different geospatial technologies in mapping the distribution and quality of specific ecosystems was highlighted through case studies of urban ecosystems, water bodies and forests. We also aimed to identify the causes that determined certain ecosystem approaches, and the potential of geospatial technologies in providing to geographers and other scholars the possibility to explore processes from the past, present, or modeling the future. As geographical assessments require a "cause and effect" approach, we aimed to emphasize how geospatial technologies are used in identifying the causes that determined certain planning policies, shaping the current geographical landscape, the effects of these policies, and the future outcomes of newly implemented or proposed planning policies. The current potential of geospatial technologies gives access to complex diachronic analysis, providing the geographers and other scholars the possibility to explore the various processes that occur in the geographical landscape. The chapter demonstrates how geography and geospatial technologies can help policy and decision makers, local administrations, or stakeholders evaluate the distribution and quality of specific ecosystems.

TI  - SAR Interferometry for Sinkhole Early Warning and Susceptibility Assessment along the Dead Sea, Israel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past three decades, the Dead Sea (DS) water level has dropped at an average rate of 1 m/year, resulting in the formation of thousands of sinkholes along its coastline that severely affect the economy and infrastructure of the region. The sinkholes are associated with gradual land subsidence, preceding their collapse by periods ranging from a few days to about five years. We present the results of over six years of systematic high temporal and spatial resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations, incorporated with and refined by detailed Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) measurements. The combined data enable the utilization of interferometric pairs with a wide range of spatial baselines to detect minute precursory subsidence before the catastrophic collapse of the sinkholes and to map zones susceptible to future sinkhole formation. We present here four case studies that illustrate the timelines and effectiveness of our methodology as well as its limitations and complementary methodologies used for sinkhole monitoring and hazard assessment. Today, InSAR-derived subsidence maps have become fundamental for sinkhole early warning and mitigation along the DS coast in Israel and are incorporated in all sinkhole potential maps which are mandatory for the planning and licensing of new infrastructure.

TI  - Sea level changes of Sharm Yanbu and its expected impacts on development processes using GIS and remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern coast of the Red Sea is characterised by many coastal entrances that penetrate the sea. Its origins can be traced to the estuaries of ancient wadis that influenced the evolution of the geological environment, marine structures, and sea factors. The objective of this study is to discover the geomorphological development of Sharm Yanbu and to determine the factors of its development and the most important changes that occurred on the coast between 1990-2016. The study also aims to identify areas that have suffered a decline due to erosion and marine factors that have threatened tourism and economic development in the region. The risk of flooding in marine areas and surrounding sea floods during periods of high tide and storm waves is also examined to determine coastal ranges. Two Landsat images are used over a 26-years period to monitor changes in the coastline and identify the areas of decline through the satellite image analysis program. Radar data is also used to identify topography and surrounding areas, and to construct a pattern of occurrence of marine floods and identify areas likely to be covered by seawater in the future. The first factor is related to the geological formation and the structure that surrounds the sharm. The second factor is related to marine factors whose effects appear in the form of carving down and the dissolution of the limestone coastline to form grooves and trenches. The third factor relates to the topography of the low sloping coastal plain.

AB  - Measuring forces and torques applied to tools of unconventional shapes can be challenging due to difficulties in connecting commercially available force/torque sensors. We propose an innovative, customizable six-axis force/torque sensor which can be clamped around a tool or end-effector to minimize the proximity between tool tip and sensor structure. The sensor is fabricated using 3d printing technology and consists of two pieces which together form an 8-legged Stewart platform. Each leg is designed as a cantilever beam to allow for a measurable displacement under an external load. The displacements of the legs are measured with 8 light intensity-based optoelectronic sensors, which exhibit high sensitivities and low noise levels without the need for external amplification circuitry. A customized printed circuit board and peripheral hardware are proposed to allow for efficient analog-to-digital conversion of the force/torque measurement. A calibration process is proposed which makes use of a commercial ATI Mini40 sensor and custom hardware to allow for fast calibration routines. Finally, the calibrated sensor design is compared to the ATI Mini40 sensor by measuring sequences of forces and torques, and the maximum errors of force/torque components (F-x, F-y, F-z, M-x, M-y, M-z) are 16.3%, 20.0%, 27.5%, 20.5%, 21.6%, 14.9% respectively.

AB  - The purpose of present study was to acquire the knowledge about the phase noise of Sentinel-1 satellite, acquiring C-band SAR imagery since 2016. Firstly, the coherence was estimated for 6 pairs of images at Tsukuba study site, and the relationships between the coherence and the baseline were evaluated. Then, we estimated the errors of DEMs of the fixed ground objects produced by the interferometric analysis. Further, we evaluated the relationships between the errors of DEMs and the height of ambiguity, and finally the phase noise was estimated based on the developed methods by the authors. The result showed that the phase noise of Sentinel-1 was about 11 %, about 6 times larger than PAL SAR-2.

AB  - Promoting the recovery of forest management has been identified as a key priority by the Government of Mongolia. The objective of this paper is to define land cover classification and land cover change in Khandgait valley between 2000 and 2019. The study area is located in the North central part of Mongolia in Bulgan province. Landsat satellite images with 30m resolution were applied. For the validation, we used ground truth measurements. Maximum-likelihood method was applied in this study. The output map of land cover classification was analyzed and compared with the ground truth measurements. The results showed an overall accuracy of 86.5% and 89.0% for the 2000 and 2019 images, respectively. Land cover changes were quantitatively presented with the results of accuracy assessments between 2000 and 2019. In the future, we need to improve forest monitoring and analyze forest management using satellite images.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land-use statistics are more informative per-field than per-pixel. Land-use classification requires up-to-date field boundary maps potentially covering large areas containing thousands of farms. This kind of map is usually difficult to obtain. We have developed a new, automated method for deriving closed polygons around fields fromtime-series satellite imagery. We have been using this method operationally in New Zealand to map whole districts using imagery from several satellite sensors, with little need to vary parameters. Our method looks for boundaries-either step edges or linear features-surrounding regions of low variability throughout the time series. Local standard deviations from all image dates are combined, and the result is convolved with a series of extended directional edge filters. We propose that edge linearity over a long distance is a more important criterion than spectral difference for separating fields, so edge responses are thresholded primarily by length rather than strength. The resulting raster edge map (combined from all directions) is converted to vector (GIS) format and the final polygon topology is built. The method successfully segments parcels containing different crops and pasture, as well as those separated by boundaries such as roads and hedgerows. Here we describe the technique and demonstrate it for an agricultural study site (4000 km(2)) using SPOT satellite imagery. We show that our result compares favorably with that from existing segmentation methods in terms of both quantitative quality metrics and suitability for land-use classification.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) may be associated with intrapartum sentinel events or may be unexplained. We sought to identify risk factors for unexplained HIE cases and compare their morbidity and mortality to cases associated with sentinel events.Study Design Retrospective cohort study of all neonates admitted with suspected HIE treated with whole-body hypothermia from January 2007 through July 2017. Cases of unexplained HIE were compared with those with a sentinel event.Results A total of 223 neonates met the inclusion criteria, of which 86 (38.6%) experienced a sentinel event and 137 (61.4%) did not. Placental histopathology was performed for 28/31 (90.3%) and 48/53 (90.6%) inborn neonates with and without sentinel events, respectively. Placentas from unexplained HIE cases more often exhibited histologic chorioamnionitis (43.8% vs. 17.9%, p =0.02) and funisitis (25% vs. 3.6%, p =0.02). Neonatal morbidity and mortality were similar. On multivariable regression, nulliparity (odds ratio [OR], 4.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-13.62) and histologic funisitis (OR, 20.33, 95% CI: 1.11-373.4) remained significant.Conclusion Other than nulliparity and infection which could be identified on umbilical cord examination following delivery but not on clinical assessment prior to delivery, there are no other identifiable risk factors for HIE in the absence of a sentinel event, and morbidity and mortality are similar between groups.

AB  - Natural and man-made disasters have become an issue of growing concern throughout the world. The frequency and magnitude of disasters threatening large populations living in diverse environments, is rapidly increasing in recent years across the world due to demographic growth, inducing to urban sprawls into hazardous areas. These disasters also have far-reaching implications on sustainable development through social, economic and environmental impact. This chapter summarises three scientific contributions from relevant experiences of the British Geological Survey and the Federico II University of Naples, where remote sensing sensors have been playing a crucial role to potentially support disaster management studies in areas affected by natural hazards. The three cases are: the landslide inventory map of St. Lucia island, tsunami-induced damage along the Sendai coast (Japan) and the landslide geotechnical characterization in Papanice (Italy). For each case study we report the main issue, datasets available and results achieved. Finally, we analyse how recent developments and improved satellite and sensor technologies can support in overcoming the current limitations of using remotely sensed data in disaster management so to fully utilize the capabilities of remote sensing in disaster management and strength cooperation and collaboration between relevant stakeholders including end users.

TI  - Recent NDVI Trends in Mainland Spain: Land-Cover and Phytoclimatic-Type Implications
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal evolution of vegetation is one of the best indicators of climate change, and many earth system models are dependent on an accurate understanding of this process. However, the effect of climate change is expected to vary from one land-cover type to another, due to the change in vegetation and environmental conditions. Therefore, it is pertinent to understand the effect of climate change by land-cover type to understand the regions that are most vulnerable to climate change. Hence, in this study we analyzed the temporal statistical trends (2001-2016) of the MODIS13Q1 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to explore whether there are differences, by land-cover class and phytoclimatic type, in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. We found 7.6% significant negative NDVI trends and 11.8% significant positive NDVI trends. Spatial patterns showed a non-random distribution. The Atlantic biogeographical region showed an unexpected 21% significant negative NDVI trends, and the Alpine region showed only 3.1% significant negative NDVI trends. We also found statistical differences between NDVI trends by land cover and phytoclimatic type. Variance explained by these variables was up to 35%. Positive trends were explained, above all, by land occupations, and negative trends were explained by phytoclimates. Warmer phytoclimatic classes of every general type and forest, as well as some agriculture land covers, showed negative trends.

TI  - OVERVIEW OF CULTURAL PECULIARITIES IN TEACHING RUSSIAN TO MALAGASY STUDENTS
T2  - 13TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The article explores the experience of teaching Malagasy students the Russian language and theoretical disciplines in Russian at RUDN University (Moscow, Russia). Being an international institution of higher education, RUDN University pays particular attention to teaching foreign students focusing on their national identity and cultural peculiarities. The authors put forward a thesis that greater efficiency and better results are achieved when working and evaluating in groups, which is largely determined by the peculiarity of the world outlook of the Malagasy.The specificity of the worldview by the Malagasy is considered on the example of the cultural concept Fihavanana 'social fraternity' and the Malagasy paroemiae. The cultural concept involves collective meaningful mental formations that record the uniqueness of the culture under consideration, which is closely related to linguistic consciousness, communicative behavior, and discourse.Fihavanana, one of the characteristics of Malagasy society, originated in the early Malagasy ideology and had a great influence not only on the mentality of the people, but also on the life of Malagasy society. In Madagascar, Fihavanana remains a hot topic, it is comparable to the concepts of several European philosophers, such as J. Simmel, J. Lacan and E. Durkheim, and relates to the level of cultural and moral values of society. Fihavanana can be described as a combination of the concept of friendship, solidarity and readiness for help; a system of rules, norms and customs that organizes Malagasy society; as a marker of belonging to a social group, and also as a sign of tolerance, justice, and harmony in the world.The scientific novelty of the research consists in the fact that the paroemiae of the Malagasy language and their translation in a comparative aspect are described for the first time. The practical value of the study is implemented through the recommendations for teaching the Russian language to Malagasy students (particularly, in a university) proposed by the authors.The results of the research are proved by a poll in which 20 Malagasy students took part, which contributed to increasing the efficiency of educational activities with Malagasy students and their development in the cultural environment of a foreign university.

AB  - This chapter examines the influence of agricultural land uses on the occurrence of landslides in the humid tropical environments of Kigezi highlands in South Western Uganda. Analysis of the agricultural land use practices is a prerequisite to understanding landscape fragility and community resilience to landslide hazards. An analysis of agricultural land use patterns was undertaken through interpretation of Sentinel 2A images for 2016. The imagery data was acquired from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinels Scientific Data Hub. Field surveys and investigations were also carried out to establish and map the spatial distribution of landslide hazards. Six agricultural land use categories were identified, namely, annuals, perennials, grazing, fallow, wood lots and agroforestry. Considering the agricultural land use patterns, annual crops are the dominant agricultural land use type spanning 69% of the total area followed; by perennials (13%). Grazing land and fallows covered 11% and 5%, respectively. The study revealed that annual crop land is the most affected agricultural land use category. Out of the 65 landslide scars mapped, 31% occurred on annual crop areas. Wood lot areas experienced the least landslide occurrence (4%). A close spatial distribution of agricultural land use practices and landslide occurrence is discernible. It is recommended that a comprehensive tree planting campaign be carried out in areas prone to landslides since it was inferred that wood lots suffered least from landslides. It is also recommended that farmers be encouraged to restore and manage terrace bunds which could help to check on water velocity and consequently increase on slope stability.

TI  - Downscaling Land Surface Temperature on Multi-Scale Image for Drought Monitoring
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important indicator of environmental changes, especially related drought monitoring. It is necessary to accurately detect drought events using advanced technology proved information regarding the drought areas. Remote sensing images have proven to be efficient in detecting drought events. MODIS Terra and Landsat 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (The Operational Land Imager and the Thermal Infrared Scanner) represent remote imaging images with different spatial resolutions that enable us to provide drought information. However, proper methods are needed to optimize these images for monitoring drought events. The purpose of this study is to find out the ability of multi-scale images provide information about drought monitoring using LST methods. The method used in LST is a Temperature Condition Index (TCI), the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). All three equations are selected because they represent a modification of the method for LST input. The results suggest that the three equations used in multi-level imagery have a critical alignment of information regarding the drought. The results show that the drought pattern identified by MODIS Terra image was similar to the one detected by Landsat ETM+ and OLI/TIRS images. However, we found a temperature difference in the dry season (especially in October) between Landsat ETM+ and OLI/TIRS. The degree of LST estimation accuracy between MODIS Terra and Landsat (ETM+ and OLI/TIRS) is indicated by the average difference between the results of those images, which was 1 degree Celsius (1 degrees C). The use of these three equations for drought monitoring with multi-level imagery suggests that there is a positive relationship. This relationship manifests the same pattern, shape, and association that are produced, thus using a common equation for drought monitoring is more focused.

AB  - Muara Gembong used to a large area of mangroves at the northern tip of Bekasi Regency, West Java. Over the last 4 decades, this area has experienced significant changes in land use and loss of environmental and ecosystem services provided by mangroves. Past economic activities have resulted in the conversion of thousands of hectares of mangrove into pond areas in pursuit of fisheries production, which at the time became a national program. This change has resulted in ecological disasters and caused economic losses to coastal communities such as shoreline changes (causing the loss of several coastal villages) and sea water intrusion (damaging pond areas and resulting crop failure). This study assessed the impact of land used changes on mangrove dynamic and shoreline erosion rate along the 5 coastal villages of Muara Gembong over 42 years. Multi-temporal Landsat data set and ground truth survey were applied. The imageries have been classified digitally using Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm and have been validated through the process of accuracy assessment. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) in ArcGIS environment was used to create transects and statistical analyses for the shoreline. The results show that since 1976 the area of mangrove forests has decreased by 55% and most of it has changed to become fishponds (increased to 35%). The land conversion has resulted in shoreline changes and the biggest erosion occurred in the Pantai Bahagia village with an erosion rate of 15.46 m/year and lost an area of 330,460 Ha.

Early dataset from two x-band radar observation data (GMWR25SP and SANTANU) and composite RGB Himawari satellite are used to investigate the first signal before the v-shaped occurred. The period of the dataset is from 10.50 LT until 11.10 LT. Comparison from both time and visualization of the dataset are conducted to analyze the event. Time comparison from three dataset showed differences for the emergence of early indication. GMWR25SP is the first that could detect the early origin of convective cell. Visual comparison in three dataset showed slightly different pattern, especially for composite RGB Himawari. Similarity pattern are only showed in the period 11.00 LT. Analysis of each dataset are necessary to see more detailed on the generation process. SANTANU showed a rapid growth process from one cell into two convective cells spatially within 20 minutes period. The vertical growth of these two convective cells are persistent and reaching up to 10 km based on GMWR25SP. These strong convective cells are probably because of the vorticity couplet that occur in 11.00 LT until 11.10 LT. The dominant air mass movement based on the water vapor distribution RGB Himawari are showed towards the west side. This probably affect the position of the generated second convective cell (position on the left side of the previous cell). Data indication in 11.10 LT is the important period because it showed the generated second convective cell. Combination from three dataset give a more comprehensive analysis on the process before localized heavy rainfall occurred.

AB  - Whenever a disaster occurs, users in social media, sensors, cameras, satellites, and the like generate vast amounts of data. Emergency responders and victims use this data for situational awareness, decision-making, and safe evacuations. However, making sense of the generated information under timebound situations is a challenging task as the amount of data can be significant, and there is a need for intelligent systems to analyze, process, and visualize it. With recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), numerous researchers have begun exploring AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques for big data analytics in managing disasters efficiently. This paper adopts a systematic literature approach to report on the application of AI, ML, and DL in disaster management. Through a systematic review process, we identified one relevant hundred publications. After that, we analyzed all the identified papers and concluded that most of the reviewed articles used AI, ML, and DL methods on social media data, satellite data, sensor data, and historical data for classification and prediction. The most common algorithms are support vector machines (SVM), Naive Hayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial neural networks (ANN), Natural language processing techniques (NLP), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR).

TI  - Water in the Chinantla region, Mexico. Comparative study of a Chinantec worldview based on their oral tradition
T2  - BOLETIN DE LITERATURA ORAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, eight stories from the Chinantec oral tradition are mentioned and compared. Half of them correspond to a compilation by anthropologist Robert J. Weitlaner, from the middle of the 20th century, and the other half was obtained between 2015 and 2016 in the municipalities of Santa Maria Jacatepec and San Jose Chiltepec, located in the same region, known as the Chinantla. The only requirement for the study was that the topic of water was present in the texts. This exercise allowed observing the importance of water resources in the Chinantec worldview, its recurrence and persistence in tradition, despite the changes caused by the social development policies promoted by the Mexican government, which impacted on natural resources. However, the comparison will serve to demonstrate that, from the similarities arise the possible differences between both corpuses. These are related to the historical context in which the stories were compiled.

AB  - The oxygen in the city of Jember largely generated by green open space of vegetation stand. The green space that is the focus of this research is woody / cambium standing vegetation, which is able to produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Remote sensing data through SPOT-7 image is used to know the condition of green open space in Jember City more quickly and accurately. The purposes of this research are: (1) studying SPOT-7 image capability for extraction of green open space data viewed from its accuracy; (2) to know the amount of oxygen supply produced by the actual standing vegetation green open space and the oxygen supply needs of the population, motor vehicles, and livestock; (3) to know the adequacy of green open space based on oxygen demand in Jember City. This research uses quantitative method and field measurement. The analysis of the adequacy of green space is known through the extraction of information from SPOT-7 images and related secondary data. The parameters used are the determination of the area of green open space demand based on oxygen demand, and the amount of oxygen produced by the actual standing vegetation green open space. The analysis of the adequacy of green open space based on oxygen demand is calculated in the vicinity of Jember City. The results of this study indicate that the spread of green open space around the city of Jember uneven, this is caused by the spread of green space that actually clustered in certain sub-districts. Therefore, it is better to balance the ecological and natural environment aspects of urban areas can be a concern in the management of green open space in the city of Jember.

AB  - Characteristics of corals spectral from different species are expected have optically different characters. This study classified the dominant substrate of shallow water base on spatial resolution of imagery and in situ measurement and analyzed the accuration of Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery to determine health of coral reefs. The image processing are atmospheric correction, cropping, masking, Depth Invariant Index, Unsupervised classification, ground truthing, reclassify, accuracy assessment, and spectral reflectance analysis. Unsupervised classification used IsoData method with Lyzenga application to detection of coral reefs condition. Spectral measurement by spectroradiometer underwater, photo underwater, and geotagging are conduct as in situ measurement. Spectral reflectance of medium spatial resolution image and insitu measurement are integrated to discriminate of live coral, dead coral cover with algae, rubble and algae. The results of this study show a baseline for develop the Di gi t a l Coral Health Chart as an approach to determine living coral condition using remote sensing techniques. It can be used as an effective way for detecting and monitoring of dynamic changes of coral reefs on small islands in Spermonde Archipelago. Image analysis integration and in situ survey results show that rubble and dead coral with algae were indicating as coral death due to either damaging human activity and natural death.

TI  - Narrative warfare The 'careless' reinterpretation of literary canon in online antifeminism
T2  - NARRATIVE INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article studies the use of literature and narrative strategies of online antifeminist movements. These movements classified under the umbrella term the manosphere, wage ideological narrative warfare to endorse a misogynistic worldview. The case at hand concentrates on the radical faction of neomasculinity and its attempts to reinterpret the Western canon of literature. I propose that neomasculine readings of novels such as Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita are careless interpretations that ground themselves on specific traits of the texts while ignoring others. These readings attempt to evoke a sense of recognition in the community that believes in an alleged feminist conspiracy against men. Careless interpretations borrow from post-truth rhetoric and the feminist literary theory tradition of reading against the grain. When confronted over their controversial views, neomasculine figures renarrativize readings to benefit the promotion of neomasculine perspectives. This strategic use of literature is part of the narrative warfare discussed in detail.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to estimate the extent of the burned area in ex-Mega Rice Project (MRP) (Block A and Block E), Central Kalimantan and quantify the carbon emission as a result of peat fires in this area. A Synthetic Aperture Radar TerraSAR-X image was the main input in this study. Pre-processing included radiometric calibration, geometric reprojection and speckle filtering (Gamma MAP 7 x 7 kernel size). Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification was used for classifying burned areas. The classification result was validated based on data from the Kalimantan Forests and Climate Partnership report (KFCP). The burned area in 2010 as estimated by the TerraSAR-X satellite image HH/HV polarization was 47.6113 km(2) (4761.13 ha). Main pollutants (carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC)) emissions were estimated based on an empirical equation. The average annual carbon releases into the atmosphere from this area were estimated to be 173,019.46 ton CO2, 11,388.62 ton CO, 1,149.81 ton PM10, 996.50 ton PM2.5 569.43 ton OC and 72.27 ton BC. This study suggests that the methodology proposed based on Earth Observation data can be used to locate burned areas in tropical environment and quantify carbon emissions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Why do so many Americans hold misperceptions? We examine two factors that contribute to the prevalence of these beliefs. First, presenting correct information should reduce misperceptions, especially if provided in a dear and compelling format. We therefore test the effect of graphical information, which may be especially effective in facilitating belief updating about changes in quantities over time. in some cases, though, people may reject information because it threatens their worldview or self-concept - a mechanism that can be revealed by affirming individuals' self-worth, which could make them more willing to acknowledge uncomfortable facts. We test both mechanisms jointly. In three experiments, we find that providing information in graphical form reduces misperceptions. A third study shows that this effect is greater than for equivalent textual information. Our findings for self-affirmation are more equivocal. We find limited evidence that self-affirmation can help diminish misperceptions when no other information is provided, but it does not consistently increase willingness to accept corrective information as previous research in social psychology would suggest. These results suggest that misperceptions are caused by a lack of information as well as psychological threat, but that these factors may interact in ways that are not yet well understood.

T2  - PERSON-CENTERED AND EXPERIENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the turbulent times of the 1960s and 1970s in Europe and the US a cultural upheaval of predominantly young people challenged the structures, habits and institutions that underpinned the Modern industrial worldview that had originated in the Enlightenment. Though resisted by the establishment, the counter-cultural challenge nevertheless succeeded in loosening constraints of industrial consciousness and opened the way for new psychological attitudes or new ways of being that Carl Rogers suggested pointed the way to 'persons of tomorrow.' This article is adapted from a presentation given at the 13th World Conference for Person-centered & Experiential Psychotherapy and Counselling 'Facilitating Hope' held in Vienna in July 2018 and describes a consciousness shift apparent among people engaged in transformative change projects in which Modernist consciousness is being expanded by reclaiming ways of knowing and acting left behind by the Enlightenment. Describing work by the International Futures Forum, examples are offered of transformative action projects where this new consciousness is at work. Such projects may function as academies of hope.

M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of Sentinel 1 C-band (5 cm wavelength) synthetic aperture radio detection and ranging (RADAR) (abbreviated as SAR) for flood mapping is demonstrated, and this approach is used to map the extent of the extensive floods that occurred throughout the Republic of Ireland in the winter of 2015-2016. Thirty-three Sentinel 1 images were used to map the area and duration of floods over a 6-mo period from November 2015 to April 2016. Flood maps for 11 separate dates charted the development and persistence of floods nationally. The maximum flood extent during this period was estimated to be -24,356 ha. The depth of rainfall influenced the magnitude of flood in the preceding 5 d and over more extended periods to a lesser degree. Reduced photosynthetic activity on farms affected by flooding was observed in Landsat 8 vegetation index difference images compared to the previous spring. The accuracy of the flood map was assessed against reports of flooding from affected farms, as well as other satellite-derived maps from Copernicus Emergency Management Service and Sentinel 2. Monte Carlo simulated elevation data (20 m resolution, 2.5 m root mean square error (RMSED were used to estimate the flood's depth and volume. Although the modelled flood height showed a strong correlation with the measured river heights, differences of several metres were observed. Future mapping strategies are discussed, which include high-temporal-resolution soil moisture data, as part of an integrated multisensor approach to flood response over a range of spatial scales.

TI  - Preliminary Analysis of Forest Stand Disturbances in Coastal Georgia (USA) Using Landsat Time Series Stacked Imagery
T2  - FORMATH
M3  - Article
AB  - A determination of forest characteristics across broad areas is of great concern to the forest industry in the southern United States, as timber supply decisions can be based on opportunities, or lack of thereof, across all wood procurement areas. This is important in areas such as the southern United States, where the land ownership distribution is highly fragmented and where no general comprehensive source of forest data exists other than the low-intensity USDA Forest Service FIA surveys. In an effort to describe forest characteristics along the lower Coastal Plain of the State of Georgia (USA), we utilized a time series of Landsat data and an algorithm that assesses an integrated forest Z score. The methodology was used to create disturbance maps for over 30 years that represent the year of disturbance for specific locations. The overall accuracy was 52% when all years were considered, and approximately 70% from 1991 forward. Preliminary findings showed moderate levels of accuracy when determining ages for current forests, most of which are even-aged nature stands. Further modifications to the process were necessary to adapt to the unique conditions of study region. The modeling process also prompted several areas for future refinement, including improvement of the temporal resolution of the analysis by using all the available Landsat imagery and detection of the regeneration that normally occurs several years after disturbances.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ankobra River basin, which forms part of the Southern-Western River System of Ghana, has become a hub for both large and small-scale mining activities. Some of the activities of these mines threatens the sustainability of its resources in the basin. A study in the basin which focuses on changes in LULC patterns in the basin over the past years is therefore paramount to understand the changes that has taken place and its potential impact on resources in the basin. This study assessed the pattern of Land use/cover changes, and the possible drivers of change, in the basin. The study used multi-spectral Landsat images of 30 m resolution for the years 1991, 2002, 2008 and 2016. The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) in QGIS was used for atmospheric correction, image classification using the spectral angle mapping algorithm, and post processing. The overall difference between the reference and the classified map of 2016 was 5.5% with the overall quantity, exchange and shift components as 1.5%, 3% and 1% respectively. Findings from the study show that, the Ankobra River basin has witnessed noticeable changes over the 25-year study period. Closed forest which occupied 40.4% of the total basin area in 1991 reduced drastically to 22.8% in 2016. The dominant LULC change patterns in the basin are from Closed Forest to Open Forest; Open Forest to Farmland, Settlement/Bare land and Mining Area; and the increase in surface area of Water consequently resulting from the increase in Mining Area. Mining activities, particularly illegal mining was identified to be the dominant driver of deforestation in the Ankobra Basin between the years 2008 and 2016 where mining activities in the basin sharply increased.

T2  - CURRENT ISSUES OF SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR THE STATE ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd All-Russian Scientific Conference with International Participation on Current Issues of Scientific Support for the State Anti-Corruption Policy in the Russian Federation
CL  - Ekaterinburg, RUSSIA
AB  - The article attempts to comprehend the concept opposite in meaning to the concept of "corruption". The analysis of the existing antonyms, and the formation of the antonym-anticonception is more relevant than ever, since the word marks a certain social practice. The absence of a concept expressing the opposite of corruption means a lack of understanding of the essence, and anti-corruption efforts. The author criticizes the notions of "honesty" and "integrity" as really significant antonyms of anti-concepts in relation to "corruption", offering to understand the idea of power as a basis, on which the opposite of corruption can be interpreted. It is assumed that the performed power has a polar sense.To argue this position, analysis of the relationship between the categories of power and violence has been performed using examples from the field of political philosophy through understanding the conceptual implications of bringing these concepts together, or opposing them. The moral and ethical deviations associated with the identification of power and violence are investigated. First of all, the transformation of morality into a prudence is concerned. The role of special kind of mythology parasitizing in the field of global generalizations is analyzed. Worldview myths regarding power are an important part of the modern person's prudentia. Coupled with the communicative "closeness", it increases the level of corruption in personal and social consciousness.The utilitarian-economic mode of discussing anti-corruption strategies is highlighted as the problem of the philosophical and theoretical analysis of corruption. It is concluded that the priority of such a mode is left to civil consciousness in the field of influence of prudentia. This means the impossibility of sufficient self-reflection in relation to anti-corruption efforts. The importance of updating the philosophical position regarding the problem of power and violence for the formation of anti-corruption resistance of society is noted.

TI  - TRANSFORMATION OF THE EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS THEORY
T2  - REVISTA GENERO & DIREITO
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolutionary economics was separated into an independent direction of research only after the appearance of the works of R. Nelson and S. Winter. The theory they propose is based on similar processes in economics and biology. Thus, the evolutionary economic theory was built on the inconsistency of two processes based on Darwin's theory (variability and selection). When transferring this into the economic reality we create the following model: a competitive struggle is created between the firms as a result of which the most adapted ones "survive" in the process of industrial innovation. At the same time, the evolutionary ideas arose much earlier. In the XVIII century B. Mandeville, A. Smith, and later T. Malthus expressed their ideas that could be attributed to the evolutionary approach today in connection with the assertion of a natural-science worldview that undermined the idea of a divine creation, though with some reservations. The purpose of this article is to trace the change in the ideas of "evolutionary economics" in various technological orders.

TI  - Detecting Hardly Visible Roads in Low-Resolution Satellite Time Series Data
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - Los Angeles, CA
AB  - Massive amounts of satellite data have been gathered over time, holding the potential to unveil a spatiotemporal chronicle of the surface of Earth. These data allow scientists to investigate various important issues, such as land use changes, on a global scale. however, not all land-use phenomena are equally visible on satellite imagery. In particular, the creation of an inventory of the planet's road infrastructure remains a challenge, despite being crucial to analyze urbanization patterns and their impact. Towards this end, this work advances datadriven approaches for the automatic identification of roads based on open satellite data. Given the typical resolutions of these historical satellite data, we observe that there is inherent variation in the visibility of different road types. Based on this observation, we propose two deep learning frameworks that extend state-ofthe-art deep learning methods by formalizing road detection as an ordinal classification task. In contrast to related schemes, one of the two models also resorts to satellite time series data that are potentially affected by missing data and cloud occlusion. Taking these time series data into account eliminates the need to manually curate datasets of high-quality image tiles, substantially simplifying the application of such models on a global scale. We evaluate our approaches on a dataset that is based on Sentinel 2 satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap vector data. Our results indicate that the proposed models can successfully identify large and medium-sized roads. We also discuss opportunities and challenges related to the detection of roads and other infrastructure on a global scale.

TI  - [Efficacy of laboratory methods of diagnostic of purulent bacterial meningitis.]
T2  - Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - According to the World Health Organization, every year about 1 million cases of purulent bacterial meningitis (PBM) are registered in the world, of which 200 thousand cases end in death. Bacterial meningitis is polyethiologic, which makes the task of determining the pathogen the main in the organization of epidemiological surveillance, treatment regimens, planning of preventive and anti-epidemic measures. The quality of laboratory diagnostics has a key influence on this. The true incidence of meningitis of different etiology can be altered at low-efficiency laboratory diagnostics. This work was carried out to assess the effectiveness of existing laboratory methods for the detection of PBM pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis; as a part of the programme on sentinel surveillance of invasive bacterial diseases (IBD) carried out by the WHO regional office for Europe in a number of countries in Europe (Ukraine, Belarus), Transcaucasia (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia), Asia (Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan) in the period 2010-2017. 2893 samples of clinical material (CSF and blood) obtained from patients with the meningeal syndrome were studied by four diagnostic methods: cultural method, latex-agglutination test, immunochromatographic test (BinaxNOW), PCR (conventional and real-time), used to identify the following pathogens: Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae. When identifying the causative agents of BM, PCR more effective than culture method is 5 times in detecting N. meningitidis; 3 times in the detection of S. pneumoniae; 4 times the detection of H. influenzae b. Latex-agglutination test and immunochromatographic test allow to increase the identification of pathogens of BM for N. meningitidis - by 35.6%; S. pneumoniae - by 67%; H. influenzae b - by 19.2%, it is possible to set them in the field and at the epidpoint if necessary. When working with clinical material from patients diagnosed with GBM, it is advisable for bacteriological laboratories to complement the culture method of microbiological diagnosis of latex-agglutination test, immunochromatographic test or PCR.

TI  - Impact of Differences in Land Management on Natural Vegetation in Semi-Dry Areas: The Case Study of the Adi Zaboy Watershed in the Kilite Awlaelo District, Eastern Tigray Region, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for a sustainable land management has become a universal issue. It is especially necessary to discuss sustainable land management and to secure a site with enough feed supply to improve the lives of the farmers in the Ethiopian Highlands. This research studied the Adi Zaboy watershed in Tigray in order to reveal the changes in land management, assess how the different forms of land management affected the vegetation through unsupervised classification and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis with geographic information system (GIS) 10.5 using a WorldView-2 satellite image taken in September 2016 and field investigation, and consider how to allow both environmental preservation and sustainable use of feed resources. The land management types at the research site were classified as "seasonally-closed grazing land", "prohibited grazing and protected forest land", and "free grazing land". On comparing the NDVI of each type of land management, it was found that the seasonally-closed grazing land makes it highly possible to secure and supply feed resources by limiting the grazing period. The expansion of the prohibited grazing and protected forest land is likely to tighten the restriction on the use of resources. Therefore, sustainable land management to secure feed resources may be possible by securing and actively using seasonally-closed grazing land, securing feed by a cut-and-carry, and using satellite images and GIS.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Maize production in Kenya is usually affected by climate variability. Climate variability, further has implications for maize prices and national food security. The main objective of this study was to determine temporal fluctuations of maize prices in five (5) markets in Kenya; using NDVI values from SPOT-VEGETATION imagery of 1998-2010. The results show a weak relationship between maxNDVI and Kenyan maize wholesale price. Out of the five (5) markets analysed, only Kisumu (r(2) = -0.11) shows a negative regression value; whereas, Nairobi (r(2) = 0.29), Mombasa (r(2) = 0.27), Nakuru (r(2) = 0.44) and Eldoret (r(2) = 0.05) portray a positive relationship. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that maize prices were high during drought periods (i.e. negative anomalies) and low during wet seasons (i.e. positive anomalies). The findings of this work underscores the potential for maize price monitoring using satellite derived vegetation indices, such as the normalised difference vegetation index towards providing valuable inputs to the food security modelling community. We however, recommend that, in the future, there is need to integrate a cumulative vegetation index (CVI) method to reduce any differences that could exist during analysing maize growing stage using vegetation index remote sensing techniques.

AB  - This study investigated the linear relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index and total column ozone. Total Column Ozone and Normalized Difference Vegetation index data were obtained from January 2005 to November 2017 from NASA's AURA and MODIS archives respectively. The obtained results showed a predominant and significant positive linear relationship between the two variables over the West African region. The prevalent practices of bush burning, deforestation, crude oil exploration and other activities will continue to contribute to global warming through an increase in the total column ozone and its precursors.

TI  - Exploring the Application of Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation in the Japanese National Health Insurance System
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Advances in health care due to the development and introduction of new drugs and medical devices have brought considerable benefits to people and patients in terms of upgraded quality of life and extended years of survival. However, some are concerned that the very advancement of health care would increase further the inflation of national healthcare costs. In response to these concerns, Japan's Central Social Insurance Medical Council ("Chuikyo") began in 2012 to examine how cost-effectiveness evaluation might be applied to the national health insurance system, and has been working toward establishing a system for its usage. Methods Cost-effectiveness evaluation was adopted on a trial basis in fiscal year (FY) 2016, targeting seven drugs and six medical devices. Analyses and re-analyses were performed by manufacturers and a public expert organization, respectively. Based on these analyses, a cost-effectiveness evaluation expert organization conducted an overall assessment ("appraisal"). Results of the evaluation were used to adjust the prices of the target items. Results Following the trial adoption of cost-effectiveness evaluation, price adjustments were performed for three items in April 2018. Meanwhile, a decision was also made to examine seven items for which technical requirements were identified due to differences in the understanding of analysis methods between involved parties. Conclusions The Chuikyo will examine how to meet the newly identified technical requirements and discuss specific details with regard to establishing a system that incorporates cost-effectiveness evaluation. The Chuikyo plans to reach a conclusion by the end of FY 2018.

The Korea Ocean SatelliteCenter has developed and provided a GOCI Data Processing System(GDPS) for general users who are not familiar with HDF5 format. Nevertheless, it is not easy to merge andprocess Hierarchical Data Format version5(HDF5) data that requires an understanding ofsatellite data characteristics, needs to learn how to use GDPS, and stores location andattribute information separately. Therefore, the open source R and rhdf5, data.table, andmatrixStats packages were used to develop algorithm that could easily utilize satellitedata in HDF5 format without the need for the process of using GDPS.

AB  - Rapid and all-weather detection of flood areas is needed for monitoring and mitigating flood disasters. In this paper, we investigated flood area detection in built-up area using PALSAR-2 data acquired during the 2015 heavy rainfall disaster in the Kanto and Tohoku areas, Japan. We performed an interferometric processing using pre- and co-event PALSAR-2 data and compared proposed phase-only statistics with traditional coherence-based flood detection. The result indicated that the flood detection accuracy by thresholding of phase standard deviation (PSD) image is more accurate than that of coherence and the accuracy was a 0.443 kappa coefficient in flood/non-flood discrimination. This result demonstrated the feasibility of using PALSAR-2 data for rapid flood monitoring in built-up area without being affected by strong backscattering from the buildings.

M3  - Article
AB  - Theodor Oizerman's article "On The Meaning of the Question` What is Philosophy?'" was first published in the journal "Voprosy filosofii", 1968, vol. 11. Since that the issue has become a bibliographical rarity and still does not exist in a digital form. Other versions of the article were rewritten in the form of book chapters and transformed in the context of the current situation. This proposed publication bases on one of the older versions, which, is, on the one hand, close to the original author's intention, and on the other hand, lacks a certain dependence on the ideological context. The text, however, includes some critically important arguments appearing only in later editions. In general, the article is of central significance in terms of its place in the Metaphilosophy concept proposed by Oizerman, which later the following books have manifested: "The Problem Of The History Of Philosophy"(1969, 1983), "The Foundations For The Theory Of The Historico-Philosophical Process" (1983, in co-authorship with A.S. Bogomolov), "Philosophy As A History Of Philosophy" (1999), "Ambivalence Of Philosophy" (2011); "Metaphilosophy: Theory Of The Historico-Philosophical Process" (2009). A number of references due to the difficulty of reading the archived article text have been omitted or taken from new editions. The text has been prepared and edited by Ilya T. Kasavin.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents results of physical retrieval of sea-surface temperature (SST) from the INSAT-3D imager observations. Radiance measurements from two thermal infrared imager channels are used for retrieving SST. Prior to their use in the retrieval process, the INSAT-3D radiances are corrected for the biases using a newly developed algorithm. The physical retrieval of SST is performed using an optimal estimation method. The optimisation is performed under two scenarios. In the first scenario, the SST retrieval problem is assumed to be linear while in the second one, the assumption of linearity is relaxed. Further, retrievals are performed by considering the reduced, as well as, the full state vector. Overall, physical retrieval performs much better than the regression-based approach. Moreover, in the physical retrieval, the best performance is obtained in the second scenario with the use of the full state vector. Validation of these retrievals with the iQuam SST resulted in a standard deviation (bias) of similar to 0.65 (0.19) K while those from the regression-based method are found to have standard deviation (bias) of similar to 0.68 (-0.17) K.

AB  - Language reflects one's thoughts, feelings, and worldview. Technology has led to a proliferation of brief communications. Is this brief text meaningful? We examine whether text from brief political and nonpolitical communications reflect political ideology. Student responses to their ideological foundations (Study 1), brief snippets of unanimous Supreme Court verdicts (Study 2), and celebrity tweets (Study 3) were textually analyzed to examine whether they contained perceived threat and resistance to change content and whether this predicted the authors' political affiliation. Across three studies, words related to resistance to change, but not perceived threat, were related to political ideology such that conservatives were more likely to include resistance-to-change-related words in their responses compared with liberals. These results suggest that brief text, even when not overtly political, reflects one's political ideology. The increase in brief text production via new technology and its ability to predict political ideology make these findings particularly meaningful.

AB  - Accurate bathymetry information, in form of maps of water depth, is essential for a wide variety of purposes including offshore activities (e.g., pipeline laying), resource management (e.g., fishery), and defense (e.g., navigation). In this study, we compared three atmospheric correction algorithms and used a radiative transfer model (RTM) to derive water depth from a multispectral image of an area from Florida, USA. Our results showed that with accurate atmospheric correction, water depth can be reasonably estimated up to 15 m, where optical conditions are favorable for the use of multispectral images.

TI  - DIALECTIC INTERACTION OF QUANTITY, QUALITY AND RELATION IN SIMILE DOMAIN
T2  - ADVANCED EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper attempts to shed some light on the problem of correlation of such ontological categories as quality, quantity and relation in similes. The matter in question is significant since it relates to the problem of anthropocentrism in language. It shows the speaker's attitude to the information encoded in a simile by consciously choosing a vehicle via measuring a tenor's salient feature against an implied abstract scale of objects, notions, phenomena, etc. that possess a particular quality to a certain extent. The nature of the ground of simile is described to be gradable, capable of being subjectively measured from the perspective of the speaker's environmental perception. The gradability of a shared feature shown as a scale of potential vehicles lends itself to the interpretation as a fragment of the linguistic worldview displaying a range of scale markers typical of a certain linguistic community in a certain historical period of time. The polar opposite notions on an implied scale are depicted to represent a (proto/stereo) type and an anti(proto/stereo)type typical of certain linguo-cultural domains in a particular fragment of a linguistic worldview. By moving from the explanatory examples to the analysis of empirical material the author concludes that the categories of quantity, quality and relation are intrinsic in every simile and manifest themselves in the choice of a tenor-vehicle pair that do not exist within simile other than in relation to each-other. The material described in the article serves as an evidence of language dependence on historical and social parameters. The paper explains the mechanism of creation of the congruous and ironic similes according to the universal process of simile formation where the unity of quantity, quality and relation are the key factors of its existence.

AB  - Land surface emissivity is required for deriving surface temperature from thermal infrared radiances. When using single-channel or two-channel thermal infrared sensors, information on emissivity may be derived from spectral reflectance measurements through regression models. In this study, we present relationships derived over bare soils for Landsat 7 - ETM+ sensor. Reflectances in ETM+ channels were obtained from soil spectra (between 0.4 and 13 mu m) extracted from the ASTER spectral library and the dataset acquired by Lesaignoux et al. (2013). The best relations were obtained between reflectances in the mid-infrared channels (ETM5 and ETM7) and the thermal infrared channel (ETM6) with correlation coefficients of 0.63 and 0.72 respectively. The relations were mostly generated by the variations of soil reflectances due to changes in soil moisture. Correlations were lower when considering the variations due to soil type.

AB  - Frequency and intensity of fires are increasing due to climate change. Devastating fires like the megafires occurring in Chile in 2017 are the new noimal in fire-prone areas. The native schlerophyll forest in Chile was the ecosystem most affected by the 2017 fires. This study presented an approach to improve the estimation of GHG emissions from biomass burning in the native schlerophyll forest of Chile. Biomass estimation was improved by using field work data to fill the gap of knowledge about the species distribution, and number and size of trees. The combustion completeness factor was adapted using the burned severity estimations generated from the dNBR calculation on Sentinel-2 data. Our results show that by adapting the parameters to the specific conditions of the affected ecosystem the emission estimations become more accurate.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF THE GEOMORPHOLOGICAL FEITIONS OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF BURITI DOS LOPES-PI: SUBSIDY TO TERRITORIAL ORDINANCE
T2  - GEOSABERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article aims to characterize the geomorphological features of Buriti dos Lopes municipality in the state of Piaui, located in the northern mesoregion of the state and in the microregion of the coastal plains. In order to contribute to territorial planning, the work also has as justification to present studies related to the theme for the municipality, because few studies are directed to the area. The methodology used for mapping the area was based on the use of Shuttler Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) altimetry images, where three morphometric parameters were considered: altimetry, shaded relief and slope, geoprocessing methods and field work. The QGIS software 2.18.18 was used in the SRTM image processing, where the maps were generated. The Geomorphological Geomorphological Manual developed by IBGE (2009), FROTA (2015), CABRAL (2015) and the Geomorphological Geological and War Dictionary of War and War (1993) were used for the circumscription of the geomorphological features found. In this way, four features were found: Clusters of Tables, Plains Terraces Fluviolacustres, Planed Hills and Closed Valleys. The feature found in a greater proportion in the municipality was the Cluster of Tables with 27.77 km(2) being 39.54% of the area. Through the mapping it is possible to highlight the characteristics of the features to serve as a basis in the territorial order.

AB  - Pasture land is the most extensive use over world. The objective was to compare two pasture land cover databases - (A) and (B) - for Brazil in 2015. (A) is a national pastureland map from a article and (B) is the MODIS land cover product. Pasture fraction maps were generated and expressed in same spatial resolution (5') and coordinate system. Absolute difference map, total pasture area and correlation were computed. Both maps presented high pasture distribution over Cerrado and Caatinga biomes. (A) also had relevant pasture areas in Atlantic Forest and Pampa biomes. Total pasture area was 1,745,143 km(2) for (A) and 1,860,086 km(2) for (B). Most similarities occurred in the Pantanal biome. Higher dissimilarities were in Cerrado, Caatinga and Pampa biomes. Correlation of Brazilian territory was 0.45, with variations between biomes. Differences in databases influence their application and appropriate usage must consider the pasture definition/specification, spatial resolution and classification method.

TI  - Generating a hyperspectral digital surface model using a hyperspectral 2D frame camera
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Miniaturised 2D frame format hyperspectral camera technology that is suitable for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has entered the market, making the generation of hyperspectral digital surface models (HDSMs) feasible. HDSMs offer a rigorous approach to capturing the target spectral and 3D geometric data. The main objective of this investigation was to study and develop techniques for the generation of HDSMs in forest areas using novel hyperspectral 2D frame camera technologies. An approach based on object-space image matching was developed, adapting the traditional vertical line locus (VLL) method for HDSM generation; this was then named the hyperspectral VLL (HVLL) approach. Additionally, image classification was introduced into the processing chain in order to adapt the matching parameters, based on different classes. We also proposed a method for extracting the spectral and viewing angle information of the points. An empirical study was carried out using UAV datasets from tropical and boreal forests using 2D format hyperspectral cameras, based on tuneable Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) technology. Quality assessment was performed using DSMs based on state-of-the-art commercial software and airborne laser scanning (ALS). The results showed that the proposed technique generated a high-quality HDSM in both tested environments. The HDSM had higher deviations over the continuous canopy cover than the digital surface models (DSMs) generated using commercial software. The method using image classification information outperformed the commercial approach with respect to the ability to measure ground points in shadowed areas and in canopy gaps. The proposed method is of great interest in supporting automated interpretations of novel multi- and hyperspectral imaging technologies, especially when applied complex objects, such as forests.

TI  - Mogamulizumab: a new tool for management of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) poses unique treatment challenges, given its range of presentations and numerous systemic therapy options. These options often lack comparative evidence or are characterized by low response rates and short remission duration in relapsed/refractory disease. The approval of mogamulizumab, a humanized, glycoengineered IgG1. monoclonal antibody targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) chemokine receptor, brings a novel tool into the spectrum of treatment options for advanced CTCL and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). CCR4 is expressed in almost all cases of ATLL, and in a majority of CTCLs, particularly when blood involvement is present. In a Phase III randomized trial, mogamulizumab was associated with 28% overall response rate among patients with relapsed CTCL, median progression-free survival of 7.7 months, and median duration of remission of 14.1 months. Responses are more frequent among patients with Sezary syndrome and within the blood compartment. Common adverse effects include rash and infusion reactions, which are usually low grade. Sentinel reports indicate that exposure to mogamulizumab may result in severe or refractory graft vs host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, highlighting the need for vigilance and expert management. Further research may establish incremental efficacy of combining mogamulizumab with cytotoxic or immunomodulatory agents in CTCL, ATLL, and possibly other lymphomas and even solid tumors.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with right breast cancer. Approximately 18 years had passed since the treatment for left breast cancer without recurrence. She became aware of the right breast tumor with mild pain 5 months before she came to the hospital. The diagnosis was right-sided breast cancer, cT2N0M0, StageⅡA, ER(-), PgR(-), HER2(-). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was chosen, and then combined treatment with epirubicin(EPI)and cyclophosphamide(CPA) was started. The breast tumor had become smaller, but she complained of shortness of breath during the third course of chemotherapy. On the basis of her history of cancer onset, chest CT findings, and increase in serum SP-D levels, the combined therapy with EPI and CPA was suspected as the cause of the drug-induced interstitial lung disease(DILD). For this reason, the therapy was discontinued. After her recovery from this state, the operation(partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy)was performed. S-1 was used as postoperative adjuvant therapy, and the respiratory symptoms did not recur or worsen. On the basis of the disease course, we made a diagnosis of DILD with EPI and CPA. Many anticancer drugs may cause DILD. In case of a suspicion of DILD onset, a prompt diagnosis and an appropriate treatment are important.

TI  - Assessment of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2L-band and Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter for discriminating between large-scale oil palm plantations and smallholdings on tropical peatlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm agriculture is rapidly expanding across the tropics, particularly on peatlands to meet increasing global demand for palm oil based products. Oil palm production systems can be divided into two broad categories of management system: large-scale monoculture plantations and smallholdings. Both categories are separated by large differences in environmental and social impacts. These oil palm production systems are often characterized by different agricultural practices and vegetation characteristics and therefore land cover. To date, there are no examples of radar remote sensing studies in oil palm production landscapes assessing differences between large-scale plantations and smallholdings. Here, we investigate whether these management systems have distinct radar signatures that can be identified through backscattering intensity using ALOS (Synthetic Aperture Radar) - PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) L-band and Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). SAR has been shown to be superior to other remote sensing sensors in the tropics for monitoring oil palm expansion due to its all-weather capabilities. In this study we measured backscattered intensity of 196 plots planted with oil palm that were established on peatland in Peninsular Malaysia. Our results indicated that backscattered intensity was significantly influenced by the management systems. We found that canopy and soil moisture was greater in smallholdings compared to large-scale plantations. With the exception of HV polarization method, season had significant effect on backscattered intensity. Irrespective of management systems, canopy and soil moisture was greater in wet months compared to dry months. Our findings suggest that ALOS-2-PALSAR-2L-band and Sentinel-1 C-band have great potential to discriminate oil palm production landscapes managed under different management systems. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the current findings are consistent for oil palm in mineral soils.

T2  - ATLANTIC JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay proposes a view of public speaking as interventional that incorporates and subsumes the traditional speaking goals of informative, persuasive, and invitational. Additionally, this approach to public speaking reorients attention to the fundamental process of constituting symbolic reality that underlies and is generated in human communication. It argues that speeches should be reconceptualized as attempted interventions in ongoing conversations that shape how participants construe needs, power, and worldview symbolically. It introduces the rhetoric of social intervention model as a framework for entering the rhetorical process, developing speeches that attempt to promote and hinder shifts in naming patterns, and reflecting on potential side effects and ethics of one's own and others' naming choices. The essay explores how a speaker would develop a speech from an RSI perspective and discusses the implications of an interventional approach to public speaking.

TI  - Surface Evaporative Capacitance: How Soil Type and Rainfall Characteristics Affect Global-Scale Surface Evaporation
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The separation of evapotranspiration (ET) into its surface evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) components remains a challenge despite its importance for linking water and carbon cycles, for water management, and for attribution of hydrologic isotope fractionation. Regional and global estimates of surface evaporation often rely on estimates of ET (e.g., Penman-Monteith) where E is deduced as a residual or as a fraction of potential evaporation. We propose a novel and direct method for estimating E from soil properties considering regional rainfall characteristics and accounting for internal drainage dynamics. A soil-dependent evaporative characteristic length defines an active surface evaporative capacitor depth below which soil water is sheltered from capillary pull to the evaporating surface. A site-specific evaporative capacitor is periodically recharged by rainfall and discharges at rates determined by interplay between internal drainage and surface evaporation. The surface evaporative capacitor concept was tested using field measurements and subsequently applied to generate a global map of climatic surface evaporation. Latitudinal comparisons with estimates from other global models (e.g., Penman-Monteith method modified by Leuning et al., 2008, [PML]; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS]; and Global Land-surface Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology [GLEAM]) show good agreement but also point to potential shortcomings of present estimates of surface evaporation. Interestingly, the ratio of surface evaporation (E) to potential evapotranspiration (ET0) is relatively constant across climates, biomes, and soil types with E/ET0<0.15 for 60% of all terrestrial surfaces, in agreement with recent studies.

TI  - Linking land cover satellite data with dietary variation and reproductive output in an opportunistic forager: Arable land use can boost an ontogenetic trophic bottleneck in the White Stork <i>Ciconia ciconia</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining how the progressive loss of resources due to agricultural intensification and habitat degradation affect individual fitness and population persistence is a matter of urgency. Here we explored three major questions in order to extend knowledge of the relationship between reproduction rate, diet and energy intake in White Storks Ciconia ciconia based both on our own analysis of pellets and landscape properties sampled in 52 nests in south-western Poland, and published literature data. (1) How many individual prey items are needed to meet the daily energy requirements of nestlings over the brood rearing period? (2) How do the dietary patterns vary under different habitat conditions and what is the spatial scale responsible for these relationships? (3) Is reproductive output related to variations in landscape traits, and is diet variability related to intraspecific competition resulting from colonial breeding? In our estimation, the energy requirements of nestlings during the brood rearing period showed that the most profitable invertebrate prey items were Orthoptera and earthworms. Owing to the nestlings' gape-size constraint (precluding consumption of vertebrate prey items of the size of Common Voles), these most likely comprise the staple diet enabling survival during the first 20 days of life. The total energy content across all the pellets was a simple function (a negative correlation) of %arable land within a distance of 5 km around the nests. White Storks from nests of high-productivity pairs (with 3-4 fledglings and less %arable around) consumed equal %biomasses of invertebrate and vertebrate prey, while invertebrates prevailed in the diet of the low-productivity pairs. Our results suggest that a two-level ontogenetic trophic bottleneck may explain the low productivity of White Stork pairs in simplified landscapes with predominant arable land use. As a result of this, parent birds are unable to satisfy the growing energy demands of nestlings (1) by gathering a sufficient volume of abundant small-sized prey (early nestlings) and (2) by delivering energetically more profitable vertebrate prey at the time of the diet switch.

AB  - Very High Throughput Satellites (VHTS) are optimized satellite systems that will meet the demands on increasing data traffic. VHTS outperforms the capacity of traditional systems that provide FSS and MSS (Fixed and Mobile Satellite Services, respectively) which use contoured regional footprints. VHTS aims at achieving 1 Terabit/s per satellite in the near future, and are based on multi-spot coverage with frequency and polarization reuse schemes using larger bandwidths in the feeder link in the frequency Q/V bands or by optic links. These systems provide higher satellite links capacity with a reduced cost per Gpbs-in-orbit. Since traffic demand is not always the same in the service area and it may change over time, new flexible payload concepts are required. In this sense, this contribution presents the study of a flexible payload concept, the methodology for the adaptive algorithm to be used during the on-line or off-line processes for optimal resources allocation and the architecture for adaptive resources allocation as well with a set of preliminary results.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments IV held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important factor in global climate change, vegetation growth, and urban heat island (UHI). LST is one of the most important environmental variables measured by satellite remote sensing. Public domain data are available from the operational Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). The present study focuses on determining and mapping UHI for the metropolitan city of Turin in Piedmont Italy using Landsat 8 multitemporal collection dataset from 2013 to 2018. The main purpose of this research is to give an instrument for the present urban management and future urban planning in order to increase city resistance and resilience against climate change through mitigation and adaptation. Improving green areas using urban forestry can be a way to mitigate Summer heat waves and trying to regulate the high demand of energy for cooling buildings. LST has been estimated using the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) while the LSE (Land Surface Emissivity) according to the NDVI Thresholds Method. In the multitemporal collection the UHI has been detected after calculating zonal statistics. Surfaces with similar thermal behave have been mapped using an Unsupervised classification (K-means). Through the considered years, the analysis has revealed how UHI are very common and persistent in the metropolitan Turin area, where vegetation and water content are lower and where there are a high number of buildings in concrete and asphalt is widespread.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - We describe a new method of reconstruction of ocean surface currents based on motion detection at near simultaneous satellite images. Many world areas are regularly observed by pairs of satellites with small time intervals. In particular, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 pass over certain areas within a time interval of order of minutes every 2-12 weeks, while MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua daily observe the majority of Earth surface with time interval of order of hours. In this study we show that motion detection at these pairs of near simultaneous satellite images obtained by optical flow algorithms is an efficient tool for precise reconstruction of ocean surface currents especially in areas with significant variability of ocean surface properties accompanied by distinct frontal zones. This method was applied for reconstruction of surface currents at several coastal regions at the Black, Kara, and Laptev seas influenced by river discharge.

AB  - In France, clear-cuts are a logging practice regulated by law under the Forest Code. The French Ministry of Agriculture, in charge of forest policies, needs exhaustive mapping methods to monitor the clear-cuts and allow its agents to efficiently take actions in the field. We present here the evolution of a clear-cut detection service relying on optical satellite data, from very high spatial resolution images to Sentinel-2 time series. Its nationwide deployment was possible due to a favorable context both technical and institutional.

TI  - TRADITIONS OF "ALEXANDRIA" IN PROSE OF 20TH CENTURY: FROM STYLIZATION TO PARODY
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of modelling a classical plot in the literature of modernism and postmodernism is considered. Attention is paid to the transformation of the story of Alexander the Great in the novels of Mikhail Kuzmin (1872-1936) and Sasha Sokolov (b. 1943). The results of comparative analysis of two novels of different literary directions are presented. The question is raised that the classic story and image are transformed, becoming a way of artistic understanding of the worldview of the era. Particular attention is paid to the methods of stylization and parody in the studied texts. It is shown that the authors in the classic examples are looking for the ways to resolve the conflicts of our time: M. Kuzmin's application to the image of the great commander is an artistic interpretation of the tragedy of human existence that have reached a lot in this world, but can not change the fate; Sasha Sokolov writes his "Palisandria" to depict the new ironic perspective on the historical process. The relevance of the study is due to the need of modern literary studies in typological studies, in the search for intertextual links. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the comparison of plot and figuratively close texts in the main literary directions of the 20th century allows to see ways of modelling a classic plot in its variants, taking into account the specifics of modernism and postmodernism.

TI  - The Grand Strategy of Militant Clients: Iran's Way of War
T2  - SECURITY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues that militant clients should be understood as a pillar of Iran's grand strategy and an extension of its military power. The article examines why Iran has relied on militant clients since the 1979 revolution and the benefits and costs of its client approach. In evaluating these issues, it identifies five main areas where Iran has gained from its client strategy: 1) maintaining independence from the West; 2) successfully exporting its religio-political worldview; 3) extending its military reach and power; 4) reducing political costs of its foreign activities; and 5) establishing needed regional allies. It further identifies five main dangers that Iran faces by continuing its strategic behavior: 1) increased pressure from the United States and a broader US military regional footprint; 2) more unified regional adversaries; 3) the risk of unintended escalation with the United States and regional adversarial states; and 4) enduring regional instability and insecurity

AB  - This paper presents integrated sensor and actuator in the same soft structure. Three-axis force sensor composed of three standing strain sensors is enabled by making the best use of its deformable flexible structure. Both force sensor and pneumatic actuator are fabricated by using common channel structures. The force sensor uses liquid metal introduced into the channel and the pneumatic actuator uses pressure supplied through the channel. We focused on the characteristic of the liquid metal strain sensor and three-axis force can be sensed by standing the strain sensors. Sensitivity of the sensor according to Fx, Fy and Fz was calculated 0.016 N-1 , 0.019 N-1 and 0.035 N-1 , respectively. The maximum generating force of integrated soft actuator was 13.3mN.

TI  - USING HYPERSPECTRAL SURFACE REFLECTANCE DATA TO DETECT CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT IN PECANS
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - We explored the relationship between hyperspectral surface reflectance data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer and foliar chlorophyll content of pecans. Canopy scale hyperspectral remotely-sensed data and foliar chlorophyll content determined with SPAD meter were collected simultaneously from two mature pecan orchards for two years. One pecan orchard was located in a clay loam soil and the other in a sandy loam soil. Hyperspectral surface reflectance data were correlated to chlorophyll content. The relationship between remotely-sensed data and SPAD was high (R-2 >= 0.8) to moderate (0.8 >= R-2 >= 0.6) in the first year, and generally weak (R-2 < 0.6) in the second year in both orchards. In the first year, canopy reflectance within the wavelength range 500 to 720 nm of the pecan orchard in the clay loam soil had a moderate to strong relationship (R-2 > 0.6) with SPAD compared to other wavelengths across the canopy reflectance spectrum (i.e. 350-500 and 730-2450 nm). Contour map revealed that the band ratios with a numerator consisting of any wavelength within the 600 to 680 nm range and a denominator of any wavelength along the visible and near infrared spectrum (350 - 1600 nm) had high correlations with SPAD in both orchards in the first year. The vegetation indices NDVI, mNDVI, SIPI, SIPI2 and PSRI also had high regression values (0.91 >= R-2 >= 0.87) with SPAD in clay loam site and moderate regression (0.73 >= R-2 >= 0.67) in sandy loam site in the first year. Overall, canopy surface reflectance data holds promise for studying foliar chlorophyll content in pecan orchards.

AB  - Kenya is mostly affected by floods during the March-April-May (MAM) and October-November-December (OND) rainfall. This often occurs along river basins such as the Tana river basin, leading to disruption of people's livelihoods, loss of lives, infrastructure destruction and interruption of economic activities. This study used openly available data on flood exposure, vulnerability, lack of coping capacity, flood impacts and observed satellite rainfall to analyse and predict forecast-based impacts in Tana river. Earth observation satellites including LANDSAT, sentinel 1 and 2 were acquired based on credible flood event dates to validate flood exposure and flood events. The community risk assessment (CRA) approach was used to delineate communities at high risk of floods using combination of data on vulnerability, flood exposure and lack of coping capacity. Using an ordinary least squares (OLS) predictive model, observed satellite rainfall was used as a covariate in order to predict flood impacts on communities with high flood risk scores in Tana river. Weighted scores from the CRA dimensions were summed up with forecasted hazards from the OLS model in order to derive a flood impact-based forecast. The flood impact information is to be used in forecast-based action through early warning, early action protocols thereby reducing impacts of potential floods in communities living in high flood risk areas based on the flood risk map.

AB  - Recent studies have investigated the identification of governing equations of geophysical systems from data. Here, we investigate such identification issues for ocean surface dynamcis from ocean remote sensing data. From a methodological point of view, we address the learning of data-driven dynamical models when only provided with a noisy training dataset. We propose a novel architecture that relies on data assimilation schemes to learn the underlying dynamical model through the minimization of a reconstruction cost. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed architecture with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches in the identification and forecasting of synthetic and real case-studies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and near-surface air temperature products have been commonly used in the studies of global climate change. In this work, we compare satellite-observed LST from Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and surface skin temperature and 2m air temperature (T2) simulated from High Asian Refined analysis (HAR) to provide an independent overview of the surface/air temperature trend over Tibetan Plateau (TP) region in 2003-2011. We investigate the seasonal trend, spatial variability, and the elevation dependency of LST and air temperature over TP for the last decade. Linear regression method is applied to all data sets to illustrate the warming and cooling trends and variability of temperature over the study area. Our analysis shows that an overall warming slope is 0.04Kyear(-1) in the day trend and 0.05Kyear(-1) in the night and the trend slope is stronger in the simulated HAR data sets than that in the AATSR LST, especially for the night air temperature. However, in regions with elevation above 4000m, the proportion of areas with the warming trend is less than 50% except in autumn from HAR data sets. The Namco and Qomolangma sites show an apparent trend of warming and cooling, respectively. The results from both satellite observations and numerical outputs show that warming trend over the entire TP was not obvious during last decade and the cooling trend was even found in the northeast TP.

AB  - Traditionally, miracles have been defined as supernaturally caused events which are outside the scope of scientific explicability. In this paper I will criticize the argument that, when we lack a scientific explanation for an event but it has an adequate explanation in theistic terms, then the most reasonable conclusion is to claim that the event is a miracle. I will defend that this argument would not work unless we had prior independent evidence for God's existence. Furthermore, I will argue that even within a theistic worldview in which the reality of God were unquestioned, we would not be justified in claiming that an event is a miracle because we would not have sufficient knowledge of God's intentions and purposes.

AB  - This study investigated the performance of leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in a mountain ecosystem. The authors hypothesized that significant spatial and temporal differences exist in LAI and PAR values in the Manafwa catchment on Mt. Elgon. This was accomplished through field measurements of actual LAI and PAR values of diverse vegetation types along a similar to 900m altitudinal gradient (1141-2029 masl) in the catchment. In-situ measurements were obtained from 841 micro-scale study plots in 28 sampling plots using high resolution LAI sensors. The findings showed a significant positive relationship exists between elevation and observed LAI (r = 0.45, p = 0.01). A regression model further shows that elevation and curvature of the landscape slope were highly significant (p < 0.00002) predictors of LAI. Finally, the authors detected significant spatial and temporal differences in LAI and PAR values in the study area. The study provides a critical basis for setting up long-term monitoring plans to understand mountain ecosystems and global climate change.

TI  - Degradation monitoring in Silvo-pastoral systems: A case study of the Mediterranean region of Turkey
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To identify policies that will promote positive effects and mitigate negative ones of grazing is a major challenge in the Silvo-pastoral system. This paper presents the role of examining land-cover change trajectories by remote sensing imagery in grazing policy monitoring. The study was conducted for Duzlercami forest ecosystem located in the Mediterranean geographical region of Turkey and administrated by the General Directorate of Forestry (GDF) of the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs. Time series land-cover datasets from Landsat images between 1988 and 2016 were collected and classified. To link the conversions among trajectories and grazing policy, class level landscape metrics derived from the classified images were used. To validate the approach, yearly grazing-plans managed by GDF and populations of livestock were used. Results of this research have indicated that even though there is a yearly grazing plan, overgrazing can happen on the pilot site, and it can be easily identified by the destruction of woody vegetation. The notable correlation (r(2) = 0.89) between degraded woody vegetation and cattle population has occurred in the last 30 years in the landscape, and Landsat imagery can effectively support the grazing policy mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Intraoperative palpation of sentinel lymph nodes can accurately predict axilla in early breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent randomized trials have shown that completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is not required in all patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) who will receive radiation therapy. Although routine intraoperative pathologic assessment (IPA) becomes unnecessary and less indicated by breast surgeons in the United States and some European countries, it is still widely used all around the world. In this prospective study, the feasibility of intraoperative nodal palpation (INP) as opposed to IPA of the SLN has been analyzed. Between March 2014 and June 2015, 305 patients with clinical T1-2/N0 breast cancer from two different breast clinics (cohort A; [n = 225] and cohort B; [n = 80]) who underwent any breast surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were included in this study. Surgeons evaluated the SLNs by manual palpation before sending for IPA, and findings compared with the final pathology. The positive predictive values (PPV) of INP and IPA were 81.8% and 97.9%, respectively, whereas the negative predictive values (NPV) of INP and IPA were 83% and 92.4%. The accuracies of INP and IPA were 82.6% and 94.1%, respectively. If patients with SLNB including micrometastasis were also considered in the final pathologic assessment (FPA) (-) group that would not require a further axillary dissection, the revised NPV of INP and FPA were found to be 92.6% and 98.1%, respectively. The revised accuracy of INP also found to be increase to 86.9%. Our study, which is the only prospective one about palpation of dissected SLNs in the literature, suggests that INP can help to identify patients who do not need ALND, which encourages omitting IPA in cT1-2 N0 breast cancer.

AB  - The paper is a review of the recent studies in the field of identity and its manifestation in communication. Traditionally this term has been explored in philosophy, psychology, sociology and cultural studies. Now it has started to attract the attention of linguists since language is the most essential component of identity. The paper considers different types of identity with the particular focus on lingua-cultural identity and its structural components, amongst which axiological, communicative and emotional ones are most prominent. The paper shows how identity is embedded in language and reveals itself in the speech of native speakers of Russian and English.

AB  - Tree pests can cause rapid and widespread damage, reducing the economic value of plants, production, in the case of fruit trees, and their role in mitigating climate change. There are several diseases that affect trees, including, for example, pine tree nematode (PWN), trunk fungal diseases, or Xylella fastidiosa (Xf).Mapping of diseased plants based on visual or automatic analysis of remote sensing data could be a useful support for in situ investigation planning. However, there is a clear need for better modeling methods to elaborate potential critical scenarios in order to early detect diseases (e.g. Xf) in host plants.Maxent (Maximum Entropy) has proved powerful when modeling species with available scarce presence-only occurrence data. The purpose is to predict potential distributions or explore expanding distributions. In this work we applied the Maxent model comparing local modeling results with worldwide cases towards a more comprehensive analysis of potential pest risk zones.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The analysis of connections between natural disaster and food security is extremely relevant, especially in developing countries where food availability can be highly jeopardized by extreme events that damage agricultural areas and food stocks. In particular, flood events are the most impacting natural disasters on agriculture, with a percentage share of damage around 60%. This work focuses on the food-flood nexus, developing a methodology for evaluating the effects of floods on food supply by integrating remote sensing data, agricultural statistics, and water footprint databases. Based on the existing literature about extreme floods, the Bangladesh flood in 2007 and the Pakistan flood of 2010 have been selected as exemplar case studies that can highlight the effects of flood events on food availability.The analysis focused on rice as the most spread crop in Bangladesh, while it considers the national crop mix in Pakistan analysis. Results showed that the use of remote sensing data combined with other sources of onsite information is particularly useful to assess the effects of flood events on food availability. The damages caused by floods on agricultural areas are estimated in terms of crop losses and then converted into lost calories and water footprint as complementary indicators.

TI  - A high-resolution, integrated system for rice yield forecasting at district level
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet the growing demands from public and private stakeholders for early yield estimates, a high-resolution (2 km x 2 km) rice yield forecasting system based on the integration of the WARM model and remote sensing (RS) technologies was developed. RS was used to identify rice-cropped area and to derive spatially distributed sowing dates, and for the dynamic assimilation of RS-derived leaf area index (LAI) data within the crop model. The system-tested for the main European rice production districts in Italy, Greece, and Spain-performed satisfactorily; > 66% of the inter-annual yield variability was explained in six out of eight combinations of ecotype x district, with a maximum of 89% of the variability explained for the 'Tropical Japonica' cultivars in the Vercelli district (Italy). In seven out of eight cases, the assimilation of RS-derived LAI improved the forecasting capability, with minor differences due to the assimilation technology used (updating or recalibration). In particular, RS data reduced uncertainty by capturing factors that were not properly reproduced by the simulation model (given the uncertainty due to large-area simulations). The system, which is an extension of the one used for rice within the EC-JRC-MARS forecasting system, was used pre-operationally in 2015 and 2016 to provide early yield estimates to private companies and institutional stakeholders within the EU-FP7 ERMES project.

TI  - Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 product consistency and implications for monitoring aquatic systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 and Landsat data products when combined open opportunities for capturing the dynamics of near shore coastal and inland waters at rates that have never been possible before. Recognizing the differences in their spectral and spatial sampling, to generate a seamless data record for global water quality monitoring, it is critical to quantify how well the derived data products agree under various atmospheric and aquatic conditions. This study provides an extensive quantitative assessment of how Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B equivalent data products compare and discusses implications on differences in downstream products generated via the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS). These products include the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (rho(t)), the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs), as well as biogeochemical properties, such as the total suspended solids (TSS). The analyses are conducted a) for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B near-simultaneous nadir overpasses (n-SNO) and b) over several highly turbid/eutrophic inland/nearshore waters. Following the implementation of vicarious gains for Sentinel-2A, the n-SNO analyses indicated that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A agree within +/- 1% in p, and +/- 5% in R-rs products across the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Similar evaluations with preliminary vicarious gains for Sentinel-2B showed +/- 2% in rho(t) and 7% in R-rs products. Considering Landsat-8-derived R-rs products as a reference, we found < 5% difference in Sentinel-2A and -2B R-rs products. Analyses of combined TSS and R-rs time-series products over several aquatic systems further corroborated these results and demonstrated the remarkable value of combined products. Occasional negative retrievals of R-rs products over hypereutrophic and highly turbid waters suggest the need for improvements in the atmospheric correction procedure to empower science/application community to fully explore Landsat-Sentinel-2 products. With very similar absolute radiometric observations and products, the science community should consider developments of suitable biogeochemical algorithms to maximize the utility of merged Landsat-Sentinel-2 products.

AB  - The ubiquitousness of satellite imagery and powerful, computationally efficient Deep Learning frameworks have found profound use in the field of remote sensing. Augmented with easy access to abundant image data made available by different satellites such as LANDSAT and European Space Agency's Copernicus missions, deep learning has opened various avenues of research in monitoring the world's oceans, land, rivers, etc. One significant problem in this direction is the accurate identification and subsequent segmentation of surface-water in images in the microwave spectrum. Typically, standard image processing tools are used to segment the images which are time-inefficient. However, in recent years, deep learning methods for semantic segmentation is the preferred choice given its high accuracy and ease of use. This paper proposes the use of deep-learning approaches such as U-Net to perform an efficient segmentation of river and land. Experimental results show that our approach achieves vastly superior performance on SAR images with pixel accuracy of 0.98 and F1 score of 0.99.

TI  - Mass variation observing system by high low inter-satellite links (MOBILE) -a new concept for sustained observation of mass transport from space
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODETIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As changes in gravity are directly related to mass variability, satellite missions observing the Earth's time varying gravity field are a unique tool for observing mass transport processes in the Earth system, such as the water cycle, rapid changes in the cryosphere, oceans, and solid Earth processes, on a global scale. The observation of Earth's gravity field was successfully performed by the GRACE and GOCE satellite missions, and will be continued by the GRACE Follow-On mission. A comprehensive team of European scientists proposed the next-generation gravity field mission MOBILE in response to the European Space Agency (ESA) call for a Core Mission in the frame of Earth Explorer 10 (EE10). MOBILE is based on the innovative observational concept of a high-low tracking formation with micrometer ranging accuracy, complemented by new instrument concepts. Since a high-low tracking mission primarily observes the radial component of gravity-induced orbit perturbations, the error structure is close to isotropic. This geometry significantly reduces artefacts of previous along-track ranging low-low formations (GRACE, GRACE-Follow-On) such as the typical striping patterns. The minimum configuration consists of at least two medium-Earth orbiters (MEOs) at 10000 km altitude or higher, and one low-Earth orbiter (LEO) at 350-400 km. The main instrument is a laser-based distance or distance change measurement system, which is placed at the LEO. The MEOs are equipped either with passive reflectors or transponders. In a numerical closed-loop simulation, it was demonstrated that this minimum configuration is in agreement with the threshold science requirements of 5 mm equivalent water height (EWH) accuracy at 400 km wavelength, and 10 cm EWH at 200 km. MOBILE provides promising potential future perspectives by linking the concept to existing space infrastructure such as Galileo next-generation, as future element of the Copernicus/Sentinel programme, and holds the potential of miniaturization even up to swarm configurations. As such MOBILE can be considered as a precursor and role model for a sustained mass transport observing system from space.

AB  - Accurately and affordably predict the production of a crop can be very helpful to achieve sustainable agriculture practices. With the increasing presence of new technologies in agricultural management, remote sensing data is being used more and more often for crop monitoring and yield forecast. This study determined the relation between Sentinel-2's derived NDVI and final production values for pea crops at maturity stage at Sorraia and Tejo's Valleys, Portugal. For the model, 37 parcels from the 2017 and 2018 campaigns were used. The results showed the average production of a pea crop parcel was directly proportional to the average NDVI values. The linear model achieved an R-2 of 0.72 and was considered statistically significant at p<0.01. Additionally, 15 parcels from the 2019 campaign were used as a validation set. The model revealed a tendency to overestimate yield values with an average error of 19%. Additional data, such as weed effect on production and NDVI values, is necessary in order to improve the model accuracy.

CP  - 1st International Conference on Information Technologies in the Research of Biodiversity
CL  - Irkutsk, RUSSIA
AB  - Phytoplankton is the lowest level of the trophic chain determining the aquatic ecosystem productivity. Information about the surface phytoplankton distribution over a large area can be obtained by the modern remote methods. Satellite signal penetrates only into the upper layer, so these methods are limited. Plant biomass volume located under the surface water layer differs significantly from the remote data. Vertical model of phytoplankton functioning based on the concept of fitness function is used to reconstruct the integral biomass in the whole water column under a unit area. Phytoplankton community is considered under its aspiration to occupy the niche most favorable for life. The community growth rate coincides with the specific growth rate of phytoplankton. The model solution reduces to solving the Cauchy problem for a system of ordinary differential equations with the remote sensing data as the initial conditions. The remote sensing data of the Sea of Japan and Issyk-Kul Lake are used for the model testing. The model solution visualization gives an idea of the spatial distribution of biomass within the entire zone where the photosynthesis takes place.

AB  - This paper investigates spaceborne multiple multispectral data-fusion and blending to generate an integrated data with higher spatio-spectral resolution and spectral coverage in order to obtain improved geological mapping. A hybrid approach using Gram-Schmidt pan-sharpening and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) based downsampling technique is developed to generate integrated data from multiple multispectral data. In this study, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data have been used to evaluate the developed approach for lithological mapping. Liikavaara to Puoltikasvaara including Nautanen and nearby-mining area, in the Gallivare district of Norrbotten county, Sweden, is chosen as a case study. Lithological map of the study area is produced using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Bedrock geological map from the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) is used for classification accuracy assessment. The results show that integrated data produced better accuracy than original individual spaceborne multispectral data for lithological mapping of the study area.

AB  - Paddy crop is one of the foremost food crops in the world. Human consumption accounts for 85% of total production of paddy. Paddy delivers 21% of human per capita energy and 15% of per capita protein. The present study focused on estimating the crop phenological parameters. The phenological parameters were estimated using soil moisture active passive (SMAP), MODIS NDVI, and SCATSAT-1 scatterometer data. The statistical models adopted in the study are two-parameter Gaussian distribution and two-parameter logistic distributions. The puddling stage is the first phenological stage, and it is estimated by the application of soil wetness index (SWI) and anomaly method. The transplanting stage is estimated using the anomaly method. The heading stages are estimated using statistical models, and it is found that Gaussian distribution is the best-fitted model. The harvesting stage is identified using SCATSAT-1 scatterometer and MODIS NDVI data. A chi-square test and degrees of freedom are used to identify the performance and comparison of statistical models. Chi-square test measure is equal to 80.561 and corresponding tabulated chi-square value with N-K-1 degrees of freedom that is equal to 117 is 151.929. The null hypothesis is not rejected.

TI  - Philosophical and scientific debates on geomancy in the Latin Middle Ages
T2  - TRANS-FORM-ACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomancy, a divinatory discipline imported from the Arab world, flourished in the Latin Middle Ages. In the attempt to explain the popularity of geomancy, translators and authors of geomantic writings, philosophers, theologians, and other scholars addressed such issues as its validity, its philosophical implications, and the worldview it presupposed. This paper explores this debate, delineating the epistemological status of geomancy in relation to astrology The problem of the scientificity of geomacy will be discussed with regard to the celestial influences on the sublunary world. In addition, the different roles played by both the geomancer and the consultant (quaerens) are examined. Attention will be paid to the concept of intentio, which implies a psychological analysis peculiar to geomancy. Geomancy is also characterized by ritual elements such as both preliminary prescriptions and invocations of God, meaning that it is not an ordinary divinatory technique, but a form of wisdom revealed only to experienced and upright geomancers, who can thus obtain knowledge of future events and hidden things. From this analysis emerges the complex nature of geomancy, whose original Arabic version had a prominent religious character and a close, albeit ambiguous, link with Islamic prophecy.

AB  - This paper investigates the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 (S-1) interferometric coherence to crop structure and near surface soil moisture (SSM) content. The study analyzes a data set collected in 2017 over the Apulian Tavoliere agricultural site (Southern Italy). The data set includes: i) in situ data over more than 600 agricultural fields monitored during the 2017 winter and spring growing seasons; ii) time-series of S-1 IW VV & VH backscatter & interferometric coherence; iii) time series of S-1 SSM maps. The temporal behavior of S-1 coherence and VH backscatter has been assessed over the monitored agricultural fields. Initial results indicate a stronger sensitivity of S-1 coherence than VH backscatter to crop geometric structure. In addition, an analysis at site scale, conducted before and after an important rain event, indicates a change of SSM from 0.18 to 0.30 m(3)/m(3) along with a change of S-1 coherence from 0.61 to 0.53.

TI  - Evaluation and utilization of CloudSat and CALIPSO data to analyze the impact of dust aerosol on the microphysical properties of cirrus over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study elucidates on the evaluation of two versions (V3 and V4.10) of vertical feature mask (VFM) and aerosol sub-types data derived from the Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and its utilization to analyze the impact of dust aerosol on the microphysical properties of cirrus over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In conjunction to the CALIPSO, we have also used the CloudSat data to study the same during the summer season for the years 2007-2010 over the study area 25-40 degrees N and 75-100 degrees E. Compared to V3 of CALIPSO, V4.10 was found to have undergone substantial changes in the code, algorithm, and data products. Intercomparison of both versions of data products in the selected grid between 30-31 degrees N and 83-84 degrees E within the study area during 2007-2017 revealed that the VFM and aerosol sub-types are in good agreement of similar to 95.27% and similar to 82.80%, respectively. Dusty cirrus is defined as the clouds mixed with dust aerosols or existing in dust aerosol conditions, while the pure cirrus is that in a dust-free environment. The obtained results illustrated that the various microphysical properties of cirrus, namely ice water content (IWC), ice water path (IWP), ice distribution width (IDW), ice effective radius (IER), and ice number concentration (INC) noticed a decrease of 17%, 18%, 4%, 19%, and 10%, respectively due. to the existence of dust aerosol, consistent with the classical "Twomey effect" for liquid clouds. Moreover, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed moderate negative correlations between -0.4 and -0.6 with the microphysical characteristics of cirrus. As our future studies, in addition to the present work undertaken, we planned to gain knowledge and interested to explore the impact of a variety of aerosols apart from the dust aerosol on the microphysical properties of cirrus in different regions of China.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation on Remotely Sensed Images Using an Enhanced Global Convolutional Network with Channel Attention and Domain Specific Transfer Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the remote sensing domain, it is crucial to complete semantic segmentation on the raster images, e.g., river, building, forest, etc., on raster images. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder (DCED) network is the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method for remotely sensed images. However, the accuracy is still limited, since the network is not designed for remotely sensed images and the training data in this domain is deficient. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel CNN for semantic segmentation particularly for remote sensing corpora with three main contributions. First, we propose applying a recent CNN called a global convolutional network (GCN), since it can capture different resolutions by extracting multi-scale features from different stages of the network. Additionally, we further enhance the network by improving its backbone using larger numbers of layers, which is suitable for medium resolution remotely sensed images. Second, channel attention is presented in our network in order to select the most discriminative filters (features). Third, domain-specific transfer learning is introduced to alleviate the scarcity issue by utilizing other remotely sensed corpora with different resolutions as pre-trained data. The experiment was then conducted on two given datasets: (i) medium resolution data collected from Landsat-8 satellite and (ii) very high resolution data called the ISPRS Vaihingen Challenge Dataset. The results show that our networks outperformed DCED in terms of F1 for 17.48% and 2.49% on medium and very high resolution corpora, respectively.

CL  - New Delhi, INDIA
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique widely used to generate elevation maps, commonly known as interferograms, that depicts surface deformations and topographic trends. Changes in topography and deformations can be measured over span of days to years and are recorded in the form of fringes. Taking into consideration the upcoming NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, which is designed to support wide-swath interferometry, it is high time to develop a InSAR processing tool dedicated to ISRO missions. Due to its versatile features, popularity, flexibility and the huge library support, the tool development was chosen to be in Python3 programming language. In this paper the first results obtained from the in-house developed, python 3 based, software tool for InSAR processing are presented. The tool is slated to become part of the Microwave Data Analysis Software (MIDAS) of SAC, which is a generic SAR processing software suite. Currently, the tool accepts ERS 1/2, ENVISAT, RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-2 data. For verification purpose, the outputs generated by the tool are compared with those generated by the freely available Delft Object-oriented Radar Interferometric Software (DORIS) developed by the Delft Institute of Earth Observation and Space Systems (DEOS), Delft University of Technology.

TI  - Philosophical "reading" of the opposition "Me - Other" in the traditional culture of the Ob Ugrians (gender aspect)
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article considers the opposition "Me - Other" on the materials of Ob-Ugric folklore and ethnographic data. Such types of opposition as mythological (origin of a man, emergence of sexual dimorphism as the formation of the binary opposition feminine / masculine), religious (totemic beliefs, profane / sacral), family and social (rite of avoidance) and philosophical (awareness of "Me" different from the "Other" in the mode of time). The idea of the article is to reveal the essence of the oppositions of worldview positions and the possibilities of their convergence (connection, interpenetration).Objective: to reveal the peculiarity of the manifestation of the "Me - Other" opposition in the traditional culture of the Khanty and Mansi as "feminine / masculine" from the standpoint of philosophical anthropology and phenomenology.Research materials: published folklore texts, data of linguistics and ethnography of the Ob Ugrians, as well as field materials of the author.Results and novelty of the research: the article analyzes the types of "Me - Other" opposition. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the fact that the types of the opposition "us - them" (mythological, religious, philosophical) identified by V. G. Felde are extrapolated by us to the opposition "Me - Other" in the traditional culture of the Ob Ugrians. This made it possible to add this list with a family and social type of opposition, to give them characteristics and models for removal of contradictions in accordance with the traditional worldview. It is proved that the opposition "Me - Other" is largely determined by the cultural and historical reality.The main theses of the article contribute to the organization of a dialogue of specialists in the field of philological, historical, philosophical and other sciences on issues of changing of the opposition "Me - Other" in culture.The work contains materials and conclusions that can be implemented in the teaching of anthropology, cultural studies, philosophy, as well as they can be used as the basis for a the specialized course devoted to the problem of the development of the opposition "Me - Other".

TI  - Structure of characters of Mansi folklore: the forest woman Misne
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Structure of characters of Mansi folklore still does not fall into the focus of attention of scientists. At the same time, its understanding opens up new frontiers for the study of mythological representations, culture, and worldview of the Northern ethnos. The characters of folklore are people, animals, elements, fantastic (mythical) creatures. In this article, we will focus on one character - Misne. In Mansi folklore, she is represented as the forest woman. Her main function is to help forest residents and hunters. Extensive information about her is contained in fairy tales and tales.Objective: systematic analysis of the Misne's image based on the material of folklore texts and folk ideas.Research materials: the texts of Mansi tales published in various folklore collections in periodicals; historical sources, as well as field material of the author. For detailing, we also involve prohibitions that are common in the Mansi culture.Results and novelty of the research: the study adds the scientific knowledge of Mansi folklore. Based on folklore, linguistic, literary and historical data, the article reveals the image of the forest woman. The characteristics of Misne are fixed in the folklore texts, her description is given. The anthropomorphism of the image, its desire for socialization distinguishes the folklore image from the mythological one.The folklore texts determine the boundaries and the degree of interaction of a people with Misne. The material opens up prospects for continuing research on the character and plot structure of Mansi folklore.

TI  - Does institutional ownership engagement matter for greater financial performance? Evidence from a developing market
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Previous empirical evidence scrutinizing the impact of the institutional ownership on the firm performance has produced inconclusive results and mostly concentrated in the developed market. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the ownership engagement by pressure-resistant, pressure-sensitive and foreign institutions on the corporate financial performance in a developing market like India post US financial crisis.Design/methodology/approach - This study considers a panel data set of 361 Indian listed firms from National Stock Exchange (NSE) 500 index for a period of eight years from financial year (FY) 2008-2009 to FY 2015-2016. The panel data regression (pooled ordinary least square [OLS], fixed-effect [FE] and random-effect [RE]) and simultaneous equation modeling are used by considering the institutional ownership engagement as both exogenous and endogenous variable.Findings - The test results show that institutional ownership engagement by the pressure-resistant and foreign institution have a robust and positive effect, while ownership engagement by the pressure sensitive institution has an adverse impact on the financial performance of the Indian listed firms.Research limitations/implications - The findings will boost the monitoring activities of the institutional owners in the developing markets. The investment from pressure-resistant and foreign institutions needs to be augmented in Indian firms to improvise their governance functions and performance.Originality/value - This research will enrich the governance literature of the developing economies as the studies on institutional ownership engagement are limited in the developing world. Further, this study adds value by capturing two emerging institutional ownership category such as the pressure-resistant and pressure-sensitive, which are still untouched in the Indian context. Next, the consideration of the institutional ownership as both exogenous and endogenous is also novel to the Indian literature.

AB  - The fusion of multispectral and panchromatic images acquired on common location to form resultant image that features higher spectral as well as higher spatial resolutions is also referred to as `Pansharpening'. In the recent past, many such fusion algorithms belonging to various approaches have been proposed. In this paper, the authors compare performances of the most popular image fusion algorithms using Component Substitution approach. Selected algorithms are applied to two real datasets, acquired by WorldView-3 and WorldView-4 satellite sensors. The performances are evaluated based on popular image quality metrics. This performance analysis will surely help in evaluation of the best possible trade-off in between spectral resolution and spatial resolution for the fused image by selected algorithms.

AB  - Fusion of multispectral to panchromatic image obtained for the same location, that is ultimately producing new multispectral image with added details of spatial resolution is best known as `Pansharpening'. Developing such algorithms for image fusion and assessing quality by objective metrics are the most debated topics of research from the last few decades. In this paper, the authors attempt to validate use of image segmentation in pansharpening and compare performance of fusion process with other most recent algorithms. Fusion algorithms are tested on two datasets, acquired by QuickBird-2 and WorldView-2 respectively. Evaluations of corresponding results are based on computations of popular image quality metrics. The analysis will surely help to know the best possible trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions for desired fused image.

AB  - Due to the cloud coverage in optical remote sensing data, it is challenging to have a cloud-free image over large region. These inevitable cloud/cloud shadow pixels bring invalid patches in the derived thematic maps, which usually labeled as cloud and cloud shadow types. We use a pixel-level image composition method to generate cloud-free image. For each invalid patch in the thematic map, an enlarged area is extracted in the thematic map and composited image. Then the training data are generated automatically using the thematic map surrounded the invalid patch. The Random Forest (RF) method is used to classify the composited image. The new classification result is used to fill the invalid patch in the thematic map. This method is tested and evaluated in forest cover map in selected sites of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The result shows it is an efficient way to produce a cloud-free forest cover map for further analysis and applications.

AB  - This paper described an experiment of developing a complex technique for satellite imagery time series processing when estimating spatial distribution of framing (or changing) calendar dates of the growing seasons. Particularly, we reflected on allocation of growing season framing dates in conditions of unstable weather. As surface air temperature may fluctuate in many cases around bordering values during some days or weeks, the allocation of stable crossing of temperature through the control values (that marks time frames of growing seasons) is a fundamental problem in the case of ground observations. We compared some results of the growing season frames allocation based on ground data observations of the temperature (needed for the verification and calibration purposes), and the estimation results made relying on the data of remotely observed Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).

AB  - There has been long-term observation of coastal erosion in Koh Kho Khao, Ban Nam Khem, Phang Nga province, in Thailand, which was affected by a tsunami on December 26, 2004. The disaster, as is well known, caused the loss of lives and property. This area is recognized as one of the best tourist areas in Thailand. The objective of the research was to identify the coastal changes to the island, Koh Kho Khao. The Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing were used. Five-time periods were used, in which aerial photographs and satellite images were taken, with the aerial photographs taken in February, 2002. IKONOS images were taken on December 29, 2004, and Quick Bird images were dated the 23rd of February, 2009. Worldview-2 images were dated the 6th of December, 2012, while the Pleiades images were dated January 8, 2016. The coastlines were compared using the overlay technique. Coastal erosion and coastal deposition during consecutive years were calculated. The results showed that the tsunami in 2004 caused coastal erosion in the area, as coastal changes during those years were found. Additionally, natural adaptation was found after 14 years at the middle and upper parts of the island. Severe coastal erosion of the lower part of the island has been continuously found, with an erosion rate between 2002 and 2004 (2-year period), 2004 and 2009 (5-year period), 2009 and 2012 (3-year period), and 2012 and 2016 (4-year period) of 22.44, 9.96, 19.63, and 12.34 meters per year respectively. In addition the erosion rate between 2002 and 2016 (14-year period) was 100.97 meters per year. It was also found that the seawall was the main factor in the coastal erosion in the lower part of the island because it was recognized that the coastline was sharply cut along the seawall. It is recommended that the lower part of the island be declared a special observation area in order to prevent further coastal erosion.

TI  - Combining Binary and Post-Classification Change Analysis of Augmented ALOS Backscatter for Identifying Subtle Land Cover Changes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to detect subtle changes by combining binary change analysis, the Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (IRMAD), over dual polarimetric Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) backscatter with augmented data for post-classification change analysis. The accuracy of change detection was iteratively evaluated based on thresholds composed of mean and a range constant of standard deviation. Four datasets were examined for post-classification change analysis including the dual polarimetric backscatter as the benchmark and its augmented data with indices, entropy alpha decomposition and selected texture features. Variable importance was then evaluated to build a best subset model employing seven classifiers, including Bagged Classification and Regression Tree (CAB), Extreme Learning Machine Neural Network (ENN), Bagged Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MAB), Regularised Random Forest (RFG), Original Random Forest (RFO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree (XGB). The best accuracy was 98.8%, which resulted from thresholding MAD variate-2 with constants at 1.7. The highest improvement of classification accuracy was obtained by amending the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture. The identification of variable importance (VI) confirmed that selected GLCM textures (mean and variance of HH or HV) were equally superior, while the contribution of index and decomposition were negligible. The best model produced similar classification accuracy at about 90% for both years 2007 and 2010. Tree-based algorithms including RFO, RFG and XGB were more robust than SVM and ENN. Subtle changes indicated by binary change analysis were somewhat hidden in post-classification analysis. Reclassification by combining all important variables and adding five classes to include subtle changes assisted by Google Earth yielded an accuracy of 82%.

AB  - The planned EUMETSAT Polar System-Second Generation (EPS-SG) Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) radiometer will provide quantitative estimates of ice clouds and snowfall from space. ICI has 11 channels in the millimeter and sub-millimeter wave range (from 183 up to 664 GHz). These wavelengths allow to detect ice clouds, whereas the emission signal from the surface is predominantly masked by high water vapor opacity. The latter is a problem for the geolocation assessment because current methods, comparing coastlines in imagery data with the known geographic locations, are not readily applicable to ICI channels. However, in very dry atmospheric conditions the geolocation validation technique could be still based on the observations at 183.3 +/- 7 GHz. This work proposes to evaluate geolocation error over the two biggest ice shelves (Ross and Filchner-Ronne) in the Antarctic region as surface natural targets, using as a coastline reference, data derived from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.

AB  - The advent of multitemporal high resolution data, like the Copernicus Sentinel-2, has enhanced significantly the potential of monitoring the earth's surface and environmental dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning framework for urban change detection which combines state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks (similar to U-Net) for feature representation and powerful recurrent networks (such as LSTMs) for temporal modeling. We report our results on the recently publicly available bi-temporal Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) Sentinel-2 dataset, enhancing the temporal information with additional images of the same region on different dates. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the recurrent networks as well as the use of the additional dates on the unseen test-set using an ensemble crossvalidation strategy. All the developed models during the validation phase have scored an overall accuracy of more than 95%, while the use of LSTMs and further temporal information, boost the F1 rate of the change class by an additional 1.5%.

AB  - Semantic segmentation, especially for very high-resolution satellite data, is one of the pillar problems in the remote sensing community. Lately, deep learning techniques are the ones that set the state-of-the-art for a number of benchmark datasets, however, there are still a lot of challenges that need to be addressed, especially in the case of limited annotations. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel framework based on deep neural networks that is able to address concurrently semantic segmentation and image reconstruction in an end to end training. Under the proposed formulation, the image reconstruction acts as a regularization, constraining efficiently the solution in the entire image domain This self-supervised component helps significantly the generalization of the network for the semantic segmentation, especially in cases of a low number of annotations. Experimental results and the performed quantitative evaluation on the publicly available ISPRS (WGIII/4) dataset indicate the great potential of the developed approach.

AB  - Estimation of LAI is really a challenge and researchers are developing new methods to get more accurate estimation of LAI. MODIS continuously provides globally temporal LAI product and it is easily accessible for application and development purpose. But main problem is the spatial resolution (500m) where the main target features has affected due to the presence of unwanted features like clouds and others. It was concluded by previous researchers that MODIS MOD15A2H products give the overestimation or underestimation of LAI. From the Choudhury's method [1] of view, using the available MODIS products like vegetation indices, view zenith angle, sun azimuthal angle information LAI estimation can be improved. In this study an algorithm was developed on the basis of this Choudhury method to extract the improved LAI estimation by indirectly retrieving of canopy leaf angle distribution function, extinction coefficient from the MODIS MODIS13Q1 product. This modified Choudhury method (ModcModLAIE) applied in the Bhitar Kanika mangrove forest of Odisha, India for estimating the LAI. It was proved and validated with the help of Digital Hemispherical Photography (DHP) that from the available MODIS products itself it is possible to extract finer resolution (250m) improved LAI product. DHP analysis works on the basic principle of Beer's law, gap fraction calculation. At the time of comparison, it has shown that DHP extracted LAI has the higher correlation with ModcModLAIE output than the MOD15A2H LAI product. So, this research has proved the overestimation and underestimation fact of MODIS LAI product as well as it has shown a way to extract an improved LAI estimation from available course resolution MODIS products.

AB  - The accuracy in classification of remote sensing (RS) images using deep learning architectures is affected by the lack of large sets of training samples. Although a significant effort is currently devoted to generate databases of annotated satellite images, these datasets may not be large enough to accurately model at global level different types of land-cover surfaces. To solve such a problem, this paper presents an unsupervised approach which aims to exploit the RS image that has to be classified and publicly available thematic products to generate a training database of weak samples representative of the considered study area. First, we harmonize the thematic map and the RS image. Then, samples having the highest probability to be correctly associated to their labels are extracted from the map by exploiting the information provided by the RS image to be classified. Finally, the weak labeled samples are used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). Experimental results obtained training a CNN on Sentinel 2 images with weak labels extracted from the 2018 corine land cover (CLC) map demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - In Seo, Jeong-in's novel, the scapegoat is mentioned and described.Seo, Jeon-in argues that the history of mankind is the history of the scapegoat, talking about the death of Jesus as a humanistic event that showed the innocence of scapegoat and the unanimous violence of crowd by revelation. As a reason for this, he holds that the exclusive attitudes of human beings are inherent behind all the disputes. He points out that the excessive faith in his right is to make others as enemies and evils, and therefore the exclusive attitude has produced many scapegoats. He also shows Girolamo Savonarola in his novels ‘Yong Byeong Dae Jang’ and ‘Malttug’ to illustrate the epitome of the religious sacrifice. However, the essence of the scapegoat mechanism is the majority's violence toward the minority. Seo, Jeong-in indicates that the scapegoat was created even in the peak period of religion through the use of Girolamo Savonarola, and the mechanism is still valid.Seo, Jeong-in clearly states that the scapegoat is an arbitrarily designated person to take it out on and shift blame. It is based on the human psychology that wants to create person to take it out on anyhow. He recognizes that Korean society has been busy to spend time to create the scapegoat. He deplores that the scapegoat mechanism has been used as a way to solidify the political power of certain people, including 4.19 revolution, the pro-democracy movement in Busan and Masan, and the Gwangju democracy movement on May 18, and these have been repeated. The scapegoat created by the corrupt regime has no sin and has little power to protect itself. The corrupt regime knew it well and actively induced their complaints toward the outside of the system. Societies that do not respect various opinions and ideas are oppressive and violent. Seo, Jeong-in regards the society in which various voices coexist as an ideal society, which ultimately leads to social desire for democracy.His pursuit of diversity is associated with relativism and forms the mainstreams of his literary world.

AB  - With the development of remote sensing sensor technology, it has become possible to acquire satellite images with various spectral information. In particular, since the hyperspectral image is composed of continuous and narrow spectral wavelength, it can be effectively used in various fields such as land cover classification, target detection, and environment monitoring. Change detection techniques using remote sensing data are generally performed through differences of data with same dimensions. Therefore, it has a disadvantage that it is difficult to apply to heterogeneous sensors having different dimensions. In this study, we have developed a change detection method applicable to hyperspectral image and high spat ial resolution satellite image with different dimensions, and confirmed the applicability of the change detection method between heterogeneous images. For the application of the change detection method, the dimension of hyperspectral image was reduced by using correlation analysis and principal component analysis, and the change detection algorithm used CVA. The ROC curve and the AUC were calculated using the reference data for the evaluation of change detection performance. Experimental results show that the change detection performance is higher when using the image generated by adequate dimensionality reduction than the case using the original hyperspectral image.

AB  - Choi Seung-ro was a six-headed line and the status of the family was not high. So he grew into a Confucian scholar following the six-headed tradition. By raising the reform plan to Sungjong, he contributed to the Confucian politics and the system maintenance. He was from Gyeongju in Silla but lived as a bureaucrat of Goryeo. He lived with the identity of Goryeo.In view of the Confucian ideology as a way of ruling the country, he insisted on implementing Confucian politics and weakened the influence of religious faith in politics. Sungjong was much more thorough in promoting Confucianism than Choi Seung-ro. He said that the king led the politics and that the king and his servants should politicize in consultation. He criticized the subordinates for leading politics. He distinguished between bureaucrats and non-bureaucrats and sought bureaucratic interests. And he aimed at bureaucratic politics with the king rather than aristocracy that constrained the kingship.He insisted on dispatching local officials in pursuit of a centralized governance system, while at the same time acknowledging the autonomous local domination of the local ruling class. He had a sense of succession in Goguryeo and independent worldview and based on that, he understood the international relations of China, the Kitan and the Jurchen.

AB  - Sentinel-1A and 1B operate in Extra Wide swath dual-polarization mode over the Arctic Seas, and the two-satellite constellation provides the most frequent SAR observation of the Arctic sea ice ever. However, the use of Sentinel-1 for sea ice classification has not been popular because of relatively higher level of system noise and radiometric calibration issues. By taking advantage of our recent development on Sentinel-1 image noise correction, we suggest a fully automated SAR image-based sea ice classification scheme which can provide a potential near-real time services of sea ice charting. The denoised images are processed into texture features and a machine learning-based classifier is trained by feeding digitized ice charts. The use of ice chart rather than manually classified reference image makes enable an automated training which minimizes the effects from biased human decision. The resulting classifier was tested over the Fram Strait area for an extensive dataset of Sentinel-1 constellation acquired from October 2017 to May 2018. The classification results are shown in comparison with the ice charts, and the feasibility of the ice chart-feeded automated classifier is discussed.

AB  - The flood detection technique based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was assessed. This technique was applied to a flood event in Busan in 2017. Sentinel-1 imagery was acquired, and then different multitemporal change detection methods were applied for SAR data analysis. Observed data were collected from newspapers, social media, and the Korean Fire Protection Association (KFPA). Specifically, flood and non-flood data were collected and used for analysis. As a result of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.67, which indicates a generally efficient technique, but it showed lower performance than the random model according to the threshold value. Four of 15 flood sites and a threshold value of 0.02 were selected to compare the flood area between the observed data and the flood maps derived from SAR analysis. As a result, all four flood maps included the observed flood areas, with some overestimation of flood area. A criterion for selecting the optimal threshold was suggested using ROC curve analysis, and the flood map results from this threshold were validated, but follow-up study is required to assess the accuracy numerically.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper examined largely the way in which the latitudinarians’ perspective on the political authority of the civil magistrate was shaped by their apocalyptic interpretation of the godly ruler. Recently, historians argue that their political thought was heavily influenced by Thomas Hobbes’ ideas because their central prepositions of the authority of monarchy showed little difference from Hobbes’ ideas. The accusation of ‘Hobbism’ against the latitudinarian clergy was made by a contemporary group of High Church apologists and Nonconformists. Both attacks were commonly directed at the insistence of the latitudinarians on the legitimate right of the civil rulers to control religious matters. Despite that some ideas that seemed slightly different from Erastianism, or Hobbism, were manifest in these moderates’ ecclesiology, it does not mean that the contending polemicists’ identification of the latitudinarians with ‘Hobbism’ is justified. Their attitude towards the duty of the monarch in religion and church matters was articulated mostly through religious language and rhetoric. In particular, their ideas of royal authority over the church were explained through the biblical understanding of political authority. Their view of the relationship between religion and politics should be understood as not so much one of inheritances of Hobbes’ worldview but as a part of the transformation of religious languages in politics in the later 17th-century England.

TI  - Object-based Land Cover Change Detection and Landscape Structure Analysis of Demilitarized Zone in Korea
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The demilitarized zone (DMZ) in Korea, a 4-km-wide military-free zone at the border between South Korea and North Korea, has been well preserved for half a century and has a high ecological value. However, temporal and spatial data are lacking owing to poor accessibility. In this study, we detected object-based land cover changes using Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM, and Landsat-8 OSI, and identified changes around the DMZ through landscape structure analysis. The land cover was classified into six categories, namely, settlements, cropland, wetlands, forest land, semiforest land, and bare land by object-based classification. The landscape structure was analyzed using five landscape metrics [i.e., number of patches (NumP), mean patch size (MPS), total edge (TE), edge density (ED), and area-weighted mean shape index (AWMSI)]. Results showed that, from 2000 to 2009, the forest land and bare land areas decreased, while the semiforest land area increased. In 2009-2019, the bare land area increased, while the forest land area decreased. Consequently, the restoration of wildfire-damaged areas decreased the fragmentation of Goseong-gun in 2000-2009 and wildfire caused more forest damage in 2009-2019.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images contain different types of noises which restricts its wide application for the ocean surveillance. Therefore, this study focuses on removing several types of noises from SAR images. At first images were Fourier transformed to obtain frequency domain. Then, sidelobe noises from KOMPSAT-5, and scalloping and thermal noises from Sentinel-1 images were masked out by applying low-pass filter on the frequency domain. Then pixels affected by azimuth ambiguity in KOMPSAT-5 images were determined based on the distance and comparative brightness of the detected ships, and removed accordingly. This method is applied on 4 KOMPSAT-5 images and validated with the visual detection results of ships. The ship detection results without applying noise removal contains up to 59.26% false detections which were fully removed by the proposed method. Thus, the proposed noise reduction scheme has improved the accuracy of ship detection. Further improvement of the algorithm using more images is in progress.

AB  - This article studies the contents and tradition patterns of urban legends spread among people in today 's science and technology era, and the religious character of these urban legends. To this end, I reviewed the current status and characteristics of urban legends, and analyzed the works in the book Do-Si-Goi-Dam (Urban Ghosts Stories).Books that contain titles such as 'urban legends' or 'urban ghost stories' can be classified into comics, novels, collections, and research books. Among them, most of the comic books about urban legends were translations of works by Japanese authors, and most of the novels were selected offline from popular web novels. The collections and the research books have similar proportions when translating foreign works and those written in Korea.Urban Ghosts Stories contains a total of 66 urban legends. This paper focuses on 19 urban legends in the chapter 'Mobile phones, computers, and digital cameras'. One of the most important features that penetrate 19 urban legends is that IT devices mediate the real world and the transcendent world. And it can be divided into the mediator between the living and the dead, and the mediator between man and Godhead.Due to the development of science and technology, people have largely deviated from the magical worldview. So people became more and more difficult to trust the transcendent world. But people have lived as religious beings for a very long time. It is the conclusion of this article that, in the rapid modernization, people seem to despise and deny interest in the transcendent world, while still imagining such a world and creating and passing on new urban legends.

AB  - Monitoring of land subsidence is important to protect invaluable lives and properties. Although terrestrial observations such as Global Positioning System (GPS) survey can provide very accurate surface's displacement at a point with very high temporal resolution, it has limitation to apply for observation of vast areas. Differential radar interferometry enables us to retrieve high spatial surface's deformation map with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. Especially we can calculate a time-series of surface's deformation using the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach reducing atmospheric artifact and topographic errors with multi-temporal SAR observations. In this study, the SBAS technique has been applied to monitor possible land subsidence in Busan, South Korea with L-band ALOS PALSAR observations. Total 19 SAR images were acquired from 15-Sep-2007 to 24-Dec-2010 with geometric baseline (from-2832 to 1855 meters). We selected 30 points which are showing significant subsidence signals for statistical analysis. The preliminary result shows land subsidence with average velocity rate of -4.09 +/- 0.65 cm/year at line of sight (LOS) direction.

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In recent 10 years, forest damage caused by forest fires in Korea has increased significantly compared to previous years. Therefore, interest and concern about damage caused by forest fires are very important in terms of environmental and ecosystem. According to various domestic and international research results, forests perform functions such as reporting of life resources, prevention of desertification, and adjustment of micro climate. There are many studies to extract the damage areas based on hyper spectral aerial image, high resolution satellite image, vegetation index and factors affecting the forest environment. However, there are limitations that the indexes have different threshold values depending on the region and season, and the threshold value must be continuously adjusted in order to detect the concentration of the damage areas. In this study, we detected forest disaster damaged areas through satellite image data and deep learning. We collected image data on Landsat satellite and applied to the detection of damaged area using U-net [1] and SegNet [2] models. We tried to verify the applicability of semantic segmentation for remote sensing, compare and evaluate each model, and build an optimal forest disaster detection model.

T2  - 한국조직신학논총

AB  - ‘Serving of Christian’, namely ‘diakonia’(diakoni,a), is one of the important identities of the church and also motivated by the teaching and life of Jesus. Jesus came as a servant to the earth (Luke 22:24) and told his disciples to live as servants. The early Church maintained its identity as a community that served according to the teachings of Jesus, and it was one of the main reasons that the early Church was able to have the power to transform the world in the midst of persecution and suffering.Thus, diakonia of the Church always had a social character. The diakonia practiced in the social realm, namely social diakonia, is the social function of the church. Due to the ecclesial and social nature of diakonia, social diakonia requires a theological basis.Therefore, the problem of diakonia should be treated theologically. In particular, it needs to be systematically established through systematic-theological categories. This is because we can clearly see the characteristics of diakonia as a whole and know the features of social diakonia that has been regarded until now. Therefore, After suggesting a conceptual understanding of the diakonia in Chapter 2, this paper empha sizes the need for social diakonia by redefining diakonia through systematic-theological categories in Chapter 3. By this systematic theological interpretation, this paper attempts to clarify the following poionts.First, in the aspect of theodicy, diakonia is oriented toward justice based on neighborly love. Diakonia is personal in the sense of love motivation, but social in the view of justice as the realization of love. On the humanistic side, diakonia pre supposes autonomous human beings. Above all, autonomous human beings have spontaneity as a restored person freed in faith, because diakonia based on spontaneity is free from social interests and it goes to participate to solve the social and structural problems for the socially weak. Second, autonomous human beings need a life of self-determination. In particular, the self-determination of the beneficiary of diakonia is an essential element for existence as an independent human being.From the perspective of the Christian worldview, social dia konia must overcome a dualistic worldview based on the separation of the church and the state. While a dualistic worldview can be useful for the church diakonia, it undermines the value of diakonia by social diakonia. Diakonia should also be newly established from the view of ecclesiology. Pastoral ministry and diakonia are closely interrelated, but diakonia exists not only for ministry. A true church of diakonia is possi ble when diakonia is accepted as an essence of the church, like kerygma and koinonia. Such church endeavours not to instrumentalise diakonia for mission. Both, diakonia and mission have had their own values since the early Church.

AB  - Three studies investigated the effects of meditation on responses to reminders of death. Study 1 took a quasi-experimental approach, comparing defensive responses to mortality salience (MS) of South Korean participants with varying levels of experience with Buddhism and meditation. Whereas non-Buddhists without meditation showed the typical increase in worldview defense after mortality salience (MS), this effect was not found among non-Buddhists immediately after an initial meditation experience, nor among lay Buddhists who meditated regularly or Buddhist monks with intensive meditation experience. Study 2, a fully randomized experiment, showed that MS increased worldview defense among South Koreans at a meditation training who were assessed before meditating but not among participants assessed after their first meditation experience. Study 3 showed that whereas American students without prior meditation experience showed increased worldview defense and suppression of death-related thoughts after MS, these effects were eliminated immediately after an initial meditation experience. Death thought accessibility mediated the effect of MS on worldview defense without meditation, but meditation eliminated this mediation.

AB  - Most of the researches on the Korea Theater up to now were focused on which plays in “Korean language” were performed at the Korea Theater from the perspective of Korean literature.　Although the preservation of our language and traditional arts were important responsibilities of the Korean artists, the Korea Theater amidst the Soviet regime and the independent Republic of Kazakhstan has been advocating evolution through painstakingly choosing artworks that can raise its artistic status while being responsive to government policies. Accordingly, performance of plays based on original Korean play script was one of the important activities of the Korea Theater, however the leaders of the theater did not pressure the playwrights to write plays only in Korean. Even though translating plays in other languages and putting them on stage was another important mission, whether plays were suitable to be in the theater’s program was their most important task.With such awareness, this study takes a closer look at the following perspectives among the plays performed on stages in Central Asia: The cultivation of multicultural spirit through traditional plays created by Kazakhstan’s representative playwrights Gabit Musrepov and Mukhtar Auezov; cultivation of revolutionary spirit and women’s enlightenment through socialistic realism-oriented performances created by Uzbekistan’s representative playwright Hamza Hakimzoda Niyazi; and the formation of spiritual consensus through humanism-oriented performances created by Kyrgyzstan’s representative playwright Chingiz Aitmatov. Based on this, the study sheds light on the staging repertoire of the Korea Theater, which gradually converged Soviet characteristics, Central Asian worldview, and Koreans’ ethnic elements, as well as contemplating the cultural/artistic goals of the theater’s leaders, aspects of acculturation, and obligation consciousness of the times.

AB  - This paper is a case study of ecoart since the 1960s. Since the 20th century, environmental issues have become more serious worldwide, and the ecological world view emerged as a new paradigm of replacing the anthropocentric view. This is a holistic worldview based on systems thinking. Ecoart is the artistic implementation of the ecological world view according to the demands of the times. Ecoartists such as Helen Mayer Harrison (1929-2018) and Newton Harrison (1932-)  the Harrisons  Hans Haacke (b. 1936) and Mark Dion(b. 1961) regard environment issues as a serious social problem, and try to do systems critical work related to this problem. They tend to display research data and samples based on field surveys in order to identify the realities of the ecosystem. The Harrisons investigated the environment with the help of experts and tried to identify the ecological system in their exhibitions. Haacke and Dion implemented a pseudo-ecosystem through sample collection, and clarified the close relationship between nature and civilization. Their exhibition space, representative of cultural space, was the ecological system itself. Consequentially, these halls became public spheres that provided a basis for changingthe perception of nature and culture.

AB  - In preparation for a research project focused on the risk of the sea level rise (SLR), and on the basis of previous studies, we started to investigate the ice loss by some marine-terminating ice tongues in Antarctica in the last 10 years. The first test site selected for this study was the Erebus Ice Tongue (EIT) which stretches from Ross Island into the Ross Sea. The analysis was carried out using Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) images from the catalogue of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and from a recent acquisition. The scene under analysis includes various elements such as sea-ice, open-sea and sections of the Ross Island coast. Over the years, the area of the EIT underwent various changes. Thus, to avoid misinterpretations caused by the temporal variations of the scene elements, it was decided to restrict the analysis to the tongue itself. The first step of the analysis defined a methodology for automatically detecting the EIT in a delimited window. This was accomplished using a Template Matching technique which samples the input image with a manual training pattern of the EIT structure. The result shows the matches of the EIT patch. In the second step, a relaxation method for pixel labelling was developed in order to compare the area of the ice tongue as it was 10 years ago and today. In the case of the Erebus Ice Tongue, the analysis shows a modest decline of the area in the last 10 years, hence a modest ice loss.

AB  - Solovyov's attitude to Joseph de Mestre is striking in its paradox. The name of this bright and convinced propagandist of Catholicism is absent from the works of Solovyov on the Catholic Church, and unexpectedly appears in the article "Slavophilism and its degeneration". In this article, Mestre is presented as a teacher of Slavophiles, for whom the attractiveness of his political conservatism overshadowed an unacceptable for them religious system, sympathy for the Jesuits, and even hostility towards the Russian people and their religion. For Solovyov this is one of the evidence of the inconsistency of the Slavophil doctrine. At the same time, Soloviev does not himself establish a genetic link between the Mestre and the late Slavophiles, but merely cites the thoughts from the article of the writer of the Slavophile direction P.A. Matveyev. Further acquaintance with the works of Mestre allowed Solovyov to formulate his own critical attitude to his ideas. Despite a number of coincidences in relation to Catholicism and to Pope, Solovyov actually denied Mestres the right to be considered a Christian thinker because of his positive attitude towards the death penalty and the idealization of the executioner. In this, according to Solovyov, pagan roots features characteristic of the medieval worldview were revealed.

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has gained increasing attention being an indicator of the anthropogenic activities' effects on urban areas. Moreover, the establishment of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) for urban areas underscores the need to monitor the UHI phenomenon. This paper explores the influence of land use type and population density on UHI intensity using two Saudi cities, Jeddah and Yanbu, as case studies. Landsat images from 1990 to 2015 were used to extract the land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) of the study areas. Statistical measures and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the variations in LST due to land use type. The correlations between LST and the indices (NDVI and NDBI) and population density were also computed. The results show variations in LST due to land use type (at 0.01 level of significance) and the differences in the thermal regimes of the two cities. The population density is positively correlated with LST with R-2 varying from 0.3 to 0.87 for Jeddah and Yanbu from 1991 to 2016.

AB  - The paper compares the potential of WorldView-3 (WV-3) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite data for mapping naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) outcrops to be used by geologists in the planning phase of environmental monitoring. The wide distribution as well as the variety and extent of asbestos-bearing rocks make the selected area a significant case study for the evaluation of the feasibility of multispectral VNIR-SWIR (0.425-2.330 mu m) remote sensing observations for NOA outcrops mapping, in those areas where the density of vegetation allows their spectral identification. Different classification procedures were used to produce NOA outcrops maps for the study area. In our study, we found in general a good agreement (k > 0.8) between the produced NOA outcrops maps and the extensive available in situ data for the accessible locations.

AB  - Laser-induced fluorescence KA-14 LIDAR, developed and employed at the National Aviation Academy of Azerbaijan was used for detection of emission spectra of oil spills on the surface of the Caspian sea and earth surface of the Absheron peninsula. It is known, that oil spills may take place due to leakage of oil from different Oil-Gas-Production Companies and Joint Ventures of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic. There are 8 Oil-Gas-Production Companies and 4 Joint Ventures in Azerbaijan Republic. Fluorescence spectra were excited by 355 nm line of CFR 200-type laser (QUANTEL) with parameters: diameter of laser beam spot-circle divide = 5 mm ( after collimation- 40 mm); frequency of excitation- f = 20 Hz; pulse duration and power of laser- tau = 7 ns and 60 mJ, respectively.Analysis of differences of the spectral positions of maximums of fluorescence spectra, forms of the emissions spectra, as well as peculiarities of fine structures in emission spectra allowed with a high degree of availability to determine from which Oil-Gas-Production Company of State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic ( including OGPC "Neftjanije Kamni") leakage took place on the surface of the Caspian sea and on the earth of Absheron peninsula.Results obtained allow, for the first time, to create a data bank of fluorescence spectra of crude oil extracted on the earth of the Absheron peninsula of Azerbaijan as well as from adjacent water areas of the Caspian sea, including OGPC " Neftjanije Kamni".

AB  - Land-sea breeze can generate the growth of convective clouds and rainfall that cause hydrometeorological disasters. Early identification of the diurnal cycle of convective activities can help in mitigating the impact of disasters. The eastern coast of North Sumatra is directly adjacent to the Malacca Strait that is suitable for the land-sea breeze model simulation. The land-sea breeze circulation affects the atmospheric dynamics. This study aimed to simulate the land-sea breeze circulation using the WRF model and analyzed its effect on the diurnal cycle of convective activity. The convective activity was identified using convective index, moisture transport, and rainfall distribution. ECMWF data from 2016 to 2017 were processed to determine the land-sea breeze rainy days based on Six Filtering Method and heavy rainfall definition. The Himawari-8 satellite data was used to calculate the convective index, and the specific humidity and wind from FNL data was used to calculate the moisture transport. The GSMaP rainfall data was used to depict the diurnal rainfall distribution over Sumatra. The prevailing sea breeze on the eastern coast of North Sumatra was the northeasterly wind. Sea breeze intrusion on the north coast of North Sumatra is characterized by a decrease in temperature, rising humidity, and easterly wind. Spatially, there is a time lag of about 1-2 hours from the peak convection to the formation of rainfall in the eastern coast region of North Sumatra. Peak diurnal rainfall in the eastern coast of North Sumatra generally occurs during midnight.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF STATE OF CEDAR FORESTS IN TOMSK REGION USING REMOTE SENSING DATA OF THE EARTH
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the necessity to obtain objective information on the condition of forests for their protection from fires, diseases and pests, as well as for forestry and logging production.The aim of the research is the quantitative and qualitative assessment of changes in the condition of cedar forests on the example of the Tomsk region using ground survey methods and Earth remote sensing data.The objects of the research are the 13 cedar forests located on forest lands and belonging to the forestry branch of institution "Tomsk forest management" in Tomsk region.Methods: thematic mapping of the territory; calculation of the indicator of the number of photosynthetically active biomass NDVI (Normalize Difference Vegetation Index) on space images of medium spatial resolution (30 m) from the satellites Landsat 5 (camera TM), 7 (camera ETM+) and 8 (camera OLI), obtained in the period from 2002 to 2015 from the archive of the US Geological Survey using the Internet service Earth Explorer; spatial analysis of data using geographic information technologies; statistical processing of the obtained results by correlation and regression analysis.Result. A comprehensive assessment of 13 cedar forests was given; the dynamics of NDVI values in the period from 2002 to 2017 was analyzed; the main reason (illegal logging, windfalls, fires and spread of pests) were determined; the cedar forests were grouped according to their status; the maximum values of NDVI were set for the Bogashovskiy and Belousovskiy cedar forests, the minimum values of NDVI were set for Aksenovskiy, Protopopovskiy, Plotnikovskiy cedar forests; positive correlations between NDVI values and tree state were shown: high correlation - with the vital index, and the average correlation - with the weighted average tree state category in the forest; reliable correlation of NDVI values of cedar trees with the amount of precipitation and the amount of temperatures have not been found (except for the Aksenovskiy cedar forest, characterized as "severely weakened"); the proposed approaches are applicable to the evaluation of any cedar forests.

AB  - The aim of this work is to analyze different methodologies for the estimation of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), using the Sentinel-2 satellite. LAI and CCC are biophysical parameters indicator of crop health state and fundamental in the productivity prediction. The purpose is to define the most optimal LAI and CCC estimation method for operational use in the monitoring of agricultural areas. Moreover, the CCC and LAI automatic products obtained directly through the Sentinel Application Platform Software (SNAP) biophysical processor and Sentinel-2 images by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) are validated. On the other hand, common vegetation indices used to LAI and CCC retrieval are analyzed. Both methods were tested using a dataset composed of LM and CCC in situ data, obtained in an agricultural area near Caserta (Italy). As a result, Sentinel-2 automatic products present good statistics for LAI (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.80) and CCC (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.68 g/m(2)), without producing saturation at high LAI values. On the other hand, the best index for LAI retrieval was the normalized SeLI index (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.87) and for CCC, the three-band TCARI index (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.61 g/m(2)). But the SeLI index produces a saturation process with LAI values higher than 3.5. The main conclusion of this study, hence, is that Sentinel-2 Level 2A products, such as the LAI and CCC parameter, have great potential to be used automatically and operationally in agricultural studies, minimizing time and economic costs.

AB  - Climate change being in the verge of all discussions points most of its focus on the change in the snow cover area which leads to increase in sea surface level in the long term and sometimes flood like scenario in the short term. So monitoring the snow areas with respect to time is a must to understand the effects of climate change more closely. This work demonstrate the application of Feature Oriented Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), also called as "Crosta technique" [1]. FPCA is a multivariate statistical technique used to transform the set of relatively correlated spectral bands of Landsat 8 to uncorrelated Principal Components. The statistical interpretation of the loadings of the SWIR wavelength band (sensitive to snow/glacier) in different PCs were used to generate a snow/glacier color composite image (Crosta image) of the Teesta river basin, Sikkim, India.

TI  - PUBLIC PREVENTION PLANS TO MANAGE CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESPIRATORY ALLERGIC DISEASES. INNOVATIVE MODELS USED IN CAMPANIA REGION (ITALY): THE TWINNING ARIA IMPLEMENTATION AND THE ALLERGY SAFE TREE DECALOGUE
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE AT UNISA
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, climate change has been influenced by air pollution, and this destructive combination has justifiably sounded an alarm for nations and many institutional bodies worldwide. Official reports state that the emission of greenhouse gases produced by human activity are growing, and consequently also the average temperature. The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that health effects expected in the future due to climate change will be dramatic, and has invited international groups to investigate potential remedies. A task force has been established by the Italian Society of Allergology, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC), with the aim to actively work on correlation between pollution and climate change. The Task Force provided prevention tools to suggest city leaders how to improve the health conditions of allergic people in public urban parks. The "Allergy Safe Tree Decalogue" suggests the preparation and maintenance of public low allergy-impact greenery. Through the Twinning ARIA project, the Division for the Promotion and Enhancement of Health Innovation Programs of Campania Region (Italy), sought to promote the implementation of the project in the regional Health System. The main objective will be to investigate the current use and usefulness of mobile phone Apps in the management of allergic respiratory disease, through Mobile Airways Sentinel networK (MASK), the Phase 3 of the ARIA initiative, based on the freely available MASK App (the Allergy Diary, Android and iOS platforms). The effects of these prevention activities will be registered and compared with monitoring efforts thanks to the Aerobiology Units, located throughout the Campania area. A joint effort between researchers and public administrations for the implementation of prevention plans coherently with the two models proposed in a specific area, i.e. the Decalogue for public administrations and the MASK Allergy Diary app for individual patients suffering from allergy, will be implemented as a pilot.

AB  - The present study aims to assess agricultural drought using remote sensing based NDVI and soil moisture products in a drought prone river basin of India. The study is conducted in the Ghataprabha river basin which is a sub basin of river Krishna, in India and is agriculturally dominated. Major portion of the basin is semiarid and rainfall is the major sources of water for agriculture. Gridded soil moisture data from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) from 1980 to 2015 is considered to derive Standardized Soil moisture Index (SSI) at different time scales. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) was calculated from MODIS NDVI products from 2000-2013. The results of VCI and SSI indicated significant number of drought episodes during the study period while severe agricultural drought was observed during 2001-2003. A Good agreement between SSI and VCI was observed during drought year.

AB  - Over the last decade, many snowpack parameter retrieval algorithms utilizing C- and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been proposed. These algorithms are capable of retrieving snow density and snow wetness accurately, but not Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). In this paper, a novel approach of SWE estimation is proposed based on TerraSAR-X full-polarimetric data. A unique relationship between the extinction coefficient of the snowpack and snow wetness is built and verified with field data. This relationship enables the retrieval of Snow Depth (SD) and SWE using existing snow density algorithm and volume scattering power. The validation of SD and SWE is carried out with near-real-time ground truth measurements. The accuracy assessment for SD showed Mean Absolute (MAE) and Root Mean Squared (RMSE) Errors of 15 cm and 16 cm, respectively. On the other hand, SWE retrievals resulted in MAE and RMSE of 22.7 mm and 30 mm, respectively.

TI  - The circles of culture in child education: building dialogical pedagogical practices
T2  - EDUCACAO
M3  - Review
AB  - This article presents the results of a survey conducted with 5-year-old children in a municipal pre-school in Santo Andre/SP. It is a research of intervention, whose objective was to construct a pedagogical practice dialogic from the circles of culture proposed by Paulo Freire. It assumes that children read and communicate the world from the moment they are born through multiple languages. However, in an adultcentric and grafocentric society such as the Brazilian, their voices end up being silenced in the different instances of socialization, among them the educational ones. The research problematized the silencing imposed on the children and the urgency to listen to them, having as theoretical reference the studies of Paulo Freire in interlocution with researchers of the childhood. The intervention took place from the circles of culture, with the theme generator gender relations, since this theme was recurrent among children and given its relevance to the heteronormative society. The results show that children's reading of the world is imbued with their everyday experiences, where in a dynamic movement they appropriate, confront and rename culture. In the collective, through the circles, they put in debate their worldview on the subject, which made it possible to rethink the binary opposition to the social roles attributed to men and women. This reveals the power of working with circles of culture with children, showing that an educational practice marked amorousness and dialogue opens the way to a critical-liberating education.

AB  - Glaciers are an important part of Earth ' s surface and play an important role in oceanology and climatology. Nowadays, in a changing climate it is necessary to monitor a glacier's stay. For a large glacier area, satellite data is used, and for small areas or important parts of a glacier, other techniques can be used. It means, for example, photogrammetry, GNSS or the new RPAS (remotely piloted aircraft system) technology. RPAS measurements should be focused on the movement of a glaciers face. In this project, two different RPAS types (winged drone and multicopter) were tested in Greenland and in Iceland during the last two years. The second technology used for glacier movement detection was satellite images - in this case SAR and InSAR measurement. Satellite data were tested on an inland glacier area and the movement was based on the installation of four corner reflectors directly on a monitored area in western Greenland. TerraSAR-X data were used. First, four acquisitions were performed in 2015, directly after corner reflector installation, then two acquisitions in 2017. The project experience and results are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Education of the scientific worldview within the context of national and international regulatory documents is discussed. Based on the study of theoretical concepts and practical experience, the author argues that public libraries contribute to educating and developing scientific worldview in the young people. The need for organizational instruments to build science literacy essential due to conceptual, political, economical, educational transformations in the social life, is substantiated. The author suggests to introduce modern formats, e.g. lectures, master classes, visual presentations, conferences and workshops in technics, the natural and engineering sciences. The libraries, museums, academic and educational institutions have to partner to excite young population's interest toward scientific knowledge to make them taking informed decision when choosing a profession.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with an important period in priest Pavel Florensky's life, when all his fundamental religious, philosophical, and theological conceptios were formed. The beginning of this period is associated with a deep internal crisis experienced by Florensky in 1899. His memoirs and correspondence of 1900-1904 reveal the essence of this crisis, which consists of two main aspects, i.e. the belief in the inferiority (non-viability) of the scientific worldview that excludes religion, and an experience of certain internal irrational processes manifesting themselves in fear, mental and spiritual disorder. Both these aspects were reasons for Florensky's religious conversion. He perceived religion. first of all, as a means of establishing an internal existential "order" in man. In this regard, the article draws attention to the special importance for Florensky of his acquaintance with works of Vladimir Solovyev and to the significance of his personal communication with Boris Bugaev (Andrey Bely) and Vyacheslav Ivanov. The article reveals the reason why Florensky first developed critical attitude to some views of Solovyev and studies in detail the process of Florensky's dealing with the "historical" Orthodox church in Russia. Based on the facts collected, a conclusion is made that Florensky found accord with his internal condition in Andrey Bely's emotions and in Vyacheslav Ivanov's works. This being said, his discord with A. Bely was due not only to his communication with D. Merezhkovslcy and to his later fondness for anthroposophy, but rather to the discrepancy in the understanding of the significance of mysteries (sacraments) in human life and in overcoming the internal and global crisis. In this regard, Vyacheslav Ivanov came to be almost unanimous with Florensky. In his conception of "homo liturgius", Florensky processed and developed in a creative way Vyacheslav Ivanov's ideas, according to which the personal internal crisis and its consequences can be overcome by those means and instruments that have been developed in the religious cult in the course of the history of humankind.

M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeAim of the present analysis was to evaluate the movement and dose variability of the different lymph node levels of node-positive breast cancer patients during adjuvant radiotherapy(RT) with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH).MethodsThirty-five consecutive node-positive breast cancer patients treated from October 2016 to February 2018 receiving postoperative RT of the breast or chest wall including RNI of the supra-/infraclavicular lymph node levels (corresponding to levelsIV, III, Rotter LN (interpectoral), and some parts of levelII) were analyzed. To evaluate the lymph node level movement, acenter of volume (COV) was obtained for each lymph node level for free-breathing (FB) and DIBH plans. Geometric shifts and dose differences between FB and DIBH were analyzed.ResultsAsignificant movement of the COV in anterior(y) and cranial(z) dimensions was observed for lymph node levelsI-II and Rotter lymph nodes (p<0.001) due to DIBH. Only minor changes in the lateral dimension (xaxis) were observed, without reaching significance for levelsIII, IV, and internal mammary. There was asignificant difference in the mean dose of levelI (DIBH vs. FB: 38.2Gy/41.3Gy, p<0.001) and levelII (DIBH vs. FB: 45.9Gy/47.2Gy, p<0.001), while there was no significant difference in levelIII (p=0.298), levelIV (p=0.476), or internal mammary nodes (p=0.471).ConclusionAsignificant movement of the axillary lymph node levels was observed during DIBH in anterior and cranial directions for node-positive breast cancer patients in comparison to FB. The movement leads to asignificant dose reduction in levelI and levelII.

AB  - The Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) that will fly aboard Landsat 9 has undergone pre-launch spectral characterization to demonstrate that its spectral response requirements will be met with few waivers. The test was conducted both at the subsystem level and, after upgrading the test setup and improving the alignment methodology, at instrument-level as well. This work reviews these upgrades and alignment methodology that contributed to a reduction in spectral response uncertainties to a relatively small value relative to the overall TIRS-2 radiometric uncertainty requirements. The spectral response results show an increase in signal to noise ratio and reference detector stability from subsystem-level to instrument-level measurements. Spectral response testing is part of a comprehensive pre-launch test program that ensures TIRS-2 will achieve the performance necessary for a variety of environmental applications.

AB  - The literary representation of metamorphosis through a curse, or 'involuntary' shapeshifting, is found in both the Early Medieval Irish and Old Norse narrative traditions. Both show similarities with a wider worldview of the soul, the body, and transformation in general, and both, surprisingly, adhere to the tropes found in contemporary Christian thinking and writing. By examining the literary evidence, presenting cases of curses, as well as deliberate self-cursing, the study analyses the individual texts and attempts to place them in a wider context of philosophical and Christian ideas of the medieval period.

AB  - A comprehensive cohort study including an entomological surveillance component can contribute to our knowledge of clinical aspects and transmission patterns of arbovirosis. This article describes the implementation of a populational-based birth cohort study that included an entomological surveillance component, and its associated challenges in a low-income community of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The participants were recruited in two periods: from 2012 to 2014, and from 2015 to 2017 The children had scheduled pediatric consultations and in case of fever. Epidemiological, clinical data and biological samples were collected at pediatric visits. Active febrile surveillance was performed by telephone calls, social networking, message apps, and household visits. A total of 387 newborns and 332 new children were included during the first and second recruitment periods, respectively. By July 2017, there were 451 children on follow-up. During the study, 2,759 pediatric visits were performed: 1,783 asymptomatic and 976 febrile/rash consultations. The number of febrile or rash consultations increased 3.5-fold after the use of media tools for surveillance. No temporal pattern, seasonality or peak of febrile cases was observed during the study period. A total of 10,105 adult mosquitoes (including 3,523 Aedes spp. and 6,582 Culex quinquefasciatus) and 46,047 Aedes eggs were collected from households, schools, and key sites. Although challenging, this structured sentinel populational-based birth cohort is relevant to the knowledge of risks and awareness of emerging pathogens.

AB  - UVB radiation refers to ultraviolet (UV) with wavelength ranging from 280nm to 320nm and plays a major role in vitamin D synthesis, plant growth, and human health. In this article, erythemal weighted UVB irradiance (UVER) is modeled on the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) stations based on the relationship with solar zenith angel (SZA), clearness index (Kt), and ozone (O-3). Two models are established, one of which can be used when the O-3 information is missing (Model I) and the other one (Model II) takes O-3 into consideration. Verification indicates both Model I and Model II show good performance on Fort Peck, Montana with tiny mean bias error (MBE), within +/- 0.2%, while Model II performs more stable when verified on all SURFRAD stations, with smaller MBE (-1.61%) and root mean square error (RMSE). By using MODIS downward shortwave radiation (DSR) as model input, a UVER product with a resolution of 5kmx5km can be obtained. The MBE of this product on SURFRAD stations is 0.82% and 2.85% for the instantaneous and 3-hour estimation, respectively. And similar result can be obtained on stations of UVB monitoring and research program (UVMRP) maintained by U.S. department of agriculture. Erythemal daily dose (EDD) is further calculated from the hourly UVER product, and the result corresponds to that from measurement within +/- 10% bias in 33 out of total 35 stations and within +/- 5% bias in 18 stations. In addition, comparison with OMI product OMUVBd shows that our result corresponds the ground measurements better.

AB  - This paper is devoted to the study of the possibilities of restoring the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) in fresh waterbodies using the images of Sentinel-2 / MSI of the Gorky reservoir as an example, validated via the high-resolution ground-truth data obtained by fluorescence lidar UFL. This water area in the period of intense chromaticity of cyanobacteria is distinguished by their completely heterogeneous spatial-temporal distribution with scales of patchiness from several tens of meters and high temporal variability. For this reason, direct methods of "spot" measurements in place on water samples in a small part of the reservoir for 3 hours relative to the satellite's span do not provide us with reliable and statistically proved data. In this regard, the work proposed an original method of high-performance sub-satellite synchronous measurements of the brightness of the water column, concentrations of Chl-a and TSM with a fluorescent lidar onboard a high-speed vessel. This technique is provided with a spatial (8 m) and a temporary (1 s) resolution. Based on this, 4 independent regional models for the recovery of Chl-a concentrations, as well as TSM were developed based on in-situ measurements of the brightness of the water surface, or from Sentinel-2 / MSI images. To ensure the possibility of using satellite images, the analysis of atmospheric correction algorithms was performed and the best one was determined. The proposed models can be used for regular environmental monitoring of the Gorky Reservoir according to the in-situ ship measurements of the brightness of the water surface or from Sentinel-2 / MSI images. When using the proposed methodology for lidar high-performance collection of sub-satellite data, the developed models can be adapted for limnological monitoring of other freshwater bodies with high spatial and temporal variability of the optical properties of water.

AB  - This study addresses the use of Sentinel-1 data for innovative improvements of automatic classic ship detection detection chains. Firstly, we propose to extract the complex coherence from the two polarization channels and to perform the vessel detection the vessels in this domain. A comparative assessment between the use of the complex coherence and the intensity images together with AIS validation demonstrates that the fusion of the different results allows to reduce the number of false alarms while maintaining an optimal detection rate. Secondly, we propose to make use of Sentinel-1 time series in order to delineate the coastline which is an essential parameter for ship detection chains. Experimental results are conducted on Sentinel-1 images acquired in different areas of interest for maritime surveillance such as the Gulf of Califoria (Mexico) or the English Channel.

AB  - Sentinel-2 satellites are now acquiring images of the entire Earth every five days from 10 to 60 m spatial resolution. The supervised classification of this new optical image time series allows the operational production of accurate land cover maps over large areas. In this paper, we investigate the use of one year of Sentinel-2 data to map the state of Victoria in Australia. In particular, we produce two land cover maps using the most established and advanced algorithms in time series classification: Random Forest (RF) and Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TempCNN). To our knowledge, these are the first land cover maps at 10 m spatial resolution for an Australian state.

AB  - Satellite image time series (SITS) have proven to be essential for accurate and up-to-date land cover mapping over large areas. Most works about SITS have focused on the use of traditional classification algorithms such as Random Forests (RFs). Deep learning algorithms have been very successful for supervised tasks, in particular for data that exhibit a structure between attributes, such as space or time. In this work, we compare for the first time RFs to the two leading deep learning algorithms for handling temporal data: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNNs). We carry out a large experiment using Sentinel-2 time series. We compare both accuracy and computational times to classify 10,980 km(2) over Australia. The results highlights the good performance of TemCNNs that obtain the highest accuracy. They also show that RNNs might be less suited for large scale study as they have higher runtime complexity.

AB  - A new methodology is suggested for forecasting crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (also referred to as potential evapotranspiration ETp) by combining VIS-NIR satellite images and numerical weather forecasts. The methodology is proposed for farms where a reliable weather station is operating for assessing current reference evapotranspiration according to FAO Penman-Monteith equation (ET0-PM). Measured weather data are exploited for correcting systematic errors in weather forecasts and for locally calibrating Hargreaves-Samani (HS) equation for estimating the reference ET (ET0-HS). VIS-NIR crop images and current weather conditions are employed for updating a crop coefficient (K-c), analytically derived as the ratio of crop potential evapotranspiration computed with the Penman-Monteith equation (ETP-PM) and ET0-PM. Crop parameters in ETP-PM are assessed by means of albedo and LAI, both retrieved from VIS-NIR images. ETP forecasts are then computed with the HS formula by the product ETP-HS=Kc.ET0-HS. The methodology was applied to two experimental farms in Southern Italy, by employing COSMO-LEPS numerical weather forecasts, LANDSAT 8 and DEIMOS-1 VIS-NIR images. ETP-HS forecasts resulted to be more accurate and precise than ETP-PM forecasts. Differently from ETP-PM forecasts, ETP-HS relies only on temperature forecasts, which are generally less uncertain than the forecasts of the other atmospheric variables, which are required for computing ETP-PM.

AB  - This paper presents a novel change detection scheme for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series, named Pattern Mining by Change Matrix Analysis (PMCMA). This scheme involves three steps: 1) change detection in SAR time series via the statistic of change matrix; 2) change matrix clustering by the simultaneous clustering and model selection (SCAMS) algorithm; 3) change pattern classification using the clustering results of change matrices. The procedure is executed with an automatic clustering algorithm and does not require the default number of clusters. The proposed approach is tested on two SAR time series of 12 TerraSAR-X images acquired from September, 2013 to October, 2014 over the Shanghai, China. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed PMCMA scheme.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method to detect urban changes in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images by using optimal transport distance (OTD) as the measurement of dissimilarity. First, the multichannel logarithm with Gaussian denoising (MuLoG) scheme is used to efficiently suppress the speckles of the SAR images. The despeckled images are then segmented into superpixels by the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm (SLIC). After that, the difference map is obtained via the use of Gaussian mixture model and OTD. Finally, change detection results are obtained by the generalized Kitler and Illingworth (GKI) thresholding algorithm. Experimental results on TerraSAR-X images over urban areas show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - [Purpose]To take the advantages of a variety of remote sensing data, the application of remote sensing image classification is a very important choice. Remote sensing image classification is large in computing capacity and time-consuming, and with the development of modern remote sensing technology, the amount of various remote sensing data obtained is getting larger and larger, the issue of how to fuse remote sensing image quickly and accurately and of getting useful information is becoming more and more urgent especially in some remote sensing applications such as disaster monitoring, prevention and relief, etc. In this paper, in order to fuse remote sensing image quickly and accurately, a parallel classification algorithm of multi-spectral image and panchromatic image based on wavelet transform is proposed.[Methods] In the method, based on parallel computing, the low-frequency components of wavelet decomposition are fused with the classification rule based on the feature matching, and the high-frequency components of wavelet decomposition are fused with the classification rule based on the sub-region variance. Then the low-frequency components and the high-frequency components after classification are processed with the inverse wavelet transform, and the fused image is obtained. According to the statistical characteristics of SAR images and the semantics of fuzzy neural networks analysis, an efficient image segmentation method based on Deep Learning Semantic analysis and wavelet transform is proposed to achieve precision of classification.[Results] The experiment results show that the proposed method can get better classification results and faster computing speed for multi-spectral image and panchromatic image. Originality. In the proposed classification algorithm of multi-spectral image and panchromatic image, wavelet transform and different proper classification rules for low-frequency components and high-frequency components of wavelet decomposition are used. To get a high speed, parallel computing is also taken in some complex parts of the proposed classification algorithm. Thus, better classification results and faster computing speed are obtained. [Conclusions] Practical value. The experiments have proved that the proposed algorithm can quickly get good classification results for remote sensing images, and it is useful in remote sensing applications in some aspects such as disaster monitoring, prevention and relief, Hybrid parallel Computing method for tasks and data (Pixels) etc.

AB  - Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Rice usually grows in tropical and subtropical areas where are usually rainy and cloudy. Under this weather condition, optical remote sensing has a great limitation, but the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) runs well. This paper utilized C band multi-temporal Radarsat-2 data, which is acquired in 2016, to extract quad-polarized backscattering coefficients, Cloude-Pottier and Freeman-Durden decomposition parameters for establishing classification features. Random forest (RF) algorithm was employed as the classifier. The Overall Accuracy (OA) is 82.9% when only the data on May 15th was used. After adding the data on July 26th, the OA increased to 88.8%. Then, the variable importance was estimated by using out-of-bag (OOB) data. The results indicate that using RF would effectively identify the ground objects in the rice planting area.

AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar tomography (Pol-TomoSAR) allows to achieve a 3-D characterization over urban areas using multiple polarimetric acquisitions. However, using spaceborne datasets, such as TerraSAR-X, it is difficult to localize the distributed or uncorrelated scattering patterns along elevation due to the temporal decorrelation. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper proposes polarimetric correlation tomographic techniques based on Tandem-mode images. The key of this technique is to build a covariance matrix from the observed Tandem coherence pairs, and then apply conventional covariance-based tomographic techniques. This processing allows to extract both coherent and distributed scatterers. The resulting 3-D reconstruction is more refined and detailed, compared to the one derived from TerraSAR-X data. Seven TSX/TDX pairs in fully polarimetric mode over a small county in Yunnan province, China, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for the characterization of urban environments.

TI  - Estimating Total Leaf Chlorophyll Content of Gannan Navel Orange Leaves Using Hyperspectral Data Based on Partial Least Squares Regression
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to model the total leaf chlorophyll content (LCC<sub>tot</sub>) of Gannan navel orange leaves using a field imaging spectroscopy system in the visible and near-infrared domain. The spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm with 176 wavebands (a wavelength interval of 3.41 nm) or 360 wavebands (a wavelength interval of 1.67 nm), labeled as Datasets1.67 and Datasets3.41, respectively, were used. Although different spectral data types were used, better prediction results for LCC<sub>tot</sub> were based on Datasets1.67 for LCC<sub>tot</sub> prediction. Several prediction models of LCC<sub>tot</sub> were built based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANN), ordinary least squares regression (OLSR), and stepwise linear regression (SLR) using full spectral and effective wavelength (EW) data (raw spectral (RS), first derivative spectral (FDS) and second derivative spectral (SDS) data). The determination coefficient (R-2), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the residual predictive deviation (RPD) were used to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the predicted LCC<sub>tot</sub> values. As a result, 14 (7 obtained from Datasets1.67, 7 obtained from Datasets3.41), 39 (21 obtained from Datasets1.67, 18 obtained from Datasets3.41) and 50 (27 obtained from Datasets1.67, 23 obtained from Datasets3.41) wavebands were selected from the RS data, FDS data and SDS data, respectively, as the EWs for LCC<sub>tot</sub> prediction of navel orange leaves. After that, PLSR and ANN predictive models were established using full spectra, and OLSR and SLR predictive models were built using the selected EWs. The experimental results demonstrated that these various regression methods were useful for estimating LCC<sub>tot</sub> in the order of PLSR models established using full spectra from RS data (F-RS-PLSR) PLSR models established using full spectra from SDS data (F-SDS-PLSR) PLSR models established using full spectra from FDS data (F-FDS-PLSR) SLR models established using EWs by RS data (EWs-RS-SLR). However, models built with ANN and OLSR, where the RPD values were less than 3, cause the models to be inaccurate. Finally, in comparison, the F-RS-PLSR model exhibited the best performance of LCC<sub>tot</sub> estimation; with the number of principal components (Pcs) 5, this model provided high values of the R-2 of calibration (C-R-2) 0.92 and the R-2 of validation (V-R-2) 0.96, small values of the RMSE of calibration (C-RMSE)0.05 mg/g and the RMSE of validation (V-RMSE) 0.19 mg/g, and sufficient the RPD of calibration (C-RPD)17.00 and the RPD of validation (V-RPD)3.63 values. Overall, the best modeling method was PLSR. Hence, the PLSR applicability for assessing chlorophyll content in navel orange leaves was demonstrated.

AB  - The Po Plain (Italy) is a complex mixture of urban and rural landscapes. Between Lombardy and Piedmont, the rural zone includes the largest rice crop area in Europe, accounting for 40% and 90% of the European and Italian rice production, respectively. The monitoring of this crop system is important by both environmental and economic points of view, because of its impacts on ecosystems, society and markets. In particular, the near real time (NRT) provision of information about crop status at farm scale is relevant for different players (i.e. farmers, consultants, policy makers, insurance companies). In this study, a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), implemented for the provision and dissemination of NRT crop status information, is presented. These information, derived from very high resolution satellite imagery, can be helpful to support loss adjusters in their workflows. The SDI architecture is designed as a seamless solution from satellite data download to presentation of added value information, which are retrieved and displayed on a mobile device, directly in the field.

AB  - We exploit large DInSAR and GPS datasets to create a 4D image of the magma transfer processes at Mauna Loa volcano from 2005 to 2015. The datasets consists of 23 continuous GPS time series and 307 SAR images acquired from ascending and descending orbits by ENVISAT and COSMO-SkyMed satellites. The joint use of SAR data acquired from different orbits together with deformation data from GPS networks and geological information can significantly improve the constraints on the geometry and location of the sources responsible for the observed deformation. The analysis of these datasets has been realized using an innovative method that allows to image a complex configuration of different type of sources. The results suggest that the deformation pattern observed from 2005 to 2015 has been controlled by three deformation sources: the ascent of magma along a conduit, the opening of a dike and the slip along the basal decollement.

TI  - Performance of the SSEBop model in the estimation of the actual evapotranspiration of soybean and bean crops
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of the operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) model in the estimation of the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of soybean and bean crops irrigated by a central pivot. The model estimates were obtained from digital images of the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites, and were compared with the ETa obtained by the Bowen ratio method. The model was evaluated by the refined agreement index (dr), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE). The model's performance in the estimation of the ETa was classified by the performance index (Pi). The relationship between the estimates of the model and the Bowen ratio method showed correlation (r=0.94) and agreement (dr=0.82), with a mean square error of 0.62 mm per day and a mean bias error of 0.04 mm per day. The estimate perfomance of the SSEBop model in comparison with the Bowen ratio method, was classified as optimal (Pi=0.77), proving the SSEBop usability and precision to estimate ETa for irrigated crops, such as soybean and bean.

TI  - Mapping land uses/covers with Semi-automatic Classification Plugin: which data set, classifier and sampling design?
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aimed to suggest guidelines to better map land uses using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) for QGIS, highlighting which the best data sets, classifiers and training sampling designs. Four data sets from a Sentinel 2A image were combined with three classifiers available in the SCP, and two sampling designs: separate or dissolved training samples (ROI's) in a single sample, obtaining 24 treatments. The treatments were evaluated regarding the accuracy (Kappa coefficient), visual quality of the final map and processing time. The results suggest that: (1) the SCP is suitable to map land uses; (2) the larger the data set, the better the classifier performance; and (3) the use of dissolved ROI always decreases processing time, but has an ambiguous effect on the different classifiers. In order to get better results, we recommend to apply the Maximum Likelihood classifier on the largest data set available, using training samples that cover all possible intraclass variations, subsequently dissolved in a single ROI.

TI  - How Effective Is Super-Resolution to Improve Dense Labelling of Coarse Resolution Imagery?
T2  - 2019 32ND SIBGRAPI CONFERENCE ON GRAPHICS, PATTERNS AND IMAGES (SIBGRAPI)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 32nd SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) / Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR)
CL  - Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL
AB  - Coarse resolution remote sensing images, such as LANDSAT and MODIS are easily found in public open repositories and, therefore, are widely used in many studies. But their use for automatic creation of thematic maps is very restrict since most of the deep-based semantic segmentation (a.k.a dense labelling) approaches are only suitable for subdecimeter data. In this paper, we design a straightforward framework in order to evaluate the effectiveness of deep-based super-resolution in the semantic segmentation of low-resolution remote sensing images. We carried out an extensive set of experiments on three remote sensing datasets with distinct nature/properties. The results show that super-resolution is effective to improve semantic segmentation performance on low-resolution aerial imagery. It not only outperforms unsupervised interpolation but also achieves semantic segmentation results comparable to high-resolution data.

TI  - Calibration and validation of algorithms for the estimation of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration and Secchi depth in inland waters with Sentinel-2
T2  - LIMNETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi disk depth are two of the most important biophysical parameters used to assess water quality and determine the ecological state of inland waters. The Ocean Color 2 and Dall'Olmo three-band algorithms were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration and the calibration of the ratio 490/705 nm was used to produce an algorithm for estimating Secchi disk depth. These algorithms have been calibrated for the Sentinel 2-Multispectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and validated using in situ measurements of chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth and radiometry. This data was taken in the Valencia region reservoirs as part of the project Ecological Status of Aquatic Systems with Sentinel Satellites (ESAQS). The results show that for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration, it is better to apply a prior classification based on their trophic status. For eutrophic and hypertrophic waters, the TBDO algorithm had an error of 23 mg/m(3) over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 10 to 169 mg/m(3). For ultraoligotrophic to mesotrophic waters, the better algorithm was OC2_490, which resulted in an error equal to 0.9 mg/m(3) over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 0.54 to 5.8 mg/m(3). For the estimation of water transparency by Secchi disk depth, we have obtained good results with the ratio 490/705 nm, with an error equal to 0.88 m over a Secchi disk depth range of between 0.26 to 8.1 m. These algorithms have been applied to S2-MSI images and satisfactory results have been obtained for different reservoirs in the Valencia region (Spain).

AB  - The paper deals with opportunities of remote probing as a method to assess the environmental condition of hard-to-reach areas. The dynamics of changing the condition of the vegetation cover of anthropogenically disturbed areas of the Tomsk region under conditions of the negative impact of oil recovery was investigated using freely distributed satellite MODIS images of medium spatial resolution. Vegetation cover condition was assessed according to the value of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Condition dynamics for vegetation cover in the vegetation season was analysed over the 9-year period from 2010 to 2018. The work stepwise stated the processing algorithm of satellite data using geographic information system ArcGis 10.2.2. Analysis was performed for NDVI values of the background territory of the Oglatsky wildlife reserve and five territories of oil and gas fields in the Tomsk region. The latter include Luginets, Olenie, Lomovoye, Katylginsky, and West Katylginsky fields. As determined, the trend of changing index values for all investigated areas is single-type: high and minimum magnitudes in 2016 and 2012, respectively. As demonstrated by the analysis of the dynamics of changing average NDVI values during vegetation, there are improved but significantly reduced NDVI magnitudes in all investigated areas from 2012 to 2016 and 2016 to 2018, respectively.

AB  - The use of satellite data for analyzing the dynamics of values of vegetation indices for vegetation of inaccessible territories of oil and gas fields of the Tomsk Oblast is considered. Satellite data are used to calculate the time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which is a modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with reduced sensitivity to atmospheric conditions. To analyze the EVI change, MOD13Q1 data with a spatial resolution of 250 m for the period from 2007 to 2017 are used. The average EVI values are calculated for the sites of five hydrocarbon deposits in the Tomsk Oblast: Archinskoye, Shinginskoye, Zapadno-Ostaninskoye, Yuzhno-Tabaganskoye, and Kazanskoye. The analysis of the dynamics of changes in average EVI values allows to determine the minimal and maximal values of the index for the sites under study, as well as to identify a trend of an increase in its values, which suggests a good non-depressed state of vegetation and an improvement in the ecological situation of the territories under study.

TI  - Precipitable water vapor over oceans from the Maritime Aerosol Network: Evaluation of global models and satellite products under clear sky conditions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present results from an evaluation of precipitable water vapor (W) over remote oceanic areas as derived from global reanalysis models and from satellites against observations from the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) for cloudless skies during the period of 2004-2017. They cover polar, mid latitude and tropical oceanic regions and represent a first effort to use MAN observations for such evaluation. The global reanalysis model products evaluated in this study are from the Modem Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA I), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) model. The satellite products evaluated are from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POWER), the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2), the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY), and the Atmospheric Infra-red Sounder (AIRS). Satellite retrievals of W are based on the attenuation of solar reflected light by water vapor absorption bands, except those from AIRS that rely on brightness temperature measurements. A very good agreement is observed between the model estimates and MAN, with mean differences of similar to 5% and standard deviations of similar to 15%. These results are within the uncertainties associated with the models and the measurements, indicating the skill of the reanalysis models to estimate W over oceans under clear sky conditions. Mean differences of W between the satellite and MAN products are similar to 11, 6.7, 12, -7, and 3% for MODIS, POLDER, GOME-2, SCIAMACHY and AIRS respectively, while their standard deviations are 31, 29, 28, 20 and 17%. These differences reveal the need to address inconsistencies among different satellite sensors and ground based measurements to reduce the uncertainties associated with the retrievals.

AB  - Urban heat island is a condition when municipal area has warmer temperature than surrounding environment. High population and their activities inside the city can be the factors that trigger urban heat island. Indonesia has some large cities with big population. Jakarta and Surabaya are two largest and most populous cities in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of green areas on the urban heat island (UHI) in the two largest cities in Indonesia, Jakarta and Surabaya. In this study, the effect of urban heat island in those two cities will be compared using Landsat 8 data in the period of 2018. The correlation between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature were analyzed to investigate the influences of the green areas on the urban heat island. Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI) were also used for estimating the built up area as indicator of urban development. The result showed negative correlation between surface temperature and NDVI that indicates that the green open space can decrease urban heat island effect. The results also indicated that the decreasing of green area had significantly affected on the increasing of land surface temperature, which then it triggered the UHI phenomena in both two cities.

AB  - Several different indicators have been adopted to map shoreline evolution from remotely-sensed images, some of them are based on the identification of specific features (shoreline, dune foot, etc.), others concern specific vertical datum related to a given sea level. Tuscany Region adopted the 0 m elevation contour as proxy to monitor coastal evolution and surveys with traditional topographic instruments, at first, and with dGPS/GNSS, later, have been carried out since the mid 1980s.The need to frequently update this dataset and have synchronous measurements along the whole regional coast found answer in the methodology presented in this paper, which is based on the Pleiades images processing for a semiautomatic shoreline extraction. The 0 m elevation contour is postulated to be midway between the run-up and the run-down; the formers to be located at the contact between dry and wet sand, the latter where foam borders the beach under fair sea state.For the regional coast, where tidal range is within few decimetres, and for images acquired after several days from a storm, this indicator, easily retrieved from ad hoc processed satellite images, proved to be reliable.A comparison between manually drawn and semi-automatically extracted shorelines gave an accuracy of 0.14 m. Being the position of the so acquired shoreline affected by errors (e.g. pixel size, threshold identification, etc.) and influenced by physical factors (e.g. tide and swash zone slope) error analysis for the beach at Marina di Cecina was performed, giving a maximum value of +/- 1.8 m, which is considered acceptable for a regional monitoring.Dune foot position, which is less sensitive to short term beach variability, was retrieved as well and showed the same accuracy. Considering that, where tidal range is within few decimetres and under fair sea, 0 m elevation contour (which is the common reference for shoreline field detection through dGPS/GNSS) can be approximately set between the run up limit (wet/dry sand limit) and the run-down limit (approx. upper side of the beach step), we used the strip delimited by these two limits as the proxy for our shoreline, and defined it as a first approximation as the midline of this strip. A method in which the different data (in-situ, satellites) are processed as well as a quantitative validation of this method is presented. Errors that can occur derive from manual digitation, pixel error related to the image spatial resolution, and geometric error due to the orthorectification process. Nevertheless, results show average differences between EO data and survey data far below 1m, which is a good result in for regional scale monitoring purpose. The same analysis has been performed on coastal dunes proxy, using existing multi-temporal datasets.

TI  - THE CONFLICT OF VALUES AND THE VALUE OF CONFLICT IN N. HARTMANN'S ETHICS
T2  - HORIZON-FENOMENOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to analyze the problem of conflict of values in N. Hartman's ethics. According to Hartmann, 'the old ethics' related the concept of conflict to contradictions that arise between 'values' and 'anti-values.' This approach to moral values is associated with the problem of normative philosophical ethics. This article shows that Hartman privileged other types of conflicts of values that are more important for the existence of morality. Hartman notes that most of the various values can be reduced to a certain harmony of values. But there are values that are so contradictory in content that in specific situations they are fundamentally mutually exclusive. In such cases, it is not a conflict between the moral and immoral (value and anti-value), but between the moral and moral. In addition, there are conflicts that arise in the process of learning values. Each new conflict in life confronts a person with the need to make a moral decision and thus leads her to the comprehension of new values. Hartman believes that neither the particular man nor mankind has a conscious goal of learning values, but the whole history of mankind constitutes the process of discovery of moral values - be it within the limits of historical existence, or within the limits of a personal moral worldview. The article substantiates the idea that Hartmann's moral philosophy of formulates a fundamentally new notion for the history of ethics - namely, the notion of the conflict of values having a positive role to play in ethics.

AB  - Automated delineation of smallholder farm fields is difficult because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems. Edges between smallholder plots are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours have to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural patterns of the fields. We introduce a strategy to delineate field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalization and grouping algorithm to produce a hierarchical segmentation of the fields. We carry out an experimental analysis in a study area in Kofa, Nigeria, using a WorldView-3 image, comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The proposed strategy outperforms state-of-the-art computer vision methods and shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with an accuracy close to human level photo-interpretation.

AB  - Lemuru Bleeker, 1853 is one of the most commonly found species in pelagic fisheries in Bali Strait. Data from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra satellite remote sensing, collected over a period of nine years from 2007 to 2015, were used to observe the spatial relationship between lemuru catches, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the Bali Strait, Indonesia. The purpose of the study was to provide information about the spatial relationship between lemuru catches and both marine environmental parameters. Linear correlation analysis was carried out to determine the level of relationship with the restriction of the analysis of long-term and seasonal relationships. The results showed that during the year of observation, lemuru catches showed a declining trend. Lemuru catches showed a correlation with SST and chl-a concentration, as clearly indicated by high responses in DJF (December-January-February) and SON (September-October-November) months and unclear responses in MAM (March-April-Mei) months and JJA (June-July-August) months. In DJF, the spatial relationship between both marine environmental parameters and lemuru catches was high in the central part of the strait and in SON in the northwestern part of the strait.

TI  - Estimation of Irrigation Water Requirements at irrigation district level using MODIS evapotranspiration product

AB  - An accurate Soil Water Balance (SWB) assessment is a crucial tool to guarantee efficient and sustainable management of water resources in agriculture, especially in the context of limited water availability. However, developing an SWB over large areas (i.e. irrigation district, river basin) requires a large number of input data obtained from expensive and time-consuming field measurements. Remote sensing (RS) thus represents a valid source to retrieve the necessary biophysical vegetation's parameters useful for estimating the SWB's components.The main scope of this study is to set an operational large-scale SWB model, derived from an adaptation of FAO-56 model, and test its capacity to estimate the seasonal Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) using as input a combination of in-situ agrometeorological measurements and MODIS derived evapotranspiration and vegetation's parameters products. The SWB was assessed over the "Sinistra Ofanto" irrigation scheme (Italy), characterized by a semi-arid climate and an extremely fragmented and heterogeneous landscape with the presence of the most significant Mediterranean crops. The comparison of the estimated IWR with the water volumes provides by the Irrigation Consortium for the considerate two crop season (2015 and 2016) allows a first assessment about the SWB's performance. Though the moderate spatial resolution of MODIS products (500 meters), the comparison demonstrates as the prosed SWB procedure has a good capability to estimate the IWR volumes at irrigation district scale in a simple and cost-effective way. Moreover, the SWB proposed exploits only free of charge products and thus can be easily applied in other contexts characterized by similar agroclimatic conditions and limited field data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The present study aims at analyzing the role of spatial resolution in Ecosystem Functional Types (EFT) time series' patterns by comparing their spatial variability, retrieved at 300 m (MERIS products) and 30 m ( Landsat products) of spatial resolution, with time series of Fluxnet in situ measurements, such as gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET).EFT maps at both spatial resolutions for 2005 and 2009 year in Sudan study region were generated, with a classification system of 64 categories. However, the 50% of the study area was covered by four representative EFTs. The main result at fine spatial resolution, related to the 2005-2009 comparison, shows a clear pattern of vegetation with high productivity and low seasonality in both years. At coarse spatial resolution, EFTs located in shrublands or forests regions are more difficult to be clearly detected.The presented methodology is absolutely replicable for using Sentinel-2 (MSI) images and Lansat-8 ( OLI) in cases where the data availability of fluxnet database reaches the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 active period.

AB  - Visualizing inconsistencies among global agricultural land cover products using Google Earth Engine This map product demonstrates challenges associated with mapping global agriculture, particularly smallholder agriculture in areas where land use is mixed at fine spatial resolutions (Peter et al. 2018). In the case of Malawi, smallholder agriculture fields may be mixed with tree cover, barren land, housing structures, shrubs, and other land-cover types within a 500-m MODIS land-cover pixel. When subtle thresholds determine land-cover classifications, smallholder agricultural lands in Malawi can become completely missed by global land-cover products. The purpose of visualizing these data is to show that more research is needed regarding agricultural land classifications and that global-scale data require substantial attention for addressing local-scale problems.

TI  - Insights into retinoic acid deficiency and the induction of craniofacial malformations and microcephaly in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
T2  - GENESIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental malformations caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. FASD sentinel facial features are unique to the disorder, and microcephaly is common in severe forms of FASD. Retinoic acid deficiency has been shown to cause craniofacial malformations and microcephaly in animal models reminiscent of those caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Alcohol exposure affects the migration and survival of cranial neural crest cells, which are required for proper frontonasal prominence and pharyngeal arch development. Defects in craniofacial development are further amplified by the many downstream pathways that are transcriptionally controlled retinoic acid target genes, including Shh signaling. Recent evidence shows that alcohol exposure itself is sufficient to induce retinoic acid deficiency in the embryo. These data suggest that retinoic acid deficiency is an important underlying etiology of FASD. In disorders like Vitamin A Deficiency, FASD, DiGeorge (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome), CHARGE, Smith-Magenis, Matthew-Wood, and Congenital Zika Syndromes, evidence is accumulating to link reduced retinoic acid signaling with developmental defects like craniofacial malformations and microcephaly. Research focus on characterizing the effects of retinoic acid deficiency during early development and on understanding the downstream signaling pathways involved in aberrant head, and craniofacial development will reveal underlying etiologies of these disorders.

AB  - A study of the basement of Fennoscandia on magnetic and gravity anomalies has been carried out. There are detected magnetic and density features of the structure of the greenstone belts of the Early Precambrian crust of the Baltic Shield as a result of interpretation of CHAMP and GRACE satellite data and near surface magnetic anomalies. Magnetic and density sections have been constructed through the mega blocks of Fennoscandia with the age of the Earth's crust ranging from 3.2 to 1.6 billion years that underwent different stages of metasomatosis. There are detected magnetoactive layer in the basement of the Early Precambrian crust ("magnetite zone") and fluid systems at depths of 12-15 and 25-35 km that are the source of the formation of rich deposits of Fennoscandia greenstone belts. Based on the concept of the distribution of fluid supply flows, there are selected several areas promising for electromagnetic monitoring that can help to detail the features of the basement conductivity of the Baltic Shield.

TI  - Ontological Duality in Rock Poetry by Victor Tsoi (on Material of Song "In Our Eyes")
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article investigates the ontological duality as one of the important philosophical aspects of rock poetry by V. Tsoi. The importance of a philosophical interpretation of the rock text that embodies a worldview of its author is emphasized. It is shown that the text of the song "In Our Eyes" reflects the concept of being, various components of which are sometimes filled with opposite meanings; and yet they are logically combined, creating a complex philosophy of the lyrical hero. The attention is focused on the fact that ontological duality is represented at all levels of the artistic world of the song, including the level of lyrical hero, addressee, composition, but first of all - at the content and ideological level. It is noted that the text of the song "In Our Eyes" is in relationship with other works of the album "Blood Group," being an integral part of the overall metaphysical plot of the rock cycle. It is proved that the concept of ontological duality of human existence is formed in the text of the rock song; rock, the author seeks to solve the philosophical problem of choice, and a lyrical hero of the song is not afraid to confront the world and at the same time does not seek to destroy it, he is ready to take place in the world, while maintaining his uniqueness.

AB  - The characterization of snow conditions and the estimate of snowpack parameters have been investigated in this paper, by taking into account both C- and X-band SAR data collected from Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) satellites, respectively. Although C- and X-band are not the most suitable frequency for the retrieval of snow parameters due to the high penetration power inside snowpack, some results concerning the wet/dry snow status and both Snow Depth (SD) and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) estimate can be achieved by using appropriate algorithms and models.A sensitivity analysis was carried out by exploiting datasets of in situ measurements (snow depth, density, snow grain radius, temperature and wetness) collected on two test site in South Tyrol (Ulten Valley and Val Senales). This analysis provided indications on the sensitivity of C- and X-band backscattering to the target snow parameters. As a second step of the analysis, simulations based on the Dense Medium Radiative Transfer (DMRT) forward electromagnetic model have been considered for interpreting and assessing the experimental findings. Finally, an attempt of implementing a retrieval algorithm for estimating SWE from these frequencies is carried out. The algorithm is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The training of the algorithm accounts for experimental data and DMRT model simulations and, successively, it is applied to time series of CSK images collected on both test areas. The obtained results are encouraging, although more analysis and validation is needed for exploiting the potential of SAR in snow parameter retrieval.

AB  - Most remote sensing applications require atmospheric correction of satellite images and an increasing part exploits multi-temporal data. Sentinel-2 satellites and Landsat-8 provide almost equivalent satellite images and a joint use of both data sources gives the advantage of a denser time series if the quality of atmospheric correction is consistent. The present study investigates the performance of atmospheric correction processor ATCOR and shows, that it gives consistent results for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data enabling a combined use of both satellites. Both satellite sensors provide the same correct shape of surface reflection spectra.

CP  - Symposium on the History of Cartography on Mapping Asia - Cartographic Encounters Between East and West

AB  - The second half of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century saw the encroachment of foreign powers on China combined with internal political and socio-economic crises, revolts and power struggles. The subsequent reshuffle of territorial control against the backdrop of the so-called global condition challenged Chinese intellectuals to confront a new worldview as well as geographical ideas and techniques from other countries. They had to reassess and enhance their geographic and cartographic knowledge, include new geographies, and question China's position in the world. This process was accompanied by travel, study abroad, the translation of maps from other countries as well as the founding of Chinese geographical societies and the production of new Chinese maps. Based on Chinese cartographic images and atlases, this paper will examine visualizations of China in its place 'under heaven', as depicted on nineteenth-century maps of the tianxia (sic) variety, and cartographic representations of China and the world from the late Qing and Republican times, when China was in the process of reinventing and thus remapping itself. In addition, it will introduce some of the creators of these maps, whose biographies mirror intellectual and cartographic currents of their time.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are useful in protecting coastal lines, reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and providing shelters and foods for ecosystems, but they are among the top threatened habitats worldwide caused by human activities, climate change, and coastal-related natural disasters such as tsunami, flood, storm, etc. Understanding quantitative and spatial information of mangrove associations is essential for managing mangrove forests effectively. The main aim of this research is to investigate the changes of mangrove forest associations in tropical regions and possible reasons of changes via the case study of the Can Gio biosphere reserve in Viet Nam by using remote sensing datasets (SPOT 4 and 5 imagery), object-based image analysis and Support Vector Machine classifier. The classification results showed that the highest overall accuracy of this combination was 81.6%, given 420 reference objects, confirming the applicability of using remote sensing on assessing the development of mangrove forests. For the case study, we found that there was a decrease of the Avicennia alba - Sonneratia alba (Association I) area by 20.1% caused by the development of aquaculture and other human activities, but there was an increase of the Rhizophora apiculata (Association II) area by 34.8%. These trends may result in the exacerbated risk of soil erosion and make the region become more vulnerable to climate change and tropical storm events. Management policies should be revised to harmonise the benefits of economic development, environmental protection, and species diversity.

T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at developing a regional algorithm to quantify chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in the Thac Ba Reservoir surface-water using Landsat 8 imagery basing on in-situ data of Chla and above-water reflectance taken in both dry and rainy seasons 2018. In situ datasets obtained from 30 water sampling sites show a strong correlation (R-2=0.73) with the reflectance ratio of two Landsat 8 (L8) bands, the green band (band 3: B3) versus the red band (band 4: B4), B3/B4, by an exponential equation. The algorithm for estimating Chla using this ratio was well-matched up the validation using multiple-dates in-situ datasets (R-2 = 0.82; RMSE 5 %) and was then applied to L8 images level 2 acquired in both dry and rainy seasons to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of Chla over the reservoir. Obtained maps of Chla present clearly two trends: (1) Chla in the reservoir water in the dry season (averaged at 15.3 mg/m(3)) is relatively lower than those in the rainy season (averaged at 17.0 mg/m(3)); (2) In both seasons, Chla increased from water area in front of the Chay River mouth to the center of the reservoir. The algorithm and method outlined in this study could be applied to monitoring CM in other inland waters having similar features as the Thac Ba Reservoir water.

TI  - Soil Salinity Mapping Using SAR Sentinel-1 Data and Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms: A Case Study at Ben Tre Province of the Mekong River Delta (Vietnam)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity caused by climate change associated with rising sea level is considered as one of the most severe natural hazards that has a negative effect on agricultural activities in the coastal areas in most tropical climates. This issue has become more severe and increasingly occurred in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam. The main objective of this work is to map soil salinity intrusion in Ben Tre province located on the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band data combined with five state-of-the-art machine learning models, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN), Gaussian Processes (GP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forests (RF). For this purpose, 63 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 4-6 April 2018 corresponding to the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The performance of the five models was assessed and compared using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (r). The results revealed that the GP model yielded the highest prediction performance (RMSE = 2.885, MAE = 1.897, and r = 0.808) and outperformed the other machine learning models. We conclude that the advanced machine learning models can be used for mapping soil salinity in the Delta areas; thus, providing a useful tool for assisting farmers and the policy maker in choosing better crop types in the context of climate change.

AB  - Samut Songkhram is one province in Thailand which has coconut cultivation for domestic consumption and export abroad. However in the dry season, will be faced with the problem of using water due to the problem with sea water condition that raised, which the initial solution is to bring fresh water from the upper dams to push saltwater out of the area. Therefore, the data used of fresh water in the area, is important to water management in the upcoming crisis. Evalution of water requirement can assist the location of water demand in dry areas. Satellite data and ground data combined to estimate the volume of water needed. This research the assessment of water requirement for coconut cultivation is mainly aimed to determine the area of coconut growing through remote sensing technology with LANDSAT8 and assess the water demand in the coconut growing area. The result found, the area of coconut cultivation as 74876 Rai, where was analyzed by satellite data of Landsat8 with Supervised Classification method. The accuracy from interpreted data is 92 percent. The determination of water requirements for planting coconut were analyzed from the equation of Penman Monteith, average equal to 458,473,908 cubic meters. The value of Reference Crop Evapotranspiration average ETo is 3.80 mm / day and the coefficient of water use (Crop Coefficient) average Kc is 1.35. This research found the amount of coconut water needs in the early stages of growth with relatively little water demand and gradually increased, and there is no change in water usage.

AB  - Geometric calibration (GC) is a technique to compensate for the systematic errors in the imaging model of an optical satellite. The independent GC method without use of ground calibration site has been studied in recent years. In this paper, an integrated independent method aiming to the GC of stereo cameras aboard an optical satellite is presented. Supported by the satellite's stereo imaging ability, this method can overcome the strong correlation between the elevation error and camera GC accuracy, and get rid of the dependency on the constraints of ground elevation further. The real data collected by the stereo three-linear camera (TLC) of ZY-3 satellite was used to verify this method. The satisfactory GC accuracy better than 1 pixel indicated that the presented method effectively compensated for systematic errors, and improved the geometric quality of TLC images together.

Charles University, Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady. Prague.Methods: The study included women from prospective protocols LAP I and LAP II with cervical cancer stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion and stage IA2 from 2002 to 2018 classified according to FIGO 2014 staging, TNM 8. Detection of sentinel lymph nodes throughout this period was performed using ultra-short protocol with Tc and patent blau and also by histopathological examination.Results: In the first group (28 women) with stage IA1 and lymphovascular space invasion diagnosed from cone biopsy there were two women with positive lymph nodes (7.1%). In the group stage IA2 (34 women) there were 13 women (38.2%) with positive lymphovascular space invasion and two women had positive lymph nodes (5.9%). The risk of positive lymph nodes for stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion and for stage IA2 is not statistically significant OR = 0.8125 (95% CI 0.1070-6.172).Conclusion: The detection of sentinel lymph nodes aids to individualize the therapy of early stage cervical cancer and helps to reduce the radicalization of surgery. The risk of positive lymph nodes in stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion and stage IA2 with/without lymphovascular space invasion is the same. The results confirm, that the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion is fully indicated.

AB  - The evaluation of infrared satellite images over active lava flows assists the identification of potentially threatened areas and thereby the overall lava inundation hazard assessment. The estimation of the lava flow's size and temperature is not trivial as the lava occupies only a small fraction (< 1 %) of a typically resolved target pixel (e.g., from Landsat 7-ETM+; EOS-MODIS). Conventionally, this is solved by processing observations in at least two separate infrared spectral wavebands. We investigate the resolution limits of the Dual-Band (DB) method by means of a uniquely designed indoor analog experiment. A volcanic thermal anomaly is simulated by an electrical heating alloy of 0.5 mm diameter installed on a plywood panel. Satellite observations are simulated by two thermographic cameras with wavebands comparable to those available from satellite data. These range from the short-wave infrared (SWIR) over the mid-wave infrared (MIR) to the thermal infrared (TIR). In the conducted experiment, the hotspot's pixel fraction (p) was successively reduced by increasing the camera-to-target distance from 2 m (p = 41.7 %) to 38 m (p = 2.2 %). We carried out three experiments with different wire temperatures and compare different DB setups. In the case of the hottest wire (1019 K), the standard method gives relative deviations between the observed and theoretical hotspot area fractions below 16 % for about one third of the cases (i.e., distances).

AB  - According to the United Nations, 68% of the world's population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050. This makes urban growth one of the cornerstones of sustainable development policies that must be implemented from the outset. Well-managed urbanization is essential to minimize environmental degradation and land use, while maximizing the benefits of agglomeration and ensuring the expected well-being of all city dwellers. On the other hand, it is equally important that these growth dynamics interface systematically with ongoing climate change and its expected effects on the urban environment. Local climate regulation is a crucial urban ecosystem service as it directly affects the quality of urban life. Although its link with soil sealing and land-use change is theoretically known, it is worth explaining this relationship in terms of significant parameters of both altered surfaces and type of urban expansion.This paper simultaneously analyzes the artificial soils dynamics transformation and land surface temperatures (LST) time series derived by MODIS satellites in a study area, the Basilicata region, widely affected by urban sprinkling and a marked depopulation.Our results show a strong relationship between the increase in recorded minimum temperatures and the expansion of urban areas, especially where the main growth dynamic is compaction.

AB  - Evaluation indicators and parameters of land use and cover change have been drawing a significant attention as approaches for Sustainable Land Management (SLM), Sustainable Soil Management (SSM), Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), Conservation Agriculture (CA), Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) etc. increasingly progress to sustain and promote above and below-ground ecosystem services for human wellbeing. Most of the relevant models duly strive to improve their capability and propriety of assessing temporal-spatial cover change trend using remote sensing tools. Exclusively, from the perspective of different earth surface hydrological and erosional processes, not only over a period of years, rotational management systems of agricultural land require understanding of variations but within a year, as well. In this study, two different NDVI (Normalized Different Vegetation Index) metrics derived from satellite images of Pleiades 1A-1B and Spot-7 (NDVIsat and NDVIgm, respectively) and ground-measurements by hand-held crop sensor to obtain LAI (Leaf Area Index) were used to determine within a year variations occurred at different crop-stages of wheat and sunflower plots in semi-arid cropping systems in Turkey. Rough Fallow (Period F), Seedbed (Period SB), Establishment (Period 1 for sunflower), Development (Period 2 for wheat) and Maturing (Period 3) constituted measurement stages. In general, correlation analysis showed results from all three methodologies (NDVIsat, NDVIgm and LAO were highly correlated one another at each growth stage. Exceptionally, NDVIsat, NDVIgm and LAI were poorly correlated at Period 1 and Period 3, respectively, for sunflower and wheat. To a great extent this was ascribed to the fact that wheat photosynthetic activity inversely varied with its leaf area index at Period 3 and the fact that vegetation cover rate of sunflower showed kind of fluctuations that hindered a clear gradient to emerge in Period I. Also, the means of measurements of different growth stages for each research method were compared by ANOVA test, and all three methodologies statistically detected differences as the photosynthetic activity either increased or decreased among the wheat and sunflower growth stages with few exceptions. For instance, the LAI could not mark any significant difference between Period F and Period SB in wheat plots while NDVI-sat showed no statistically significant difference between Period F and Period 3 in sunflower. For either crops it was clearly observable from both satellite and ground measurements that the NDVI values increased as photosynthetic activity was approaching its maximum level, after which it decreased with the start of maturement; on the other hand, rather than photosynthetic activity, the LAI reached maximum values as the number and periphery of leave layers increased, which was much more notable for sunflowers. Consequently, study methods led to much clearer results for horizontally growing sunflower plots than those of wheat for all growth stages, suggesting that NDVIs can be used in combination with LAI to have cumulative totals of differences stemming from variances in both photosynthetic activity and leave periphery by growth stages.

AB  - Forest dynamics meet strong changes due to anthropogenic or natural causes. The first ones highlight the effects of deforestation, fragmentation and air pollution. Deforestation leads to the instability of forest environments, mostly the protected areas. For this study, we illustrate the linkage between deforested areas and protected forest area in Calimani Mountains, the fragmentation of forests and endanger of natural habitats, for animals, especially for big carnivores (bears, wolves and lynx). As a database, we used the Global Forest Change, from the Maryland University for 2001-2016. The results revealed significant deforested rates in the northern part of Calimani Mountains with cut-clear areas that influence the stability of forests and high fragmentation negatively. We showed inter-annual variabilities of deforested rates, and the highest was recorded in 2007 and 2012. The obtained results are essential for the forestry management and conservation of biodiversity.

T2  - International Journal of Oceans and Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - The western Arabian Sea is known for its intensive upwelling developed seasonally along the Omani coast as well as for numerous mesoscale eddies originating in and passing through waters with seasonally high or low primary productivity. The frequency of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy occurrence for the 13 year period (from 2002 to 2015) retrieved with 4-km spatial resolution from MODIS-Aqua sea surface height anomalies, and data on wind speed, atmospheric anomalies, geostrophic currents and landings of large pelagic species (Yellowfin tuna, Kingfish and others) were analyzed, in order to elucidate the interannual variability and statistical linkages between parameters. The linear increase of eddy occurrence over years was observed during intermonsoon seasons, against the background of decreasing wind speed and the kinetic energy of the main geostrophic flow. Along with that, a positive correlation between the number of eddies and the variation of fish catches was elucidated. Presumably, the increasing number of cyclonic eddies could mediate the variance of fish catches, making them less predictable over years. The mechanism of this link could be based on the impact of cyclonic eddies on the oxycline depth. Concentrations of dissolved oxygen less than 1.5-2.5 ml L-1 reportedly act as the hypoxic threshold for the Yellowfin tuna. An enhanced number of cyclonic eddies could generate more heterogeneous spatial distribution of threshold concentrations-by lifting them to the upper layers and creating an unfavorable environment for populations of large pelagic species.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - ISPRS Technical Commission III WG III/2, 10 Joint Workshop on Multidisciplinary Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring
CL  - Kyoto, JAPAN
AB  - The goal of this work is to assess a method for supporting decisions regarding identification of most suitable areas for two types of harvesting approaches in forestry: skyline vs. forwarder. The innovative aspect consists in simulating the choices done during the planning in forestry operations. To do so, remote sensing data from an aerial laser scanner were used to create a digital terrain model (DTM) of ground surface under vegetation cover. Features extracted from the DTM are used as input for several machine learning predictors. Features are slope, distance from nearest roadside, relative height from nearest roadside and roughness index. Training and validation is done using areas defined by experts in the study area. Results show a K value of almost 0.92 for the classifier with best results, random forest. Sensibility of each feature is assessed, showing that both distance and height difference from nearest road-side are more significant than overall DTM value.

AB  - In this work we test the power of prediction of deep learning for detection of buildings from aerial laser scanner point cloud information. Automatic extraction of built features from remote sensing data is of extreme interest for many applications. In particular latest paradigms of 3D mapping of buildings, such as CityGML and BIM, can benefit from an initial determination of building geometries. In this work we used a LiDAR dataset of urban environment from the ISPRS benchmark on urban object detection. The dataset is labelled with eight classes, two were used for this investigation: roof and facades. The objective is to test how TensorFlow neural network for deep learning can predict these two classes. Results show that for "root" and "facades" semantic classes respectively, recall is 84% and 76% and precision is 72% and 63%. The number and distribution of correct points well represent the geometry, thus allowing to use them as support for CityGML and BIM modelling. Further tuning of the hidden layers of the DL model will likely improve results and will be tested in future investigations.

TI  - Inpretation of Associative Data as a Methodogical Issue of Psycholinguistics
T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Associative experiments uncover people's active attitude to the world represented by language means that determines their relevant strategies of verbal activity and mediates the specifics of their world conceptualization. A word's associative field modeled on the basis of experimental data is a psychological structure of a word's content that is relevant for native speakers. Associative meaning distinguished via the analysis of distribution of reactions to a stimulus word proves to be an effective method of discovering emerging trends in the change of word meanings. The author researches the issue of data interpretation in associative experiments. Despite the long history of usage, the notion "associative field" and the correlation of stimulus and reaction are often interpreted in different ways because, firstly, they model the most complex processes of speech activity; secondly, most of suggested typologies of associates do not have a common systematization criterion, which hinders the usage of such classifications in research practice and sometimes leads to an ambiguous interpretation of associative data. Therefore, the author argues that classifications of associates should be developed depending on: (1) characteristics of psycholinguistic/linguistic object researched through an associative experiment; (2) isomorphism of speech and the activity it accompanies; (3) characteristics of mental supports in the cognitive process; (4) the way of representation of these supports. Such criteria of classification require an analysis of the correlation between stimulus and reaction as a unit of association. This correlation is a separate speech act where the stimulus is a motive producing the reaction and the associate expresses the author's communicative intention. This helps to establish motives of associating and thus acquire a more veracious database for modelling different components of speech activity and its overall production/ comprehension processes. Besides, this approach justifies the principles of worldview modelling. The author presents theoretical and methodological grounds for an effective analysis of associates on the basis of a psycholinguistic object defined by several parameters: strategy of association, dominant psychological function of a language sign that realizes the strategy and the motive of activity explicated in associates.

T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - A large dinoflagellate bloom in Walker Bay (South Africa) in January 2017 impacted 3 land-based abalone farms resulting in the death of several million animals. Satellite-derived images of Chl-a from the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) on board the European Space Agency Sentinel-3 A showed bloom initiation in late December 2016 and dispersal in mid-February 2017. The bloom was dominated by two dinoflagellate species identified by light microscopy as Gonyaulax spinifera (Claparede & Lachmann) Diesing, 1866 and Lingulodinium polyedrum (Stein) Dodge, 1989. These morphologically based identifications were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using partial sequences of the large subunit rDNA of both dinoflagellates. The appearance of yessotoxins (YTX) in abalone clearly coincided with increases in dinoflagellate concentrations. Yessotoxins in both the plankton and abalone were dominated by the two analogues homo-YTX and 45-hydroxy-YTX. The absence of toxins in a clonal culture of L. polyedrum implicated G. spinifera as the likely source of YTX. Toxin concentrations were found to be highest in the gills which showed the most significant pathology, including severe, generalized disruption of the gill epithelium characterized by degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells accompanied by a modest inflammatory response. Some farms undertook pre-emptive or emergency harvesting to reduce financial losses.

AB  - GeoSensor is a novel, open-source system that enriches change detection over satellite images with event detection over news items and social media content. GeoSensor combines these two orthogonal operations through state-of-the-art Semantic Web technologies. At its core lies the open-source, semantics-enabled Big Data infrastructure developed by the EU H2020 BigDataEurope project. This allows GeoSensor to offer an on-line functionality, despite facing three major challenges of Big Data: Volume (a single satellite image typically occupies a few GBs), Variety (its data sources include two different types of satellite images and various types of user-generated content) and Veracity, as the accuracy of the end result is crucial for the usefulness of our system. We present GeoSensor's architecture in detail, highlighting the advantages of using semantics for taking the most of the knowledge extracted from news items and Earth Observation products. We also verify GeoSensor's efficiency through a preliminary experimental study.

T2  - TURBULENCE, ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Turbulence, Atmospheric and Climate Dynamics
CL  - Moscow, RUSSIA
AB  - The results of studies of atmospheric aerosol over the territory of Russia are of great interest from the point of view of ecological and climatic problems. The paper presents the results of spatial and temporal variability of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over the European territory of the Russian Federation in the period 1999 - 2016 yy. The assessments were carried out using the original AOD extraction method based on ground-based observations of the Russian actinometric network, and also on the satellite observations of MODIS. The general regularities of spatial variations in the aerosol optical depth over Russia are revealed: a monotonic decrease from the southwest to the northeast with localized areas having different aerosol loads due to the global and regional factors of their formation. The AOT increase in spring and summer is associated with a seasonal increase in temperature and humidity and with changes in the underlying surface. "Purification" of the atmosphere from aerosol is caused by the absence of large volcanic eruptions and by industrial "calm" conditions during the last decade. Negative tendencies are less pronounced in the fall than in spring and summer. To compare the atmospheric AOT values obtained from the MODIS, AERONET and GMS data, we have compiled a combined archive of daily AOT values synchronized in pairs for the 3 types of observations (GMS, MODIS and AERONET): "Aerosol optical thickness of the atmosphere by satellite and ground observations ". The data of the comparison of terrestrial and satellite data for AOD are presented only in averaged form and need further consideration.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article shows the unique historical and cultural phenomenon known as the 'writing doctor' based on evidence from several works of two authors M. A. Bulgakov and P. Strauss. The aim of this article is to investigate the writing doctors' "drama of life." The research objective is to discuss their inner world through the discourse of pathography, to demonstrate their philosophy of life as a view of the medical profession, conceptions of 'pain, suffering, and loneliness' by means of literary techniques. The flagship approach is the typological comparison of philosophical views and means of expression of ideas. The authors' article shows that their oeuvre is an interdisciplinary phenomenon for medicine and literature. Medicine served as a launch pad for authors and then, because in their works they wrote about their medical practice, continuous communication with patients and colleagues and their inner emotion. Bulgakov and Strauss lived, worked and wrote at the same time. However their destiny was different. Bulgakov left Medicine and devoted his entire life to literature, but Strauss continued to be a 'writing doctor' for the rest of his life. Strauss was able to formulate in his monographs his conception of philosophy about "the good doctor." Their careers as writers and doctors were marked by political and social changes in both countries, which had a serious effect on their worldview. Both of them asserted freedom of speech and their choice of career as writers and concerned citizens.

AB  - A new empirical algorithm CWAVE_S1-IW for estimation of significant wave height H-s including swell and wind sea from C-band satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has been developed for Sentinel-1 (S1) Interferometric Wide Swatrh Mode (IW) imagery. The algorithm was implemented into the Sea Sate Processor (SSP) for fully automatic processing for near real time (NRT) services and allow the estimation of wave fields of thousands of kilometres in the flight direction and 250km swath from S1 IW scenes consisting of a sequence of individual images.The priority of CWAVE_S1-IW development was an automatic, fast and robust raster processing independent of wave patterns, applicable even when only clutter is visible in the SAR images. The algorithm is based on the spectral analysis of subscenes in wavenumber space. The empirical function allows direct H-s estimation from image spectra without first converting them into wave spectra and uses integrated image spectra parameters as well as estimated local wind information. A texture analysis based on Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) is also applied. In this way, also the parameters of short waves can be estimated, which are not visible in S1 IW images and are only represented by clutter.The algorithm was tuned worldwide using in-situ collocated measurements of 92 buoys with more than 2500 acquisitions. The validated SSP allows automatic processing of worldwide S1 IW images in VV or HH polarization, including Atlantic storms, cyclones, and huge storms in the Gulf of Alaska with a root-mean-square (RMSE)error of 80 cm for H-s. For the closed seas like the North Sea, Baltic Seas and Black Sea the accuracy is higher with an RMSE=55 cm. The algorithm is integrated into a demonstration service, used for further validation at the DLR ground station in Neustrelitz. The NRT processing has been tested by supporting a research ship cruise in the Antarctic Sea.

TI  - THE ONOMASTICON OF "STOLBISTS"
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies proper names (toponyms and anthroponyms) and specific terms used among the "Stolbists," a group of people practicing free climbing (without rigging equipment) on the rocks of the Stolby ("Pillars") Nature Reserve in the vicinities of Krasnoyarsk. Over 150 years of existence, it has evolved into a full-fledged community brought together by a shared location (the Stolby Natural Complex), general occupation (regular visits to the reserve, climbing practice, joint leisure), a special lifestyle and traditions: holidays, festivals, competitions, fun events, games, "popular circus" (demonstration of artful tricks on the rocks), ceremonies and customs, corporate language, etc. The naming system they use is regarded as another part of their corporate thinking. This paper considers the development and the structure of the naming patterns that apply in this community. Being essentially more than a geographical site, the reserve constitutes a unique cultural space, and "stolbism" is regarded as a unique folk tradition of Krasnoyarsk residents. The names coined by the Stolbists will most typically refer to natural geographical objects (rocks, stones, streams, clearings, terrain details, etc.), as well as their own infrastructure: huts, companies, climbing, tricks, rock sections, individual peaks, paths, etc. The analysis concerns different naming techniques such as semantic derivation (including metaphorical reference), affix derivation, transonymization, proper names appellativization. Instances of onomastic awareness of the "Stolbists" featured in names evaluation puns, and cases of folk etymology are viewed as a reflection of their language worldview.

TI  - Integration of Hydro-Climatological Model and Remote Sensing for Glacier Mass Balance Estimation
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The accurate monitoring and understanding of glacier dynamics are of high relevance for climate science and water-resources management. The glacier parameters are typically estimated by data assimilation methods which inject field measurements into the numerical simulations with the aim of improving the physical model estimates. However, these methods often are not able to capture and model the complexity of the estimation problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method that integrates remote sensing (RS) data, in-situ observations and a physical-based model to accurately estimate the Glacier Mass Balance (GMB). The RS data are used to represent the physical properties of the glaciers by characterizing their topography and spectral properties. Instead of assimilating the observations into the model, the in-situ measurements are used to perform a data-driven correction of the GMB estimates derived from the physically-based simulations in the informative RS feature space. The method is applied to the Alpine MUltiscale Numerical Distributed Simulation ENgine (AMUNDSEN) hydro-climatological model. In the experimental analysis, the multispectral images used to define the feature space are high-resolution Sentinel-2 images. The method is validated on three glaciers in Tyrol (Hintereis, Kasselwand and Varnagt glaciers), in 2015 and 2016. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the method in improving the GMB estimates.

TI  - ONOMASTIC REPRESENTATION OF THE OTHERWORLD IN RUSSIAN POPULAR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article attempts to render a speculative image of the otherworld as represented in Russian onomastic material. The concept itself refers to an imagined metaphysical reality in which most important locations and characters are specified by proper names. The study deals with proper names that suggest references to death and the related notions (metaphorical names of death, cemeteries, topographic objects, and creatures of the otherworld). A particular focus is made on name constituents of dialectal phraseological units in the vernacular of the Kama River area (field materials collected from 2003 to 2018 in the southern and northern parts of the Perm Region). These onymic components are regarded as linguocultural concepts reflecting believers' worldview and attitude to existence. The semantic analysis of set phrases is carried out against the background of general Russian dialectology, with occasional references to the context of folk traditions of the Kama Region (texts of visions, dreams, and loose retellings of Biblical plots). The study illustrates that proper names add to the clarity and consistency of the afterlife image. In its onomastic reflection, the otherworld is more similar to the real world other than a hostile and dangerous demonic space. The analysis of semantic properties and cultural connotations of the personal and place names under study reveals that, in popular understanding, the otherworld is inseparable from the earthly life. This verbal representation of the otherworld, on the one hand, testifies to the archaic state of worldview with no division into real and imaginary and, on the other hand, serves as a form of psychological adaptation to the problem of life's ending. The findings of the study may contribute to further research on the cognitive and virtual aspects of onomastics.

TI  - Secretory carcinoma of the breast: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Secretory breast carcinoma (SBC) is a rare breast tumor which accounts for < 0.15% of all breast cancers. It was originally described as a juvenile breast carcinoma, occurring in young children and adolescent women. SBC is associated with a characteristic balanced translocation, t(12;15), that creates aETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 52-year-old Caucasian woman had palpable lump in her right breast. After breast imaging examination (BI-RADS 4b) and preoperative core-needle biopsy with suspicion of SBC a breast conserving therapy was performed. The diagnosis of SBC was confirmed through immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic examination of the tumor. The patient is now 22 months post-surgery and remains disease-free.DISCUSSION: Recent studies reported that the disease occurs at a later age than previously recognized, and is associated with good long-term survival. In breast imaging it may mimic a benign tumor. Immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic analysis of the tumor are crucial for confirmation of SBC.CONCLUSION: There is no consensus with regard to the best treatment strategy for patients with SBC. Breast conserving therapy with sentinel lymph nodes biopsy is at present the first choice treatment. Further research for a specific NTRK3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor could lead to the discovery of a new targeted treatment of this tumor. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - On the assessment of alternatives for building cooling load reductions for a tropical coastal city
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goal in this contribution is to study and formulate different scenarios that will aid in identifying opportunities to increase environmental and energy sustainability of the urban environment of a tropical coastal city. These cities are among the most vulnerable to climate change and impacts on the energy infrastructures are particularly concerning. For this effort, the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, with the Building Effect Parameterization and Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) schemes are applied to the tropical coastal San Juan Metropolitan Area (SJMA) in Puerto Rico. SJMA has a total population of 2.0 million inhabitants in a total area of 750 km(2). Building use and heights required for BEP-BEM are estimated from the World Urban Database Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT), Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification, which partitions the urban landscape into ten different urban classes. WUDAPT output was compared with observations from the NASA ATLAS Mission and NASA Landsat 8 imagery, and was found to be in good resemblance for their urban built up class. To test energy use and mitigation strategies for SJMA, we consider the heat wave event from 09-29-2014 to 10-02-2014. The new modeling methodology (BEP-BEM-WUDAPT) was found to improve results from non-urbanized versions when compared with observations from a network of weather stations. Air conditioning (AC) demand from urban WRF was found to be in good agreement with EnergyPlus (TM) simulations and available records from the local power utility company. The work explored building energy sustainability and mitigating options to include energy efficient building materials, white roofs, increase of indoor AC temperature set points, and use of high efficiency AC equipment. Among mitigating alternatives explored, results show that white roofs, target indoor temperatures and high efficient AC systems reduce the total energy demand by 6.9%, 9.9% and 16.15%, respectively. Furthermore, when considering all alternatives simultaneously, the peak demand decreased by 40% during a tropical heat wave event. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Improved biosecurity surveillance of non-native forest insects: a review of current methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Biosecurity surveillance has been highlighted as a key activity to discover non-native species at the initial stage of invasion. It provides an opportunity for rapidly initiating eradication measures and implementing responses to prevent spread and permanent establishment, reducing costs and damage. In importing countries, three types of biosecurity activities can be carried out: border surveillance targets the arrival stage of a non-native species at points-of-entry for commodities; post-border surveillance and containment target the establishment stage, but post-border surveillance is carried out on a large spatial scale, whereas containment is carried out around infested areas. In recent years, several surveillance approaches, such as baited traps, sentinel trees, biosurveillance with sniffer dogs or predatory wasps, electronic noses, acoustic detection, laser vibrometry, citizen science, genetic identification tools, and remote sensing, have been developed to complement routine visual inspections and aid in biosecurity capacity. Here, we review the existing literature on these tools, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and identify the biosecurity surveillance categories and sites where each tool can be used more efficiently. Finally, we show how these tools can be integrated in a comprehensive biosecurity program and discuss steps to improve biosecurity.

AB  - The study presents the results of multistage of classification using supervised algorithm of Maximum Likelihood to assessment the forest using of multitemporal Landsat (summer-autumn) images for mapping cover disturbance in Middle Volga region. Analysis of the degree of forest cover disturbance was determined based on by biotic (fires, thematic map of the state of forest cover) and complex factors (forest disturbance map using the Disturbance Index) for 1985-2014. Calculation of the influence degree ("weight index") of each factor on the disturbance of forest cover was made. The integrated disturbance map was obtained based on a bivariate statistical analysis of raster data. The algorithm of geospatial analysis of thematic raster data allowed determining the degree of correlation between the indicators of the revealed violations of forest cover in the Middle Volga region and various factors affecting these violations. For classification and validation of thematic maps of forest cover disturbance was used test sites with independent field data for each satellite Landsat image of middle spatial resolution. Cross-validated overall accuracies, ranged between 81-87%, showed high degree of agreement between the forest cover disturbance map and the ground truth data. Research results can be applied for the long term forest monitoring and development of forest management plan for the investigated region.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 25th International Symposium On Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics
CL  - Novosibirsk, RUSSIA
AB  - In this paper we consider the influence of various parametrizations of aerosol-cloud-interaction on the total solar radiation and cloud transmission at the earth's surface according to the INMCM5 model. Several 10-year numerical experiments were carried out with/without three parametrizations of this interaction. In addition, numerical experiments with different emissions of aerosol precursor gases for 1980 and 2005 were performed. We show that the account for aerosol particles in aerosol-cloud interaction leads to an increase in the cloudiness by an average of 0.1 and a decrease in the total radiation by 25 W/m(2). As a result, there is a decrease in the air temperature by an average of 2 degrees for all months of the year. This result confirms the theoretical assumptions about the increase of the cloud albedo effect with a decrease in the effective radius of the particles. However, numerical experiments with different emissions of aerosol precursor gases for 2005 and for 1980 revealed that at lower emissions there is a decrease in cloud transmission and an increase in the cloudiness. The probable causes of the observed effect are discussed.

AB  - Water/Ice/Land region classification is an important remote sensing tasks, which analyze the occurrence of water, ice on the earth surface. Common remote sensing practices such as thresholding, spectral analysis, and statistical approaches generally do not produce globally reliable classification results. Even the robust deep learning models do not perform enough due to the limitation of ground truth available for training and the medium resolution of the Open satellite images. Therefore, in this research, we used a relatively easy method to generate ground truth for randomly selected locations around the globe. Then, we utilized a simplified variant of well-known UNet deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with a dilated CNN layers, skip connections and without any max-pooling layers. The proposed model shows better performance in medium resolution satellite images (Landsat-8) compared to state-of-the-art models such as UNet and DeepWaterMap applied on the same task.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Water region estimation is considered as one of the fundamental classification tasks in remote sensing. Several previous research works focused on traditional practices such as spectral analysis, and statistical approaches for water region estimation. However, producing a consistent global scale water estimation results are still considered as relatively challenging task. On the other hand, in computer vision applications Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) emerged as greater tool for classification tasks. Recently, Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network(R-CNN) proposed for improved classification results. Therefore, inspired from R-CNN, this research proposes a Recurrent feedback Encoder-Decoder without max-pooling for global scale water region estimation using temporal Landsat-8 images. The proposed R-CNN uses three Landsat-8 images which consist of current observation (t0) to predict water region and two previous observation of the same location (t - 1, t - 2), and these three temporal observation of the same location were employed for training with the ground truth labelled data (water/non-water) from the current observation. Proposed R-CNN model uses temporal input data and results in multi-temporal output for water region estimation. Experiments show promising results especially while using concatenated recurrent feedback features. The model significantly outperforms baseline model and UNet (without recurrent and feedback structure). Detailed comparison study on temporal Landsat-8 images that highly affected by sunglint, cloud and other atmospheric conditions shows that the proposed model has a potential to produce reliable water region estimation where UNet, baseline model R-CNN single model fail.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Although Rwanda has accomplished significant improvements in food production in recent years, one fifth of its population remains food insecure. Agricultural information is currently collected through seasonal agricultural surveys, but more frequent and timely data collection is needed to adequately inform public and private decision-makers about the status of crops during the growing season. Sentinel-1 and -2 data are freely available with new images provided every 4-5 days. While analysis of these multispectral images has been used for agricultural applications, there are few applications to smallholder agriculture. Major challenges for satellite image analysis in the context of Rwanda include heavily clouded scenes and small plot sizes that are often intercropped. Sentinel-2 scenes corresponding to mid-season were analyzed, and spectral signatures of maize could be distinguished from those of other crops. Seasonal mean filtering was applied to Sentinel-1 scenes, and there was significant overlap in the spectral signatures across different types of vegetation. Random Forest models for classification of Sentinel scenes were developed using a training dataset that was constructed from high-resolution multispectral images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in several different locations in Rwanda and labeled as to the crop type by trained observers. The models were applied to satellite images of the whole country of Rwanda and validated using a test dataset from the UAV images. The Sentinel-2 model had the user's accuracy for maize classification of 75%, while the Sentinel-1 model overestimated the maize area resulting in a user's accuracy of <50%.

TI  - Progress in adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The prognosis of patients with early stage breast cancer has greatly improved in the past three decades. Following the first adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemotherapy trials, continuous improvements of clinical outcomes have been achieved through intense therapeutic escalation, albeit with increased health-care costs and treatment-related toxicities. In contrast to the advances achieved in surgery or radiotherapy, the identification of the patient subgroups that will derive clinical benefit from therapeutic escalation has proved to be a daunting process hindered by a lack of collaboration between scientific groups and by the pace of drug development. In the past few decades, initiatives towards de-escalation of systemic adjuvant treatment have achieved success. Herein, we summarize attempts to escalate and de-escalate adjuvant systemic treatment for patients with breast cancer and argue that new, creative trial designs focused on patients' actual needs rather than on maximizing drug market size are needed. Ultimately, the adoption of effective treatments that do not needlessly expose patients and health-care systems to harm demands extensive international collaboration between academic groups, governments, and pharmaceutical companies.

AB  - EnMAP is a German hyperspectral satellite mission. The Remote Sensing Technology Institute of the German Aerospace Center is responsible for the stray light characterisation of the satellite's spectrometers. This paper describes the light source developed for that purpose and how it will be employed to characterise the in-band, in-field stray light. This type of stray light can be characterised by measuring the point spread function (PSF) at multiple locations on the detector. Because of the cumulative effect of stray light, it is necessary to characterise the PSF in the near- and far-field. The PSF can span a range of more than 6 orders of magnitude from the peak to the wings at the edges of the detector, exceeding the intrinsic dynamic range of the instrument. Therefore a high dynamic range (HDR) PSF measurement is required: A spectrally and angularly narrow spot of light is guided onto the instrument then measurement frames of multiple signal levels are acquired. The signal level is controlled by changing the instrument's integration time or changing the neutral density filter of the light source. The overexposed pixels in the higher signal level frames are excluded, then the multiple image frames are combined into one HDR frame which can then be used in the stray light correction algorithm. This HDR 'bracketing' technique is demonstrated here with DLR's HySpex VNIR-1600 airborne imaging spectrometer.

AB  - Cultural heritage conservation and preservation are at the forefront of the most important UNESCO activities. The World Heritage Convention adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972 encourages States Parties to strengthen the appreciation of the public for World Heritage properties and to enhance their protection through educational and information programs. The international student scientific Congress "Problems of cultural heritage preservation in multicultural education" was held on April 19, 2018 at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Financial University and the 100th anniversary of the St. Petersburg University of Culture in the form of a telecommunication session - 'bridge' between Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Congress was attended by the Embassy representatives of several countries. Around 100 students of the Financial University, Peoples ' Friendship University, St. Petersburg University of Culture, Saint-Petersburg Polytechnic University from Russia, representing Mongolia, Vietnam, Montenegro, the USA, Italy, Latvia, China, Kazakhstan, Venezuela took part in the virtual and real dialogue of cultures.The main objectives of the article are:to prove that the English language plays a truly unifying role, creating a comfortable environment for collaboration in the dialogue of cultures;to investigate what is necessary for the effective formation of verbal and non-verbal communication strategies in order to acquire professional linguistic knowledge, skills and abilities implementing a broad worldview culture, organic and tolerant perception of human values;to contribute to the students ' awareness of the cultural heritage of different countries and Russia cultivating their citizenship, especially in the current political situation.The relevance of the research problem is due to the growing needs of the modern Russian society and, in general, the world community in the development of polycultural education as one of the main factors in the conservation and development of the global cultural heritage and the strengthening of international cultural cooperation. The article considers the ways of solving this problem. We are convinced that the study of world Heritage Sites is an essential strategy for bringing people of different cultures together and for intercultural dialogue. Today we need a new approach to the transformation of cultural heritage into an innovative force that plays a leading role in the establishment of intercultural dialogue and sustainable development. One can conclude on the basis of the given experience results that it is necessary we have an open platform to unite theory and practice and to promote the development of dialogue among cultures within the framework of the main theme of Cultural Heritage on the Planet belonging to all of us.

TI  - The concept of the "mother" in the worldview and folklore of the Northern Mansi
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The article discusses the features of the concept of the "mother" in the traditional worldview of the local (Upper Sosva) group of the Northern Mansi (basin of the Lyapin River and the Northern Sosva River). In Mansi culture, the personality of the mother is distinguished not so much by the variety of functions only (because it is limited by the main purpose of a woman as a giver of life), but by the conceptual diversity of parental, social and social aspects. Representations about the mother belong to the intimate sphere of relations, that's why many topics relating to the theme of the "mother and motherhood" still remain taboo. This circumstance had an impact on the formation of the source base of the research.Different aspects of the concept of the "mother", analyzed in language material, reveal the original (biological, reproductive), as well as social status of the woman-mother in Mansi society.Objective: to reveal the multi-aspect of the concept of the "mother" in traditional culture of the Mansi from the perspective of cognitive anthropology and linguistics.Research materials: the article uses materials on history, ethnography, folklore and linguistics of the Mansi, as well field materials of the author.Results and novelty of the research. The study of the concept of the "mother" in traditional culture of the Mansi revealed a variety of properties and images related to the female reproductive sphere (motherhood); divine patrons (mythology, religious beliefs). The author noted interrelation of forms of social life with its cognitive and normative components. Examples of sacred prescriptions for women in childbirth, rooted in traditional customs, are given. The research is oriented from the position of traditional Mansi specificity in its cultural and linguistic representation. For the first time, attention is focused on motherhood as a special socio-cultural institution of traditional society.The results of the research can be used by students of universities, researchers, graduate students and undergraduates studying the culture of the Ob-Ugric peoples.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Reduced visibility and adverse cloud cover is a major issue for aviation, road traffic, and military activities. Synoptic meteorological stations and LIDAR measurements are common tools to detect meteorological conditions. However, a low density of meteorological stations and LIDAR measurements may limit a detailed spatial analysis. While geostationary satellite data is a valuable source of information for analyzing the spatio-temporal variability of fog and clouds on a global scale, considerable effort is still required to improve the detection of atmospheric variables on a local scale, especially during the night.In this study we propose to use thermal camera images to (1) improve cloud detection and (2) to study visibility conditions during nighttime. For this purpose, we leverage FLIR A320 and FLIR A655sc Stationary Thermal Imagers installed in the city of Bern, Switzerland. We find that the proposed data provides detailed information about low clouds and the cloud base height that is usually not seen by satellites. However, clouds with a small optical depth such as thin cirrus clouds are difficult to detect as the noise level of the captured thermal images is high.The second part of this study focuses on the detection of structural features. Predefined targets such as roof windows, an antenna, or a small church tower are selected at distances of 140m to 1210m from the camera. We distinguish between active targets (heated targets or targets with insufficient thermal insulation) and passive structural features to analyze the sensor's visibility range. We have found that a successful detection of some passive structural features highly depends on incident solar radiation. Therefore, the detection of such features is often hindered during the night. On the other hand, active targets can be detected without difficulty during the night due to major differences in temperature between the heated target and its surrounding non-heated objects. We retrieve response values by the cross-correlation of master edge signatures of the targets and the actual edge-detected thermal camera image. These response values are a precise indicator of the atmospheric conditions and allows us to detect restricted visibility conditions.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy using fluorescent lymphography in cT1-4N0M0 breast cancer patients: high diagnostic capabilities
T2  - Voprosy Onkologii (St. Petersburg)
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer cT1-4N0M0 patients usually require a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green fluorescence detection is a modern technique with a high lymph node detection rate. However, the false-negative rate was not evaluated adequately. Our objective was to determine node detection rate and the false-negative rate. 99 patients with 100 cases of breast cancer cT1-4N0M0 were operated on. The axillary part of an operation consisted of indocyanine green fluorescence-guided SLN biopsy and an axillary lymphadenectomy of levels I-II or I-II-III. A signal lymph node was detected in 98 cases (98 %). In 28 (28.6%) cases out of 98, metastases in signal lymph nodes were found. Other than sentinel lymph node had metastatic lesion only in 35.7% in SLN N+ cases. False negative result occurred in 1 case of 28 (3.6%). The application of indocyanine green fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in cNO breast cancer patients allows for a high signal lymph node detection rate and a low false negative rate.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Paraiba and Taperoa river basin are located in the semiarid zone of Paraiba State. Much of the delimitation of the semiarid region has Caatinga forests, which, due to its bioclimatic conditions, diversity and endemism, become a singular biome, extending over a surface area of 844,453Km2 IBGE (2010). The objective of this study was to evaluate soil use and cover, spatial pattern of fragmentation and connectivity of the Upper Paraiba and Taperoa basin. The mapping was done from GEOBIA classification of MSI images of Sentinel 2 satellite, and worked on GUIDOS software. The vegetation cover and the water and bioclimatic condition of the surveyed area were used. The results point to a greater presence of caatinga areas in quantity and connectivity in the northwest of Upper Paraiba and in the southwest of Taperoa.

AB  - As part of the European Copernicus programme, the Sentinel-1 mission, based on a constellation of two SAR satellites, ensures continuity for C-band SAR observations for Europe. Both satellites have been launched from Kourou on a Soyuz rocket, Sentinel-1A on 3rd April 2014, Sentinel-1B on 25th April 2016. Following the completion of the constellation operational qualification phase, the routine operations of the constellation are on-going and performed at the full mission and system capacity. The mission is characterized by large-scale, frequent and repetitive observations, systematic production and a free and open data distribution policy.The paper provides high-level information on the on-going mission operations. It describes at high level the system operations, incl. the basics of the Sentinel-1 observation scenario and the satellite and ground segment operational activities. It presents few examples of Sentinel-1 mission exploitation activities in the domain of disaster management and geohazards monitoring, ones of the main thematic of IGARSS 2019.

AB  - Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc. have a huge impact on a society-causing destruction of life and property in their wake. During disasters such as flood, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of the situation as it occurs for effective response. In this paper, we address the problem of satellite image classification for urban floods using deep learning. We propose an encoder-decoder neural network based on the Efficient Residual Factorized Convnet(ERFNet), for multi-class segmentation of urban floods from multi-spectral satellite imagery. The ERFNet architecture capitalizes on skip connections and one dimensional convolutions to achieve the best possible trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Since time is of essence during a disaster, the choice of the ERFNet architecture on a high performance computing (HPC) platform is apt. Satellite imagery from WorldView-2 of floods in Srinagar, India during September 2014 have been used for this study. The tool 'markGT' has been developed to assist end-to-end annotation of satellite imagery. The urban flood dataset used for this study has been generated using markGT. The proposed deep learning model over urban flood satellite imagery gives promising results on Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU. We envisage that the proposed model could be extended and improved for real-time classification of urban floods, thereby aiding disaster response personnel in making informed decisions.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends and transitions in the growing season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor at 250-m resolution were analyzed for the period from 2000 to 2018 to understand recent patterns of vegetation change in ecosystems of the Noatak National Preserve in northwestern Alaska. Statistical analysis of changes in the NDVI time series was conducted using the "Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend" method (BFAST). This structural change analysis indicated that at least one NDVI abrupt change breakpoint was detected in 25% of the MODIS pixels covering the NOAT. All of the large wildfires mapped by Landsat burn severity classifications within the NOAT since the year 2000 coincided with multiple negative NDVI breakpoints. Results showed that six large drainage basins, all within the Eli River and Kugururok River systems of the western NOAT, had significant correlations between early spring snowmelt and annual area burned. Later-than-average snowmelt dates were strongly associated with a high number of abrupt shifts in greenness cover detected by BFAST. Negative (browning) NDVI trends in the de-seasonalized residuals were detected as significant (p < 0.05) at 15% of the total MODIS 250-m pixel coverage of the NOAT.

AB  - Fusion of Directed Principal Component Analysis (DPCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms was applied to some selected Landsat-8 mineral indices for mapping gossan and clay-rich zones for Zn-Pb exploration in the Franklinian Basin of North Greenland. This region contains a unique potential for exploration of world-class zinc deposits. Numerous potential zones for Zn-Pb deposits were identified using the fusion technique of DPCA/ICA. Their identification was based on detecting alteration mineral patterns consist of ferric iron, ferrous iron and clay minerals within a background of sedimentary rocks using Landsat-8 spectral bands. Several zones of gossan and clay mineral assemblages were identified in the trough sequences of the Citronen Fjord, Peary Land that may represent potential undiscovered CD Zn-Pb deposits and warrant further investigation. This investigation indicates that satellite remote sensing mapping techniques can aid in identifying unknown/undiscovered Zn-Pb sulfide deposits in the High Arctic Franklinian Basin by targeting the location of alteration zones that are feasible location for mineral occurrences.

AB  - Several regions remain poorly studied in terms of geological mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions especially in the Arctic and Antarctica due to harsh conditions and logistical difficulties. Application of specialized image processing techniques is capable of revealing the hidden linearly mixed spectral sources in multispectral and hyperspectral satellite images. In this study, the application of Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) algorithm was evaluated for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) remote sensing data for geological mapping in Morozumi Range and Helliwell Hills areas, Northern Victoria Land (NVL), Antarctica. The results of this investigation demonstrate the capability of the algorithms in distinguishing subpixel targets in the multispectral satellite data. The application of the method for identifying poorly exposed geologic materials and subpixel exposures of alteration minerals has invaluable implications for geological mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the process of very high-resolution thermal mosaic acquisition using low-altitude airborne remote sensing and the basic analysis of data regarding urban climate research. The process of data acquisition from flight planning to final mosaicking is described. A broadband thermal camera was mounted to a Cessna aeroplane for two flights over the city; one performed in the morning and one in the afternoon. The ground resolution of the final mosaic fluctuates between 90 and 105 cm. Gathered data had to be processed to acquire kinetic temperature values. The processing consisted of radiometric, geometric, atmospheric and emissivity corrections. As a result, two mosaics covering the city were created. The difference between the building canopy layer and ground level was investigated, and a 5 degrees C increase was found during the day on the rooftop level. It was confirmed that natural materials do not heat as much as artificial ones. Local Climate Zones were used in the analysis as the spatial unit for comparison of the thermal regime at the neighbourhood level. To summarise, the possibilities of extreme resolution thermal remote sensing data acquisition and analysis are demonstrated.

TI  - Assimilation of Global Total Chlorophyll OC-CCI Data and Its Impact on Individual Phytoplankton Fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coupled ocean circulation-ecosystem model MITgcm-REcoM2 is used to simulate biogeochemical variables in a global configuration. The ecosystem model REcoM2 simulates two phytoplankton groups, diatoms and small phytoplankton, using a quota formulation with variable carbon, nitrogen, and chlorophyll contents of the cells. To improve the simulation of the phytoplankton variables, chlorophyll-a data from the European Space Agency Ocean-Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) for 2008 and 2009 are assimilated with an ensemble Kalman filter. Utilizing the multivariate cross covariances estimated by the model ensemble, the assimilation constrains all model variables describing the two phytoplankton groups. Evaluating the assimilation results against the satellite data product SynSenPFT shows an improvement of total chlorophyll and more importantly of individual phytoplankton groups. The assimilation improves both phytoplankton groups in the tropical and midlatitude regions, whereas the assimilation has a mixed response in the high-latitude regions. Diatoms are most improved in the major ocean basins, whereas small phytoplankton show small deteriorations in the Southern Ocean. The improvement of diatoms is larger when the multivariate assimilation is computed using the ensemble-estimated cross covariances between total chlorophyll and the phytoplankton groups than when the groups are updated so that their ratio to total chlorophyll is preserved. The comparison with in situ observations shows that the correlation of the simulated chlorophyll of both phytoplankton groups with these data is increased whereas the bias and error are decreased. Overall, the multivariate assimilation of total chlorophyll modifies the two phytoplankton groups separately, even though the sum of their individual chlorophyll concentrations represents the total chlorophyll.Plain Language Summary Different types of plankton are simulated globally with ocean ecosystem models. To further increase their prediction quality, we combine the model with satellite observations of chlorophyll using modern methods called data assimilation. This method allows us not only to improve the modeled total chlorophyll but also the simulation of the different plankton types. Further, we can fill gaps in the satellite data that results, for example, from clouds. Thus, we are able to better predict the ocean ecosystem, which in turn helps to understand climate change patterns and carbon cycle processes.

AB  - Urbanization of the last decade contributed to the urban morphological changes in Yogyakarta Urban Area (YUA). These conditions have an impact on local climate zone variations. There is an urgent need for enhanced climate-based urban planning. This study aims to: 1) Classify the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) in YUA using the World Urban Database Access and Portal Tool (WUDAPT) method, and 2) develop climate-based urban planning recommendations of the classification results. WUDAPT method used in this research based on the concept of LCZ framework by utilizing Landsat 8 imagery. LCZ classification of the whole area is determined using random forest classifier algorithm by SAGA GIS. The results of this study indicate that there are 12 LCZs in YUA, consisting of 6 types of LCZ based on building type and 6 LCZs based on land cover type. The highest increase of LST are in LCZ 3 and LCZ 5. Consequently, there's a change in diurnal temperature from low to medium. Therefore, the thermal comfort aspect define by four components of LCZ is important in YUA urban planning strategy.

TI  - Cathepsin L Induces Proangiogenic Changes in Human Omental Microvascular Endothelial Cells <i>via</i> Activation of the ERK1/2 Pathway
T2  - CURRENT CANCER DRUG TARGETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Metastasis still remains the major cause of therapeutic failure, poor prognosis and high mortality in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Previously, we showed that EOC cells secrete a range of factors with potential pro-angiogenic activity, in disease-relevant human omental microvascular endothelial cells (HOMECs), including the lysosomal protease cathepsin L (CathL). Thus, the aim of this study was to examine potential pro-proliferative and pro-migratory effects of CathL in HOMECs and the activated signalling pathways, and whether these proangiogenic responses are dependent on CathL-catalytic activity.Methods: HOMECs proliferation was investigated using WST-1, BrdU and CyQUANT assays. Cell migration was examined using a Cultrex Cell 96 transwell migration assay. Enzyme activity was assayed at various pHs using the CathL-specific fluorogenic substrate FY-CHO. Activation of cell signalling pathways was tested using a commercially available phosphokinase array and intact cell-based ELISAs.Results: We showed for the first time that CathL has a potent pro-proliferative and pro-migratory effect on HOMECs. For instance, CathL significantly increases HOMEC proliferation (134.8 +/- 114.7% vs control 100%) and migration (146.6 +/- 17.3% vs control 100%). Our data strongly suggest that these proangiogenic effects of CathL are mediated via a non-proteolytic mechanism. Finally, we show that CathL-induced activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in inducing these cellular effects in HOMECs.Conclusion: These data suggest that CathL acts as an extracellular ligand and plays an important pro-angiogenic, and thus pro-metastatic, role during EOC metastasis to the omentum, by activating the omental microvasculature, and thus can potentially be targeted therapeutically in the future.

AB  - Coastal degradation can be observed as destruction of mangrove area. The impact of mangrove destruction is evidenced by a significantly eroded area. Further impacts included lessened biodiversity, especially in the mangrove ecosystem. This study aimed to determine the impact of coastal damage to the mangrove ecosystem in Karawang coastal areas. The mangrove degradation was identified from changes in mangrove covered area by utilizing data from several Landsat TM satellite imagery and ground check equipped with GPS and Google Earth applications. Data from the inventory of mangrove area issued by the Perhutani of KPH Purwakarta 2017 were also used as supplement in determining the extent of destruction. From satellite imagery, the mangrove area in 2017 was 258 hectares. This area was only approximately 3% of the total area of mangrove protected areas assigned by the Regency Spatial Plan. Compared to the condition in 2009, the coastal destruction was significant. The worst mangrove degradation occurred in the sub-districts of Cibuaya, Tempuran, and Cilamaya Wetan. The coastal communities were aware of the problem. They understood that this problem was caused by coastal abrasion and land use change, wild catch, milkfish and shrimp aquaculture, salt ponds, rice farms, and tourism.

AB  - Monitoring of rice field, as a place for producing paddy is very important to realize one aspect of food security, namely food availability. Modern agriculture has been widely utilize remote sensing data, especially optical images for monitoring agricultural land in various aspects of land management. However, the use of optical images is hampered by cloud cover when monitoring rice fields because most of them located in tropical countries, so there is an alternative to using SAR imagery that has ability to penetrate clouds. One of the SAR image products is Sentinel-1A with band C on its sensors which was launched in 2014 and the data can be utilized by the wider community for free. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of multitemporal Sentinel-1A SAR imagery in identifying paddy and non-paddy in Bantul Regency's agriculture field which was measured through its mapping accuracy. Sentinel-1A multi-temporal images with ten recording dates from February to May 2018 were used as the main data for this study. The method used is a digital classification with two approaches i.e. parametric with MLC algorithm and non-parametric with k-NN algorithm. In addition, the Sentinel-1A, which consists of VV and VH polarization, performed in three classification schemes (VV multi-temporal, VH multi-temporal, and VV&VH multi-temporal). The classification results show that multi-temporal Sentinel-1A can be used to identify paddy and non-paddy crops with an accuracy of 77.69% (VV multi-temporal-MLC), 82.15% (VH multi-temporal-MLC), 88.45% (VV&VH multi-temporal-MLC), 76.64% (VV multi-temporal-kNN), 78.47% (VH multi-temporal-kNN) and 79.52% (VV&VH multi-temporal-kNN).

TI  - RELIGIOUS FAITH: EXISTENTIAL-ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEANINGS
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The aim of this article is to analyse the essential features of religious faith as an existential-personalistic model of the formation of a person, his worldview orientations and activities. This requires a consistent solution of the following tasks: a) to focus on different approaches to understanding the phenomenon of "religious faith" (as a problem of principled openness, incompleteness of a person; as the problem of "I-Other" relations; as a problem of synthesis of the human and the divine, etc.); b) to reveal the spiritual potential of religious faith, its capabilities in boundary situations. Theoretical basis. The author thinks that the interpretation of religious faith as confidence in the invisible is unsatisfactory, one-sided and superficial. Religious faith is the existential, due to which a person overcomes the contradictions between finiteness and infinity. It is the construct of the human spirit, which makes its way into the transcendental realm. In this context, religious faith is a kind of criterion for the "growth" of the "human" in human, the criterion of his spirituality and humanity. Religious faith, being an integral part of human existence, gives it irrational dimensions, makes the possibility of impossible. The existential potential of religious faith serves as the "fulcrum" of a person, thanks to which he self-actualizes, self-fulfills and forms a certain worldview model. Originality. The author has proved that religious faith, which is the projective model of a person, turns out to be one of the possible ways to solve its existential problems, as it concerns not only the nature of the essential characteristics, the properties of the Divine itself but also the ultimate foundations of person in all the uniqueness and specificity of his being. Conclusions. Religious faith, acting as a factor in human activity, builds his value-worldview model of the world. Faith deals with the "ultimate" problems of human existence since it is of exceptional importance in solving life-meaning issues of human existence. The existential experience of the believer acquires the status of an event that opens up a field of new possibilities, a new spiritual experience. The accumulative effect of such experience forms the spiritual and value priorities of human existence, sets certain coordinates of his vital activity, due to which he self-determines, being in dialogue with the Absolute. Religious faith, unfolding as a permanent process of "search and finding" opens the "code" of transcendence, a new level of relations of the Human and Divine.

AB  - We present a novel approach for detailed crop type and tree species classification exploiting high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2A data. Here, we address the challenge of frequent cloud coverage in satellite observations by defining, purely data driven, adaptable time periods to create image composites from training pixels. A set of composites from all established time periods within the classification year serve as multi-temporal input data for an adaptable classification approach that uses multiple random forest models for a Germany-wide pixel-based land-use classification. For crop types, we achieved an overall classification accuracy of 88.5 %. The same method will be applied for nationwide tree species mapping. A pre-study on tree species identification showed an an overall accuracy of 74.7 %. The map was used to define tree species composition to better determing conservation status of forests.

TI  - Assessment of solar PV power potential over Asia Pacific region with remote sensing considering meteorological factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of solar radiation (SR) is one of the most important required inputs for the estimation of photovoltaic (PV) power station output. Meanwhile, the efficiency of solar PV systems is affected by meteorological factors such as temperature, dust, precipitation, and snow. Meteorological data from satellites provide a viable way for estimating PV potential due to its advantage in spatial coverage and temporal resolution. This paper presents a new approach to adjust SR data from satellites based on the cloud optical thickness (CLOT) before evaluating the solar PV power (P-PV) potential, with the effective efficiency of solar cells computed based on temperature, dust, precipitation, and snow. The objective of this study is to evaluate the over-all spatiotemporal solar PV potential in the Asia Pacific region which will holistically include limiting meteorological factors and identify which factor contributes most significantly to the decrease in solar PV potential in selected cities in the region. First, SR and CLOT data from Advanced Himawari Imager 8 and a SKYNET station were processed to derive the correction factor for solar radiation data. Second, satellite data for temperature (MOD11), precipitation (global satellite mapping of precipitation), dust (MOD04), and snow cover (MOD10) were processed to derive the effective solar PV efficiency. Finally, maps showing the seasonal PV power potential over the Asia Pacific region were generated, with selected cities zoomed in for detailed analysis using mean monthly values from March 2016 to February 2017. The results showed that the maximum theoretical P-PV in the region was estimated to be 1.9GW per 17.5km2 effective pixel area. Moreover, P-PV decreased by maximum values of 180 MW, 550 MW, and 225MW due to temperature, dust, and snow, respectively. For Beijing, Tokyo, and Jakarta, the major contributor to the decrease in P-PV is dust, while Khabarovsk is consistently affected by snow effects. Initial validation of the model shows over-and underestimation of solar PV output compared to the actual values by as high as 30%. However, very high values of coefficient of determination (> 0.90) show promising results of the model. The contribution of this study is two-fold: regional-scale assessment of P-PV potential and investigation of the collective effect and individual contributions of dust, temperature, and snow to the decrease in P-PV potential.

AB  - Land cover change is a dynamic phenomenon addressing environmental issues including natural calamities. Recent advancements in geospatial technology and availability of remote sensor data have fostered monitoring and mapping of land cover changes more precisely. Remote sensing is widely used where emerging research findings are focused mainly on coastal hazard studies. Tropical cyclones being an extreme weather event are more powerful and hazardous to southern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Aftermath of the cyclone is extreme causing land cover changes like defoliation, water logging, destruction of cultivable lands, plantations shrub vegetation, dissolving salt pans etc. The tropical cyclones are fierce to devastate the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu and make it a prey to these cyclones. In this paper, an attempt has been made to assess the pre and post cyclonic land cover change by utilizing potential microwave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset. The study portrays the occurrence of a severe cyclonic storm named `Gaja' that was formed over Bay of Bengal which hit Tamil Nadu on 15th of November 2018 causing high death toll and demolition. The study focuses on the pre and post damage assessment provoked by Gaja cyclone. For analysis, a methodical procedure was followed by utilizing the Sentinel 1 SAR dataset. Random Forest (RF) classifier approach was incorporated for mapping land cover types as it reduces the variance among the classes thus yielding accurate predictions. Results demonstrate that classified imagery using dual polarization SAR dataset outperforms well for RF classifier thus escalating the overall accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article makes an attempt of a comparative analysis of foundations of religious and philosophical ideas of the Russian and English writers. It discusses the ideas of Tolstoy and Huxley about religion and the religious truth, the unity of God, world and man, about time and eternity, the features of their understanding the divine basis. The analysis draws on the texts of the later period of Tolstoy's work, including the collections of thoughts of the writer ("Circle of Reading", "For Every Day", "Path of Life"), his diaries and letters, as well as Huxley's texts of the 1940s-1960s (the novels "Time Must Have a Stop", "The Island", the collection "Perennial Philosophy", his essayistic texts "Doors of Perception", "Heaven and Hell"). The article traces a similarity in the approaches of the two classics which manifested itself in a specific religious and philosophical synthesis based on addressing traditions of the eastern and western thought. It is possible to speak about a specific extraconfessional approach of Tolstoy and Huxley, who made use of Hindu scriptures, Taoist literature, Sufism, Christian mystics of the Middle Ages and Modern Time, the Quakers, etc. The idea of the unity of man and the world, of all the living, played a prominent role in forming the shape of Tolstoy's and Huxley's worldviews. This was one of the key ideas in Tolstoy's religious and philosophical work. Perceiving the identity of the source of life in people and in everything living, a specific perception of the Hindu tat tvam asi (the identity of Atman and Brahman), was expressed by Tolstoy both in his diaries and his literary works. The same idea made up the foundation of the "Perennial Philosophy" by Huxley. The two thinkers followed a rational approach to the sources and believed in the existence of the single religious truth and the possibility for every person of assimilating it. Tolstoy and Huxley emphasised the role of the personal religious experience, the movement of the person towards internalising the truth, whereas such factors as specifi c confession, theological details, belonging to a certain cultural and religious traditions were seen as less important, compared with the approach of the believer to the religious ideal.

AB  - Natural Resources Canada is in the process of defining spatial resolution requirements for a national scale optical imagery service. This study aims to evaluate the impact of spatial resolution on residential buildings extraction accuracy in an urban context. The hypothesis is that as spatial resolution gets coarser, there will be a decrease in successful identification. A 3-band Worldview-3 image was used for a study site located in Toronto, Canada. Buildings were manually extracted independently by specialized technicians for five different resolutions ranging from 30 cm to 2.5 m. Results show similar extraction accuracy between 0.3 m and 0.7 m (>90%). There is a significant decrease in accuracy for resolutions of 1 m and coarser. The study demonstrates that a spatial resolution of 0.7 m or better is required for accurate building extraction in an urban context.

The purpose of the article is to reveal the meaning-forming role of images of "home" (closed space), "path" (open space), "threshold", "gate", "window" (border space) and the besieged Leningrad (extreme space) in the artistic picture of the world of the poet. The research shows how the traditional image of the house in Bergholz's work at first opens the boundaries to the outside world, thanks to the actualization of "threshold" places, then turns into anti-home (prison "minus"-space), and later models as a social space, transforming from "mine" into "ours", and expands its boundaries to the city. Since wartime, the blockade Leningrad becomes the main representative spatial parameter in Bergholz's artistic picture of the world. The topos of Leningrad is assigned in the texts by a well-defined geographical space and in a specific historical time, which is constantly emphasized by the author at the level of the titles of her works. At the same time, geographically-specific image of Leningrad turns into a city-symbol, generating new meanings in the works of Muse of the siege. In a film story They Lived in Leningrad the city is presented as three-dimensional, panoramic, "widescreen"; in the same name play the spatial images are cut down, the conflict gets a psychological implication and refers to an "inner man", the private space of the besieged city-dweller. In the Last wording of the play Born in Leningrad the city is actualized as the place of the second birth of the besieged city-dweller. Leningrad in the poem February Diary is identified as an extreme space in which a person is characterized by the fullest sense of being. Leningrad in the late lyrics is modeled through the mythologemes "father", "home" and "path": whereupon, the "home" and "path" are no longer in opposition, "home" and "city" are recognized as identical, and the statement "Leningrad-father" is given in line with the idea of the play Born in Leningrad. The semantics of space revealed in the article, is of great importance in understanding of Bergholz's fate drama and her self-realization as a writer of the Soviet era.

AB  - This paper deals with an example of synergy between numerical weather models and Sentinel data. The example concerns the incorporation of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-3 derived products in a high spatial resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) model operating at cloud resolving grid spacing. The rationale is that NWP models are presently able to produce forecasts with a spatial resolution in the order of 1 km, but unreliable surface information or poor knowledge of the initial state of the atmosphere may produce an inaccurate simulation of the weather phenomena. In this context, the Copernicus Sentinel satellites represent an important source of data, because they provide a set of high spatial resolution observations of physical variables (e.g. soil moisture, land/sea surface temperature, wind speed) used in NWP models runs. This paper presents the first results of one experiment of ingestion/assimilation of surface information derived from Sentinel data into a NWP model. The experiment concerns a flood event occurred in Tuscany (Central Italy) in September 2017.

AB  - The utility of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to produce flood delineation maps is well established. However, flood mapping still represents a challenge in urban settlements, because the radar signatures of flooded urban pixels are generally ambiguous. As a matter of fact, flood mapping algorithms generally do not consider urban areas, thus producing a lot of missed detection errors. Recent studies demonstrated that SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents a suitable tool to at least mitigate this problem. Following these studies, here we analyze time series of complex coherence data in stable scatterers, i.e., pixels exhibiting high backscatter combined with high temporal stability. Our idea is based on the fact the water surfaces show no coherence in a repeat-pass interferogram, so that a decrease of coherence may occur even for stable scatterers if floodwater is present in a resolution cell. The analysis was performed considering the floods that hit the city of Alicante (Spain) in March 2017. This event was observed by Sentinel-1 in Interferometric Wide Swath mode.

TI  - EVALUATION OF CLOUD TYPE CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SPLIT WINDOW ALGORITHM USING HIMAWARI-8 SATELLITE DATA

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - Precise evaluation of cloud types is indispensable for the detailed analysis of the Earth's radiation budget. The split window algorithm (SWA) is an algorithm that has been widely employed for cloud type classification from meteorological satellite imagery. In this study, we apply the SWA to analyze the clouds that appear in the Japan area using the imagery of Himawari-8 meteorological satellite. The brightness temperature (BT) information from band 13 (BT13, 10 mu m) and band 15 (BT15, 12 mu m) are employed with the BT difference (BTD) between these two bands (BTD13-15). For daytime analysis, the albedo of band 1 (0.47 mu m) is also used to discriminate the cloudy and cloud-free areas. The validation of the resulting cloud type (SWA13-15), which includes ten classes including cloud-free condition, is carried out using the space-borne lidar data concurrent with the satellite observations. In addition, two different classifiers, namely, the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers are tested with the results of SWA. When about 10% of 2 million data points are used for training the classifiers, the test results reveal that the correctly classified points are 97.0% and 89.5% for the first dataset (observed in July 2015) and 97.4%, and 92.1% for the second dataset (July 2016) for SMO and NB, respectively.

CP  - 6th Swiss Conference on Data Science (SDS)
CL  - Bern, SWITZERLAND
AB  - The ongoing advancements in deep learning, and exemplary results obtained for different problems using spatio-temporal satellite images, have made deep neural networks quite popular for analysing Earth Observation data. The deep learning models have the capability to learn complex features from the dataset available, and specific to the problem at hand. In this research, the aim is to classify field parcels in images from the Sentinel-2A satellite and identify the corresponding crops using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To obtain a good classification network, the mandatory requirement is clean and reliably labelled data, which is a challenging task in real world applications. What if the labels are not reliable due to manual errors or due to the complexity of annotating data?The purpose of this project is to design a pipeline to verify the reliability of the data with minimum supervision and then, use the clean data to train the network for the classification problem at hand. Experiments on different crop types (Wheat, Maize, and Legumes) have shown excellent results in distinguishing a variety from others. The pixel-level classifier model not only allows training of the model with limited available data but also gives an advantage of further analysing the crop area on a sub-parcel level. The proposed approach for detection and classification of vegetation types creates a new possibility in handling Big Data in the domain of Earth Observation with a multitude of potential applications in the areas of precision and smart agriculture, pre-emptive forest management, health monitoring, and damage assessment. The presented pipeline shows the significance of data verification and provides an efficient way to create models by optimizing the efforts, and the time of both engineers and experts.

AB  - Satellite monitoring thermal stress on the coral reef is of fundamental importance to understand coral bleaching phenomenon. The new phenomenon of global coral bleaching events is caused highly visual indicator of ocean warming. The rise in global ocean warming generated by climate change and satellite provides an important role in the detection of reef scale thermal stress and changing significant shifts in ocean temperature that cause coral bleaching phenomenon. Surveys conducted at four Island in Western Indonesia region (Bintan Island, Batam Island, Lingga Island and Natuna Island). Satellite data from Aqua and Terra MODIS were used to evaluate the relative importance of bleaching pattern from 2015 to 2016 during the incidence of coral bleaching. Ncdf4 R-analysis and Ocean Data View (ODV) were used to comparison analysis SST anomaly dataset from Aqua and Terra MODIS. To assess the impact of bleaching phenomena on coral communities using photo quadrats with 50 meters transect line at 1 m intervals in sixty-three sampling site (14 sites in Bintan Island, 11 sites in Lingga Island, 19 sites in Natuna Island and 19 Site in Batam Island). Each photograph was analysed in Coral Point Count program with Excel extensions (CPCe). The raw point data from all photographs on a transect line were combined to calculate the percent cover of bleaching phenomena. The percent bleaching incidence during 2015 - 2016 event resulted in positive temperature anomalies above the warmest monthly climatology value of currently increasing Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at 1 degrees C - 2 degrees C on bleaching phenomenon site. Thermal satellite data from Aqua and Terra Modis showed significant related increasing anomaly SST from 2015 and 2016 where coral bleaching occur 34.57% in Bintan Island, 6.56% in Lingga Island, 0,95% in Natuna Island and 10,07% in Batam island, respectively.

AB  - Satellite-based rainfall estimation is evolving rapidly. Most studies use data, which is spatially fine, but poorly regarding time. On the other hand, availability of verification data is also quite rare. This study used Hillman Form B report that was corrected by ME-48 from Malang Climatological Station. 2009-2016 IR1 satellite data were used in hourly temporal resolution (only less than 3% data missing). Four estimation methods were compared: Auto Estimator, CST, mCST, and Quantile Analysis Equation. Data processing was carried out using Python and R statistic as a quality control. The analysis was done by creating a graph that combines False Alarm and Miss Information for each rainfall intensity. Binary transformation was done for enabling information to be plotted. All rainfall estimation methods have a high false alarm (more than 74% at 1 mm) but quite low miss (less than 0.03%). By taking into account its error pattern, satellite data can be used in rainfall observation. The Quantile equation is slightly superior to other methods. This study is relatively inexpensive to be duplicated so it can be used as an evaluation tool for rainfall estimation best practice for Meteorological and Climatological Agency's network.

AB  - Volcanic ash is a significant phenomenon towards aviation safety and capacity of influencing climate change. Therefore, accurate information of the volcanic ash spatial distribution in the atmosphere possessed a fundamental role in the community. Polar type satellites such as Terra / Aqua equipped with MODIS sensors are capable of providing vivid imagery of the volcanic ash spatial distribution. However, the deficiency of this satellite is unable to perform optimal imagery for real-time monitoring due to its limitation require to be located above the volcanic ash site. Therefore, a geostationary satellite is a feasible solution to solve this issue hence its capability to observe specified fixed location continuously. Despite its capability, this type of satellite also performs designated weaknesses hence non-absolute perpendicularity observation angles on certain conditions towards the observed objects from the satellite fixed position. The purpose of this study is to create an automatic detection system using Himawari-8 satellite observations data by applying Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with training datasets and utilizing Terra / Aqua polar type satellite with MODIS sensors as validator. The input variation based on previous research references were using three bands, all bands, and four variations of satellite bands. The result of the study justifies the models established using all bands and four variation bands can produce good performances in training data, although less consistent if applied towards other cases. While the singlepixel model with three-band input well suited over Mt. Merapi volcanic eruption event on June 1st, 2018 with 93.71% accuracy

AB  - Clusters of galaxies are the most massive structures in the Universe, confined together in gravitationally bound systems with typical mass in the range of 10(13) M-circle dot-10(15) M-circle dot. Clusters of galaxies may be considered as self-similar, meaning that the properties of low mass clusters can be scaled up from the properties of more massive clusters, and vice versa. Clusters of galaxies have been thought to have standard mass fraction of gas, independent of their redshifts or total masses, and therefore proposed to be used as "standard buckets".The purpose of this work is to check the validity of clusters of galaxies as standard buckets by studying larger sample than those analysed by Mantz et al. (2014). The data set employed here consists of Chandra observations of 47 relaxed clusters at redshift 0.069 <= z <= 1.063. The results of this study show that compared to the differential gas fraction (f(gas,diff)), the cumulative gas mass fractions (f(gas,2500)) of the total sample of clusters are less dependent to the total mass M-2500 and redshift. Relation between gas mass fraction and total mass M-2500 suggests that massive clusters are more reliable to be used as standard buckets.

AB  - Skipjack tuna is a typical tropical tuna species with very large potential, so that it becomes the main target among Bone Gulf fishermen. Oceanographic factor anomalies have an impact on the distribution and abundance of skipjack tuna. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between satellite data of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) anomalies and, skipjack tuna catch and distribution. Using the remote sensing data from May to August 2012-2018, we analyzed the SST and chl-a anomalies. The oceanographic and skipjack tuna Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) data, we identified their relationship using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The results of this study indicated that positive and negative anomalies have occurred where SST ranging from -0.8 - 0.6 degrees C and, chl-a ranging from -0.06 - 0.08 mg m-3 during the study period. We found that the anomalies of both oceanographic factors influenced a shift in the distribution pattern of Skipjack tuna in the coastal waters of Bone Gulf. The SST and chl-a anomalies were statistically significant factors affecting skipjack tuna abundance. This study suggests that these variables play an important role in developing tuna fisheries management and conservation.

TI  - Comparing Land-cover Maps Accuracies Generated from Multispectral Classification of Landsat-8 OLI dan Pleiades Images using Two Different Classification Schemes

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Multispectral classification is one of the main methods in the analysis and processing of digital remotely sensed imagery, which until now is still widely used to generate land-cover/ land-use information. Technically, pixel-based classification methods rely on conventional approaches, as compared to GeoBIA, and it can be implemented using either supervised or unsupervised methods. The classification methods are supported by the rapid development of various image processing software, which provide a wide variety of algorithm options, so that the classification process can be carried out easily. Although relatively simple, an appropriate selection of multispectral classification algorithm may provide highly accurate land-cover maps. However, the highly accurate land-cover/land-use maps may also be influenced by image types and classification schemes that are used in the study. This study aimed to compare the results of the multispectral classification using maximum likelihood algorithm, for generating land-cover maps based on Landsat-8 OLI images (30 meters) and Pleiades imagery (2 meters). The classification referred to two different classification schemes relating to spectral and spatial dimensions. The results showed that the multispectral classification with spectral-related classification scheme applied to Pleiades imagery gave higher overall accuracy as compared to that of Landsat-8 OLI. It was also found that the highest overall accuracy achieved in this study was 81.7%, obtained using Pleiades imagery and referring to spectral dimension classification scheme. On the other hand, the lowest overall accuracy was obtained by the same imagery applied using spatial-related dimension. The relatively similar values of low overall accuracy for spatial-related dimension was also gained by Landsat-8 OLI imagery, proving that multispectral classification does not work well for spatial-related land cover classification scheme.

AB  - The rapid growth of computer technology, earth observation sensors and GIS science led to the development of advanced satellite imagery analysis method named OBIA (Object Based Image Analysis), which is recognized as an alternative to the traditional pixel-based methods. Although initially applied to high spatial resolution imagery to minimize salt-and-pepper effect of pixel-oriented classification, the OBIA is now beginning to be widely applied to medium-even low-spatial resolution. It is because OBIA works on a relatively homogenous object resulted by image segmentation, whereas pixel-based take into account of individual pixel to be classified as a member of certain type of LULC (land use/land cover). As a group of pixels, various characteristics of segmented object using in OBIA namely mean value, standard deviation, ratio, etc. can be calculated; besides there are shape and texture features of the objects available to be gauged for differentiating LULC within similar spectral information, which potentially resulting higher accuracies of LULC maps. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of OBIA applied to Landsat 8 imagery for spectral and spatial dimensions of Danoedoro's LULC classification system, and we compare them with those provided by the pixel-based method using maximum likelihood algorithm. Observation results revealed that OBIA could improve the overall accuracy of LULC maps both in Spectral and Spatial dimension by more than 10% for both schemes.

TI  - Simulation of snow accumulation and melting in the Kama river basin using data from global prognostic models
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the improvement of numerical models of weather forecasting allows using them for hydrological problems, including calculations of snow water equivalent (SWE) or snow storage. In this paper, we discuss the applicability of daily precipitation forecasts for three global atmospheric models: GFS (USA), GEM (Canada) and PL-AV (Russia) for calculating snow storage (SWE) in the Kama river basin for the cold season of 2017-2018. As the main components of the balance of snow storages the following parameters were taken into account: precipitation (with regard for the phase); snow melting during thaws; evaporation from the surface of the snow cover; interception of solid precipitation by forest vegetation. The calculation of snow accumulation and melting was based on empirical methods and performed with the GIS technologies. The degree-day factor was used to calculate snowmelt intensity, and snow sublimation was estimated by P.P. Kuz'min formula. The accuracy of numerical precipitation forecasts was estimated by comparing the results with the data of 101 weather stations. Materials of 40 field and 27 forest snow-measuring routes were taken into account to assess the reliability of the calculation of snow storages (SWE). During the snowmelt period, the part of the snow-covered area of the basin was also calculated using satellite images of Terra/Aqua MODIS on the basis of the NDFSI index. The most important result is that under conditions of 2017/18 the mean square error of calculating the maximum snow storage by the GFS, GEM and PL-AB models was less than 25% of its measured values. It is difficult to determine which model provides the maximum accuracy of the snow storage calculation since each one has individual limitations. According to the PL-AV model, the mean square error of snow storage calculation was minimal, but there was a significant underestimation of snow accumulation in the mountainous part of the basin. According to the GEM model, snow storages were overestimated by 10-25%. When calculating with use of the GFS model data, a lot of local maximums and minimums are detected in the field of snow storages, which are not confirmed by the data of weather stations. The main sources of uncertainty in the calculation are possible systematic errors in the numerical forecasts of precipitation, as well as the empirical coefficients used in the calculation of the intensity of snowmelt and evaporation from the snow cover surface.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Pesticides is considered one of the most hazardous compounds that caused serious health implications to man and environment. However, their use is perquisite to guarantee a high yield especially, for greenhouse cucumber production. In fact, the process success depend on spraying coverage, rate and early detection of infection symptoms. In this study, a novel remote sensing approach for detecting Powdery Mildew symptoms in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) leaves has been developed. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. An unmanned vehicle platform used to carry the remote sensing sensors. Infected leaves were then analyzed using a pioneer image processing model. In this model, leaves were classified according to different feature especially, the reflect color. Image processing results were then assessed using ground reference data (lab analysis). The accuracy assessment of remotely-sensed data was ground reference data were comparable. Because changes in infected leaves associated with the imagery model data, we conclude that remotely-sensed data derived from the unmanned vehicle sensor data hold promise for detecting Powdery Mildew symptoms in cucumber leaves.

TI  - Assessment of the health impact of paper mulberry (<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i> <i>L</i>.), an invasive plant species in Islamabad, Pakistan
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the risk of pollen allergy due to paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera L.), an Asian invasive plant species now common in large parts of the world. Pollen plays a key role in the pathogenesis of respiratory allergic diseases, particularly rhinitis and asthma, and Islamabad, a major metropolitan city, is severely affected by allergy owing to B. papyrifera pollen. Due to its seasonality and other relationships with climatic variables, we used remote sensing to monitor the trend of pollen count. We also mapped the localisation of patients affected by pollen allergy using geographic information systems. The maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to SPOT-5 satellite imagery for land use/land cover classification. Temporal analysis of remotely sensed data revealed an increasing trend of paper mulberry density towards the southern and south-western part of Islamabad. Although not evident during rainfall, a clear positive correlation was found between patient count and pollen count. Field survey data and hotspot spatial analysis of allergy patients revealed that residents of Shakerperiyan and Lok Virsa areas (Sectors H-8, I-8, I-9, G-8, G-7 and G-6 in Islamabad) had more pronounced symptoms compared to residents of other sectors. The methodology adopted used in this study can be used to map the distribution of similar invasive species in other parts of the country.

AB  - 3D radiative transfer modeling in forest canopies is of great importance to upscale leaf level observations to canopy level, which, however, is particularly difficult in heterogeneous areas due to the complexity of forests. A common solution is to use physically based radiative transfer models. In this paper, we parameterized the LESS (LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework) model through a voxel-based reconstruction of airborne LiDAR data. For that, an airborne spectral image was simulated and compared with actual ASIA hyperspectral image. The results show a good agreement with R-squared being 0.5 and 0.56 for near infrared and red band, respectively. This demonstrates that the proposed voxel-based parameterization approach can successfully capture the fine-scale structures of forest canopies, and it can provide reliable data source for 3D radiative transfer models.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characteristics of Qinghai Lake ice phenology between 2000 and 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice phenology is considered a sensitive indicator of regional climate change. We utilized time series information of this kind extracted from a series of multi-source remote sensing (RS) datasets including the MOD09GQ surface reflectance product, Landsat TM/ETM+ images, and meteorological records to analyze spatiotemporal variations of ice phenology of Qinghai Lake between 2000 and 2016 applying both RS and GIS technology. We also identified the climatic factors that have influenced lake ice phenology over time and draw a number of conclusions. First, data show that freeze-up start (FUS), freeze-up end (FUE), break-up start (BUS), and break-up end (BUE) on Qinghai Lake usually occurred in mid-December, early January, mid-to-late March, and early April, respectively. The average freezing duration (FD, between FUE and BUE), complete freezing duration (CFD, between FUE and BUS), ice coverage duration (ICD, between FUS and BUE), and ablation duration (AD, between BUS and BUE) were 88 days, 77 days, 108 days and 10 days, respectively. Second, while the results of this analysis reveal considerable differences in ice phenology on Qinghai Lake between 2000 and 2016, there has been relatively little variation in FUS times. Data show that FUE dates had also tended to fluctuate over time, initially advancing and then being delayed, while the opposite was the case for BUS dates as these advanced between 2012 and 2016. Overall, there was a shortening trend of Qinghai Lake's FD in two periods, 2000-2005 and 2010-2016, which was shorter than those seen on other lakes within the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau. Third, Qinghai Lake can be characterized by similar spatial patterns in both freeze-up (FU) and break-up (BU) processes, as parts of the surface which freeze earlier also start to melt first, distinctly different from some other lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. A further feature of Qinghai Lake ice phenology is that FU duration (between 18 days and 31 days) is about 10 days longer than BU duration (between 7 days and 20 days). Fourth, data show that negative temperature accumulated during the winter half year (between October and the following April) also plays a dominant role in ice phenology variations of Qinghai Lake. Precipitation and wind speed both also exert direct influences on the formation and melting of lake ice cover and also cannot be neglected.

AB  - Seismicity-related anomaly analysis or earthquake precursor cognition is a great challenge for geo-electromagnetic signals mining and remote sensing application. To mining seismic anomaly from satellite data including microwave data is of extreme importance. A spatio-temporally weighted two-step method (STW-TSM) is developed to retrieve or to mine seismicity-related microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomaly with microwave satellite big data from Aqua AMSR-E and/or FY-3B MWRI sensors. To remove the general trend of MBT to retrieve basic MBT residuals of the shocking year, historical microwave data were given varied time-weights according to respective time intervals with the shocking year. To eliminate the regional meteorological noise so as to retrieve cleaned MBT residuals actually related with seismic activities, adjacent pixels inside the seismic preparation zone were endowed with varied space-weights according to Euclidean distances away from the epicenter With Wenchuan earthquake sequence in May, 2008 and Nepal earthquake sequence in April and May, 2015 being case studies, this paper demonstrated the practical application of STW-TSM. Results showed that 1) significant strip-shaped MBT anomalies appeared near the epicenter of Wenchuan earthquake days before the main shocking and migrated with aftershocks moving northeastward 2) the horizontal strip MBT anomalies covered exactly the epicenters and seismic concentration zone of Nepal earthquakes during shocking days 3) the MBT anomaly zones behaved highly spatial overlap with geological quaternary strata and cliff-shaped mountainous region. The mined MBT anomalies are supposed to be related with the effects of rock dielectric constant variation, which is most likely to be caused by crust stress activated positive electricity carriers from deep crustal. This research is of particular meanings for mining MBT anomaly from satellite microwave big data, and for searching geo-electromagnetic signals related with seismicity.

TI  - Combined Effects of Precipitation and Temperature on the Responses of Forest Spring Phenology to Winter Snow Cover Dynamics in Northeast China
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The start date of vegetation growing season (SOS) is generally considered as an essential indicator to reflect vegetation growth condition. To date, relatively little research has explored the combined effects of temperature and precipitation on the responses of forest spring phenology to snow cover in detail. To investigate this, we applied the developed plant phenology index (PPI) derived from Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate SOS over Northeast China from 2004 to 2018, and explored the relationship between SOS and climate variables, such as temperature, precipitation and snow cover. Our results indicated that winter snow cover dynamics had a significant effect on the forest spring growth in the following year. SOS showed a negative correlation with snow cover duration (SCD) and the ending date of snow cover (SCED), whereas had a positive correlation with the onset date of snow cover (SCOD). It implied that a longer SCD, later SCED and earlier SCOD would promote forest growth. Furthermore, we first revealed that SOS was more closely associated with the preseason temperature than winter temperature. Most regions exhibited a significant positive correlation with increasing preseason temperature, but the winter temperature showed an opposite pattern except for the cool-temperate needleleaf forest region. Meanwhile, SOS had a negative relationship with precipitation, especially for preseason precipitation. Furthermore, with increasing of temperature and precipitation in winter, the responses of SOS to snow cover phenology in temperate needleleaf and broadleaf mixed-forest region are contrary to that in the other three regions. During the period from SCED to SOS, the responses of SOS to snow cover phenology varied among different vegetation zones and the gradients of temperature and precipitation.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The onset date of spring phenology (SOS) is regarded as a key parameter for understanding and modeling vegetation-climate interactions. Inner Mongolia has a typical temperate grassland vegetation ecosystem, and has a rich snow cover during winter. Due to climate change, the winter snow cover has undergone significant changes that will inevitably affect the vegetation growth. Therefore, improving our ability to accurately describe the responses of spring grassland vegetation phenology to winter snow cover dynamics would enhance our understanding of changes in terrestrial ecosystems due to their responses to climate changes. In this study, we quantified the spatial-temporal change of SOS by using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1982 to 2015, and explored the relationships between winter snow cover, climate, and SOS across different grassland vegetation types. The results showed that the SOS advanced significantly at a rate of 0.3 days/year. Winter snow cover dynamics presented a significant positive correlation with the SOS, except for the start date of snow cover. Moreover, the relationship with the increasing temperature and precipitation showed a significant negative correlation, except that increasing Tmax (maximum air temperature) and Tavg (average air temperature) would lead a delay in SOS for desert steppe ecosystems. Sunshine hours and relative humidity showed a weaker correlation.

AB  - Crop type identification refers to distinguishing certain crop from other landcovers, which is an essential and crucial task in agricultural monitoring. Satellite images is good data input for identifying different crops since satellites capture relatively wider area and more spectral information. Based on prior knowledge of crop's phenology, multi-temporal images are stacked to extract growth pattern of varied crops. In this paper, we proposed a machine learning model which combines generative and discriminative models and achieved averaged AP score of 0.903 over all tested crops and regions under the limitation of small dataset and label noise using satellite images taken at different times.

AB  - Ecosystem services are the important link between the ecological system and human welfare. Quantifying and predicting the changes of ecosystem service value (ESV) is an important tool to seek choices to manage natural and human-made capital more effectively and sustainably. This study aims to model and predict the impacts of future Land Use/Land Cover(LULC) changes on ESV in a coastal area suffering rapid process of urbanization of China, Qingdao. Based on Landsat images and random forest algorithm, LULC in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were mapped and classified. A cellular automaton (CA)-Markov model was used to simulate future LULC changes in 2025. ESVs was quantified and predicted based LULC data and a modified coefficient method. The total ESV of Qingdao decreased from 172.72 billion yuan in 1990 to 164.17 billion yuan in 2025, mainly due to the loss of farmland and grassland. The built-up land should be controlled to the occupation of farmland and grassland. The management of LULC should follow ecological protection rules to protect environment and achieve sustainable and balanced development.

AB  - The quick and accurate extraction of water bodies from images is imperative for land resources management, ecological protection, and flood disaster prevention. However, the prevalent methods for water body extraction of SAR imagery have the major issues of depending on expert experience, the poor retention of water-land boundaries, and a high false alarm rate. In this paper, focusing on these issues, we study the effectiveness of water body extraction using only simple polarimetric decomposition components and commonly used machine learning classifiers for Gaofen-3(GF-3) image. We test it using different sizes of training samples and compare it with the previous methods. The experimental results showed that the combination of polarimetric decomposition components and machine learning classifiers can achieve satisfactory accuracies in water body extraction of GF-3 image, and has strong robustness, reliability and high application value.

AB  - This paper presents a physics-based method to estimate all components of surface solar irradiance (SSI) from Himawari-8 imagery. Cloud parameters were retrieved from satellite data, and SSI calculated using radiative transfer through look-up-tables. Detailed validation using 3 years of high quality 1-minute surface measurements at 11 stations across Australia consistently showed low bias (<= 5 W/m(2)) across timescales for all SSI components, and rapidly reducing RMSE with increasing averaging period. Issues in validation using in-situ measurements will be discussed. We will also present an accurate analytical model for the calculation of circumsolar radiance applicable to clear and cloudy sky conditions.

AB  - Over the past few decades, climate warming and increasing human activities severely disrupted permafrost distribution in Qinghai-Tibet plateau. However, existing surveying tools and methods limit our research on permafrost over large areas. The formation of thaw lakes in permafrost areas has been strongly linked to the degradation of permafrost, which can be potentially identified in remote sensing images. For identifying and characterizing the spatial distribution of permafrost degradation, here we present a semi-automated method for thaw lake detection in permafrost area. The method mainly includes two steps: (1) Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) combined with multi-threshold for training samples generation and (2) Markov Random Field (MRF) for thaw lake detection. The proposed method was applied to detect thaw lakes from 10 m Sentinel-2 image in permafrost area of Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and the capability of rapid thaw lake detection over large areas. We consider this method may provide a technical support for future research in permafrost changes.

AB  - This paper proposes a framework to fuse multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images, with application on LCZ-derived urban land cover classification. Cross-validation over a seven-city study area in central Europe demonstrates its consistently better performance over several previous approaches, with the same experimental setup. Based on our previous work, we can conclude that decision-level fusion is better than feature-level fusion for similar tasks at similar scale with multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images. With the framework, urban land cover maps of several cities are produced. The visualization of two exemplary areas shows urban structures that are consistent with existing datasets. This framework can be also generally beneficial for other types of urban mapping.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of multi-spectral Sentinel-2 imagery for human settlement mapping, using deep learning based methods. We show first results of a study area in central Europe, with an attention-based ResNeXt to better exploit the spectral information. Reasonable mapping accuracy has been achieved, compared to the state-of-the-art products. Based on the results and comparison with the existing products, we discuss two interesting questions: how can human settlement mapping be made consistent with or complementary to the existing human settlement maps and how can further improvement in human settlement mapping be achieved by exploring deep learning-based approaches?

TI  - Making Landsat Time Series Consistent: Evaluating and Improving Landsat Analysis Ready Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has released a new dataset, called Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD), which is designed specifically for facilitating time series analysis. In this study, we evaluated the temporal consistency of this new dataset and recommended several processing streamlines for improving data consistency. Specifically, we examined the impacts of data resampling, cloud/cloud shadow detection, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) correction, and topographic correction on the temporal consistency of the Landsat Time Series (LTS). We have four major observations. First, single-resampled data (ARD) are generally more consistent than double-resampled data (re-projected Collection 1 data), but the difference is very minor. Second, the improved cloud and cloud shadow detection approach (e.g., Fmask 4.0 vs. 3.3) moderately increased data consistency. Third, BRDF correction contributed the most in making LTS consistent. Finally, we corrected the topographic effects by using several widely used algorithms, including Sun-Canopy-Sensor (SCS), a semiempirical SCS (SCS+C), and Illumination Correction (IC) algorithms, however they were found to have very limited or even negative impacts on the consistency of LTS. Therefore, we recommend using Landsat ARD with the improved cloud and cloud shadow detection approach (Fmask 4.0), and with BRDF correction for routine time series analysis.

TI  - Study of subsidence monitoring in Nanjing City with small-baseline InSAR approach
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface subsidence in Nanjing has become increasingly apparent because of the influence of geological conditions and the rapid progress of urbanization. Here, the theory of synthetic aperture radar interferometry is analysed, and a method based on the short baseline subset (SBAS) technology is proposed. The method can overcome time and baseline decorrelation and other factors, and it can extract points with high coherence from interferograms have short spatio-temporal baselines when the atmospheric delay phase and the noise phase in the frequency domain are used to differentiate the corresponding characteristics. The slow deformation ratio of the monitoring area over long periods can also be calculated by this method. In this study, the 16 advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) data acquired from 2007 to 2011 in Nanjing are processed by the SBAS technology and compared with levelling result. This work emphasizes that the SBAS technology could derive the cumulative deformations of surfaces and deformation fields accurately.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important indicator for climate change. Nowadays many sensors in orbit have the capacity of SST observations. Longterm climate data record of global SST requires satellite SST products with high accuracy and stability. In order to evaluate the quality of satellite SST products, proper collection of in situ sea surface skin temperature is needed. The infrared SST autonomous radiometer (ISAR) has been deployed on the research vessel Dong Fang Hong II of Ocean University of China since 2009. The ISAR data collected during five cruises are used to validate the Level-2 WST products from Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). The comparison results show negative bias of 0.085K and standard deviation of 0.356K. Due to the influence of the weather conditions and short temporal extent of the SLSTR L2 WST archived, only 148 match-ups are produced. Further studies will be carried out with more available data from in situ and satellites.

AB  - The Irrawaddy River is the largest river in Myanmar with its river delta as the country's agricultural center. It is of great significance to investigate river channel erosion and ecosystem evolution in such a river delta based on remote sensing. Thus, its river channel erosion/deposition and ecosystem evolution from 1970s to 2011 were analyzed based on Landsat and HJ satellite data through object-oriented supervised classification with the NDVI and NDWI threshold segmentation methods were used. The results show that river channel of Irrawaddy River from Burma Aung to the estuary delta hardly changes in 34 years while area of the estuary shoal is increasing slowly. An overall trend of continuously enlargement of cultivated land and urban land is found in the delta area with a gradually reduced forest land and wet land.

TI  - Insights into geological processes with CO<sub>2</sub> remote sensing - A review of technology and applications
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Geological CO2 degassing is a fundamental Earth process but still quite poorly understood, since a thorough quantification with conventional measurement techniques is challenging. Optical remote sensing techniques have the potential to extend conventional measurement capabilities, enabling new insights into processes related to Earth's CO2 degassing. This article provides an integrated and pragmatic overview of existing and future remote sensing approaches suitable for geological CO2 quantification and connects results from instrument research in optical remote sensing with possible applications in the Earth sciences. The paper aims to provide intercomparison by means of key parameters of very different remote sensing approaches. One of these parameters is the minimum detectable CO2 flux, which is estimated for each remote sensing method herein. This may be used to identify a remote sensing platform for a specific Earth science problem related to CO2 degassing. Six such prominent Earth science problems are detailed. Remote sensing technology for extraterrestrial CO2 degassing is briefly examined. With respect to established in situ measurements, the main benefits of remote sensing include a safe measurement distance, spatially inclusive probing and swift measurements, while the main shortcomings include a generally lower measurement precision and the lack of commercially available turnkey solutions. While all six Earth science problems examined in this review will benefit to some extent from CO2 remote sensing, remote sensing is unlikely to replace conventional in situ probing entirely in the near future, but can be seen as complementary to conventional measurement approaches. Earth science problems that could immediately benefit from CO2 remote sensing include a comprehensive survey of the significant but highly uncertain CO2 flux of the East African Rift System, comparing volcanic CO2 concentrations from satellite borne remote sensing with ground-based remote sensing, and integration of CO2 remote sensing data into automated volcanic unrest prediction.

AB  - Applications for intelligent transportation systems are springing up to bring many benefits to users during their journey through the use of vehicle traffic monitoring. However, testing and experimenting with real-world environments still poses a challenge for these applications since a realistic scenario of mobility is required. Typically, simulation tools use mobility trails to construct the network topology based on the mathematical formulation of a city mobility model, which attempts to emulate the real mobility of a given city. Another strategy is to use the real route of vehicles traveling to generate the model of mobility of a certain city; however, many studies available in the literature do not use the entire flow of vehicles that circulate in the city, acquiring data only of a small group of vehicles. Thus, in this work we intend to develop an infrastructure that would allow the extraction of the information of mobility from the vehicles of the countryside cities, in real time. This enables not only real-time vehicle monitoring but also the generation of traceability of real-time mobility. The results showed low battery consumption, as well as a low amount of mobile data usage.

TI  - Multi-temporal RapidEye Tasselled Cap data for land cover classification
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping can be seen as a key element to understand the spatial distribution of habitats and thus to sustainable management of natural resources. Multi-temporal remote sensing data are a valuable data source for land cover mapping. However, the increased amount of data requires effective machine learning algorithms and data compression approaches. In this study, the Random Forest and C 5.0 classification algorithms were applied to (1) a multi-temporal Tasselled-Cap-transformed, (2) top of atmosphere and (3) surface reflectance RapidEye time-series. The overall accuracies ranged from 91.44% to 91.80%, with only minor differences between algorithms and datasets. The McNemar test showed, however, significant differences between the Tasselled-Cap-transformed and untransformed mapping results in most cases. The temporal profiles for the Tasselled-Cap-transformed RapidEye data indicated a good separability between considered classes. The phenological profiles of vegetated surfaces followed a typical green-up curve for the Greenness Tasselled-Cap-index. A permutation-based variable importance measure indicated that late autumn should be considered as most important phenological phase contributing to the classification model performance. The results suggested that the RapidEye Tasselled Cap Transformation, which was designed for agricultural applications, can be an effective data compression tool, suitable to map heterogeneous landscapes with no measurable negative impact on classification accuracy.

AB  - In this experiment, the effect of Y2O3 and ZrO2 additions on the microstructure and cyclic oxidation resistance of 17-Cr ODS steel containing Al consolidated using spark plasma sintering method were studied. In addition, density, porosity and hardness were also observed. Four compositions of ferritic steels as Fe-17Cr-3.5Al-Ti-Y ('FP'), Fe-17Cr-3.5Al-Ti-Y-0.4Y(2)O(3) ('FY'), Fe-17Cr-3.5Al-Ti-Y-0.4ZrO(2) ('FZ'), and Fe-17Cr-3.5Al-Ti-Y-0.2Y(2)O(3)-0.2ZrO(2) ('FYZ') were prepared by mechanical alloying and followed by sintering at 1000 degrees C. Microstructure characteristics were observed for different aspect, viz. elemental distribution, composition, and phase identification. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 800 degrees C for 8 cycles. The results show that ZrO2 addition suppresses the formation of Y-Al-O clustering and promotes the formation of Y-Zr-O clustering and the enhancement of oxidation resistance of the alloy. However, in some condition it also has a deleterious effect on crack resistance. In contrast, the addition of Y2O3 decreases the oxidation resistance but increases the hardness.

TI  - A New Approach to Semantic Computing with Interval Matrix Decomposition for Interpreting Deforestation Phenomenon
T2  - INFORMATION MODELLING AND KNOWLEDGE BASES XXX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 28th International Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases (EJC)
CL  - Riga, LATVIA
AB  - Deforestation is a major problem in ecosystem degradation and one of the main sources of carbon emission to the atmosphere. The use of multi-temporal satellite remote sensing has proven to be effective means to monitor forest conditions on global scale. The effectiveness of the utilization of remotely sensed images will depend on the analysis model and parameter selection procedure to provide information that meets the requirements of deforestation monitoring. Here we demonstrate the ability of semantic computing for analyzing satellite images that applied to interpreting tropical deforestation. The typical semantic computing works for interpreting numerical or textual data. It still remains challenging for utilizing remote sensing images for environmental monitoring in semantic computing since the data is presented in interval value. Therefore, we proposed interval matrix decomposition for automatically generate semantic projection that address uncertain value in environmental parameters. In this study, independent dimensions of Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery (Landsat-8) and The Phased Array Type L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) were combined to create an integrated interpretation of environmental condition for a study area in the deforestation zone of global tropical forest. We proposed essential semantic interval-dimensions derived from heterogonous satellite images, combination of L-Band SAR and optical, namely: HV gamma-naught, red, green, blue, NIR, SWIR channel; and combinational features: soil temperature, soil moisture, temporal change density, temporal change velocity, shape and texture. Afterward, semantic computing is employed as analysis model to explain significant knowledge of deforestation activity. The experimental result shows that integrated independent dimensions from both the optical and SAR domains, has potential for presenting for aspect-based deforestation assessment and to enable the design of robust forest monitoring systems.

AB  - Statistical Downscaling (SD) is a model that uses satellite data from General Circulation Models (GCM), which in climatology are very useful in predicting climate for the next few decades. GCM data is generally ill-conditioned, which is high dimension and multicollinearity, so a special technique is needed to handle this poorly conditioned. One of the variable selection techniques and handling of multicollinearity which is currently highly developed is regularization techniques including Adaptive Lasso, where selective parameters are adaptive, which can differ for each regression coefficient. Until now, predictions of extreme rainfall in Indonesia have not used Adaptive Lasso in SD modeling. This paper aims to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) at moderate extreme (quantile 0.75) and high extreme rainfall (quantile 0.9 da 0.95) and handling poorly conditioned GCM data with Adaptive Lasso techniques and building predictive models of local rainfall by utilizing GCM data using the Bayes quantile regression model. Response in the form of monthly rainfall at Indramayu district, West Java Indonesia, and 49 explanatory variables in the form of GCM precipitation data in the period January 1981 - December 2013, which handled multicollinearity and variable selection using the Adaptive Lasso. The results are very satisfying with correlation between predicted and real data is above 0.91 for and the RMSEP is less than 50. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of the study is to obtain a quantitative assessment of soil type impact on the soil-vegetation system through the respective models. To achieve this goal, the vegetation cover of a habitat under Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive) for the 2016-2019 time period and the influence of climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) on the vegetation cover by applying Interim Ecological Monitoring (IEM) based on remotely-sensed data. Multispectral satellite data (MSI) from Sentinel-2 have been used for quantification of the soil-vegetation system. Various types of Vegetation Indices like Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soiled-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), have been estimated to determine the actual state of the vegetation cover. For tracking the "soil-vegetation" relation Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI) has been applied based on orthogonalization of satellite data from Sentinel-2. The results obtained are validated by interim ecological monitoring methodology (MIEM) for habitats and are expected to review habitat(s) trends for the indicated period and such for a near - future period. The study will demonstrate the benefits of IEM application for the purposes of reporting under art. 17 from Habitats Directive.

AB  - Indonesian Seas have an important role on the sea-air interaction in Indo-Pacific region. Makassar Strait is located in the center of Indonesian Seas and part of Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), which has been influenced due to the coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in Pacific and Indian Oceans, such as monsoon, El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The temporal and spatial variation of surface heat flux in Makassar Strait has been evaluated using the multi satellite dataset from 1984-2009. The remote sensing data with resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees obtained from Objectively Analyzed air-sea Fluxes (OAFlux) produced by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The results show that there is a seasonal fluctuation of surface heat flux related to the wind monsoon. The variation of the shortwave radiation and latent heat flux give a large contribution to the net surface heat flux that associated with ENSO and IOD events. In Makassar Strait, the variation of shortwave radiation and sea surface temperature (SST) is in a good agreement with the El-Nino/La-Nina events. There is a time lag between surface heat fluxes with the ENSO events.

TI  - An approach to retrieve BRDF from satellite and airborne measurements of surface-reflected radiance based on decoupling of atmospheric radiative transfer and surface reflection

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Bi-directional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) defines anisotropy of the surface reflection. It is required to specify the boundary condition for radiative transfer (RT) modeling. Measurements of reflected radiance by satellite- and air-borne sensors provide information about anisotropy of surface reflection. Atmospheric correction needs to be performed to derive BRDF from the reflected radiance. Common approach for BRDF retrievals consists of the use of kernel-based BRDF and RT modeling that needs to be done anew at every step of the iterative process. The kernels' weights are obtained by minimization of the difference between measured and modeled radiance. This study develops a new method of retrieving kernel-based BRDF that requires RT calculations to be done only once.The method employs the exact analytical expression of radiance at any atmospheric level through the solutions to two auxiliary atmosphere-only RT problems and the surface-reflected radiance at the surface level. The latter is related to BRDF and solutions to the auxiliary RT problems by a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The approach requires to perform RT calculations one time before the iterations. It can use observations taken at different atmospheric conditions assuming that surface conditions remain unchanged during the time span of observations. The algorithm accurately catches zero weights of the kernels that may be a concern if the number of kernels is greater than 3 in current mainstream approaches. The study presents numerical tests of the BRDF retrieval algorithm for various surface and atmospheric conditions.

AB  - In this paper we monitor the changes of the shoreline and coastal area using satellite data. The case study is at the area of Georgioupoli which is a mainly tourism area located on the Northern part of the island of Crete. In our study, high resolution Quickbird and WorldView-3 satellite sensor images were analyzed with a resolution of 0.60m and 0.30m respectively, at a time period of 13 years. The premise is that interpretation of remote sensing imagery can provide useful and interesting information. Combination of remote sensing techniques and geospatial analysis was applied in order to visualize and identify land cover changes. This integrated approach, was successfully implemented for the assessment of natural resources, where two images on different dates were compared, in order to quantify the type and amount of changes that have been occurred in the coastal area. Currently, various applications of change detection have been applied in many sectors such as, agriculture, hydrology, forestry and environment. For this purpose, the shoreline was depicted numerically and manually for each year. In addition, NDVI classification was applied to quantify land cover changes near the coastal area. Shoreline measurements provide information about the coastal loss over the years and the changes of the coastal area. The high resolution satellite images allow the detection of erosion and accretion of the last years. Based on the results, we showed that surfaces of the coastal area and close to it were reduced or totally disappeared. Finally, significant changes were also detected in the vegetation for a 13-year period. These changes should be taken under consideration for the long term sustainable development and economic growth of the coastal area.

AB  - This review article examines two sides of disaster that are inherently part of human life. From a cultural perspective, disasters can be divided into two main groups, namely natural disasters that are 'given' and disasters caused by human activities that do not respect the natural environment. The stewardship of nature is closely related to 1) human behavior, 2) worldview, 3) awareness, and 4) caring. These four aspects can be examined from a cultural perspective which in turn will foster a new awareness for humans as the inhabitants of the earth. 'Save the World' is a motto that persuades humans to safeguard the earth and the environment, while 'Man-Made Disaster' is a human condemnation of some other group of humans that have created environmental damage that directly or indirectly leads to disaster. The two sides of this phenomenon will be discussed reciprocally in this article, to see the common thread in which the cultural approach can be a recipient of these two poles. In other words save the world versus human-made disaster will be discussed from a cultural perspective.

AB  - GIS data layer on crop field boundary has many applications in agricultural research, ecosystem study, crop monitoring, and land management. Crop field boundary mapping through field survey is not time and cost effective for vast agriculture areas. Onscreen digitization on fine-resolution satellite image is also labor-intensive and error-prone. The recent development in image segmentation based on their spectral characteristics is promising for cropland boundary detection. However, processing of large volume multi-band satellite images often required high-performance computation systems. This study utilized crop rotation information for the delineation of field boundaries. In this study, crop field boundaries of Iowa in the United States are extracted using multi-year (2007-2018) CDL data. The process is simple compared to boundary extraction from multi-date remote sensing data. Although this process was unable to distinguish some adjacent fields, the overall accuracy is promising. Utilization of advanced geoprocessing algorithms and tools on polygon correction may improve the result significantly. Extracted field boundaries are validated by superimposing on fine resolution Google Earth images. The result shows that crop field boundaries can easily be extracted with reasonable accuracy using crop rotation information.

TI  - In-Season Major Crop-Type Identification for US Cropland from Landsat Images Using Crop-Rotation Pattern and Progressive Data Classification
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type information at the field level is vital for many types of research and applications. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides information on crop types for US cropland as a Cropland Data Layer (CDL). However, CDL is only available at the end of the year after the crop growing season. Therefore, CDL is unable to support in-season research and decision-making regarding crop loss estimation, yield estimation, and grain pricing. The USDA mostly relies on field survey and farmers' reports for the ground truth to train image classification models, which is one of the major reasons for the delayed release of CDL. This research aims to use trusted pixels as ground truth to train classification models. Trusted pixels are pixels which follow a specific crop rotation pattern. These trusted pixels are used to train image classification models for the classification of in-season Landsat images to identify major crop types. Six different classification algorithms are investigated and tested to select the best algorithm for this study. The Random Forest algorithm stands out among selected algorithms. This study classified Landsat scenes between May and mid-August for Iowa. The overall agreements of classification results with CDL in 2017 are 84%, 94%, and 96% for May, June, and July, respectively. The classification accuracies have been assessed through 683 ground truth data points collected from the fields. The overall accuracies of single date multi-band image classification are 84%, 89% and 92% for May, June, and July, respectively. The result also shows higher accuracy (94-95%) can be achieved through multi-date image classification compared to single date image classification.

TI  - Rapid Flood Progress Monitoring in Cropland with NASA SMAP
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research in different agricultural sectors, including in crop loss estimation during flood and yield estimation, substantially rely on inundation information. Spaceborne remote sensing has widely been used in the mapping and monitoring of floods. However, the inability of optical remote sensing to cloud penetration and the scarcity of fine temporal resolution SAR data hinder the application of flood mapping in many cases. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) level 4 products, which are model-driven soil moisture data derived from SMAP observations and are available at 3-h intervals, can offer an intermediate but effective solution. This study maps flood progress in croplands by incorporating SMAP surface soil moisture, soil physical properties, and national floodplain information. Soil moisture above the effective soil porosity is a direct indication of soil saturation. Soil moisture also increases considerably during a flood event. Therefore, this approach took into account three conditions to map the flooded pixels: a minimum of 0.05 m(3)m(3) increment in soil moisture from pre-flood to post-flood condition, soil moisture above the effective soil porosity, and the holding of saturation condition for the 72 consecutive hours. Results indicated that the SMAP-derived maps were able to successfully map most of the flooded areas in the reference maps in the majority of the cases, though with some degree of overestimation (due to the coarse spatial resolution of SMAP). Finally, the inundated croplands are extracted from saturated areas by Spatial Hazard Zone areas (SHFA) of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and cropland data layer (CDL). The flood maps extracted from SMAP data are validated with FEMA-declared affected counties as well as with flood maps from other sources.

AB  - With the growing use of the Vegetation Index in many remote sensing applications, it was imperative to examine the Brightness Temperature (BT) stability in the NOAA/NESDIS Global Vegetation Index (GVI) data, which was collected from five NOAA series satellites. An empirical distribution function (EDF) was developed to decrease the long-term inaccuracy of the BT data derived from the AVHRR sensor on NOAA polar orbiting satellite. The instability of data is a consequence of orbit degradation, and from the circuit drifts over the life of a satellite. Degradation of BT over time and shifts of BT between the satellites were estimated using the China data set, because it includes a wide variety of different ecosystems represented globally. It was found that the data for six particular years, four of which were consecutive, are not stable compared to other years because of satellite orbit drift, AVHRR sensor degradation, and satellite technical problems, including satellite electronic and mechanical satellite systems deterioration. The data for paired years for the NOAA-7, NOAA-9, NOAA-11, NOAA-14, and NOAA-16 were assumed to be standard because the crossing time of the satellite over the equator maximized the value of the coefficients. These years were considered the standard years, while in other years the quality of satellite observations significantly deviated from the standard. The deficiency of data for the affected years were normalized or corrected by using the EDF method and compared with the standard years. These normalized values were then utilized to estimate new BT time series that show significant improvement of BT data for the affected years so that the dataset is useful for environment monitoring.

AB  - Immediately following a natural disaster, it is imperative to accurately assess the damages caused by the disaster for effective rescue and relief operations. Passive remote sensing imageries have been analyzed and used for over four decades for such assessments. However, they do have their limitations including inability to collect data during violent weather conditions, medium to low spatial resolution, and assessing areas and pixels on a damages/ no damage basis. Recent advances in active remote sensing data collection methods can resolve some of these limitations. In this chapter, the basic theories and processing techniques of active remote sensing data is first discussed. It then provides some of the advantages and limitations of using active remote sensing data for disaster damage assessments. Finally, the chapter concludes by discussing how data from active sensors are used to assess damages from various types of natural disasters.

AB  - Fire severity and vegetation indices are widely used to understand fire disturbance and vegetation recovery in heterogenous landscapes. Multispectral sensors are used to understand fire severity and post-fire vegetation dynamics. We utilised four fire severity (dNBR, RBR, RdNBR and MIRBI) and four vegetation indices (Chlorophyll Index of Red-Edge, dNDVI, EVI and NDRE) derived from Sentinel-2 images to understand the spatio-temporal variability of fire severity and vegetation recovery. The Masonite Road fire burned 2321.32 hectares of mixed Eucalyptus and wetland forests in the southwestern Telligerry State Conservation Area of New South Wales, Australia, in January 2018. Spectral and spatial analysis of different fire severity and vegetation indices revealed the blaze affected the landscape with moderate to high level of severity. Fire severity indices showed similar patterns in spatio-temporal analysis for a year, but Chlorophyll Index of Red-Edge and EVI did not show any pattern of fire impacts on vegetation. Among the analysed indices, two combinations of fire severity and vegetation indices (dNBR or RBR or RdNBR with NDVI and MIRBI withNDRE) were significantly correlated and can be effective in assessing fire severity, burned area and vegetation recovery.

AB  - A landscape level survey of vegetation structure and composition was conducted along the treeline ecotone in Western Himalaya in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. We used a combination of field surveys and remote sensing data (Landsat MSS and TM images) to quantify the extent and distribution of various classes of forests, forest cover, patterns of vegetation structure and composition and recent changes in forest cover along the treeline ecotone. Total area under the treeline ecotone (3000-4000 m) in these states comes to ca. 11587 km(2), of which Himachal Pradesh has higher representation (6818.4 km(2)). In terms of extent, conifers (Abies and Pinus) occupy the largest cover followed by brown or Kharsu oak (Quercus semecarpifolia) and birch (Betula utilis). Mean tree density was 553 individuals ha(-1) which ranged between 440 and 690 individuals ha(-1). Average elevation of the treeline was approximately 3615 m above mean sea level, and the maximum altitude of tree growth was 4200 m. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals that there has been no altitudinal shift in the upper treeline during the last 40 years, although forest canopy cover has increased or decreased significantly within a protected area and outside, respectively.

AB  - The article presents analysis of Khakass folk costume as a traditional culture phenomenon. Description and names of main types of national clothing are given. Khakass costume complexes are viewed in parallel with similar complexes of other Turkic peoples' costume. The common Turk component based on the complex, and later the Mongolian influence formed the Khakass costume. There are parallels in Khakass costume with costumes of Tatars, Altaians, Buryats, Tuvans, peoples of Central Asia and Kazakhstan, Western Siberia and the Urals. Formation of complexes of traditional clothing of the Khakas was greatly influenced by the way of life and natural and climatic conditions, reflected in its utilitarian practicality and functionality. Fur and wool long-field clothing was adapted to climatic conditions of the existence place of nomads and to constant riding. Ideas about protective functions were clearly manifested in traditions of the manufacture and wearing of Khakass folk costume, both in the literal sense, as protection from the external environment, and in a magic sense - as protection from external, invisible, hostile forces. The traditional costume of the Khakas in the traditional worldview was a three-part model of the world, where each element is located in accordance with the system, and is a kind of symbol. To date, deformation tendencies of the national costume have been noted, and lexical units serving for its designation fall into the archaisms category. The article presents some solutions for preserving and developing manufacturing traditions, names of Khakass costume, serving as an example for other ethnic groups.

AB  - Field crop plot boundaries can be extracted from high-resolution images with spatial resolution less than 2.5 m from satellites like Cartosat, QuickBird, etc. The village maps along with survey numbers obtained from respective states' departments geo-referenced using control points like natural features, roads, etc. and the coordinates obtained from DGPS were used to increase the positional accuracy. Crop plots were extracted from high-resolution natural color composite images from Google Earth. A controlled mosaic of crop plots for each village developed in GIS environment was converted to geo-fenced map tile and loaded on to smartphone powered with suitable application for automatic navigation and recording the information along with photographs in the field. Farmers in each village were informed about the process and cooperation was sought. Field inventory carried out in Rabi was kept as basic reference of crop plots of different farmers. Android application was modified to reduce the mapping of plots without crops in subsequent season. The data generated in each season was systematically organized in QGIS for visualization and spatial analysis. Farmers not only cooperated but also felt that the process is useful so that they can have reference of crop area and type.

TI  - A Critical Discussion on the Relevance of Biosocial Science Research Ethics Codes and Principles for Social Science Researchers in Africa
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH ETHICS IN AFRICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The chapter will critically discuss some popular biomedical research ethics codes and principles in order to determine their relevance for social science researchers in Africa and to stress the importance of ethical consent. Research done on health in Africa reveals that African societies, especially those found in sub-Saharan Africa, face a double encumbrance of infectious and chronic diseases. As a result of this challenging health situation, there is currently a lot of research going on in Africa in an effort to address the situation. With the world's recognition of the significance of Africa's rich genetic diversity for biomedical research, more international research projects are being initiated. Some of these research initiatives raise unique ethical challenges that arise from the interaction between frontline science and traditional communities that have their own unique worldviews and research contexts.There are cases where research ethics codes and principles appear to be inadequate to help in the face of the said challenges. This brings into question the relevance of such ethical frameworks for researchers in Africa. This apparent inadequacy of the international ethical frameworks to help researchers has prompted a desire to want to closely examine the relevance of these frameworks for the African context. Thus this chapter is intended to critically appraise some of the most commonly applied or used international research ethics codes and principles with the aim of determining their relevance for the sub-Saharan African context.

AB  - The understanding of tomograms can be a difficult task when the observed scene is complex. The Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) ranging acquisition induces geometrical distortions depending on the local slope of the back-scattering surface. Over dense urban areas, this particular geometry produces tilted facades instead of straight buildings. Moreover the high dynamic in SAR images of urban areas may lead to 3-D representation with very bright voxels eclipsing other echoes. In this paper we present a graph-cut approach adapted to any tomographic reconstruction technique to segment the urban surface in a 3-D tomographic reconstruction. Results on real data from a stack of 40 TerraSAR-X images are presented.

AB  - The Indonesian Archipelago is prone to disaster. It is important to map the impact of the disaster accurately for the recovery process as well as for the education of future generations. Conventional field survey for disaster mapping is problematic due to labour extensive, costly, and time-consuming. This study will evaluate the utilization of interferometric algorithm of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset combining with the very high-resolution (VHR) data of PlanetScope of 2018 Palu earthquake, Indonesia. We successfully documented the displacement linear surface ruptures due to the earthquake. The Line-of-Sight (LOS) vertical displacement is similar to 1 meters while the horizontal displacement is similar to 2 meters. The availability of Sentinel-1 SAR data and VHR data of PlanetScope provide benefit for large-scale disaster monitoring impact.

AB  - The decrease of land surface temperature (LST) in reclaimed mining site can be taken as indication of environmental quality improvement. Remote sensing technology is able to provide information on LST over a large area so that it can be used to assess the effect of land-cover characteristic of mining-affected landscape on LST. This research used Landsat 8 images to study the relationships between land-use and LST in a coal-mined landscape of a mining company in South Kalimantan. Specifically, this study aimed to examine the effect of different planting years of reclaimed forest on LST and to examine the effect of different dominant tree species of reclaimed forest on LST. Data source for LST calculation was band 10 of Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) from recording years of 2014 and 2018. The images analysis consisted of the following steps: LST data extraction using Avdan & Jovanovska (2016) algorithm, land surface emissivity calculation following Valor & Caselles (1996), and overlay of LST maps with land-cover maps. A field work to measure stand characteristics of reclaimed forests was also conducted. The result shows that reclaimed forests with different planting years tends to have similar temperature-decreasing ability. This is shown by similar average LST values of reclaimed forest stands planted at year 1997, 2014, 2015, and 2016, which were around 27 degrees C at year 2018. Meanwhile, reclaimed forest stands with different dominant trees species and total basal area also tend to similar temperature-decreasing ability, being around 4.7-5.7 degrees C after 3-4 years of planting. The results indicates that the tree species currently used by PT Adaro Indonesia for post-mining forest reclamation have similar ability in decreasing LST and the LST decrease could occur in a relatively short time.

TI  - Evaluation of Sampling and Cross-Validation Tuning Strategies for Regional-Scale Machine Learning Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution (1-5 m) remotely sensed datasets are increasingly being used to map land covers over large geographic areas using supervised machine learning algorithms. Although many studies have compared machine learning classification methods, sample selection methods for acquiring training and validation data for machine learning, and cross-validation techniques for tuning classifier parameters are rarely investigated, particularly on large, high spatial resolution datasets. This work, therefore, examines four sample selection methods-simple random, proportional stratified random, disproportional stratified random, and deliberative sampling-as well as three cross-validation tuning approaches-k-fold, leave-one-out, and Monte Carlo methods. In addition, the effect on the accuracy of localizing sample selections to a small geographic subset of the entire area, an approach that is sometimes used to reduce costs associated with training data collection, is investigated. These methods are investigated in the context of support vector machines (SVM) classification and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), using high spatial resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) orthoimagery and LIDAR-derived rasters, covering a 2,609 km(2) regional-scale area in northeastern West Virginia, USA. Stratified-statistical-based sampling methods were found to generate the highest classification accuracy. Using a small number of training samples collected from only a subset of the study area provided a similar level of overall accuracy to a sample of equivalent size collected in a dispersed manner across the entire regional-scale dataset. There were minimal differences in accuracy for the different cross-validation tuning methods. The processing time for Monte Carlo and leave-one-out cross-validation were high, especially with large training sets. For this reason, k-fold cross-validation appears to be a good choice. Classifications trained with samples collected deliberately (i.e., not randomly) were less accurate than classifiers trained from statistical-based samples. This may be due to the high positive spatial autocorrelation in the deliberative training set. Thus, if possible, samples for training should be selected randomly; deliberative samples should be avoided.

T2  - CONTEXTO
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is aimed to examine the conceptual mechanisms of personification and depersonification in the identity of the characters in the book of short stories The Marriage of the Red Fish (2013) by the Mexican writer Guadalupe Nettel. The results reveal that a) the main characters of each of the stories project the problems they suffer from a microorganism (fungi) and animals such as fish, cats, cockroaches and snakes; b) use the metaphor of personification (give human condition to an animal or a thing) and depersonification (the person loses human conditions) to build their identity and that of other characters. In conclusion, we observe in the literary work by Nettel a crossing of conceptual domains from the animal world to the human universe, we note that the main characters of each of the stories use the metaphor of personification and depersonification to build their identity. In sum, the author offers the worldview of a fierce and indomitable human nature latent behind the veil of family and social relationships.

AB  - This work addresses the uneven traffic demand scenario in multi-beam satellite systems, in which a hot-spot beam is surrounded by cold beans. After partitioning the hot spot beam in different sectors, resource pulling from cold neighbouring beams is allowed following an aggressive frequency-reuse scheme. As a consequence, the level of the co-channel interference within the hot-spot beam increases. A scheme known as Non-Coherent Rate-Splitting (NCRS) is employed to cope with this interference, based on the exclusive use of magnitude channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The receiver complexity is increased with respect to full CSIT precoding schemes, which are considered for benchmarking purposes. Different NCRS strategies are analyzed and compared with several partial and full CSIT schemes. The proposed solution not only shows an improvement with respect to partial CSIT benchmarks, but also displays a competitive performance against full CSIT precoders.

AB  - This study used optical remote sensors to identify surface hydrothermal alteration and thermal anomalies in Krysuvik geothermal field. Multispectral Landsat and ASTER satellite images were used to identify hydrothermal alteration minerals and thermal anomalies. A hyperspectral image from Hyperion was used for the analysis of absorption features. Spectral analysis from the visible (VIS) to the short wavelength infrared (SWIR) allowed the identification of possible sulfur, iron oxides, and montmorillonite. A time series analysis of thermal anomalies using the nighttime satellite images from 2002 to 2017 detected extinct surface hydrothermal activity southwest of the study area, and a thermal anomaly possibly affected by crustal deformation in the southeast. In Seltun area, thermal infrared (TIR) images acquired by a camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were compared with ground measurements; the aim was assessing the accuracy of the TIR images regarding the distance between the camera and the ground. The TIR image taken at 30 m elevation was used to calculate radiative heat flux; values were in same order of magnitude than the heat flux through the soil estimated by using ground measurements. This study provides insights for monitoring natural or induced changes on the surface geothermal activity of geothermal fields.

AB  - The application of thermo-rheological models to forecast active lava flow emplacement and quantify important eruptive parameters of older flows has become more common over the last decade. With the modification and adaption of these models to modular computing languages, they are now easier, quicker, and are being incorporated into studies of both terrestrial and planetary volcanism. These models rely on certain assumptions and input parameters, some of which such as emissivity are not well understood for molten materials. Without a well-grounded knowledge of how this parameter governs radiant cooling, remote measurements of temperature and models such as FLOWGO that rely on these temperatures to track cooling with time will be in error. Here, we perform a detailed FLOWGO-based modeling study of lava flows emplaced at Tolbachik volcano during the 2012-2013 and the 1975-1976 eruptions. Specifically, we have modified the FLOWGO model to incorporate a two-component emissivity model linked to the fraction of molten lava and cooled crust. We focus first on the large Leningradskoye Flow emplaced at the start of the 2012 eruption, relying on data from numerous other orbital sensors including MODIS, ASTER and ALI to constrain some of the model input parameters. The two-component emissivity adaption produced better fits to the final flow length, directly related to the crust cover percentage. We then applied the constrained model to the large Cone II flow formed in 1975, for which no satellite-based data are available. Results revealed that a nearly identical model fit was achieved with initial effusion rate of 700 m(3)/s or 1250 m(3)/s. However, for the higher the effusion rate, a lower the crust cover is needed to fit the flow length and width. This represents the first study to implement two-component emissivity into thermo-rheological modeling of lava flows. The results show that this is an important factor for model accuracy and critical for large, higher effusion rate flows as well as for our understanding of older flows on Earth and other planets.

AB  - Changes in default values The default value for "list_prods" argument in sen2r() is NULL instead of 'BOA'. Remove 'no' value for argument "step_atmcorr" in sen2r() (use 'l2a' without selecting any L2A products instead). Default values for "smoothing" and "buffer" arguments in s2_mask() are now 0 (like in sen2r()) instead than 10/20 m. Set parallel = FALSE as default in sen2r() (parallelisation must be explicitly required). Since old name products were repackaged by ESA, these products are no longer supported. Sen2Cor v. 2.8.0 (faster and using less memory) is now installed by default. Major changes s2_list() and s2_download() now use internal methods instead of calling python function derived from s2download scripts by Hagolle (this substantially improve the speed of SAFE search), which were removed. sen2r is now supported also on MacOS. New/removed dependencies Remove sp and rgdal from explicit dependencies. Remove stringr and gdalUtils dependencies. Add stars dependency. New functions str_pad2(), equivalent to str_pad() without the needing to load "stringr". raster_metadata(), to get raster metadata, without rgdal dependency. check_scihub_login() to check if SciHub credentials are right. check_scihub_connection() to check for internet connectivity. Other changes Packages stability was improved by adding test functions, working with testthat. S2 tiles are not provided as kmz within the package, but a rds file is downloaded after installing the package (in this way, package installation is lighter, and S2 tiles are read faster). Function check_gdal() was rewritten without using gdalUtils, in order to be simpler and faster. Some new indices were added: NDWI-NDWI2 (#184); CRred-BDred-CRred2 (#168); Indices from Sentinel-hub indices were checked. The minimum convex hull of the extent is used instead of the bbox to search SAFE images. Several "soft" error/warning messages were introduced. ENVI headers now includes some information about band names (TOA/BOA) and SCL classes. Coupling SAFE: in offline mode, if some L2A products exists but not the corresponding L1C, and TOA-derived products are required, only the "coupled" SAFE archives are used. Unused old code was removed. Documentation was updated. Several bugs were fixed.

TI  - ASTER multispectral bands, ground magnetic data, ground spectroscopy and space-based EIGEN6C4 gravity data model for identifying potential zones for gold sulphide mineralization in Bhukia, Rajasthan, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have used visible near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflectance radiometer (ASTER) to identify prospective zones of mineralization associated with the gold deposit in Bhukia area, Rajasthan. Lineament density, the extent of influence of regional structures/lineament, updated lithological map and the reference magnetic anomaly map are used for prospectivity mapping based on Fuzzy-logic based gamma overlay analysis. We have used high pass filtered (5 x 5 windows) image of selected bands of ASTER to delineate geological lineaments; which are believed to have a significant role in localizing hydrothermal fluid movement and also have influenced the ore deposition. In this regard, two evidential layers are prepared for geological structures. One layer is prepared to delineate a zone of influence of geological structures and other is on lineament density. For this, we also have used ground magnetic data and EIGEN6C4 model based Bouguer gravity data to delineate regional structures; which are combined with the ASTER-derived lineaments to derive composite lineament density map. Principle component image of ASTER bands, suitable false color composite (FCC) images of selected bands are derived to update litho-contacts of reference geological map to use as an evidential layer. Weightages for the themes, on favorable structure, lineament density, and lithology are assigned based on the geological understanding of their relative influence on the formation of the deposit. Weightage given to each layer is rescaled to the range of 0-1 using suitable fuzzy function. In addition to the above-mentioned geogenic factors, magnetic anomaly map is also used as an evidential layer. In this regard, empirical relation between a magnetic anomaly and gold sulphides is used as the reference to give gradational higher weightages to high magnetic anomaly zones; which are occurring within the spatial extent of the host rocks. Highly prospective zone in the Fuzzy prospective map prepared using above evidential layers is segmented for "potential or priority areas" and consequently validated. In this regard, high Zr/Hf anomaly map, Fe2O3 oxide anomaly map, "basement-highs" derived from EIGEN6C4 gravity model and ASTER-derived gossan exposure map are used to identify few priority areas within the highly prospective zone of prospect map. Gossan exposure map used in above purpose has been derived based on the implementation of the matched filtering method on ASTER image using gossan broadband spectra as a reference. Highly prospective zone identified using few regional evidence layers are validated using the localized evidences; which have been used to identify few priority areas within the highly prospective zones. Present approach of conjugate use of regional and local evidence layers to identify the priority areas within the highly prospective zone can be regarded as an innovative method to implement for gold exploration in any part of the world.

TI  - Wilderness dynamics in Muritz National Park - Vegetation development in wildlife sanctuary areas on the eastern shore of Muritz
T2  - Naturschutz und Landschaftsplanung
M3  - Article
AB  - Muritz National Park harbours a wilderness area of 1,720 ha where hunting has been prohibited since 1998. The wildlife sanctuary is located on the eastern shore of Lake Muritz.This synoptic analysis reviews the available information regarding vegetation changes in the area from 1991 to 2012. Additionally, remote sensing data helped to identify changes in forest cover. A combination of spectral information and laser scanning data was used for detection of changes in vertical structure. Vegetation cover above 2 m was identified. This data was essential to detect vegetation changes in forest cover and open ground habitats.The data gives a detailed spatial as well as temporal picture of the changes in the wilderness area. The analysis documents the effective and prosperous restoration of peatlands in the area. An increase in the water table of 20 cm resulted in the retreat of forest cover and an increase in reed and native fen flora. It has to be assumed that red deer and wild boar had a decisive impact on the changes. They helped to increase habitat diversity and the spread of rare habitats protected under the Habitats Directive.

TI  - USE OF SENTINEL-2 IMAGES FOR WATER NEEDS MONITORING: APPLICATION ON AN INDUSTRIAL TOMATO CROP IN CENTRAL ITALY
T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The improvement of remote sensing techniques can provide a significant contribution to the use of more sustainable and efficient agronomic procedures in Mediterranean regions, especially in low and medium-tech farming systems. The availability of high spatial and temporal resolution images enables to deliver information on crop coverage and plant condition, useful to evaluate seasonal trends and to estimate water and nutrient requirements. This work investigates the potential advantage of using Sentinel-2 high resolution images both to estimate tomato field internal variability and to retrieve its related crop coefficients (Kc), for a more reliable definition of water requirements during different phenological stages. Satellite data were included into an integrated irrigation management system based on soil moisture sensors, meteorological data and agrometeorological model, to monitor and evaluate the irrigation efficiency of an Italian industrial tomato farmer. The results obtained confirm the utility of NDVI-derived Kc values in areas homogeneously managed, to estimate actual evapotranspiration at operational level and the suitability of Sentinel-2 images derived information for producing a detailed estimation of plant growth and soil water content.

AB  - The education system in architecture will undergo serious changes in the near future. The process of restructuring the whole body of architecture will take over one century, and in this process, the profession itself will face the restructuring of habits gained by architecture. These processes will require a sharp increase in moral reflection inside and outside the profession. All this will put architecture and architectural education in a fundamentally new position, to which architecture is not ready today. The article outlines the points of the renewal of the power of architectural thinking, which are revealed with the help of the principle of individuation and within the esoteric worldview.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic areas have experienced greening and changes in permafrost caused by climate change during recent decades. However, there has been a lack of automated methods in mapping changes in fine-scale patterns of permafrost landscapes. We mapped areal coverage of bare peat areas and changes in them in a peat plateau located in north-western Russia between 2007 and 2015. We utilized QuickBird and WorldView-3 satellite image data in an object-based setting. We compared four different one-class classifiers (one-class support vector machine, binary support vector machine, random forest, rotation forest) both in a fully supervised binary setting and with positive and unlabelled training data. There was notable variation in classification performance. The bare peat area F-score varied between 0.77 and 0.96 when evaluated by cross-validated training data and between 0.22 and 0.57 when evaluated by independent test data. Overall, random forest performed the most robustly but all classifiers performed well in some classifications. During the 8 year period, there was a 21%-26% decrease in the bare peat areal coverage. We conclude that (1) tested classifiers can be used in one-class settings and (2) there is a need to develop methods for tracking changes in single land cover types.

AB  - Ground truth data collection for species-level mapping is made challenging by limited access and hazardous conditions in some wetland ecosystems. Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the relationship between kernel smoothness parameter of SVM and spectral separability are investigated with a limited number of sample. The overall accuracy (OA) for 8 classes was around 56.25% (kappa = 0.50) for MLC, 78.12 % (kappa=0.75) for SVM (radial basis function) and 78.90% (kappa=0.76) for SVM (polynomial). When the polynomial kernel increased from 2 to 4, producer accuracy (%) increased from 81.25% to 87.50% and 53.22% to 66.67 % for Mangrove (Avicennia marina) and Swamp She-oak (Casuarina glauca) tree species respectively. This accuracy is acceptable as 15% of the required sample provided 79% overall accuracy from SVM and is comparable to other previous studies.

TI  - The association between seasonal influenza-like illness cases and foetal death: a time series analysis
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been reported that foetal death follows a seasonal pattern. Influenza virus infection has been postulated as one possible contributor to this seasonal variation. This ecological study explored the temporal association between the influenza activity and the frequency of foetal death. Time series analysis was conducted using weekly influenza-like illness consultation proportions from the Danish sentinel surveillance system and weekly proportions of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths from hospital registers from 1994 to 2009. The association was examined in an autoregressive (AR) integrated (I) moving average (MA) model and subsequently analysed with cross-correlation functions. Our findings confirmed the well-known seasonality in influenza, but also seasonality in spontaneous abortion. No clear pattern of seasonality was found for stillbirths, although the analysis exposed dependency between observations. One final AR integrated MA model was identified for the influenza-like illness (ILI) series. We found no statistically significant relationship between weekly influenza-like illness consultation proportions and weekly spontaneous abortion proportions (five lags: P = 0.52; 11 lags: P = 0.91) or weekly stillbirths (five lags: P = 0.93; 11 lags: P = 0.40). Exposure to circulating influenza during pregnancy was not associated with rates of spontaneous abortions or stillbirths. Seasonal variations in spontaneous abortion were confirmed and this phenomenon needs further investigation.

AB  - Air temperature is one of the most important climate characteristics, which is used for climate research, investigation and modeling of vegetation, hydrological parameters and other landscape components as well as geosystems entirely. The use of a landscape approach greatly simplifies the process of visualizing meteorological parameters and allows you to take into account influencing factors, since they have already been taken into account when drawing up a landscape map. This article describes cartographic models of the air temperature field of the Tunka intermountain basin created using in-situ wide network of modern automatic measuring instruments and remote sensing methods that allow us to solve the problem of climate research at a local level, as well as a landscape-interpretation mapping method. The main advantages and disadvantages of these cartographic methods are assessed. It is shown that a joint analysis of the data from a dense network of field observations, remote sensing data, and a landscape map made it possible to analyze the dynamics of the spatiotemporal distribution of the air temperature field with a relatively high degree of accuracy.

TI  - Measuring prevalence and incidence of chronic conditions in claims and electronic health record databases
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Health care databases are natural sources for estimating prevalence and incidence of chronic conditions, but substantial variation in estimates limits their interpretability and utility. We evaluated the effects of design choices when estimating prevalence and incidence in claims and electronic health record databases.Methods: Prevalence and incidence for five chronic diseases at increasing levels of expected frequencies, from cystic fibrosis to COPD, were estimated in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and MarketScan databases from 2011 to 2014. Estimates were compared using different definitions of lookback time and contributed person-time.Results: Variation in lookback time substantially affected estimates. In 2014, for CPRD, use of an all-time vs a 1-year lookback window resulted in 4.3-8.3 times higher prevalence (depending on disease), reducing incidence by 1.9-3.3 times. All-time lookback resulted in strong temporal trends. COPD prevalence between 2011 and 2014 in MarketScan increased by 25% with an all-time lookback but stayed relatively constant with a 1-year lookback. Varying observability did not substantially affect estimates.Conclusion: This framework draws attention to the underrecognized potential for widely varying incidence and prevalence estimates, with implications for care planning and drug development. Though prevalence and incidence are seemingly straightforward concepts, careful consideration of methodology is required to obtain meaningful estimates from health care databases.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - In this paper, a generic scattering power factorization framework for Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data is proposed to directly obtain N scattering power components along with a residue power component for each pixel. Each scattering power component can be factorized into similarity (or dissimilarity) with the utilized scattering models. The similarity measure is derived using a geodesic distance between pairs of 4 x 4 real Kennaugh matrices. In a standard model-based decomposition framework, the 3x3 Hermitian positive semi-definite covariance (or coherency) matrix is expressed as a weighted linear combination of scattering targets. The scattering powers are usually obtained by solving an under-constrained system of equations by enforcing certain assumptions to reduce the number of variables. Moreover, the scattering powers are determined following a fixed hierarchy process. In contrast, under the proposed framework a convex splitting of unity is performed to obtain the weights while preserving the dominance of the scattering components. The product of the total power (Span) with these weights provides the non-negative scattering power components. The scattering power distribution obtained using the proposed framework is assessed over some selected areas from a RADARSAT-2 C-band PolSAR image of San Francisco (SF), USA.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - This paper presents a method for deriving shallow to intermediate (1m to 50m) coastal bathymetry from space-borne multispectral data taking advantage of the short timelag between sensors' bands. The idea is to quantify local waves' characteristics (wavelengths and celerities) that are related to the water depths using optical data: local spectral analysis can provide the significant wavelengths and interband offset-tracking and the corresponding celerities (knowing the inter-band time-lag). Such an approach was firstly described in [1]. However, for an application to extended areas and using large data sets (as possible with the Sentinel-2 archive), a faster technique is required: the ability of processing large areas and data acquired at different dates is required for actual operational uses. The approach we propose here is based on Fast Fourier Transform analysis in order to simultaneously extract the wavelengths and celerities.

TI  - An evaluation framework to build a cost-efficient crop monitoring system. Experiences from the extension of the European crop monitoring system
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an evaluation framework followed to identify cost-efficient alternatives to extend the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), run by the European Commission Joint Research Centre since 1992, to other main producing areas of the world: Eastern European Neighbourhood, Asia, Australia, South America and North America. These new systems would follow the principles and components of the MCYFS Europe: a meteorological data infrastructure, a remote sensing data infrastructure, a crop modelling platform, statistical tools, a team of analysts and a crop area estimation component. The framework designed evaluates the performance of the possible MCYFS-like system realizations against six defined objectives and their costs. Possible monitoring systems are based on a combination of different technical solutions for each of the MCYFS components, and are evaluated through an automatic algorithm that calculates the expected system performance -relying on a priori expert judgement-, the costs, and possible risks to construct some technical solutions, to finally identify the cost-efficient ones. A baseline system, achieving the minimum required performance, was identified as the most efficient starting point for the MCYFS extension in all the geographical areas. Such system would be built upon: (i) near real-time reanalysis meteorological products; (ii) remote sensing data from low-resolution (similar to 1 km) platforms with a long-term product archive; (iii) crop models based on crop-specific model calibration from experimental data published in scientific literature; (iv) statistical methods based on trend and regression analysis applied to national level; (v) a team of analysts with specific technical profiles (on meteorology, remote sensing, and agronomy); and (vi) digital classification of very high resolution imagery supported by non-expensive ground surveys for area estimation. In countries where accessibility to local data and resources is high the baseline system can be upgraded enhancing some of the components: sub-national statistical analysis with additional statistical methods like multiple regression or scenario analysis; recruitment of experts on local agricultural conditions in the team of analysts; local calibration of crop models with experimental data; and exploiting high and low resolution biophysical products from remote sensing for crop monitoring.

M3  - Review
AB  - Examination of the placenta provides a unique opportunity to explore and understand the intrauterine environment, as well as providing a record of events that may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, one of the most devastating of which is central nervous system (CNS) injury. A number of placental lesions have been described in association with various forms of neurologic injury. They can be divided into four major categories: sentinel events, inflammatory lesions, vascular lesions, and "biomarker" lesions, which are not themselves causative, but are often found in association with other lesions that are causative. The purpose of this review is to outline these placental lesions and summarize the types of CNS injury that have been described in association with each. Finally, one of the most important of all risk factors for CNS injury is the finding of multiple independent placental lesions. The effects of these lesions may be synergistic, particularly when metachronous, with an earlier lesion leaving the CNS more vulnerable to the effects of a later lesion.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, vertical accuracy of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTMDEM) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER(DEM)) was compared to CARTOSAT-1(DEM) of Roja village of Shahjahanpur District of Uttar Pradesh, India. Vertical accuracy analysis between SRTMDEM and ASTER(DEM) with respect to CARTOSAT-1(DEM) (IRS-P5) allowed a quantitative/qualitative assessment of the vertical component of the error, while statistical measures were used to evaluate the performance of the DEM. The original SRTM image contained voids which were represented digitally; such voids were initially filled for obtaining accurate vertical height from DEM. Results shows that SRTM based measurements of ground control points (GCPs) exhibits root mean square error (RMSE) of 186.65m while ASTER(DEM) based measurements exhibits and RMSE of 137.65 m. This indicate that ASTER(DEM) outperforms SRTMDEM in detecting vertical accuracy. Average relative root mean square error (R-RMSE) of twenty GCPs was 1.0 and 1.25 for ASTER(DEM) and SRTMDEM, respectively. Comparison of vertical accuracy of points from ASTER(DEM) with respect to CARTOSAT-1(DEM) exhibits an Coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.59, normalized root mean square error (N-RMSE) of 1.26, mean absolute error (MAE) of 30.82 and RMSE% of 6.3. These vertical accuracy results show that the vertical accuracy of ASTER with respect to CARTOSAT-1(DEM) shows a better agreement than SRTMDEM for selected 20 points from orographic plain. This study shows that SRTMDEM is not appropriate over the settlement (city/village).

AB  - It is widely believed that the impact of fake news, internet rumors, hoaxes, deceptive memes etc. are spilling into the physical world from the virtual world. In fact, social media has had a significant role in the origination and spread of such deceptive communication, as social media users often lack awareness of the intentional manipulation of online content and are easily tricked into believing unverifiable content. In an increasingly polarized world where social media and the internet have pushed people to live inside "echo chambers" and "filter bubbles," people consciously and unconsciously are exposed only to content that reinforce their confirmation bias. In such a scenario, people only agree with content that aligns with their preexisting beliefs and disagree with or label as "fake" content that is opposed to their worldview. This paper proposes to study the psychological differences that cause people to either agree or disagree with such prejudiced and ideologically oriented online disinformation.

TI  - Spatial variation of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration retrieved from AVIRIS-NG images including water vapor correction and spectroradiometric validation for two urban places of India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF CLOUDS AND THE ATMOSPHERE XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - This is a report on the spatial variation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration with urban congestion estimated from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral images procured for the first time in the tropical urban atmosphere of India. It combines hyperspectral field measurements and airborne image analysis and puts forward a modified version of differential optical absorption spectroscopic technique, termed as a-DOAS that defines the absorption depths through weighted average of radiance at absorbing and nonabsorbing wavebands. Field spectroradiometry was carried out for part of two adjacent cities, namely Howrah and Kolkata, over sites of varied population density and vehicle abundance at both narrow and wide angle field-of-view. The local concentrations of atmospheric CO2 at the ground surface and the solar illumination at the measuring spot were noted simultaneously. As an alternative to the general validation method of comparing the image-derived absorption depth with that simulated with radiative transfer model, the present work is based on the image-derived and the groundbased data. The relative differences of the surface reflectance for the pixels of different features were reduced by normalizing the pixel values with suitable constants. While calculating the CO2 absorption depths, a correction for the adjacent water vapor absorption band was made with MODTRAN simulation. Since the pixel-to-pixel variation of radiance was too fine, the CO2 map was generated by computing average through convolution and filtering with kernel of 11x11 pixels. The overall observation was lower concentration for vegetated regions in comparison with concreted urban areas.

AB  - Radon is a natural radioactive gas that is derived from the decomposition of uranium-238 in the soils, rocks, sand and water. This study aimed to investigate whether the replacement of some amounts of raw brick materials (rocks, sand, cement) with treated kenaf fibre can reduce the Rn-222 emanations in fabricated composite bricks. Rn-222 concentrations were measured on four different fabricated bricks in Perspex box using Radon Monitor Sentinel Model 1030. 10 g of treated kenaf fibres were added by different formula of raw materials. Rn-222 concentration reading for each brick was measured within 72 hours consecutively. The results show that the properties of kenaf fibre was influenced the Rn-222 concentrations. The average of Rn-222 concentrations for composite brick 1, 2 and 3 were 1.0 pCi/L, 3.8 pCi/L, 4.1 pCi/L and 3.1 pCi/L, respectively. Composite brick 2 (gravel/kenaf fibre) show the highest average of Rn-222 concentration with 4.1 pCi/L. Meanwhile, concrete brick that act as control shows the lowest average of Rn-222 concentration with 1.0 pCi/L.

AB  - In this work, Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) method is used to reconstruct the missing values of chlorophyll-a concentration in the Arabian Sea, derived from ocean color data. The DINEOF techniques are applied to an aggregated data of 15-year (2003-2017) MODIS Aqua L3 ocean color data. (Results obtained from gap-free chlorophyll-a data provide a reliable observation and efficiency in finding the spatio-temporal variability and the seasonal response. In addition climatological analysis highlights the dynamic nature of chlorophyll-a concentration along the Arabian Sea and relative dominance in the Northern Arabian Sea over long-time-scale compared to other regions due to its response towards the monsoonal fluctuation. Further studies will improve our insight into the vulnerability of phytoplankton community structure to climate change.

AB  - The Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the ESA Sentinel-2 (S-2) allows satellite the Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) to be measured at much higher spatial resolution (10 m) than has been previously possible with space-borne sensors such as Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer aboard ENVISAT or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus aboard Landsat. Therefore, multi-spectral analysis of remote sensing data today represents an efficient tool for monitoring vegetation in a Mediterranean environment, where spatial resolution often represents a limiting factor due to high fragmentation and spatial distribution of forest stand.The aim of this study has been to map the health conditions of the Castelporziano coastal pinewood forest (Roma). To this aim, we used a diachronic NDVI index, provided by ESA Sentinel-2 images and field observations, to monitor the health status in a historic pinewood forest that has recently been affected by a rapid diffusion of pests (Tomicus destruens Woll.). The monitoring performed allowed us to map the pinewood forest in risk classes and at the same time to provide data concerning the localization of areas showing a strong decline. Thus, we provide information useful for the correct management and planning of forestry thinning to preserve those areas of the pinewood forest not involved in the decline process.

Results about meteorological influences upon spatial variation of air pollution exposure are presented on this data basis which is more than one year long. Special focus is on the information about atmospheric layering as well as mixing and transport conditions for emitted particulate matter. Better understanding of these complex processes support knowledge about quality of air, which we breath, and especially high air pollution episodes and hot spot pollution regions.

TI  - Identifying new associations between invasive aphids and Pinaceae trees using plant sentinels in botanic gardens
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite progress in prevention and management of biological invasions, challenges remain, including difficulties with assessing future invasion risks. Predicting the identity of potentially damaging invaders is complex because they are often unknown as pests in their natural range. We used a plant sentinel approach to assess host ranges of invasive aphids across 62 conifer species from around the world in Christchurch Botanic Gardens, as a model for risk assessment such as for the International Plant Sentinel Network'. Using standardised sampling, we obtained ca. 600 observations of aphid abundances (4731 individuals), mainly of the pine aphids Eulachnus brevipilosus and Essigella californica and the spruce aphids Cinara pilicornis and Elatobium abietinum. These aphids were highly genus-specific, despite the spatially mixed distribution of genera. A phylogenetic analysis of pine aphid host preferences showed that abundances of species varied among pine subgenera and the geographic origin of trees, with significantly more aphids on pines in the subgenus Pinus than the subgenus Strobus. Essigella californica occurred abundantly on many pines across most subsections in the subgenus Pinus whereas E. brevipilosus was largely restricted to a few species in the subsection Pinus. Our study revealed several new host records (previously unknown aphid-host relationships) including the abundant occurrence of E. brevipilosus on Japanese red pine, P. densiflora, and of E. californica on P. yunnanensis, P. serotina, P. brutia, and P. nigra, among others. Our study identified numerous novel insect-plant interactions that are likely to materialise if these aphids colonise new host plants, confirming the utility of the plant sentinel approach.

T2  - NEPALESE HEART JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Awareness raising is an important component of primary prevention of RHD. Data are lacking on primary prevention activities for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) prevention in Nepal. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various awareness raising activities on increasing knowledge about throat infection (TI), acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and RHD and their impact on RHD prevention.Methods: Fourteen randomly selected government health facilities in Lalitpur were enrolled in this study. A baseline study conducted in early 2015 analyzed the level of knowledge about RHD among care seekers attending health facilities in Lalitpur. An expansive public awareness raising activities on RHD were performed for 2.5 years starting from February 2015. Data were collected using structured interviews, and review of health facility records. Data were analyzed to compare the postintervention status with the baseline status.Results: The mean knowledge about ARF and RHD increased by over 71% (1.82 to 3.12) and 124% (0.37 to 0.83) respectively in post intervention group. There was significant difference in knowledge about TI, ARF and RHD among baseline and post intervention group (p-value<0.0001). The number of throat infection cases presented at health facilities increased by 30.39% from fiscal year (FY) 2071/72 to FY 2072/073 and by 4.69% in the next FY.Conclusions: Awareness raising interventions are effective in increasing knowledge about TI, ARF and RHD which further can produce positive impact in the primary prevention of ARF and RHD.

AB  - an extensive uncertainty is a big concern of deforestation, degradation and forest decentralization. Recorded cases of deforestation in northern regions of Pakistan have drawn serious involvement in the last two decades. These areas include agriculture land and source of fresh water for more than 20 million residents. Downgrading in the forest is also big damage in the ecosystem which increases the flood risk in any community. The fast development in remote sensing (RS) satellites and RS techniques in the last four decades, provides a stable, successive and efficient way for analysis of land cover and land mapping. This work is carried out the analysis of deforestation from 2000-2016. The satellite images of Landsat 4, 5 and 8 are used and processed by Arc GIS software. Maximum Likelihood (ML) supervised classification based on Bayes theorem is used and this technique classified the vegetation, water, and mountains individually. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to calculate the downfall in forests from the vegetation area. This analysis reflected a compelling downturn in forest cover in a period of study.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a useful technique to observe environmental changes which are introduced as a result of man-made activities and physical phenomenon. In this study the land cover patterns of pre-flood period, flood period and post flood period in the year 2015 on upper part of Sindh region have been analysed and difference of vegetation cover, water body and surface temperature before, during and after flood period were observed. Three satellite images of Landsat-8 OLI / TIRS were used in the study acquired on April 11, 2015, August 17, 2015 and October 20, 2015. The land cover classes identify for the study area are healthy vegetation, normal vegetation, wet soil, dry soil and water. Three techniques likelihood supervised classification, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to get more precise results. Supervised classification and NDVI showed the spatial increase of vegetative cover. Increasing vegetation also witnesses from LST record of post flood period. This result indicates that land cover classes and socio-economy of the study area is under the dangerous threat of climate change, especially flood. In flood period, many socio-economic and landuse/landcover changes especially water, vegetation, land, animal and house are damages. The flood comes approximately every year in the study area. The mean LST of pre-flood period was 30.5 degrees C , during flood period was 37 degrees C and post flood was 32 degrees C.

AB  - Syn1334 is the founder and chief executive of the Galactic Hub, and Pepper Dusk was his original homeworld and site of Peaceful Pepperbase. The Pathfinder-era settlement became a spot for heritage tourists who came to pay their respects to the Hub's founder, most of them leaving communication station inscriptions of thanks and admiration in a nearby cave later dubbed by the Hub as the "Cave of Forgotten Dreams" after the Werner Herzog film. Over 60 inscriptions were left behind, and included descriptions of the original landscape, of the base and its racecourse. Some included dates when they were placed, and others contained addresses and invitations to visit other settlements in the Hub and elsewhere. Syn1334 himself left a station with a forwarding address post-Atlas Rises.This is the 2nd site visited by Andrew Reinhard for the No Man's Sky Archaeological Project, and continued his creation of survey and excavation methodology, plus reporting style, that would evolve over the investigation of the remaining 28 sites chosen for the project. In surveying and excavating Pepper Dusk, every excavation of communication stations was filmed. "Stakes" were placed to mark test pits. Remote sensing took place. And after a system crash, Peaceful Pepperbase itself was moved halfway across the planet in a fully restored state.After the old Hub's capital planet of Lennon, Pepper Dusk and its base and inscription-filled cave is the second most important Legacy Hub site.

This is a rare example of a planet being discovered, visited, but not settled by the original player, instead inhabited by another Hub member months after the discovery. The base itself is agricultural with a bi-level hydroponic farm containing rare plants for anyone to harvest.Two sources of delight also make Panda's Legacy Hub base noteworthy. First is the presence of an alpha-class Explorer-type ship, wrecked in the deep desert, marked by a floating communication station indicating an ancient topography. Another comm station marks where a beta-class Hauler-type shipwreck used to be, but the ship is either long-gone or long-buried thanks to the v1.3 update. The second oddity is the Sentinel trapped in the botany bay of the base, something not encountered previously by Reinhard during the NMS Archaeological Project.This is the 24th base investigated by Andrew Reinhard for the No Man's Sky Archaeological project and includes text, photos, videos, and a manifest of communication station inscriptions.

AB  - In studies that involves supervised classification of several temporal images, the use of specific samples extracted from each image may require field work or image interpretation and is often expensive. The cost could be reduced with the use of reference data from a different time. However, there may appear differences in the spectral behavior of land cover classes across time due to imaging issues, which can prevent the proper reuse of this type of training data. This paper assesses the influence of image calibration on the classification of Landsat5/Thematic Mapper (TM) images using Maximum Likelihood classifier and the use of land cover training samples collected in images obtained at different times. Results show that, although the calibration method may affect the classification results, it had a small impact on classification global accuracy.

CP  - Conference on Geo-information for Disaster Management (Gi4DM)
CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - After large flood incidents in Norway, The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE), has the responsibility for documenting the flooded areas. This has so far mainly been performed by utilising aerial images and visual interpretation. Satellite images are a valuable source of additional information as they are able to cover vast areas in each satellite pass. In this paper a fully automated system for detecting and delineating floods with the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1 satellites is presented. In SAR images wet areas and water bodies usually show lower backscatter than dry areas. The flood detection system is thus based on comparing a reference image acquired before the flood with the flood event image. A Sentinel-1 training dataset has been obtained and manually annotated by NVE from three flood events in Norway. This training set has been used to train a random forest (RF) classifier, which outputs a score for each pixel in the SAR image. This score image is thresholded in order to obtain a crude flood detection. Unfortunately, changes in the backscatter may also be triggered by other events such as melting snow and harvested fields of crops. To mitigate such "lookalikes", several techniques have been implemented and tested. This includes masking based on size, slope and "height above nearest drainage" (HAND). The experiments presented show that the system performance is very good. Of the 179 manually labelled flood objects, 168 are detected. The system is being applied operationally at NVE.

TI  - ASAP: A new global early warning system to detect anomaly hot spots of agricultural production for food security analysis
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring crop and rangeland conditions is highly relevant for early warning and response planning in food insecure areas of the world. Satellite remote sensing can obtain relevant and timely information in such areas where ground data are scattered, non-homogenous, or frequently unavailable. Rainfall estimates provide an outlook of the drivers of vegetation growth, whereas time series of satellite-based biophysical indicators at high temporal resolution provide key information about vegetation status in near real-time and over large areas. The new early warning decision support system ASAP (Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production) builds on the experience of the MARS crop monitoring activities for food insecure areas, that have started in the early 2000's and aims at providing timely information about possible crop production anomalies. The information made available on the website (https://mars.jrc.ec.europa.eu/asap/) directly supports multi-agency early warning initiatives such as for example the GEOGLAM Crop Monitor for Early Warning and provides inputs to more detailed food security assessments that are the basis for the annual Global Report on Food Crises. ASAP is a two-step analysis framework, with a first fully automated step classifying the first sub-national level administrative units into four agricultural production deficit warning categories. Warnings are based on rainfall and vegetation index anomalies computed over crop and rangeland areas and are updated every 10 days. They take into account the timing during the crop season at which they occur, using remote sensing derived phenology per-pixel. The second step involves the monthly analysis at country level by JRC crop monitoring experts of all the information available, including the automatic warnings, crop production and food security-tailored media analysis, high-resolution imagery (e.g. Landsat 8, Sentinel 1 and 2) processed in Google Earth Engine and ancillary maps, graphs and statistics derived from a set of indicators. Countries with potentially critical conditions are marked as minor or major hotspots and a global overview is provided together with short national level narratives.

AB  - Over the past years irrigation has become common practice in pear growing (Pyrus communis L. 'Conference') in Belgium and the Netherlands. The presence of an irrigation installation allows pear growers to fertigate by dissolving fertilizers in the irrigation water which increases nutrient uptake efficiency. In an experiment in 'Conference' pear, yield and fruit quality response to different doses of N fertilization was studied. We tested whether optimal pear production was possible applying only 60 kg N (40% reduction) through a combination of broad band fertilization with Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) and calcium nitrate. These approaches were compared with the Growers practice, which means 95 kg N fertilization through a combination of organic manure, CAN and Calcium nitrate. A 20% reduced N fertilization scheme of 75 kg N consisting of organic manure and CAN was also included in the trial. The experimental orchard was irrigated using a regulated deficit irrigation scheme scheduled using a soil water balance. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to study variability in canopy size throughout the orchard. Yield results and soil analysis indicated that fertilization with 60 kg N, partly applied by fertigation, is sufficient to gain maximal yield in the experimental orchard.

AB  - Cotton is an important economic crop and plays an important role in the national economy. Therefore, timely and accurate access to crop planting area and spatial distribution information is very important for government departments to make economic decisions and adjust cotton planting structure. At the same time, crop census and cotton growth monitoring There are also important applications in terms of production estimates and disaster assessment. This study is based on Google Earth Engine remote sensing big data cloud computing platform and Sentinel-2 data, taking Zaoqiang County of Itengshui City, Hebei Province as an example, using nearly 50 scenes of Sentinel-2 data, combined with interest area index calculation, S-G filtering method, etc. The time series phenotypic analysis method was constructed to analyze the phenological characteristics of the main crop cotton and the interfering crop corn in Zaoqiang County. Based on the phenological analysis results, the key time phase data of cotton extraction was screened, and the object-oriented information extraction method was combined with spectral features and texture features. The cotton distribution information of Zaoqiang County was extracted, and the accuracy of the results was analyzed with the field sample data. The overall accuracy was 92%, which satisfied the cotton monitoring application demand of Zaoqiang County.

AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing technology is an effective way to obtain a large-scale land surface temperature. The GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite, the fifth satellite in the national high-resolution Earth observation project of China, was launched May 9, 2018. The Visible and Infrared Multiple-channel Sensor (VIMS) onboard GF-5 can observe land surface thermal emission in four TIR channels within 8.0-12.0 mu m with a spatial resolution of 40 m, much finer than that of ASTER (90 m), Landsat 8 (100 m), and MODIS (1 km). Under the support of national high-resolution earth observation project of China, several algorithms have been developed to retrieve LST and emissivity from VIMS image and generate products. This paper will present an overview the GF-5 LST retrieval algorithms.

AB  - Mountain glaciers are one of the major fresh water resources. Glacier mass balance on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) can directly reflect local climate change and plays a crucial role in the terrestrial water cycle and food security of local people. In this study, we improved the procedure to analyze Three-Line-Array (TLA) stereo images to estimate the glaciers mass balance in Kangri Karpo mountains using Zi Yuan-3 (ZY-3) TLA data and C-band Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in two periods, i.e. 2000-2013 and 2013-2017. The results showed that the mean mass balance of glaciers between 2000 and 2017 was -0.91 +/- 0.02 m w.e. a(-1). The glaciers presented accelerated mass loss in recent years (2013-2017, -2.84 +/- 0.05 m w.e. a(-1)), compared with the first decade in 21st (2000-2013, -1.59 +/- 0.03 m w.e. a(-1)), while the melt rate in debris-covered glaciers was larger than in clean-ice glaciers.

AB  - A novel scheme is proposed for the velocity estimation of ground moving targets in multi-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. This scheme utilizes the velocity estimates of all the detected points to obtain the precise velocity of the moving target. In fact, a moving target consists of multiple point scatterers instead of only one. Therefore, the velocity estimation should be based on the information of all the point scatterers on the moving target rather than only one. In this paper, the information is the velocity estimates of each detected point on the moving target. It is proved that the actual velocity is a weighted average of velocity estimates of all the detected points and the weight of each point is simple to be calculated with acceptable computing cost. The effectiveness is verified by test results from simulated data and real airborne SAR data.

AB  - Thunderstorms and squalls (fronts of contiguous thunderstorms) are associated with short but intense local winds that have a great impact on operability or design conditions for moored ship operations in the coastal zone. The brevity and local scale of such events makes them difficult to capture using standard measurement data and usually requires dedicated long-term measurement campaigns. Because the standard measurements available are usually based on 10-minute averages taken once an hour, such data is often not available. In the absence of conventional measured data, the use of satellite data can provide useful design data if analyzed and applied with caution. We present two case studies (West Africa and Brazil) where squalls have been identified in satellite data and used for extreme value analysis (EVA) to support the design of intermediate water depth mooring systems. The detection of squalls is confirmed with satellite imagery and the handling of this data for the EVA is presented in detail with assumptions made and the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions. The impact on design values is also discussed for both geographic locations.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of short-term 17α-ethynylestradiol exposure in two Californian sentinel fish species sardine (<i>Sardinops sagax</i>) and mackerel (<i>Scomber japonicus</i>)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances which disrupt normal functioning of the endocrine system by interfering with hormone regulated physiological pathways. Aquatic environments provide the ultimate reservoir for many EDCs as they enter rivers and the ocean via effluent discharges and accumulate in sediments. One EDC widely dispersed in municipal wastewater effluent discharges is 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), which is one of the most widely prescribed medicines. EE2 is a bio-active estrogen employed in the majority of oral contraceptive pill formulations. As evidence of the health risks posed by EDCs mount, there is an urgent need to improve diagnostic tools for monitoring the effects of pollutants. As the cost of high throughput sequencing (HTS) diminishes, transcriptional profiling of an organism in response to EDC perturbation presents a cost-effective way of screening a wide range of endocrine responses. Coastal pelagic filter feeding fish species analyzed using HTS provide an excellent tool for EDC risk assessment in the marine environment. Unfortunately, there are limited genome sequence data and annotation for many of these species including Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), which limits the utility of molecular tools such as HTS to interrogate the effects of endocrine disruption. In this study, we carried out RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of liver RNA harvested from wild sardine and mackerel exposed for 5 h under laboratory conditions to a concentration of 12.5 pM EE2 in the tank water. We developed an analytical framework for transcriptomic analyses of species with limited genomic information. EE2 exposure altered expression patterns of key genes involved in important metabolic and physiological processes. The systems approach presented here provides a powerful tool for obtaining a comprehensive picture of endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscapes are meaningful ecological units that strongly depend on the environmental conditions. Such dependencies between landscapes and the environment have been noted since the beginning of Earth sciences and cast into conceptual models describing the interdependencies of climate, geology, vegetation and geomorphology. Here, we ask whether landscapes, as seen from space, can be statistically predicted from pertinent environmental conditions. To this endwe adapted a deep learning generative model in order to establish the relationship between the environmental conditions and the view of landscapes from the Sentinel-2 satellite. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to generate multispectral imagery given a set of climatic, terrain and anthropogenic predictors. The generated imagery of the landscapes share many characteristics with the real one. Results based on landscape patch metrics, indicative of landscape composition and structure, show that the proposed generative model creates landscapes that are more similar to the targets than the baselinemodelswhile overall reflectance and vegetation cover are predicted better. We demonstrate that for many purposes the generated landscapes behave as real with immediate application for global change studies. We envision the application ofmachine learning as a tool to forecast the effects of climate change on the spatial features of landscapes, while we assess its limitations and breaking points.

TI  - Sentinel-2A and 2B absolute calibration monitoring
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - As part of the Copernicus program, Sentinel-2 is the optical imaging mission designed for the operational monitoring of land and coastal areas. It offers a unique combination of global coverage with a wide field of view, a high revisit capability (5days with two satellites), a high resolution and multi-spectral imagery.CNES, the French Space Agency, was involved in the commissioning of both Sentinel-2 satellites and is currently working in collaboration with ESA on their long-term monitoring. This paper reviews all the techniques used to ensure an absolute calibration of the 13 spectral bands to better than 5% (the target is 3%) at TOA level. After a brief description of the mission and its related radiometric calibration scheme, we show how standard vicarious calibration methods based on acquisitions over natural targets (oceans, deserts, and Antarctica during winter) are used to check and improve the accuracy of the absolute calibration coefficients. Finally, the verification scheme, exploiting photometer in-situ measurements over the La Crau plain in France and Gobabeb in Namibia, is described. The paper concludes with a summary that includes spectral coherence, agreement between the results obtained with various calibration methods and temporal evolution.

AB  - When mapping burned areas, the use of indexes such as: NDVI, NDII, SAVI, GEMI and IAQ (BAI) allow the classification of vegetation status, of which the IAQ index has been designed to clearer identification of areas affected by fires. Another alternative is the multitemporal analysis, which detects changes from one image already classified to another, corresponding to the same surface on different dates. The common denominator applies both techniques separately in order to take advantage of the characteristics of a classified image. Therefore, the current study aims to combine multi-temporality and different indexes to integrate both characteristics and facilitate the identification of burned areas. The study area is located in southern Chile with the corresponding dates from January 15 to 30, 2017, where fires consumed much of the endemic forestation of the area. The methodology applied has been based on obtaining and correcting Landsat 8 satellite images prior and after the event. Following this, the different indexes have been calculated to apply the change detection. Thereafter, the results have been integrated to make a multitemporal RGB combination of the new bands where, in the red quill corresponds to the indexes before the event, the green quill to the indexes after the event and the blue quill to the multitemporal difference. As a result of the multi-temporal index combinations, the outstanding index is the SAVI-Multitemporal, which allows 93% visual discrimination of the areas affected by the fires, unlike the SAVI, BAI, GEMI, BAI indexes -Multitemporal and GEMI-Multitemporal with a percentage of discrimination of about 73.33%, 66.67%, 80%, 20% and 86.67%, respectively. Finally, we identified that 157,116,173 hectares of forest have been affected by the fires that occurred in Chile in the studied time period.

T2  - THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION & REGULATORY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim was to analyze safety data associated with the maternal use of antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy and to assess the risk of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) as an outcome in the neonate. A parallel objective was to assess the completeness of the safety information concerning pregnancy exposures in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) and the Patient Information (PI) in the USA and the UK. Methods: We analyzed individual case safety reports of CL/P associated with antiepileptic drugs in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. For the antiepileptic drugs with signals (EB05 >= 2), we reviewed Drug Analysis Prints for CL/P cases in the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed descriptive analyses of relevant SmPCs and PIs in the UK and the USA using a checklist of recommendations collected from the literature. Results: In total 817 CL/P reports were identified for 12 antiepileptic drugs in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Ten of the 12 antiepileptic drugs were associated with 156 CL/P cases in the MHRA Sentinel. Safety information concerning pregnancy was found to be more comprehensive in UK SmPCs than in the US equivalents. Conclusions: There is statistical disproportionality in individual case safety reports indicative of an increased risk of CL/P with 12 antiepileptic drugs studied. More studies are required to explore the association between in utero exposure to antiepileptic drugs and the risk of CL/P. There are inconsistencies between the UK and US safety labels. CL/P associated with antiepileptic drugs is an important topic and requires providing inclusive, unbiased, up-to-date information to prescribers and women of childbearing age.

AB  - This article deals with main elements of the system of personalism developed by the German and American psychologist V. Stern. This system is practically unknown in Russia. Stern's conception is described in the context of teleological worldview which was developing at the beginning of the 20th century. The article discusses Stern's criticism of the preceding personalism and impersonalism and argues that the main feature of Stern's concept of the person is that he places in the position of the ability of consciousness the function of the individual viability of an activity as the person's self-development. The article also analyses his fundamental principle of teleomechanical parallelism, according to which the person, from the external side, interacts with other persons and is therefore inevitably conditioned by the law of causality. As for the internal side, it is an autonomous goal-setting being. The article gives a detailed analysis of features of this model of personalism, i.e. the simultaneous view of the person in perspectives of teleology and causality; placing in the foundation of the personality such parameters as self-protection and self-development; understanding of existence as a hierarchy of persons, panpsychism. The article also discusses Stern's revision of understanding the personality in the spirit of individual causality. According to Stern, the world is a hierarchically designed organism of persons. Each person is a living being potentially able to develop. The system of operating and interacting persons exists between the two borders of the absolute person ("God") and absolute impersonality ("matter"). The article also analyses gnoseological foundations of Stern's ontology. It is Kant's revised doctrine of categories that makes up the foundation of his ontology. The article analyses critically Stern's conception as a sui generis rationalist version of philosophy of life. An attempt of the synthesis undertaken by Stern carries an obvious contradiction of the deductive substantiation of life as an irrational element. The article discusses critical evaluations of Stern's book in Russian philosophical literature (S. L. Frank, priest Pavel Florensky). Stern's conception is incorporated into the context of the doctrine of creative causality in the Russian neo-Leibzianism (L. M. Lopatin, N. O. Lossky, S. A. Levitsky).

TI  - Time analysis of the soil coverage in the territory of the cocais region using remote sensing
T2  - REVISTA TECNOLOGIA E SOCIEDADE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic Information Systems - GISs are one of the most important tools for the analyses of the use and covering of the soil. The present research focus on the use and covering of the soil in the region of the Territory of the Cocais, in the State of Piaui, Brazil, and the huge impacts in the deforestation in the babassu production. For the analysis some images from the LandSat 5 and 8 satellites were used. With that, it was possible to build some maps of the use and occupation of the soil for 4 towns located in the Territorial of Cocais area between 1990 and 2015. It was also used some data made available by IBGE regarding the production of the babassu in the study area. The results show the increasing of the deforestation, with a rising from 2% to 8% in the study area. The study also reveals that there was a reduction of 50% of the riparian forest between 1990 and 2015. The production of the babassu coconut was reduced in 73% when compared with previous data for the years between 1975 e 2015.

AB  - Background: The impact of histologic regression on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) status and on clinical outcome is uncertain.Objective: To investigate whether and to what extent regression <75% is able to predict SLNB status and clinical outcome of patients with melanoma >1-mm thick.Methods: The study included patients with diagnoses given at 4 centers of the Italian Melanoma Intergroup. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models stratified by center were used to analyze the effect of regression on disease-free interval and melanoma-specific survival.Results: Out of 1182 patients given primary cutaneous melanoma diagnoses during 1998-2015 with a Breslow thickness[ 1 mm, 954 (304 with and 650 without regression) were included in the analysis. The proportion of patients with a positive SLNB was lower in patients with regression than without (24.4% vs 31.6%, chi-squared test P =.0368). At multivariate analysis, no association was detected between regression and disease-free interval (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.85-1.46; P =.4509) or melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.44; P =.7600).Limitation: Retrospective analysis.Conclusion: In our series, regression was not an independent prognostic factor in primary cutaneous melanoma patients with Breslow thickness >1 mm whereas it was associated with a lower incidence of SLNB positivity.

TI  - Association of outdoor temperature with lung function in a temperate climate
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute exposure to cold dry air is a trigger of bronchoconstriction, but little is known about how daily outdoor temperature influences lung function.We investigated associations of temperature from a model using satellite remote sensing data with repeated measures of lung function among 5896 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation cohorts residing in the Northeastern US. We further tested if temperature modified previously reported associations between pollution and lung function. We constructed linear mixed-effects models, and assessed departures from linearity using penalised splines.In fully adjusted linear models, 1-, 2- and 7-day average temperatures were all associated with lower lung function: each 5 degrees C higher previous-week temperature was associated with a 20 mL lower (95% CI -34--6) forced expiratory volume in 1 s. There was significant effect modification by season: negative associations of temperature and lung function were present in winter and spring only. Negative associations between previous-day fine particulate matter and lung function were present during unseasonably warm but not unseasonably cool days, with a similar pattern for other pollutants.We speculate that temperature-related differences in lung function may be explained by behavioural changes on relatively warm days, which may increase outdoor exposures.

TI  - Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis Land Cover for Assessment Level Subpixel: A Case Study of Tasikmalaya City Area Based on Landsat Imagery

AB  - Land cover in urban areas can be detected through surveys or using high-resolution imagery with a better accuracy. Especially if the need related to land cover information regionally in the period of the nineties that require the availability of data and unavailability of high resolution images. Therefore, images with intermediate spatial resolution are still required. However, the use of medium-resolution images such as Landsat is constrained by the presence of mixed pixels that cause land cover in urban areas to vary. The mixed pixel will be the source of error in the multispectral classification process, so it takes analysis up to the subpixel level. The need for information up to the subpixel level for ground cover detection can be obtained through the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis method, where one pixel in the Landsat image in this study will be separated into four endmember, ie vegetation, impervious surface, bare soil, and water. These four endmembers are assumed to represent linear combinations of land coverings contained in urban areas in the form of proportions in each pixel. The results show that the endmember can be well separated, whereas the RMS error of 1994th is 0.013 with an accuracy of 94.44%.

TI  - Discriminating among grounded theory approaches
T2  - NURSING INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - To rationalize the selection of a research methodology, one must understand its philosophical origins and unique characteristics. This process can be challenging in the landscape of evolving qualitative methodologies. Grounded theory is a research methodology with a distinct history that has resulted in numerous approaches. Although the approaches have key similarities, they also have differing philosophical assumptions that influence the ways in which their methods are understood and implemented. The purpose of this discussion paper is to compare and contrast three widely used grounded theory approaches with key distinguishing characteristics, enabling a more thoughtful selection of approach. This work contributes to the existing literature through contrasting classic Glaserian grounded theory, Straussian grounded theory, and constructivist grounded theory in a systematic manner with prominent distinguishing characteristics developed from a review of the literature. These characteristics included historical development, philosophical perspective, role of the researcher, data analysis procedures, perspective of the grounded theory, and strengths/critique. Based on this analysis, three considerations are proposed to direct the methodological choice for a study: purpose, philosophy, and pragmatics. Understanding the similarities and differences in the grounded theory approaches can facilitate methodological transparency and determine the best fit for one's study and worldview as a researcher.

TI  - Using remote sensing to quantify ecosystem site potential community structure and deviation in the Great Basin, United States
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The semi-arid Great Basin region in the Northwest U.S. is impacted by a suite of change agents including fire, grazing, and climate variability to which native vegetation can have low resilience and resistance. Assessing ecosystem condition in relation to these change agents is difficult due to a lack of a consistent and objective Site Potential (SP) information of the conditions biophysically possible at each site. Our objectives were to assess and quantify patterns in ecosystem condition, based on actual fractional component cover and a SP map and to evaluate drivers of change. We used long-term 90th percentile Landsat NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and biophysical variables to produce a map of SP. Ecosystem condition was assessed using two methods, first we integrated fractional components into an index which was regressed against SP. Regression confidence intervals were used to segment the study area into normal, over-, and under-performing relative to SP. Next, the relationships between SP and fractional component cover produced SP expected component cover, from which we mapped the actual cover deviation. Much of the study area is within the range of conditions expected by the SP model, but degraded conditions are more common than those above SP expectations. We found that shrub cover deviation is more positive at higher elevation, while herbaceous cover deviation has the opposite pattern, supporting the hypothesis that more resistant and resilient sites are less likely to change from the shrub dominated legacy. Another key finding was that regions with significant annual herbaceous invasions tend to have lower than expected bare ground and shrub cover.

TI  - Impact of the Diabetes Canada Guideline Dissemination Strategy on the Prescription of Vascular Protective Medications: A Retrospective Cohort Study, 2010-2015
T2  - DIABETES CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVEThe 2013 Diabetes Canada guidelines launched targeted dissemination tools and a simple assessment for vascular protection. We aimed to 1) examine changes associated with the launch of the 2013 guidelines and additional dissemination efforts in the rates of vascular protective medications prescribed in primary care for older patients with diabetes and 2) examine differences in the rates of prescriptions of vascular protective medications by patient and provider characteristics.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe study population included patients (>= 40 years of age) from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) with type 2 diabetes and at least one clinic visit from April 2010 to December 2015. An interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the proportion of eligible patients prescribed a statin, ACEinhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or antiplatelet prescription in each quarter. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prescriptions were the reference control.RESULTSA dynamic cohort was used where participants were enrolled each quarter using a prespecified set of conditions (range 25,985- 70,693 per quarter). There were no significant changes in statin (P = 0.43), ACEI/ARB (P = 0.42), antiplatelet (P = 0.39), or PPI (P = 0.16) prescriptions at baseline (guideline intervention). After guideline publication, there was a significant change in slope for statin (-0.52% per quarter, SE 0.15, P < 0.05), ACEI/ARB (-0.38% per quarter, SE 0.13, P < 0.05), and reference PPI (-0.18% per quarter, SE 0.05, P < 0.05) prescriptions.CONCLUSIONSThere was a decrease in prescribing trends over time that was not specific to vascular protective medications. More effective knowledge translation strategies are needed to improve vascular protection in diabetes in order for patients to receive the most effective interventions.

AB  - The situation at the end of the 19th century was the worst for all the people of Korea. Inside, the corruption of the incompetent leaders was normalized, and the world view centered on China collapsed and the West was coming out. With a collapsed worldview, the people were in a state of uncertainty about where to rely.  Donghak, who emerged in the crisis of the foreign exchange crisis, was put in the mind of the whole people at once by promulgating the hope, tomorrow, receiving the wish of the people. Donghak was born in Gyeongju, Gyeongsang province, but the place where it was most hot was Honam. It is also a dispute that there were many people who were in a harsh situation in the Honam region at that time. Donghak 's gaebyeog sesang was an equal world where all of you and I are recognized and respected by all who are not Hanhwa'ls. And the Messianic salvation hand to present a new vision and hope for a collapsed worldview.  The most affluent land, Honam, was, paradoxically, an area that was subject to abduction and exploitation because of its abundance. Jeonju was always central. Jeonju was the home of Lee Sung - gyeong, the reformer of the Joseon Dynasty, and was the root of the Joseon royal family. Jeonju is not only the spiritual symbol but also the representative city of Honam which is the granary zone. However, the city, which is the center of relative deprivation, was Jeonju, and the symbolic area where the contradictions of the late Joseon Dynasty were dominant was Jeonju. The Donghak, which has overcrowded the people who are hurting and presented them with comfort and new hope, was already structurally spreading to Jeonju in a short time.  In 1861, Mr. Sheen was the first to join the record in Jeonju. Until Choi Shee-Hyeong came to the Sajaam of Iksan in 1884, Donghak was expanding 46  |  동학학보 제51호in Gangwon Province and Chungcheong Province. However, it spread to the entire area of Honam centered on Chonbuk province. This meant that Donghak, which had been spreading around mountainous areas, had advanced into a wide granary area. It was a process of being absorbed into the peasant group, which was a symbol of oppression and persecution. During the Donghak Revolution in 1894, Honam's enthusiastic participation was their desire.  The other area in Honam was not as hot as it was in Jeonju. Jeonju could not know the precise number of participation, but it would have participated Donghak Peasant Revolution. The fervor of the revolution spreading from Jeollabuk - do like the wildfire gathered in Jeonju. Jeonju castle occupation with Jeonla Gamyeong was a symbol of the Donghak armies. Jeonju was no longer the home of Chosun, which is only a horror, but a city of the world of gaebyeogsesang where people are treated like people.

AB  - Young people have been active participants in social creation and destruction. Ideology as a form of social consciousness is crucial for developing worldview and using "soft power". "Soft power" is a leading tool for managing and ensuring social and national security. "Orange revolutions" have shown that it is easy to reform ideological views of citizens, young people. Ideology may have a negative effect on the country and society. The discourse of the "end of ideology" and "de-ideologization" is gradually transforming into the discourse of "national ideology", "ideological security", "importance of patriotism", etc. However, the former schematic classification of ideologies as integral sociopolitical doctrines does not reflect contemporary processes in the "ideological sphere of society". Ideology always involves a value-semantic aspect. Ideological values characterize the evaluative component of ideology and act as an integrative component of the ideological discourse. The coordinate approach is usually used to localize the specifics of ideological orientations of a person or group. Ideologemes are considered as an element of the ideological system and as a linguistic-cognitive phenomenon encoding ideological effects. The authors substantiate methodological approaches to the study of ideological values and orientations, provide examples of sociological analysis. It is emphasized that ideology sets rational explanation schemes for socio-economic and political situations and schemes for assessing these situations and positioning an individual and group in the "We" and "They" continuum. Ideology constructs identities being important for development of the civil identity of Russian students being a factor of national security in current conditions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use ALOS-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar data spanning the period of 2007-2011 to obtain time-dependent ground deformation data over Taal caldera related to the 2010-2011 volcanic unrest, which did not lead to an eruption. We employ finite element models that account for subsurface thermomechanical properties to test for viscoelastic deformation. We also examine the variability of crustal rheological parameters of the temperature-dependent Arrhenius formulation for viscosity, to investigate the effects on surface deformation. Deformation at Taal is observed to be time dependent and explained by a linear rate of pressure increase in a shallow magma reservoir at 5-km depth within a hot and viscoelastic upper crust. The best-fitting rheological properties of the local setting are consistent with either a felsic or hydrothermally altered uppermost crust. We show the significantly different effects that the variation of rheological parameters has on surface deformation, highlighting the importance of incorporation into future studies of deformation at different volcanic settings.

AB  - Soy has emerged in recent years as the main crop agroexport in Brazil, encouraging their expansion and influencing global agricultural dynamic. In this context, this research aims to demonstrate that the geotechnology contribute to monitoring the evolution of agricultural products. Therefore, by using Landsat satellite images, we sought to identify and quantify areas of soybean crop in 2008/09 and 2010/11 in Assis Chateaubriand - Parana/PR, Brazil. It is concluded that the geotechnology assist in monitoring temporo-spatial agricultural products such as soybeans during the season, including generating data that can give support for the analysis of economic behavior culture.

AB  - Annual and within-season crop type monitoring and mapping is an important ongoing consideration for governments, global agricultural monitoring organizations and private interests worldwide. Successful country-wide operational remote sensing-based inventories are well-established utilizing optical-only and optical/single frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) combinations of data. However, the drawbacks of these data combinations are the requirement of multiple sources of imagery throughout the entire growing season, which impedes within-season analysis, and cloud cover effects on the optical data. Currently, C-band SAR data are available with continuous global coverage from Sentinel-1A & B, RADARSAT-2 and from the expected launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). With current and expected launches of several other frequency (L-, P-, etc.) SAR missions over the next few years (SAOCOM, NISAR, etc.) the opportunity for continuous, multi-frequency SAR coverage edges toward reality. The JECAM SAR Inter-Comparison Experiment is a multi-year, multi-partner project that aims to compare global methods for SAR-based crop monitoring and inventory. The third component of this experiment is the assessment of multi-frequency SAR data for crop classification and mapping. Earth observation (EO) data acquisitions of Sentinel-1A & B, RADARSAT-2/RCM, ALOS-2, SAOCOM1 and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X have been planned and requested for the 2019 growing season to complement within field surveys being conducted across the globe. In preparation for these data, this research analyzed ALOS-2, TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data for crop mapping at the JECAM Canada-Carman site using two dates of multi-frequency SAR data, in comparison to a traditional full season optical/SAR dataset. The multi-frequency data had similar overall accuracies as the optical/SAR dataset, and improved on several individual agricultural class accuracies.

AB  - Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has combined RADARSAT-2 C-band dual polarization data with optical imagery to map crop types across the agricultural extent of Canada yearly since 2009. In preparation for the launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) primary research has been focused on incorporating similar-mode dual polarization RCM data in the operational system. The availability of the compact polarimetry (CP) mode with continuous coverage has important implications for crop mapping and inventory. CP mode on RCM has a circular transmit and two orthogonal linear receive structure and maintains phase information. The addition of CP data to AAFC's operational crop type mapping will expand the information that the current dual polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) component provides. This will increase the SAR contribution from the simple intensity of backscatter to capturing the scattering characteristics of the target. There are many parameters and decompositions that can be derived from CP data. Many of these parameters are highly correlated or may not provide information that are important for crop type identification. The goal of this research was to derive twenty-four CP parameters and decompositions for a growing season of SAR imagery and to assess the importance and contribution of these features to an overall classification of crops in southern Manitoba, Canada.

AB  - Cloudy conditions impede and reduce the utility of optical imagery. With the launch of Sentinel-1A and B, the ongoing availability of RADARSAT-2 imagery, and the expected launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), dense time series of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data will now be readily available. For crop classification and mapping, SAR imagery has yet to be used to its full potential and has generally been combined with optical imagery. The JECAM SAR Inter-Comparison Experiment is a multi-year, multi-partner project that aims to compare global methods for SAR-based crop monitoring and inventory. Sets of dense time-series SAR imagery which include RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 data were prepared for this experiment. AAFC's operational Decision Tree (DT) and newly implemented Random Forest (RF) classification methodologies were applied to these SAR only data-stacks, and to optimized, traditional data-stacks of optical/SAR combinations. This paper outlines the results of these dense time-series classifications and how these results were affected by changing numbers of agriculture classes, numbers of available SAR imagery and numbers of training and validation data points for individual crop types. In general, for the dense time-series SAR stacks, overall accuracies of greater than 85%, a typical operational goal, were obtained for 6 of 12 sites. These results have important operational implications for particularly cloudy regions where the availability of optical imagery is limited.

AB  - In this paper we propose multi-resolution data fusion methods for deep learning-based high-resolution land cover mapping from aerial imagery. The land cover mapping problem, at country-level scales, is challenging for common deep learning methods due to the scarcity of high-resolution labels, as well as variation in geography and quality of input images. On the other hand,multiple satellite imagery and low-resolution ground truth label sources are widely available, and can be used to improve model training efforts. Our methods include: introducing low-resolution satellite data to smooth quality differences in high-resolution input, exploiting low-resolution labels with a dual loss function, and pairing scarce high-resolution labels with inputs from several points in time. We train models that are able to generalize from a portion of the Northeast United States, where we have high-resolution land cover labels, to the rest of the US. With these models, we produce the first high-resolution (I-meter) land cover map of the contiguous US, consisting of over 8 trillion pixels. We demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of this data in a case study with domain experts and develop a web application to share our results. This work is practically useful, and can be applied to other locations over the earth as high-resolution imagery becomes more widely available even as high-resolution labeled land cover data remains sparse.

The determining of the frozen/thawed soil state is carried out in three ways: 1) by multi-temporal radar data on the basis of a significant in 35 dB the backscatter coefficient difference in the transition to freezing/thawing soil state, 2) by finding the threshold value of the backscatter coefficient at which the temperature in the topsoil layer falls below 0 degrees C, 3) by texture features.

TI  - A NOVEL MODEL FOR ORIENTATION OF LINEAR OPTICAL SATELLITE IMAGES BASED IN THE ADAPTATION OF THE ORBIT-ATTITUDE MODEL
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper a novel model to orient a pushbroom linear optical satellite image is proposed. This one is based in the adaptation of the Orbit-Attitude model for use of the Modified UCL Kepler platform model. It has only the components of satellite position and velocity as unknowns. This implies not only the reduction of unknowns but also the elimination of initial adjustments of the orbit to estimate the polynomial parameters. In order to validate the model, four experiments were conducted using one HRC-CBERS 2B image. Two distributions of ground controls points (GCPs) were tested, 70 and 35 GCPs. A quantity of 43 check points (CPs) was used to analyze the planimetric accuracies of the orientations. For comparisons purpose the image was also oriented with platform model using 2nd order polynomial. The results showed that the planimetric accuracy difference in the use of the two models is 4 and 6 centimeters in the two mentioned configurations of GCPs, respectively. However, the main advantage of applying the proposed model is the direct use of ephemeris without the necessity of interpolations and preadjustments, which makes the orientation process simpler.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The morphostructural conditioning in geomorphological evolution of igneous-migmatitics territories from district of Taperuaba, Ceara Central Sertao, was investigated through the integration of geological, morphotectonic, geographic and remote sensing data. Thus, information regarding lithological properties, regional and superficial deformations were allied to PDI and photointerpretation in Sentinel-2A and ALOS-PALSAR RTC images, with the aim of identifying ductility and brittle behavior that conditioning morphogenesis of current landforms. In this context, it was possible to identify 3050 lineaments, in the scale of 1: 25.000. The preferred structural trend is WNW-ESE, even tendency for a main foliation and mineral stretching lineation of rocks from this. Consequently, the main channels denote the same direction from main structural trend. The structural density is very high to moderate in landaforms with anisotropy lithologies and moderate to very low in landforms with isotropic lithologies. In this way, the erosive dynamic was more agressive in areas with high lineaments density, denoting more dissected landforms in lithologies with constancy of foliation. By contrast, in areas of low anisotropy and low density of lineaments, as in granitic-diatextic rocks, the massifs and crests arised in landscape. Therefore, exhumation and planning of the study area are genetically subordinated to a lithostructural control, denoted by the differentiation topographic levels and by the lineaments concentration.

TI  - MF-TDMA Scheduling Algorithm for Multi-Spot Beam Satellite Systems Based on Co-Channel interference Evaluation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high throughput satellites (VHTS) are the new trend in satellite communications systems in order to satisfy the increasing demand for both higher throughput and ubiquitous connectivity. Implementing an IP interactive network over a VHTS would enable the satellite to compete with terrestrial networks by offering ubiquitous added value services for end-user traffic. Even so, the simulations presented in this paper show that a 30% of throughput can be lost due to co-channel interferences. In existing interactive satellite networks such as REDSAT or AmerHis, the return uplink transmissions are inherently benefited from the MF-TDMA scheduling to mitigate the co-channel interferences present in VHTS. In such networks dynamic resource assignation (DAMA) is executed at each SuperFrame period (<100 ms). Therefore, any feasible optimization on the scheduling shall be performed in real time. In this paper, two parallel problems are faced at the same time: co-channel interference mitigation and real time scheduling. In particular, two novel interference-aware scheduling algorithms for a DVB-RCS2 return uplink are presented. Despite other previous works, the proposed algorithms are designed on the basis to be executed in real time on a fixed SuperFrame period basis. The performance assessment of the proposed algorithms is carried out through system-level simulations based on realistic satellite scenarios and interactive traffic models using DAMA in real time.

AB  - Malaria surveillance and response-systems are essential for identifying the areas most affected by malaria and for targeting interventions and optimising resources. This study aimed to assess whether the visualisation of routinely collected health facility data linked to village of residence provides evidence for targeting control interventions in four sentinel health facilities in Papua New Guinea. A video format was used to visualise the dynamics in case incidence over time and space alongside photographs illustrating the context of the data collection in the study sites. Incidence changes overtime were illustrated in animated maps. Despite limitations, this approach appeared useful in sites with very few remaining cases or with increasingly marked heterogeneity. Villages that could benefit from targeted interventions or investigations were identified.

AB  - One of the ways of categorization of reality through the vegetal code of culture is considered through the example of folklore of Mordva-Erzya and Moksha. The sacred nature of this code and the mechanism of its correlation with the worldview of man is of particular interest. The research reveals their close connection with the aesthetic associations developed by folk culture for many centuries and strengthened in the minds of Erzya and Moksha, and in general, the Finno-Ugric peoples as standards of beauty. The described fragment of the linguistic picture of the world is a complex system of images, which reflect the archaic structures of consciousness, the oldest archetypal and mythological representations. An extensive paradigm of images included in this ethnic culture is considered in the context of the system of traditional images of other peoples of the Volga region, inter-ethnic parallels are drawn. The reconstruction based on the materials of Mordovian folklore through the prism of the vegetal code of culture helps to recreate the features of perception and understanding of the phenomena of reality, to detect natural inter-ethnic similarities and differences.

TI  - Parent Feeding Practices in the Australian Indigenous Population within the Context of non-Indigenous Australians and Indigenous Populations in Other High-Income Countries-A Scoping Review
T2  - ADVANCES IN NUTRITION
M3  - Review
AB  - Although extensive literature on parent feeding practices among the general Australian population exists, Australian Indigenous populations are generally overlooked. A systematic scoping review was carried out to map any source of literature showing Indigenous parent feeding practices in Australia in the context of what is known about parent feeding practices among broader Australian populations and Indigenous populations in other high-income countries. A search of 8 electronic health databases was conducted. Inclusion criteria were children aged <12 y and reporting >= 1 child outcome related to childhood overweight and/or obesity, body mass index, dietary intake, or eating behavior in the context of parent feeding practices. Studies were grouped according to Indigenous status of the population for data extraction and synthesis. A total of 79 studies were identified; 80% (n = 65) were conducted among the general Australian population and <20% (n = 14) focused on Indigenous populations. Although a wide range of feeding practices were identified among the general Australian population, Indigenous practices most closely aligned with highly responsive and permissive parenting dimensions. The highly valued child autonomy in Indigenous parenting is sometimes criticized by researchers when viewed through a Western lens because the child has agency in deciding what and when to eat. Evidence-based understanding and knowledge of Indigenous parent feeding practices in Australia are limited. Indigenous worldviews are expressed distinctly differently than the general Western worldview in parent feeding practices. How worldviews are represented in parent-child relationships is important to consider for the way in which research with Indigenous populations is conducted and the evidence it generates to inform policy and practice.

TI  - Impact of Catchments Morphology and Lithology on Stream Channels System in High Mountains of Arid Zone (Example of High Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - PALEOBIODIVERSITY AND TECTONO-SEDIMENTARY RECORDS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TETHYS AND RELATED EASTERN AREAS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st Springer Conference of the Arabian-Journal-of-Geosciences (CAJG)
CL  - Hammamet, TUNISIA
AB  - Several factors control the morphodynamics of stream channels in high mountains of arid zone. The aim of the paper was to analyze the relation between stream channels system, catchment morphology and lithology based on examples of three small catchments of ephemeral streams that are tributaries of the Dades River (High Atlas, Morocco). The research included analysis of the topographic and the geological maps, LANDSAT, Google Earth images and the geological and geomorphological field survey. The results showed that the drainage density is strongly controlled by lithology. In the catchment built of conglomerates, the density of stream channels is almost one and a half time greater than in catchments built of limestones and almost twice as large if we take into account only initial channels. Tectonics impacts the stream density to a lesser extent. Two catchments built of limestones which are strongly fissured due to joint system and some faults are characterized by much lower drainage density than the catchment built of conglomerates where signs of discontinuous deformation are sparse. The stream channels of high-order formed in conglomerates are wide and low-gradient, whereas the initial and the first-order channels are narrow, deep, and closely spaced. In catchments built of limestone, the relation is reverse.

TI  - Deforestation in the peruvian Amazon: indexes of Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) changes based on GIS
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA ASOCIACION DE GEOGRAFOS ESPANOLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The forests of the Peruvian Amazon have undergone important transformations since the middle of the last century. This work evaluated the changes of Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) in the province of Rodriguez de Mendoza (Peruvian Amazon), through the methods of supervised classification of maximum probability and interdependent visual interpretation of images of the Landsat satellite, between the 1987-2001 and 2001-2016. Cross-tabulation matrices were constructed and annual change rates were calculated. The results show an accumulated loss of 918,59 km(2) of forest cover. The intensity of LC/LU and the deforestation rate were higher in the second period of analysis. It was evidenced that the high concentrations of loss of forest cover are close to the road and water network. The main causes of the loss of forests were the livestock activity and the migratory agricultural expansion to the small farm, favored by the accessibility of the transport infrastructures.

TI  - Urban development <i>versus</i> wetland loss in a coastal Latin American city: Lessons for sustainable land use planning
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a primary cause of wetland loss in coastal metropolitan regions. Therefore, it challenges the preservation of biodiversity and the provision of key ecosystem services for urban settlements. These services include leisure and recreation, climate and water regulation, water purification, and especially alleviation of natural hazards. Tsunami flood mitigation is a particularly valuable regulating service provided by these wetlands, as recently evidenced during the 2010 tsunami that hit the central coast of Chile.The Concepcion Metropolitan Area (CMA), located on the central coast of Chile, has experienced noticeable wetland loss in recent decades. Our study focused on the Rocuant-Andalien wetland, which has been particularly affected by urbanization. This wetland strongly contributes to flood control, and has provided effective protection against the CMA's latest tsunamis (1835 and 2010). Based on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), we have quantified urban growth over the wetland, both executed and projected under the Metropolitan Urban Plan of Concepcion (MUPC). Recent loss in wetland area by urban growth has been quantified using land use and cover change (LUCC) maps from 2004 to 2014, obtained from the classification of Landsat images. Prospective changes (considering the complete MUPC deployment) have been inferred by combining the MUPC with the 2014 land cover map. In addition, we quantified the observed effect and planned urban growth on the wetland protected area, geoforms and potential flooding based on the area affected by the last Tsunami. Results show that urban areas have increased by 28% between 2004 and 2014, while future increase is expected to reach 238%. In contrast, wetland area has decreased by 10% from 2004 to 2014 and is expected to decrease by up to 32%. Thus, the MUPC is not contributing to the mitigation of wetland loss nor the preservation of its biodiversity and ecosystem services. Implications for coastal planning are discussed.

TI  - DTM GENERATION FROM AERIAL PHOTO AND WORLDVIEW-3 IMAGES BY USING DIFFERENT DSM FILTERING METHOD
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The goal of this study is to analyze the suitability of the filtering method towards the generation of Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the Digital Surface Model (DSM). In this case, DSM was produced by optical images sensor with stereoscopic viewing. Two kinds of optical images that used which are Very High-Resolution Satellite (VHRS) image Worldview-3 and Aerial Photograph from Drone mission. Furthermore, there are three different DSM filtering methods are used which are Elevation Threshold with Expand Window (ETEW), 2D Morphological Square (Morph 2D Filter), and Adaptive TIN (A-Tin). The ALDPAT v.1.0 software was used to implement that algorithm. Also, the visual interpretation from their correspondent images is used to evaluate the quality of the filtering process. A good filtering result will remove the point that not represent a terrain. The missing of the non-ground point due to the filtering process than filling by implementation the same interpolation algorithm. The ETEW and A-Tin filter algorithm are suitable for residential areas. While the A-Tin filter algorithm gives the best results in the vegetation area. An iterative filtering process should be implemented to make a non-terrain point completely remove. Further, an interpolation process should be made for filling the missing non-terrain point.

Las estrategias para recoger datos fueron las entrevistas en profundidad y la observacion participante. Los datos se categorizaron y ordenaron en esquemas logicos manualmente y a traves del programa ATLAS-ti v.5.Results: El chumpi makes newborns transport easier and protects them from the cold of the Andean region while being carried by their working mothers. However, we found that this practice remains among Bolivian immigrants in southeast Spain.Conclusions: Quechua worldview motivations lead Bolivian women to continue practising el chumpi in destination countries. El chumpi molds the body and the character of the infant so that a strongly wrapped child will be strong. El chumpi, a practice of care, becomes a cultural identity sign. El chumpi generates controversial situations within the health sphere.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to measure by differential absorption lidar (DIAL) the ozone vertical distribution (OVD) in the upper troposphere - stratosphere at wavelengths 299/341 and 308/353 nm and to compare the results with satellite data.. lidar complex for measuring the OVD in the altitude range similar to (5- 45) km has been created. Here we analyze the results of ozone lidar measurements at wavelengths of 299/341 nm and 308/353 nm in March 2017 - January 2018 at Siberian Lidar Station (SLS) and compare them with satellite (AURA/MLS and IASI/MetOp) measurements of OVD. The retrieved lidar OVD profiles in the upper troposphere - stratosphere in comparison with AURA/MLS and IASI/MetOp profiles, as well as the stitched OVD profile in comparison with the mid-latitude Kruger model confirm the prospects of using the pairs of ozone sounding wavelengths 299/341 and 308/353 nm.

TI  - APPLICATION OF COMPUTER MODELING METHODS OF FLOOD ZONES AT MAXIMUM DESIGN WATER LEVELS FOR SOLVING PROJECT TASKS IN THE DISTURBED LANDS RECULTIVATION AND DESIGN OF BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES NEAR WATER BODIES
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of modeling zones of maximum flooding of rivers ( flood zones) during engineering surveys for design and construction of economic activity objects, development of projects for the disturbed lands recultivation in the zones of direct impact of water bodies is related to the fact that under current conditions, with ever-increasing requirements for security and business continuity of the projected facilities, the existing methods for assessing the risk of flooding do not always give a satisfactory result in order to fully assess whether there is a risk for the projected facility or not.The main aim of the research is to analyze domestic and foreign experience in modeling flood zones at maximum river water levels for practical solution of problems of engineering design, to assess advantages and disadvantages of the main approaches in the practice of surveys, to demonstrate the possibilities of modeling method for solving a particular engineering problem.Methods. The method of spatial data analysis for creating a digital terrain model via geoin formation systems was used for preparing initial data; the method of numerical simulation of the Inya river flood zone and the abandoned quarry excavation located on the left bank as part of the works on preparation of the project for the disturbed lands recultivation was used to calculate the maximum flood zone. Numerical modeling was carried out using HEC-RAS simulation system, ver. 5.0.5.Results. The author has carried out the review of the existing worldvvide and domestic practice of numerical modeling of flood zones for rivers when solving the problems in the field of engineering design. The paper introduces the author's own model of the calculated flood zone on the example of the recultivation site "Mokhovskoye pole" The example of assessment of the impact on the recultivated object when implementing the most negative scenario (probable flooding of the pit in the period of the maximum water flow of 1 % occurrence) was shown, the advantages and disadvantages of applying different approaches in practice were described.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - During last decades, the forensic opportunity to detect and identify explosives became more and more important both to protect the safety of citizens and to support the investigations against terrorists and organised crime. The analytical chemistry of explosives has a long tradition of spot test and more traditional approaches, such as chromatography, but has also new tools, such as electro-optical ones, allowing both point detection and remote sensing. In this chapter, four spectroscopic laser based techniques are presented highlighting working principles and capabilities in discriminating explosive compounds at trace level, in field operation, locally or remotely. For each techniques, the detection limits and drawbacks are reported in the application to trace sensing. Such electro-optics tools do not aim to replace the traditional laboratory methods, rather to support them in security applications and in narrowing the area under investigation, reducing the number of samples selected for laboratory analysis. More traditional approaches are then presented and discussed to illustrate the latest development with respect to on-site testing, sampling and analysis by chromatography, electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.

AB  - Neoplastic spread to lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic factors in female cancer and one of the well known TNM classification parameters, together with tumor size and distant metastases. The nodal status is in faet a significant predictor, which supports clinicians to decide on the most appropriate surgical approach and subsequent therapy. The precise intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph node and eventual metastatic burden is therefore decisive for providing high diagnostic quality and reliable staging. Since methodologies differ across institutions, standardization of results is also a challenge. Today, one step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) meets all these needs.

TI  - gnuradio/gnuradio: Release 3.8.0.0
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Release 3.8.0.0 Witness me! Tonight, we release GNU Radio 3.8.0.0. It's the first minor release version since more than six years, not without pride this community stands to face the brightest future SDR on general purpose hardware ever had. Since we've not been documenting changes in the shape of a Changelog for the whole of the development that happened since GNU Radio 3.7.0, I'm afraid that these release notes will be more of a GLTL;DR (git log too long; didn't read) than a detailed account of what has changed. What has _not** changed is the fact that GNU Radio is centered around a very simple truth: Let the developers hack on DSP. Software interfaces are for humans, not the other way around. And so, compared to the later 3.7 releases, nothing has fundamentally modified the way one develops signal processing systems with GNU Radio: You write blocks, and you combine blocks to be part of a larger signal processing flow graph. With that as a success story, we of course have faced quite a bit of change in the systems we use to develop and in the people that develop GNU Radio. This has lead to several changes that weren't compatible with 3.7. This is an excerpt only: Fixed Project Scope Roughly 36 dBBug, (ETOOMANYBUGS) Fixed .so versioning Changed Project Scope C++11 merged the wholeness of the next branch Dependency version bumps: CMake, GCC, MSVC, Swig, Boost New dependencies: MPIR/GMP, Qt5, gsm, codec2 Removed dependencies: libusb, Qt4, CppUnit Python: Python 2 & Python 3 compatible. 3.8 will be the last Py2k-compatible release series gengen was replaced by templates (if you don't know gengen, don't do any research; save yourself that sorrow) Modern CMake (as far as feasible at this point) VOLK version updated to v2.0.0 .clang-format file now dictates coding style clang-format'ed the whole tree. installed CMake files now tell about configuration gnuradio-runtime reworked fractional tag time handling, especially in the context of resamplers GRC C++ generation as option YAML instead of XML removed blks2 much better canvas tooling consistent gobject usage ROUNDED ARROWS gr-qtgui moving from Qt4 to Qt5 gr-utils gr_modtool now vastly improved gr-vocoder improved versatility removed in-tree libgsm, libcodec2, use system-wide libs Removed Project Scope Modules gr-comedi, gr-fcd and gr-wxgui are gone gr-comedi nobody could remember who used this, or for what. It has seen 0 active code contributions in the 3.7 lifecycle gr-digital python-based packet_encoder and related tools: Bugs that were sporadic and never fixed, so after long deprecation, we're removing it gr-fcd since it's currently untestable by the CI, it's being removed, as there was no code contributions. Generally, we strive to include all batteries with GNU Radio. Re-integration within a more general SDR interface would be desirable. gr-utils removed PyQwt (dead) based tools gr-wxgui Unmaintained, breaks on increasingly many systems, always was slower than Qtgui. We've been starting to tell people to migrate to Qt since at least 2015. Now, we're finally removing it.

TI  - Morphological and molecular responses in ovaries of <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> collected in two different sites of the Naples Bay
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mytilus galloprovincialis female specimens were collected from two mussel farms located in two sites next to Castel dell'Ovo, a historical complex located in the Naples Bay. Such sites were named, respectively, A-area and B-area for the different microbiological parameters so that mussels from A-area can be sold without purification, whereas mussels from B-area must be purified before sale. The mussels were collected during the nonreproductive (summer 2009) and reproductive periods (autumn 2009). Gonadosomatic index, structural organization of the ovary, presence of apoptosis, estrogen receptors expression, as well as the bisphenol A (BPA) content in the ovaries, were evaluated. Ovaries from specimens collected in area B showed a different and significant distribution of the investigated biomarkers as well as of BPA content in respect to those measured in the A-area specimens, confirming that mussels are valid sentinel organisms to biomonitor in the Naples bay too.

TI  - Neocolonial mind snatching: Sylvia wynter and the curriculum of <i>Man</i>
T2  - CURRICULUM INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In her scholarship of the past five decades, Sylvia Wynter has woven a critique of education in Caribbean, European, African, and American societies. In addition, her work demonstrates how education globally structures a particular cultural, historical, and onto-epistemic anti-Black/anti-Indigenous worldview. In Wynter's most neglected piece of work 'Do Not Call Us Negros' How Multicultural Textbooks Perpetuate Racism she weaponizes the second and third wave of her work(1) to unpack and provide a fresh critique to the Black English debates that occurred in California in the 1990s. In this, she reframes debates about history curriculum and culture from a white conservative nativist one of Man (the status quo) to the alternative Black Studies Alterity Perspective rooted in the liminal Black socio-historical-cultural experiences. Continuing Wynter's layered excavation of education as the site of EuroAmerican cultural reproduction, I sketch out a different philosophical discourse to those grounded in capital and/or race debates of the social sciences; I present a philosophical European coming of age story of humanism as a distant stage in how the West became self-aware and created a consciousness of itself. In doing so, this Western European humanism, or what Wynter coins Man for short, embarked on a 500-year journey of colonialism/coloniality to plunder the gifts and talents of the minds and bodies of non-middle-class, non-European populations through a process/technique of what I coin Neocolonial Mind Snatching.

TI  - Patterns of spectral, spatial, and long-term variability in light attenuation in an optically complex sub-estuary
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The attenuation of solar radiation controls many processes and characteristics of aquatic ecosystems and is a sentinel of larger-scale environmental change. While light attenuation is often characterized with a single broadband diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation (K-d PAR), attenuation can exhibit substantial variability across the solar spectrum and through time and space. Understanding this variability and its proximate causes may provide information to characterize large-scale environmental change. We implemented a semi-analytical K-d model in four segments of the Rhode River sub-estuary of the Chesapeake Bay to examine spectral, spatial, and temporal variability in K-d across the ultraviolet (UV) to PAR wavelengths (290-710 nm) over the period 1986-2014. We used this model to identify wavelengths most sensitive to long-term change, the seasonal phenology of long-term change, and the optical constituents driving changes. The model included contributions by phytoplankton, non-algal particulates, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and water. Over the period of record, K-d increased (water transparency decreased) in both UV and PAR wavelengths, with the largest increases at the most upstream site, during summer months, and at short UV wavelengths. These increases were due primarily to an increase in non-algal particulates, and particularly since year 2005, however there was substantial seasonality in K-d. The model reveals how different changes in water quality have a differential effect on UV and PAR attenuation, and enables insight into what types of long-term change in transparency have occurred over the long period of human impacts in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

AB  - In Earth Observation, Analysis Ready Data (ARD) are commonly referred to as satellite data that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organised into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and that facilitates interoperability through both time and space with other datasets. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) is currently developing a set of ARD specifications for both optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data under the so called CARD4L (CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land) framework [1], [2].The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) generates global SAR mosaic on an annual basis from data acquired by the JERS-1 SAR, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 missions. The mosaic products have been subject to full geometric and radiometric corrections and organised into a format that can be considered ARD. In order for the mosaic products to obtain CARD4L certification, JAXA has undertaken a product alignment assessment of what additional processing steps or ancillary information that would be required for the mosaic products also to be compliant with the CARD4L specifications for Normalised Radar Backscatter. The data products, alignment process and outcome of the assessment are described below.

AB  - A study has been conducted to measure the depth of the Mohorovicic (Moho) discontinuity and the Indo-Australian Plate subduction zone in Central Java. Both of these structures have high density contrast and thus are very sensitive to gravity methods. This study uses satellite image gravity data derived from satellite Geodetic Satellite (GEOSAT) and European Remote-Sensing 1 (ERS-1). Satellite data obtained in the form of free air anomaly which then corrected Bouguer using the average density of the Parasnis method of 2.64 g/cm3 so obtained Complete Bouguer Anomaly (CBA). The identification of Moho layers and subduction zones was done using the Energy Spectrum Analysis -the Multi Window Test (ESA-MWT) method with 19 lines of South-North. ESA-MWT results get 9 layers with depths that can reach more than 100 km. The Moho layer is identified as the 4th layer at varying depths from 28 to 63 km. The subduction zone is also identified by ESA-MWT with a depth of about 60 km and deeper to the North. The dip of slab looks sloped down at 40 degrees at the South of Central Java. The dip of slab in the middle of mainland Central Java seen sharply sloped down into the North with a dip of about 75 degrees. All these results are well confirmed by the seismic data of the earthquake in Central Java.

TI  - The influence of aerosol on the sunlight divergence in the atmospheric Indonesia

AB  - Solar radiation is the source of energy for the earth. The amount of solar radiation that reaching the earth's surface, is strongly influenced by the interaction of solar radiation with the atmospheric that is passed through. This paper analyzes the effect of aerosols on solar radiation balance in the Indonesian atmosphere using radiation data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and aerosol optical depth that is obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) - Terra, from March 2000 to February 2016. Aerosol optical depth data (AOD) and shortwave (SW) radiation that reach the top of atmosphere and the earth's surface were analyzed spatially and temporally with the observation area of the 15 degrees S - 15 degrees N and 90 degrees W - 150 degrees E. Moreover, the sample of several locations was analyzed such as Palangkaraya, Pontianak, Banjarmasin and Samarinda, to look at the cases of forest fires which generate aerosols that quite high. Results of data analysis showed a significant influence of aerosols on the divergence of short-wave solar radiation in the atmosphere of Indonesia. The divergence of short-wave radiation shows how much solar radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere. Some cities such as Palangkaraya and Pontianak showed a strong correlation (0.7 - 0.95) between AOD and the value of shortwave radiation divergence. Temporal pattern from time series analysis showed that the increase in the value of AOD due to the fires incident, give the biggest influence on the decrease in solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Shallow water bathymetric surveys support Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Maritime Spatial Planning, e.g. in coastal erosion monitoring, shore protection design and landfall projects oil and gas pipelines. High-resolution multispectral satellite imagery, such as Quick Bird and Worldview, are increasingly used for this purpose. The present study shows the results of a comparison between high resolution satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) derived bathymetry. Accuracy was validated through an hydrographic survey performed with a Multibeam Echosounder (MbEs) at the same time of UAV acquisition. The drone was equipped with a small and light multispectral camera, acquiring in the same WorldView-2 sensors spectral bands. The study area, located in the central Tuscany coast (Italy), is approximately 0.5 km(2). Because of the high percentage of water present in UAV images, a new method was implemented to produce a georeferenced orthophoto mosaic. Multispectral images were processed to retrieve bathymetric data with Stumpf's algorithm. Different pairs of bands were tested to determine the best fit for real water depth data. The influence of sea bottom control points density on data accuracy was also analyzed. Results show the possibility to produce accurate remote sensing bathymetric maps with low operational costs and easy data processing, giving the chance to set up shallow water monitoring programs based on UAV surveys. A further advantage of this method is the capability to produce a full sea-floor coverage bathymetry in very shallow water areas, were MbEs is usually unable to work properly and to represent the aerial option to survey very shallow waters alternatively to Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) a.k.a. ASV (autonomous surface vehicles).

TI  - A decade's experience in primipara, term, singleton, vertex parturients with a sustained low rate of CD
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cesarean delivery (CD) in primiparas with a term singleton vertex fetus (PTSV) is a sentinel event for the future mode of delivery and determinant of repeat CD risk. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for primary CD in a population with a decade of sustained low rate of intrapartum CD.Methods: This was a retrospective single-center cohort study between 2005 and 2014. The primary outcome of the study was the mode of delivery. PTSV who attempted vaginal delivery were identified and categorized according to the mode of delivery: vaginal delivery vs. CD. Risk factors for intrapartum CD adjusted odds ratio (a0R) [95% confidence interval (CI)] in multivariate analysis were reported.Results: During the study, 121,483 deliveries were registered; 26,301 (21.6%) PTSV were admitted in labor, of which 1944 (7.4%) had an intrapartum CD. Significantly in multivariate analysis, this group had a unique risk profile as compared to those who delivered vaginally; non modifiable risks included advanced maternal age: 3.06 (2.16-4.33), P < 0.001; prior multiple (>= 3) miscarriages: 1.94 (1.04-3.62), P = 0.04; low (<6) modified admission cervical score: 2.41 (2.07-2.82), P <0.001; low birth weight (BW): 1.42 (1.00-2.01), P= 0.05 or macrosomia: (2.38 1.77-3.21), P < 0.001; modifiable risks included induction of labor: 1.79 (1.51 2.13), P <0.001 and oxytocin labor augmentation: 8.36 (6.84-10.22), P < 0.001.Conclusion: In a population of PTSV with a sustained low risk for intrapartum cesarean maintained by a strict labor management, induction of labor remains a significant and sole potentially modifiable risk factor for CD.

AB  - Soil moisture is a key environmental variable for developing a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical modeling approach. It is recognized that a relationship does exist between water stress and emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in forested areas, which may have negative effect on human health and ecosystems. Therefore it is necessary to achieve a better understanding of the land phase of the hydrological cycle, namely soil moisture estimation, which modulates surface energy balance and consequently vegetation cover patterns. This work focuses on a new methodological approach to evaluate the spatial variability of surface soil moisture at the field scale using the Bayesian kriging model jointly with TDR measurements and Landsat 8-TM remotely sensed image. The analysis looked for quantifying different deterministic sources of variability, measurement errors and also components not well understood of variability. In particular, the spatial distribution of in situ measurements and digital image data in a scene provided by remote sensing technology is addressed through a geostatistical framework. This technique is explored as alternative to the regression techniques currently used for modeling soil moisture mapping. Tests conducted on an extensively sampled pasture field showed significant improvement, which suggests that the methodological approach could be applied at the watershed scale for validating remotely sensed datasets.

TI  - Generating a supraglacial melt-lake inventory near Jakobshavn, West Greenland, using a new semi-automated lake-mapping technique
T2  - POLAR GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze Landsat-7 imagery spanning a 13-year period (2000-2012) for the Jakobshavn Ablation Region (JAR) along the west coast of Greenland. In addition, we introduce a new semi-automated technique for the mapping of melt-lakes using FoveaPro image-processing software (plug-in to Adobe Photoshop (TM)), greatly simplifying the process, and resulting in more-precise spatial melt-lake statistics over existing manual methods. We found a total mean melt-lake area of 0.30 +/- 0.12 km(2) (+/- 1 sigma), with maximum melt-lake area increasing at an average rate of 0.032 km(2) d(-1 )across the study periods. Additionally, we note a yearly seasonal increase (similar to 1.8 m d(-1)) in the overall mean lake elevation (similar to 200 m per season) as well as an optimal elevation of the largest-area melt-lakes of similar to 1320 +/- 20 m (+/- 1 sigma). We also found an increase in the maximum average melt-lake elevation (MAME) of similar to 3.8 m a(-1) (similar to 50 m). Based on data recorded at nearby automated weather stations, the mean season& temperature increased similar to 1.6 degrees C over the 13-year period at an average rate of 0.125 degrees C a(-1). Although temperature is a driver for meltwater production, we conclude that mechanisms related to the surface topography are more likely modulating the spatial pattern and characteristics of melt lakes in the ablation zone.

AB  - Google Earth Engine currently allows you to export images and assets as either GeoTiff files and tables as Shapefiles, GeoJSON, KML, KMZ or TFrecords.

TI  - Distribution of <i>Parthenium hysterophoru L</i>. with variation in rainfall using multi-year SPOT data and random forest classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the spatial and temporal distribution of weeds such as parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) is crucial to facilitate the management and mitigation of their spread. The availability of historical remotely sensed data with fine spatial resolution from the SPOT mission offer greater prospects to effectively manage and monitor the spread of such weeds. This study sought to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of parthenium with variation in rainfall using multi-year SPOT data and Random Forest classification algorithm. Findings show that parthenium spread in the region is influenced by both rainfall and land use change. Generally, parthenium has been decreasing over the 10-year period of the study and this can be attributed to the low rainfall experienced during this period. Similarly, the sharp incline in parthenium spread in 2016 is attributed to the high rainfall in December that year leading to increased invasion on vacant or bare areas. The low rainfall has not only affected the distribution of parthenium but also of other vegetation classes such as grass-land, thereby increasing the area of bare soils. Moreover, increased parthenium spread has been recorded from areas with frequently disturbed soils, as opposed to areas of infrequent soil manipulation. The readily available SPOT data, when used in concert with robust and advance non-parametric Random Forest and vegetation indices has enabled an affordable large scale and long-term mapping of the aggressive parthenium on crop and rangelands environments.

T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of time series of satellite images allows us to trace the dynamics in the processes of reforestation and forest formation. We estimated the use of the results of cluster analysis of the pixel distribution in the monitoring of post-fire forest restoration. We processed multispectral mid-resolution satellite images (and their fragments) of Landsat 8, Landsat TM/ETM+, Landsat MSS taken in 1973-2016 using the following cluster analysis tools: unmanaged ISODATA classification and thematic difference. The thematic difference was calculated between the results of classifying data into two, four, six, and ten classes. We demonstrated that the post-fire forest restoration takes place in different burned areas with different wildfire intensity. It also depends on the proportion of post-fire wastelands. For example, greater areas of post-fire disturbance have been noted in conditions of a larger proportion of post-fire wastelands. In severely fire-damaged areas, the post-fire vegetation restoration was more intense than in slightly fire-damaged. We calculated the index characterising the forest cover in burned areas. We demonstrated its increase over the time. We considered the relationship between the change in the index characterising the forest cover over the time and the thematic difference of pixels.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are often subject to visual inspection and analysis. Many factors impact on visual quality of SAR images, such as properties of speckle, dynamic range of data, etc. Thus, the corresponding metrics have to be applied and it is worth predicting their values before one starts analyzing images. Using a set of input parameters (both statistical and spectral) and a trained neural network (NN), we show that full-reference visual quality metrics can be predicted for images acquired by modern SAR Sentinel-1. A prediction accuracy is studied and verified on real-life examples. The source codes and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/asrubel/EUVIP2019.

TI  - COMMUNICATION LEVELS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The article deals with the problem of mutual perception of individuals, which implies the analysis of the anthropological prerequisites for the study of interpersonal communication. The work emphasizes the need to identify the gnoseological lacuna of the possibility and relevance of knowing someone else's "I". As well as the need to point out implicit metaphysical attitudes, universal for many worldviews, which are implicitly included in the theory of personal communication. Theoretical basis. The author proceeds from the logical consequences of the evolutionary premise in anthropology. He compares the psychophysical goals of the interpersonal communication task with its ideological theory, monitors the impossibility of the realizing the communication level declared in the consciousness. As an opposite evolutionary premise, the author cites the postulates of the "philosophy of dialogue" by F. Rosenzweig, F. Ebner, M. Buber, and others. The correlation of these philosophical positions reveals the inconsistency of materialistic reduction in anthropology. Originality. The author identifies four levels of communication: background, obstacle, function and dialogue. He represents the rationale for the fact that the first three levels do not need the existence of an individual "I". The first three levels leave the existential "I" unnecessary and therefore unclaimed. The philosophy of dialogue with the Other raises an equally important question about the conditions for the possibility of a metaphysical continuum in ontology, and in turn, suggests the acceptance of a philosophical premise about God as the space of subjectivity in the "I-You" dialogue. Conclusions. Philosophical understanding of the communication of two existential "I" demanded in communication is possible only within the framework of religious discourse. The phenomenal consciousness can enter into communication with a specific other phenomenal consciousness only when there is a metaphysical space between them, allowing for the possibility of communication of such a level. The materialistic conditioning by the human evolutionary needs in all its conceivable forms produces a reduction of the communicative inquiry, which makes the mutual perception of the two "I" impossible. In this psychophysiological anthropological model, there is no space for the possibility of a dialogue of individuals.

AB  - Agroforestry is a land-use system representing a variety of vegetation structures. Canopy cover is one of the most important variables in ecology, hydrology, forest management, and also canopy cover is useful for a basis for the definition of forest. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a tool that can measure canopy cover, because it has the ability to penetrate the structured canopy. The disadvantage of LiDAR that it has limited spatial coverage and expensive to obtain data. Integration LiDAR to Landsat 8 data has the potential to overcome this limitation because Landsat 8 can provide greater spatial coverage to generate canopy cover of agroforestry estimation in Cidanau watershed, Banten Indonesia. The analysis showed that red band Landsat 8 using an exponential equation was the best to estimate canopy cover in agroforestry land use. The limitations of Landsat 8 OLI for the mapping of the canopy cover, on the high value of shrubs or grassland and high canopy cover, do not always represent actual canopy cover.

AB  - Power plant component condition monitoring with respect of fatigue and creep-fatigue requires information about the real operational loading of the component. Load monitoring systems are available on the market' for that purpose. The retrieved load information can be further processed in terms of fatigue assessment based on realistic loading. Moreover, the combination of load monitoring, derivation of stress-time-histories for sentinel locations, cycle counting and fracture mechanics based assessment paves the way of substantiated determination and optimization of non-destructive testing (NDT) inspection intervals.This approach enables a continuous structural health monitoring of critical components even in the sense of online-monitoring capabilities. This approach provides-in addition to the established fatigue analysis-concrete decisions for the remaining component lifetime and the maximum inspection intervals. This method can also be used if the previous lifetime consumption is unknown. It basically constitutes an advanced damage tolerance approach.The paper describes a newly developed solution which combines the established Fast Fatigue Evaluation (FFE) approach of Framatome with the THERRI capabilities of TUV NORD.

TI  - Rapid Detection of Windthrows Using Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Storm events are capable of causing windthrow to large forest areas. A rapid detection of the spatial distribution of the windthrown areas is crucial for forest managers to help them direct their limited resources. Since synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is acquired largely independent of daylight or weather conditions, SAR sensors can produce temporally consistent and reliable data with a high revisit rate. In the present study, a straightforward approach was developed that uses Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band VV and VH polarisation data for a rapid windthrow detection in mixed temperate forests for two study areas in Switzerland and northern Germany. First, several S-1 acquisitions of approximately 10 before and 30 days after the storm event were radiometrically terrain corrected. Second, based on these S-1 acquisitions, a SAR composite image of before and after the storm was generated. Subsequently, after analysing the differences in backscatter between before and after the storm within windthrown and intact forest areas, a change detection method was developed to suggest potential locations of windthrown areas of a minimum extent of 0.5 ha-as is required by the forest management. The detection is based on two user-defined parameters. While the results from the independent study area in Germany indicated that the method is very promising for detecting areal windthrow with a producer's accuracy of 0.88, its performance was less satisfactory at detecting scattered windthrown trees. Moreover, the rate of false positives was low, with a user's accuracy of 0.85 for (combined) areal and scattered windthrown areas. These results underscore that C-band backscatter data have great potential to rapidly detect the locations of windthrow in mixed temperate forests within a short time (approx. two weeks) after a storm event. Furthermore, the two adjustable parameters allow a flexible application of the method tailored to the user's needs.

AB  - In view of the large amount of original data output by BeiDou satellite navigation receiver, a real-time acquisition and analysis system of satellite data based on double core microprocessor is designed with satellite navigation receiver UB482 and OMAP-L138 Processor in this paper. Data acquisition and data analysis are realized with the ARM core and the DSP core in OMAP-L138 Processor respectively. Starting program and application program of the double core are written. The experimental results show that the system can output analysis results including position and speed of the carrier, information of the visible satellite and so on at 1Hz frequency. On this basis, the BDS/SINS tightly-coupled integrated navigation system can be further realized.

TI  - Detection of invertebrates from Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris in North American waters.
T2  - PICES Special Publication
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Japan Tsunami of 2011 resulted in an unprecedented dispersal event of marine biota from Asian coastal waters to the Pacific shores of North America. While significant effort has focused on characterizing the spatial and temporal patterns of biota arriving to North America, the fate of these organisms and the extent of new invasions are poorly resolved. We report here new surveys to evaluate the presence of non-native marine species in Pacific North America, from California to Alaska, including free-living marine invertebrates and parasites reported on Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris (JTMD). These data provide important baseline measures (benchmarks) for the species pool present in North America before and during the JTMD dispersal event. We explore the inferences that can be drawn from this baseline and its application to evaluate invasions associated with JTMD, while also considering the potential for both lag-times in detection and other mechanisms (vectors) of introduction of biota from the northwestern Pacific. We used mussels (Mytilus spp.) as a model system to explore the opportunity (risk) of parasite transfers. Mussels, one of the most frequent organisms on JTMD arriving to North America, are known to have a large number of parasitic and commensal species worldwide and in Japan, and some can cause severe disease and mortality. We tested over 1,000 mussels arriving on JTMD and detected at least three distinct parasite taxa. These results demonstrate that parasites (including commensals) arrived with invertebrate hosts on JTMD, increasing the total number of JTMD-associated taxa. In the case of mussels, detected parasites increased total diversity 4-fold, underscoring the potential for high levels of hidden parasite diversity among the nearly 380 invertebrate taxa detected on JTMD to date, since almost none of these have been tested for parasite species richness. Our extensive surveys of mussels and fouling communities along the Pacific coast of North America, combined with comprehensive analysis of existing literature, detected no new invasions attributed clearly to JTMD-mediated transport. However, these analyses also reveal large numbers of species that have colonized North America from Japan by other vectors, prior to JTMD arrival. These results indicate that many invertebrate species in Japan, including some arriving on JTMD, are able to colonize North America, suggesting a high level of environmental match. While our field-based surveys and synthesis of existing historical records have not detected JTMD-mediated invasions to date, it is still premature to draw any conclusions. The arrival of hundreds of distinct taxa and a high environmental match between Japan and Pacific North America provide significant opportunity for invasions. Despite extensive analysis to date, the likelihood of detecting invasions during our study is low because there are often significant lag times in detecting new invasions due to restricted geographic range, small population size, and limited sampling effort. Thus, full evaluation of resulting invasions requires repeated measures over time for selected sentinel sites, and would ideally (a) deploy molecular genetic techniques with high sensitivity and efficacy and (b) use the extensive baseline measures of historical occurrences established in our project.

TI  - Citizenship, Community, and the Rule of Law: With or Without Consensus?
T2  - NEW PERSPECTIVES ON DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE: DEEP DISAGREEMENTS, PLURALISM, AND THE PROBLEM OF CONSENSUS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The primary questions addressed in this paper examine equal citizenship: its strength and depth, as well as its relation to the other commitments (of philosophical or religious nature, for example) that play a role in people's lives. The underlying focus is the problem of finding sources of civility, legality and social stability such that one's autonomy would be fully respected when forming a conception of the good and a general worldview. To develop an answer to these questions, I examine Rawls's doctrine of an overlapping consensus. However, I proceed from a somewhat different perspective. I consider the ideal of the rule of law as at least partially realised in contemporary democracies and ask what kind of civic community it requires. This paper is composed of three sections. The first two focus specifically on Rawls - in the first section I provide the essential points of Rawls's account of social stability; in the second section I discuss the idea of an overlapping consensus in theory, and from the perspective of its realisation in political practice. In the final section I explain the reasons why I consider Rawls's project unsuccessful, and provide my own reinterpretation of the idea of an overlapping consensus arguing that Rawls's theory should be modified. My main proposal is to replace the idea of an overlapping consensus with the idea of a thinner, less specific, but still prospectively stable, solution: the rule of law consensus.

AB  - Dust is associated with numerous hazards to the ecosystem; the dust aerosol affects the community health by polluting the breathable air and its effects on the balance of radiant energy are quite important for scientific research. Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation: some aerosols contribute to the heating of the earth and others to the cooling. With those problems, this research presents the behavior of three selected aerosols: dust, black carbon (BC) and sulfate (SO4). The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) extinction behaviors were analyzed in comparison with the cloud amount and the surface skin temperature. In addition, we have quantitatively analyzed the dust's particulate matter (PM2.5), in the chosen region of interest (RoI). In all cases of this research, in the nearly recent 28 years (from Jan. 1991 to Jul. 2019), the aerosols data source is the second version of the modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications (MERRA-2). A selection of the focal study region in south-west Asia was due to its location in the world's dust-belt. Goddard interactive online visualization and analysis infrastructure, GIOVANNI, bridged our research objectives to the data; the Geographical Information System (GIS ArcMap) is one of the software tools that has been utilized to treat the map-based results. In results, among the three selected aerosols, the increase of the dust aerosol always associates with the decrease of the cloud amount in all the seasons of the focal region of interest. Regarding the effects of aerosols on earth's energy balance, the upwelling longwave flux at the top of atmosphere under clear sky and no aerosol conditions was analyzed with the same longwave flux under normal conditions. On side of health effects in the focal region of interest, all seasons suffer from the heaviest dust's fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Though there might exist some examples of afforested deserts in Asia, which can be accounted for a good solution to the desert's dust aerosols, we would recommend further studies about strategies to mitigate the dust hazards on both health and energy budgets.

AB  - This article is based on NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) which is automatically computed from the daily MODIS data. The main purpose of the article is to tell how the evaluation of NDWI-based growing season estimationscan be automated. The NDWI is used as an indicator of liquid water quantity in vegetation, which is less sensitive to atmospheric scattering effect then the famous growing index (NDVI). The NDWI is computed using cloud-based platform (Google Earth Engine was applied) and compared with the daily meteorological data. The available meteorological data is collected for the past 130 years and NDWI data is collecting for the past 20 years. An automated technique has been probated on the example of republic of Komi, as it has a different climate forming factors. This approach can be used to evaluate growing season estimations for other territories that contain vegetation. Due to the accumulated amount of data, the study is relevant and has a special significance for areas with sparse hydrometeorological network.

AB  - Forest/land fire often occurs in Indonesia particularly in Sumatera, Kalimantan, and Papua. This phenomenon has direct impact not only in Indonesia but also transboundary countries. To minimize this impact, remote sensing technology can be used to monitor forest/land fire using hotspot from Terra/Aqua MODIS data which good have 2 equatorial revisit times per day i.e. 10.30 a.m. for Terra and 1.30 p.m. for Aqua in near real time. The objectives of this study was to analyze the frequency and spatial distribution of hotspot in Central Kalimantan Province using Terra/Aqua MODIS. Hotspot is derived from Terra/Aqua MODIS data using algorithm which available daily in LAPAN system. Hotspot classified into three categories of confidence level i.e. low (0-30%), medium (30-80%), high (80-100%). RGB 1-2-18 were used as base map layer to analyze the spatial distribution of three hotspot categories. The result shows that there was hotspots concentrated in Kotawaringin Timur and Pulang Pisau Regency which it was burn peat hydrological unit area. Thus, peat land area that covers with shrubs, etc is hard to extinguish which relate to the frequency of hotspot. High frequency hotspot occurs in September 27th 2018 then decreasing until October 6th 2018 (10 days).

T2  - ANNALI DELL ISTITUTO SUPERIORE DI SANITA
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the leading sexually transmitted infection (STI) across Europe. In Italy, Ct prevalence is low in general population, but predominance of asymptomatic infections, passive voluntary reporting, variable diagnostic criteria and coding practices can lead to considerable underestimation, preventing assessment of real burden of disease and health intervention. We analysed data on female genital Ct infection registered in STI sentinel surveillance systems in Italy from 2005 through 2016 and found 3305 women. Among them, those aged 20-24 years had the highest disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) estimation equal to 106.77 DALYs per 100 000-stratum specific population. Through the study period, incidence rate (IR) for female Ct infection increased significantly from 2.9 to 7.1 per 100 000 resident population. Besides, we analysed data on pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) reported from the National Hospital Information system (NHIS) in the same period. We found 287 women hospitalised with concurrent PID and Ct infection. We recommend targeted screening programmes in women aged 20-24, definition of nationwide active surveillance system, standardisation of diagnostic criteria and ICD-9CM coding practices.

TI  - Recurrence after sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma: a single-center experience in Slovak patients
T2  - NEOPLASMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard approach in the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma is considered to be a complete excision of the primary lesion with an appropriate margin of the normal tissue according to Breslow thickness. Usually sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can help to determine the nodal status, and thus improve the accuracy of staging of the disease. However, the role of SLNB in melanoma treatment remains controversial. NCCN guidelines strongly support routine performance of therapeutic lymphadenectomy in all melanoma patients with clinically positive nodes without radiographic evidence of distant metastases. Patients with positive SLNB should have had completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for regional disease control. Between 2012 and 2016, 168 consecutive patients underwent surgery for primary cutaneous malignant melanoma at St. Elisabeth Cancer Institute in Bratislava. The indication for SLNB and the procedure was made according to international guidelines. In this retrospective study, a cohort of 78 patients was analyzed (35 women and 43 men). Inclusion criteria comprised patients with cutaneous melanoma with no evidence of distant metastases or clinical lymphadenopathy. SLNB comprised a dual labelling method (Tc-99m Nanocolloid/blue dye) in a one-day protocol. Median follow- up was 657 days. The primary composite outcome was the time to the first disease-related event (death, reintervention, worsening of symptoms). Primary outcome measures were overall (disease-specific) and disease-free survival. The overall identification rate of SLN in melanoma patients by dual labelling method was 98.5%. All patients with positive SLNB on frozen section underwent complete regional lymphadenectomy. Using multivariable analysis Breslow thickness of the lesion (p=0.00004, HR 4.03 on logarithmic scale) was identified as the strongest independent predictor of the disease-free survival (DFS) and male gender was significant predictor of DFS. An increase in tumor thickness was associated with significantly higher risk of an event. Neither SLN positivity nor initial S-100 level proved to be significant predictors of the event at the 0.05 level of probability. Multidisciplinary approach represents the gold standard of care for melanoma patients and surgery remains the best option for most localized cases. Although the usefulness of SLNB procedure has been questioned, it provides an excellent staging method, moreover, it can identify high-risk patients. The routine use of completion lymphadenectomy after a positive SLNB is still controversial. It is not clear whether CLND following a positive SLN biopsy improves survival but it could provide regional disease control.

AB  - The perpendicular distance and temporal difference of baselines are critical factors for determining the displacement accuracy of multi-temporal Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technique. This study aims to evaluate the capability of D-InSAR technique using large perpendicular and temporal baselines for measuring the ground displacement caused by tectonic movement and anthropogenic activity in the Bandung basin, West Java, Indonesia. Small baseline subset (SBAS) D-InSAR technique is adopted to clarify the spatio-temporal displacement pattern of the basin, and its accuracy is verified statistically using Pearson's correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error by comparing the estimated displacements with the displacement data by GPS. The results highlight two displacement patterns in the basin: anthropogenic-caused subsidence in the middle urban area and tectonic-caused uplift in the northern and southern parts around the faults.

AB  - Emerging concepts and paradigms such as Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems are influencing the development of e-health systems. State of the art e-health systems are designed to seamlessly integrate geographically dispersed specific devices, sensors. Advances in Telemedicine systems are also facilitating the development of such systems. The authors discuss the development of a Redundant GSM and Satellite Data Transmission Device with application in tlelemedicine. The device is able to transmit data through a GSM modem and switch to a secondary GSM modem when the connection parameters are no longer adequate. Moreover, when GSM networks fail or are not available the device is still able to transmit data by switching to a Satellite Connection. Such a device allow for the redundant connection of heterogenous devices. The prototype of the communication device with applications in telemedicine is analyzed in the case study section.

TI  - Low-Cost Solution for Assessment of Urban Flash Flood Impacts Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process: A Case Study of Ras Ghareb City, Egypt
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural hazards are indeed counted as the most critical challenges facing our world, represented in floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, and forest fires. Among these natural hazards, the flash flood is regarded the most frequent. In this work, we utilized two Sentinel-2 satellite images, before and after the flash flood, SRTM and photos captured by using a helicopter. This paper aims at three prime objectives. Firstly, the flood influence is determined on the city of Ras Ghareb, Egypt, based on analyzing free satellite data (Sentinel-2 images). Secondly, fuzzy the analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method and a geographical information system (GIS) are integrated for flood risk analysis and evaluation in the flood-prone area. Finally, such a flood vulnerability map is used as an index to assist the decision-makers prepare for probable flooding. FAHP is preferable as it can cater to the uncertainties in data and analysis. As a result, FAHP is appropriate to determine the flood-vulnerable area in cities especially due to the matching with the most destroyed areas identified by the change detection between the two Sentinel-2 images. Then, the decision-maker can depend on Sentinel-2 images to estimate the flood influence through a regional scale or applying the FAHP on cities susceptible to flash floods in case of unavailable satellite images to contribute in establishing an early warning system enough to the evacuation of the risky areas.

AB  - With the growing population, there is a growing demand for quality drinking water. Especially in developing parts of the world, this is a serious problem. The aim of this work is to test remote sensing methods for water quality monitoring. The presented part of the project is focused on introducing the process of water pollution assessment using vegetation indices, which are derived only using RGB images. Water quality monitoring is based on satellite imagery Landsat 8 and UAV images Phantom 3. As reference data was used in-site measurements in profiles points. In-site measurements were repeated every month in the vegetation period from April to September. Based on regression analysis, the equation for the calculation of the amount of chlorophyll and the statistical evaluation of the quality of these equations is derived for each vegetation index. The best results were achieved using the ratio aquatic vegetation index (RAVI) and ExG (Excess green) indices of 97% and 96.8% respectively.

AB  - The following article presents the temporal variations in area and volume of the Grey, Tyndall, and Dickson glaciers, located at the southeastern end of the Southern Ice Field (CHS), Torres del Paine National Park (PNTP), Chilean Patagonia, between 1998 and 2017. The variations were estimated by the combination of multispectral satellite images from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 and digital terrain models (SRTM, ASTER GDEM V2, and WorldDEM). Significant retreat experienced by the three glaciers in the last two decades, confirming the negative tendencies of most of the Patagonian glaciers, was identified. The acceleration of the retreat of the glaciers is linked to an increase of the minimum mean temperature and a decrease in annual precipitation. Considering the current climate scenario, we conclude that glacier retreat will continuously increase.

TI  - A class-based approach to classify PolSAR imagery using optimum classifier
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) imagery is still one of the challenges in active remote sensing applications. Although a large number of features and different classifiers have been proposed, no unique approach has been found to satisfy all of the images and classes yet. In this paper, given the extracted features from PolSAR data, a new class-based feature selection (CBFS) algorithm is proposed to find the most optimum features for each class. Maximizing the discrimination of each class from the others is the main contribution of the CBFS which yields distinctive features. The selected features are then employed by classifiers to generate different classification results. Finally, a new approach is developed to combine these classification results to produce the final land cover map. Five different classifiers of Wishart Maximum Likelihood, Gaussian Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, Multi Layer Perceptron and Fuzzy Inference System are also used for classification. Given the CBFS results, two different Radarsat-2 and AirSAR PolSAR data were classified. Selected features led to improvement of about 5% in producer accuracies in comparison with two well-known Genetic Algorithm Feature Selection (GAFS) and Prototype Space Feature Selection (PSFS) methods. Moreover, Comparison results demonstrate that the fuzzy classifiers could improve the accuracies about 3% if they are suitably constructed and well designed. The achieved higher overall accuracy for the final classified map shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the other compared classification procedures.

M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel consumption of marine vessels plays an important role in both generating air pollution and ship operational expenses where the global environmental concerns toward air pollution and economics of shipping operation are being increased. In order to optimize ship fuel consumption, the fuel consumption prediction for her envisaged voyage is to be known. To predict fuel consumption of a ship, noon report (NR) data are available source to be analysed by different techniques. Because of the possible human error attributed to the method of NR data collection, it involves risk of possible inaccuracy. Therefore, in this study, to acquire pure valid data, the NR raw data of two very large crude carriers (VLCCs) composed with their respective Automatic Identification System (AIS) satellite data. Then, well-known models i.e. it-Mean, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Outlier Score Base (OSB) and Histogram of Outlier Score Base (HSOB) methods are applied to the collected tankers NR during a year. The new enriched data derived are compared to the raw NR to distinguish the most fitted methodology of accruing pure valid data. Expected value and root mean square methods are applied to evaluate the accuracy of the methodologies. It is concluded that measured expected value and root mean square for HOSB are indicating high coherence with the harmony of the primary NR data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of a study of the long-term dynamics of the state of ecosystems of the Teniz-Korgalzhyn depression, carried out using data from the Earth remote sensing (ERS). Based on the analysis of space images, the formation factors of modern environmental conditions are established. In the study area, such factors are positional and barrier factors, as well as the confinement of individual surface sections to different-height layers of the Earth's surface. An analysis of the Landsat series of space images taken at different time, made it possible to establish spatial differences in the intensity of phytomass accumulation in areas located in different landscape locations. The spatio-temporal variability of the ecological conditions of the Teniz-Korgalzhin depression wetlands is accompanied by a change in the amount of food supply and the number of living organisms. Monitoring of these changes on the basis of Earth remote sensing data will allow to prove measures to preserve the biodiversity of the TenizKorgalzhin depression wetlands timely.

AB  - Change Detection (CD) is an important application of remote sensing. Recent technological evolution resulted in the availability of optical multispectral sensors that provide High spatial Resolution (HR) images with many spectral bands. Such characteristics allow for new applications of CD, however present new challenges on the proper exploitation of the information. HR multitemporal data processing is challenging due to spatial correlation of pixels and spatial context information needs to be exploited to benefit from multitemporal HR images. Moreover most of the state-of-the-art CD methods exploit single or couple of spectral channels from the optical sensors to derive CD map. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a novel unsupervised deep -learning based method that can effectively model contextual information and handle all the bands in multispectral images. In particular, we focus on the Sentinel-2 images provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) that provides both higher spatial and temporal resolution optical images with 13 spectral bands with respect to previous generation sensors. Experimental results on the urban Onera satellite CD (OSCD) dataset and on agricultural multitemporal images from Barrax, Spain confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land transformation as a result of unprecedented urbanization has introduced changes in local climate and surface energy budget. Land surface temperature (LST) is an important factor influencing local climate and ecology. Mumbai being second largest populated city is experiencing significant changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and surface energy fluxes. Hence, the main objective of the study is to assess the spatial variation in land surface temperature due to land use/land cover change. Several indices like; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized difference built up index (NDBI) were derived to validate the spatial variability of LST in different land use/land cover classes. The study utilized Landsat5/TM and Landsat8/TIRS data for assessing land transformation and its relation with LST in Mumbai city. January, June and October months of three time series 1990, 2000 and 2015 were chosen as representative of three seasons to analyze variation in LST. Pixel to pixel overlay analysis for different indices and LST was carried out to examine the relation of LST with different indices. The study revealed the maximum change in LST was recorded during the month of June over the study period. Land transformation from vegetation and agricultural land to urban built up has been found to be the main cause of increased LST in the study area. The finding of the study may help in promulgating sustainable urban land use policies and avoiding the effect of urban heat island.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims at discussing two important points of rice etbnophilosophy in Sasak, society First, it explains how various symbols of language and culture and local mythos of rice in agricultural Sasak society experienced reinterpretation over kg concepts of Islamic Worldview. Second, it illuminates how those modified symbols and mythos in Sasak society contains similarities with the ones in Malay culture as recorded in Hikayat Ascy Pade manuscript and Kitab Berladang. The study uses ethnohermeneutic method in reading the text in the context of Sasak, culture. The result shows some points of transformation in the symbols and mythos about rice in Sasak culture after being adapted to Islamic Worldview. The reinterpretation clarifies a spirited ethnophilosophy about harmony and equilibration of human life with nature and God. Adaptation conducted by the Islamic carrier among the agricultural Sasak society at the beginning of Islamic influence exemplifies how the spreading of Islam was undertaken peacefully through the confirmation of symbols and local mythos to maintain stability and harmony.

AB  - Las Vegas have undergone significant development in the past two decades in the form of pavements and buildings. Surface energy of the city has changed due to urbanization that plays crucial role in urban heat island effect and in altering the energy for evaporation and transpiration. It indirectly contributes to the urban hydrological cycle. Role of urbanization on the surface energy balance is an active area of research. The objective of this study is to relate surface energy fluxes (net radiation and soil heat flux) to urban land cover. The changes of buildup and vegetation land cover between pre-urbanized and urbanized conditions are analyzed for their impact on surface energy budget in the Las Vegas city. Changes from rural surface to four land use classes including residential, commercial, vegetative turf, and parking areas are considered. The surface energy balance algorithm (SEBAL) is used with Landsat data to estimate surface fluxes including net radiation and soil heat flux density. The land surface characteristics including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and albedo are analyzed. The time frame of the study is 2002 to 2017 which coincides with implementation of water smart landscape (WSL) program in Las Vegas. WSL is a rebate program that has promoted xeriscaping thus reducing the vegetation turf and urban water demand. The results reveal increase in net radiation and reduction in soil heat flux due to land cover change from rural to urban. These are related to the surface albedo and potentially the cause of decrease in temperature.

AB  - Application of regression models through remote sensing for estimating biophysical parameters of crops is one of the key elements for precision agriculture studies. Numerically, this problem is solved separately for each biophysical parameter such as leaf area index, soil moisture, crop height and etc. However, this approach ignores tight relationship among the biophysical parameters, which is essential for driving estimation performance with a limited number of in-situ measurements. As an alternative strategy, a multi-output regression, which also learns the relationship among biophysical parameters in the regression model, is considered. In order to see how multi-output regression models capture the plausible physical relationship between crops biophysical parameters and polarimetric features, RadarSAT-2 images acquired over agriculture fields in the context of the AgriSAR 2009 campaign were used. Specifically, multi output Gaussian Processes and multi-output Support Vector Machines, which arc two powerful kernel-based methods, are implemented and assessed in the context of accuracy assessment of the biophysical parameter estimation.

The Athenian, Platonic, androcentric, hierarchical worldview saw women as physically inferior to men. Behind courageous, wise Athena, lies Plato's dualistic philosophy of reason, and the ideology of control. We must make a distinction between a dualistic philosophy and a holistic approach to reality. Ancient goddess Hestia's inextinguishable flame as energy of all life extended to the entire world can be read as symbolizing the interrelatedness of all life.

AB  - We have been working on the development of geometrical correction method combining the Fourier phase only correlation method (POC) and an ortho-rectification method based on affine transform for system-corrected Landsat TM images. In this paper, in order to suppress image destruction by interpolation and improve registration accuracy, the bilinear interpolation method used for image interpolation was changed to the bicubic convolution interpolation method, and this method was applied to a system corrected Landsat TM image. As a result, it was found that the registration accuracy was improved to 9.0m in x-direction and 37.3m in y-direction, respectively (in UTM coordinates). And it was found that the system-corrected Landsat TM image contains small skew distortion. After correcting the skew distortion, as a result of re-applying our improved geometric correction method, the registration accuracy became 3.4m in x-direction and 2.5m in y-direction, which is dramatically improved.

AB  - Accurate identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SNL) and complete tumor removal in cancer patients is of critical importance and leads to improved patient recovery and survival. Gamma probes along with near infrared (NIR) probes are the gold standard in SNL identification but have failed to reduce false negative rates (FNR) to the desirable 5% value. By developing a high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET) detector atop the patient in coincidence with a partially populated detector ring placed underneath the patient bed with <250 ps coincidence timing resolution, we are aiming to reduce the FNR compared to what is achievable today.In this regard, we modeled variations of the intraoperative system as well as a reference whole-body PET using the MonteCarlo code GATE. Detector blocks are 13x13 arrays of 3.6x3.6x20 mm3 LYSO:Ce pixels with 3.8 mm pitch. Models varied by the number of detector blocks underneath the patient bed and location of both top and bottom detectors with respect to the patient body. Unlike conventional PET with image slices along the body axis (transverse view), here the slices are defined horizontally and parallel with body axis (coronal view).A torso phantom with background activity concentration of 1/10th of that of hot spheres with 2,4,6,8, and 10 mm diameter and 10 mm spacing was also modeled. Reconstructed images show that 6, 8, and 10 mm lesions can be identified with 40 sec image acquisition. As expected, lesion detectability is reduced when coincidence time resolution (CTR) was changed from 150 ps to 250 ps which can be compensated by increasing acquisition time.

TI  - Intraoperative biophotonic imaging systems for image-guided interventions
T2  - NANOPHOTONICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Biophotonic imaging has revolutionized the operation room by providing surgeons intraoperative image-guidance to diagnose tumors more efficiently and to resect tumors with real-time image navigation. Among many medical imaging modalities, near-infrared (NIR) light is ideal for image-guided surgery because it penetrates relatively deeply into living tissue, while nuclear imaging provides quantitative and unlimited depth information. It is therefore ideal to develop an integrated imaging system by combining NIR fluorescence and gamma-positron imaging to provide surgeons with highly sensitive and quantitative detection of diseases, such as cancer, in real-time without changing the look of the surgical field. The focus of this review is to provide recent progress in intraoperative biophotonic imaging systems, NIR fluorescence imaging and intraoperative nuclear imaging devices, and their future perspectives for image-guided interventions.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates the causes, magnitude and damage caused by the flood as a result of the breaching of the east marginal embankment of the Taunsa Barrage. The flood frequency in the district of Muzaffar Garh located in south Punjab, Pakistan had serious impacts on human lives and their properties. To pursue this study, we used primary data, collected through questionnaire, formal interviews, field observations and secondary data, obtained through government departments and online open source databases. Furthermore, Landsat ETM+ imageries were used as input in the supervised classification in order to investigate the pre and post flooding land cover and land use. Hydrograph was used to analyze the flood limits and spatiotemporal change in river discharge for barrages. The results show an abnormal rainfall occurring in the month of July in the upper Indus Basin, which resulted in a massive discharge in the central Indus Basin. As a consequence, it exceeded the flood limits at the Taunsa Barrage, which resulted in the breaching of east marginal embankment. The flood caused a high number of human casualties and a total economic loss of 14.23 million US$ including a 6.8 million US$ agricultural loss. The study thus, gives insight on how authorities can devise a flood management plan in such a way to reduce the future impacts of riverine flood disasters in Muzaffar garh.

AB  - For Japanese intellectuals, the encounter with European geography in the mid-sixteenth century meant more than a simple, physical dilation of the world. More profoundly, it meant overthrowing the traditional Buddhist worldview. In the process of confronting a greatly expanded set of continents, educated Japanese had to fundamentally transform their understanding of Asia. Since the ninth century, the prototype of the world for most Japanese had consisted of Three Sacred Countries -Tenjiku (sic) (India), Shintan (sic) (China), and Honcho (sic) (Japan)-surrounded by numerous minor lands. In a traditional world map, the bulk of the world consisted of India and China, which were always depicted in the center. By contrast, Japan was located to the northeast as one of many peripheral countries. One mission of ancient and medieval monks had been to overcome this miserable situation and articulate Japan's sacredness if not superiority in the world. In the context of this longstanding challenge, the arrival of European atlases and world maps presented an opportunity as well as a threat. Armed with new knowledge of the globe, some Japanese cartographers leapt at the chance to relativize the position of China and India. Others altered their maps more slowly, and with more reluctance. By illuminating the geographical imagination embodied in early modern world maps, this paper explores the impact of this process on Japan's traditional Asia-centric worldview.

AB  - A group H is said to be capable, if there exists another group G such that G/Z(G) congruent to H, where Z(G) denotes the center of G. In a recent paper [5], the authors considered the problem of capability of five non-abelian p-groups of order p(4) into account. In this paper, we try to solve the problem of capability by considering three other groups of order p(4). It is proved that the groupH-6 = < x,y, z vertical bar x(p2) = y(p) = z(p) = 1, yx = x(p+1)y, zx = xyz, yz = zy >is not capable. Moreover, if p > 3 is a prime number and d not equivalent to 0,1 (mod p) then the following groups are not capable:H-71 = < x, y, z vertical bar x(9) = y(3) = 1, z(3) = x(3), yx = x(4)y, zx = xyz, zy = yx >,H-7(2) = < x, y, z vertical bar x(p2) = y(p) = z(p) = 1, yx = x(p+1)y, zx = x(p+1)yz, zy = x(p)yz >,H-81 = < x, y, z vertical bar x(9) = y(3) = 1, z(3) = x(-3), yx = x(4)y, zx = xyz, zy = yz >,H-8(2) = < x, y, z vertical bar x(p2) = y(p) = z(p) = 1, yx = x(p+1)y, zx = x(dp+1)yz, zy = x(dp)yz >.

AB  - Remote sensing is a method usually used for conducting geothermal reconnaissance surveys by mapping surface alteration anomalies, which are captured by a satellite sensor. This study analyzes the characteristics of the surface alteration zones in the Wayang Windu geothermal field (WWGF). It employs a remote sensing method using multispectral Landsat 8 imagery and is validated by ground truth data from field surveys. The WWGF is located in Pangalengan, West Java with an elevation of 1500-2600 m.a.s.l., and lies in a quaternary volcanic arc. The rock types in Wayang Windu consist of andesite, basalt, tuff, breccia, and pumice. Fractures and faults are identified as lineaments in this area and based on their structures, were directed to be oriented northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest. This research combined a field survey and remote sensing methods to enhance the spatial data. Field surveys yield 18 spots for obtaining soil samples and laboratory analyses were performed. Spectral reflectance analysis was performed to determine the reflectance and mineral composition of the samples, X-ray diffraction was performed to determine the mineral composition, and X-ray fluorescence was performed to determine the abundance of elements. A scene from Landsat 8 image acquired on September 10, 2013 was evaluated using a principal component analysis-based method. The surface alteration zones in the WWGF correlated with joints and faults. Based on the mineral composition, the surface alteration zones in WWGF were identified as advanced argillic zone with the occurrence of secondary minerals such as cristobalite and halloysite, and a propylitic zone with the occurrence of secondary minerals such as epidote and chlorite.

AB  - Semi-transparent clouds, the so-called cirrus, frequently contaminate satellite images. Recently, Gao and Li (2017) have developed an empirical method for thin cirrus correction with focus on data provided by Landsat-8. This correction allows one to estimate clear-sky apparent reflectance. Validated qualitatively, we propose here a quantitative validation method using Sentinel-2 data by comparing the corrected image with a clear sky reference image. Their method shows good results on dark surfaces, like water, with an apparent reflectance found close to 0.02. On the other hand, it becomes less accurate for thicker cirrus and on more reflective surfaces. In addition, the data analysis shows that pixels located in the shadow of the cirrus are over-corrected. The downward path should therefore be taken into account when correcting the signal.

AB  - The increased interest in various aspects of regional history, the role of the intellectual elite for the purpose of development of the Chechen society and experience of training of the research and engineering staff in the Chechen Republic in the 1960-1980s. The present article is the first research on that period. It describes adaptation of the traditional worldview of the Chechen and Ingush people to the post-industrial era. The relevance of the study is due to the need for reviving the reputation of engineering professions in the Chechen Republic. The historiographical analysis identified main research areas for training of the research and engineering staff in Checheno-Ingushetia in the 1960s - 1980s and issues which were ignored by researchers. By the mid-1980s, formation of the research and engineering staff based on representatives of the titular nations had failed. The research and engineering policy aiming to strengthen interaction of science and production, social, natural and engineering sciences; to expand R&D automation; to increase effectiveness of the research potential of universities; to improve the system of scientific and technical information and patent and licensing work; to improve the organizational structure of research institutions; to develop mass creativity of inventors and rationalizers; to enhance the role and responsibility of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Disregard of staff selection and rotation was a major miscalculation made by party organizations. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB  - This paper presents the design of a simple, low cost single-sided magnetic particle imaging (MPI) scanner with Perimag magnetic nanoparticles employed as tracer material. The electromagnetic coils of the developed scanner were designed in the form of the solenoid to combat the cost and sensitivity limitation of the Helmholtz coil arrangement which reduces the image resolution. Liquid and immobilised Perimag nanoparticles samples were exposed to the superimposed magnetic field generated by the excitation and selection field coils at the field-free point. The nanoparticles (MNPs) responded with a non-linear magnetization, which is recorded in the form of a voltage signal by a gradiometer pickup coil. The second-harmonic component of the recorded signal is extracted by a resonant circuit and logged into the computer. Contour images of the MNPs distribution were obtained via solving the ill-posed image reconstruction equation using the Kaczmarz method, with the system matrix determined using model-based approach. The contour maps for one sample imaging revealed the position, shape, and size of the Perimag MNPs samples in the XY-plane at distance of 10 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm and 30 mm under the pickup coil. However, the results of two samples imaging indicated constructive interference effects, as the two samples cannot be distinguished at 20 mm below the pickup coil. The developed scanner has a spatial resolution of less than 1 mm and 42.1 ms image acquisition time. Thus, the outcome of this research showed that the developed single-side MPI scanner has a potential in the detection of MNPs, which could help in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer diagnosis.

AB  - The use of the remote sensing data to scheduling irrigation and fertilization and to predict yield may contribute to a more sustainable agriculture in Mediterranean regions, where irrigation and fertilization are not optimized in terms of timing and quantity. Data of remote sensing techniques using spectral and thermal approaches have been proposed as potential indicators to allowing rapid identification of crop nitrogen status, water stress and plants diseases across large areas. Given their versatility, remote sensing techniques have become valuable tools for precision agriculture, allowing to farmers to practice a more sustainable agriculture, minimizing risks of losing the harvest by providing the resources (water irrigation and fertilizer) needed to secure yield. Here, we review some remote sensing strategies and techniques used for a smart crop management and we discuss the useful of internet and computing programs to analyze the data of these techniques for precision agriculture. Nowadays, the use of software programs is an essential tool for the process and interpretation of data derived from remote sensing technologies, permitting a rapid and accurate farmer's decisions to improved crop production and farmers' incomes.

AB  - The applicability of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the identification of vegetation types using satellite multispectral imagery was studied. The study was focused on the three main vegetation types found in the south of the Krasnoyarsk Region: mixed forest, boreal forest and grassland. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used as a data source for the neural networks. It was shown that vegetation type can be identified pixel-by-pixel using 12 spectral channels and simple feed forward ANN with good quality and reliability. Analysis of the input layer of the trained neural networks allowed several spectral bands to be selected that were the most valuable for the ANN decision and not used in the classic NDVI vegetation index.

AB  - The article deals with the work of Algernon Blackwood, the British classic of horror and science fiction literature. His novels and stories' central theme is manifestations of another world in everyday life. To analyze Blackwood's worldview, the author uses the tools of the phenomenology of religion, in particular, Mircea Eliade's ideas on the sacred and the profane dichotomy and the hierophany; Rudolf Otto's theory of the numinous; and the phenomenological theories of W.B. Kristensen and G. van der Leeuw. The article analyzes how the theme of the sacred is revealed in Blackwood's texts and with what means he creates the world of his religion. The article explores the concept of the "non-divine sacred" as applied to the work of Blackwood. In the concluding discussion, the fantastic world of Blackwood is compared with the world created by Howard Lovecraft.

AB  - Indonesia, literally tropical cyclone free area, still gains some influence from the surrounding cyclones, such as high-intensity precipitation which causes flooding. Therefore, cyclones monitoring is important to observe its growth, movement and intensity. Using ECMWF ERA-Interim data, Himawari-8 channel infrared 1 (IR1), and GSMaP satellite data, this study attempts to spatially analyze the evolution of Cempaka tropical cyclones (occurred on November 2017), propagation cyclone and its effect to rainfall over Java Island based on the brightness temperature of the cloud. The results show that the Cempaka tropical cyclone has a three-day life span and moves from the southern ocean of Central Java to the northeast (East Java) and the peak occurs on November 27th, 2017 at 19:00 LT to 23:00 LT. Compared to rainfall data, the intensity of rainfall at 7 areas closed to Cempaka tropical cyclone began to increase ever since the cyclone peak and continue to rise despite the cyclone was slowly decaying. With this result, we hope in the future we can anticipate the impact of any tropical cyclones that arise near Indonesia.

T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Gynaecological cancers (GCCa) are common and have a significant mortality rate all over the world. Early diagnosis of cancer can play a key role in the treatment and survival of a patient. Identification, staging, treatment, and monitoring of gynaecological malignancies is being done successfully by nuclear medicines.Discussion: Currently, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) centered imaging techniques are being developed for use in patients with GCCa as a diagnostic tool. The present work elucidates several clinical studies on the use of radio-pharmaceuticals, based on their effectiveness, in the early detection and management of GCCa. It also highlights the importance of reconsidering the biology for nuclear imaging as a future modality for early, rapid and efficient diagnosis of gynecological cancers. This comprehensive review is a part of our study designed to detect gynaecological cancers at an early stage using radionuclide complex, (99)mTc-Cisplatin.Conclusion: This article summarizes the significance of radioscintigraphy such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET for identification of GCCa in the experimental humans and animals.

AB  - The traditional limitation in the lower spatial resolution of Thermal Infrared (TIR) versus Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) satellite data can be faced by applying recent disaggregation techniques. These techniques are based on the VNIR-TIR variable regressions at coarse spatial resolution, and the assumption that the relationship between spectral bands is independent of the spatial resolution. A comprehensive analysis of different disaggregation methods in the literature using MODIS and Landsat images was already addressed by [1] in a previous publication. The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of the downscaling method that showed the best results, when applied now to the MODIS/Sentinel-2 tandem for the estimation of daily land surface temperature (LST) at 10 m spatial resolution.An experiment was carried out in an agricultural area located in the Barrax test site, Spain (39 degrees 03' 35 '' N, 2 degrees 06'W), for the summer of 2018. Ground measurements of LST transects centered in the MODIS overpasses, and covering a variety of crops and surface conditions, were used for a robust local validation of the disaggregation approach. An additional set of Landsat-7/ETM+ images were also used for a more extended assessment of the LST product generated. Data from 6 different dates were available for this study, covering 10 different crop fields. Despite the large range of temperatures registered (300-325 K), differences within +/- 4.0K are obtained, with an average estimation error of +/- 2.2K and a systematic deviation of 0.6K for the full dataset. A similar error was obtained for the extended assessment of the high resolution LST products, based on the pixel-to-pixel comparison between Landsat and disaggregated Sentinel-2 LST products.

AB  - It is important to search for new strategies for biodiversity conservation. Recently, remote sensing has proven its usefulness due to the availability of presence and absence data of select species that can be modeled using different statistical designs. This research gathers data regarding the presence and absence of howler monkeys based on modeling studies, validated by sampling and field surveys. This kind of approach provides useful information that supports decision makers in their conservation efforts. The objective of this research is to identify the most robust spectral vegetation index through statistical analysis using mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata G.) as a model species, and different vegetation indices derived from satellite images. We compared certain phenological characteristics of the vegetation (leaf area index, biomass and high chlorophyll content of leaves) in the canopy of cocoa agrosystems (Theobroma cacao L.) both with and without howler monkey presence in Tabasco, Mexico. Data on the presence and absence of the species was obtained from agrosystems. Landsat-5 TM images of the agrosystem regions were used to calculate various vegetation indices. Statistical analysis software (SAS) was used to calculate statistically significant differences. A complete random design and two statistical models were applied - standard distances and Student's t-test - to compare the accuracy of vegetation indices. The Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) had the greatest spectral separability and statistically significant difference on sites with and without the presence of the species in cocoa agrosystems. These indices could be taken as useful variables to predict habitats potentially suitable for the species in support of decision makers, and thus apply conservation efforts for Primates.

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Biogeochemical ecosystem models describe the energy and mass exchange processes between natural systems and their environment. They normally require a large amount of inputs that present important spatial variations and require a parameterization. Other simpler ecosystem models focused on a single process only need a reduced amount of inputs usually derived from direct measurements and can be combined with the former models to calibrate their parameters. This study combines the biogeochemical model Biome-BGC and a production efficiency model (PEM) optimized for the study area to calibrate a key parameter for the simulation of the ecosystem water balance by Biome-BGC, the rooting depth. Daily gross primary production (GPP) time series for the 2005-2012 period are simulated by both models. First, the optimized PEM is validated against GPP derived from four eddy covariance (EC) towers located at different ecosystems representative of the study area. Next, GPP time series simulated by both models are combined to optimize rooting depth at the four sites: different values of rooting depth are tested and the one that results in the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) between the two GPP series is selected. Explained variance and relative RMSE between Biome-BGC and EC GPP series are respectively augmented between 3 and 14 percentage points (pp) and reduced between 1 and 33pp. Finally the methodology is extrapolated for the whole study area and an original rooting depth map for peninsular Spain, which is coherent with the spatial distribution of vegetation type and GPP in the study area, is obtained at 1-km spatial resolution.

TI  - CHANGE DETECTION WORK-FLOW FOR MAPPING CHANGES FROM ARABLE LANDS TO PERMANENT GRASSLANDS WITH ADVANCED BOOSTING METHODS
T2  - GEODETSKI VESTNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - The necessity of mapping changes in land cover categories based on satellite imageries is a challenging task especially in terms of arable land and grasslands. The phenological phases of arable lands change quickly while grasslands is more stable. It might be hard to capture these changes regarding the spectral overlap between crops in full growth and grass itself. We have introduced a relatively simple processing workflow with good efficiency and accuracy. Our proposed method utilises the combination of a Multivariate Alteration Change Detection Algorithm and an existing boosting method, such as the AdaBoost algorithm with different weak learners and the most recent one - Extreme Gradient Boosting that is actually a relatively new approach in remote sensing. According to the results, the highest overall accuracy is 89.51 %. The proposed process workflow was tested on Landsat data with 30 m spatial resolution, using open-source software: R and GRASS GIS, Orfeo Toolbox library.

AB  - In this study, we estimated the spatially-distributed soil moisture at the high resolution (10 m×10 m) using the satellite-based Sentinel-1A/B SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensor images. The Sentinel-1A/B raw data were pre-processed using the SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) tool providedfrom ESA (European Space Agency), and then the pre-processed data were converted to the backscatter coefficients. The regression equations werederived based on the relationships between the TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry)-based soil moisture measurements and the converted backscattercoefficients. The TDR measurements from the 51 RDA (Rural Development Administration) monitoring sites were used to derive the regressionequations. Then, the soil moisture values were estimated using the derived regression equations with the input data of Sentinel-1A/B based backscattercoefficients. Overall, the soil moisture estimates showed the linear trends compared to the TDR measurements with the high Pearson’s correlations (morethan 0.7). The Sentinel-1A/B based soil moisture values matched well with the TDR measurements with various land surface conditions (bare soil, crop,forest, and urban), especially for bare soil (R: 0.885∼0.910 and RMSE: 3.162∼4.609). However, the Mandae-ri (forest) and Taean-eup (urban) sitesshowed the negative correlations with the TDR measurements. These uncertainties might be due to limitations of soil surface penetration depths of SARsensors and complicated land surface conditions (artificial constructions near the TDR site) at urban regions. These results may infer that qualities ofSentinel-1A/B based soil moisture products are dependent on land surface conditions. Although uncertainties exist, the Sentinel-1A/B basedhigh-resolution soil moisture products could be useful in various areas (hydrology, agriculture, drought, flood, wild fire, etc.).

AB  - A system named Fire Danger Rating System is a tool using for early warning system of forest fires. Since 1999 Indonesia has this system, adapted from Canadian Forest Service (CFS), and developed by BPPT cooperation with BMG (now is BMKG), and Departemen Kehutanan (KLHK). The main scientific based of this FDRS is meteorology, where it used total precipitation in a day, and noon condition of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The final result is the Fire Weather Index where we may see the four classes of fire danger rating in two-dimension map. The improvement on this weather component is the use of satellite data to replace some parameter of weather from Automatic Weather Station data. In recent condition, not only weather condition as the primary parameter, but also the humancaused factor, and fuels condition analysis were putting as the same level of weather. Human activities are the main factor of the occurrence of forest fires, that is why the forest, plantation, and horticulture-agriculture land are the main land use that we pay attention more, and it's related to the people who live on small cities or districts in that areas. The condition of peatland we analyzed is the thickness of the peat and the land cover on the surface. The position of water body also we calculated to see the distance of the source of water for wetting the land. Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation is the right way to get some scenarios to have the final composite risk map. Grouping and standardizing the spatial factors based on human-caused and fuels we may know the effect of that component to the final composite map of the Advanced-FDRS. Ina-FDRS is the biggest scenario that includes Natural Resources Accounting as one of the main components, instead of climate, human-caused, and fuels. So, this Advanced-FDRS is the main part of Ina-FDRS (Indonesia Fire Danger Rating System) that ongoing develop by BPPT and the stakeholders for early warning land and forest fire in peatland in Indonesia.

AB  - There are many deltas that are grown and developed relatively quick in coastal area of North Java. The development of the delta region is characterized by the occurrence of sedimentation processes that cause the emerge land. The sedimentation process in the delta region is influenced by the sediment supply from the erosion of the upstream watershed. The land use change will potentially affect the rate of erosion, resulting in a sedimentation process in coastal areas. This study aimed to compare the morpho dynamic model of Delta on the north java coast used multi-temporal remote sensing techniques, namely 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017. The study locations were Delta Comal, Delta Bodri and Delta Wulan. This research was descriptive-explanatory, which was trying to find the widest possible data in order to study the dynamics of Delta, as well as trying to explain the relationship between the factors that influence it. In support of the study used Landsat satellite imagery, Indonesia Topographic Map, ER Mapper 7.0 software, GIS Arc, GPS and other equipment. The results showed that the morphodynamical model of the study area varied. At the beginning of its development, all of the three deltas showed the shape of cuspate but subsequently develop into different morphological forms. In Comal Delta originally cuspate, then developed into Lobate, then tends to cuspate again. In Delta Bodri, from cuspate originally developed into Lobate. While, in Delta Wulan originally cuspate developed into foot bird Delta. Based on the change of delta area, for Delta Comal and Delta Bodri tends to increase, while Delta Wulan tends to fluctuate.

AB  - Dynamic changes in shoreline position as a result ofnatural processes and the effects of climate variability increase the susceptibility of Arctic communities that reside along the coastal zone. The application of newgeospatial approaches is critical to providing updated measurements of shoreline change, necessary for sustainable coastal management strategies. This research is an integration of geographic data demarcating shoreline position and its analysis to detect change using an updatedmodelingapplication - Analyzing Moving Boundaries Using R (AMBUR). Rates-of-change were evaluated over three time periods: long-term (1984-2016); and two short-term eras (1995-2005; 2006-2016). The short-term periods were specifically chosen to assess the influence of changing sea-ice regimes, increased storm intensity, and elevated air and sea-surface temperatures. Results indicate a significant alongshore increase in the rates of erosion and the spatial extent of land loss across both segments of the studyarea over the short-term. Mean annual rates of change increased over the most recent period (2006-2016) along the eastern segment (-0.34m/yr) of the study area, while the western shoreline retreated at a rate of -0.24m/yr over the same interval. These are the highest erosion rates over any time period examined in this study. As air and ocean temperature increases continue to facilitate sea ice reduction and increased permafrost thawing, shoreline erosion may be exacerbated along the Paulatuk coastline in the coming years.

TI  - High-Throughput Field Phenotyping to Assess Irrigation Treatment Effects in Quinoa
T2  - AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Core IdeasWater stress in multiple quinoa varieties were introduced.Remote sensing technologies were evaluated to assess water stress response.Handheld and unmanned aerial system based sensors provided reliable data.Thermal imaging data could capture stress in quinoa varieties. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a crop known for its tolerance to abiotic stress such as drought and salinity. Quinoa is also a versatile superfood, which is gluten-free and high in protein, vitamins, nutrients, and beneficial antioxidants. Washington State University's quinoa breeding program efforts focus on identification and development of varieties that are resilient to local environmental conditions. In this study, high-throughput phenotyping techniques were applied to evaluate the performance of quinoa varieties under different irrigation regimes. Handheld multispectral radiometer (Crop Scan), proximal sensing system using ground platform, and remote sensing with unmanned aerial system (UAS) were used to assess the performance of eight quinoa varieties under two irrigation treatments (non-irrigated and irrigated). Crop Scan data, along with multispectral and thermal infrared images, were acquired at multiple time points at different stages of crop development during the season. In general, the normalized difference vegetation index, water band index, and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) data extracted from Crop Scan, and GNDVI and canopy temperature data extracted from UAS were able to detect irrigation treatment effects. Comparing the spectral data acquired at multiple scales indicated that Crop Scan data were highly and significantly correlated with remote sensing data (|r| = 0.57-0.85). Rapid data acquisition and the ability to detect differences among varieties under water stress highlight the application of remote sensing techniques as a high-throughput phenotyping tool to evaluate quinoa.

TI  - Land use dynamics in the Brazilian Cerrado in the period from 2002 to 2013
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to analyze land use dynamics in the Brazilian Cerrado region from 2002 to 2013. This analysis was based on the interpretation of Landsat satellite images carried out by the projects Projeto de Conservacao e Utilizacao Sustentavel da Diversidade Biologica Brasileira (Probio) and TerraClass Cerrado 2013, both coordinated by Ministerio do Meio Ambiente. In 2002, 38.9% of the Cerrado was covered by some type of anthropic activity. In 2013, this percentage increased to 43.4%. One of the main highlights is the emergence of a new agricultural frontier in the northern region of the study area, known as Matopiba.

AB  - In this work, we evaluate the performance of the AVHRR surface reflectance LTDR V4 using Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM5) Collection-1 surface reflectance data over 440 globally distributed sites, which give a representative set of land surface types and climate conditions. Surface reflectance anisotropy effects were normalized using the VJB method, and spectral response differences were accounted for with spectral band adjustment factors (SBAFs) computed as a function of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from a set of over 100,000 hyperspectral spectra from Hyperion. The performance of the AVHRR record is reported in terms of the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty, as compared to the specifications of the reference product. Results show that the AVHRR record performance is close to the 0.071p+0.0071 specification defined in the original TM5 product evaluation.

AB  - Soil consumption represent an important indicator of soil management, in last few years the European States have been promoted the use and installation of renewable energy sources, with a consequent soil consumption increase. The aim of this work is to implement a procedure that analyzes the change detection of the soil consumption and discriminate those related to soil consumption due to installation of renewable energy sources from that due to built-up areas. The select test site is the Municipality of Melfi (Southern Italy) because is highly significant because is characterized by fragmented and various environments. The increase of urbanization is due to the growth of built-up areas and the exponential development of renewable sources installation. The work herein presented concerns an application study on these processes with the images of Sentinel-2 satellite. In order to produce a synthetic map of soil consumption, the Sentinel-2 images were classified using a supervised classification. A first map of soil consumption was obtained divided the area characterized by urbanization from the area with the presence of the renewable energy sources. Eolic class have been subdivided and reclassified, divided the relevant street from the turbine pad. Eolic class have been reclassified discriminate the relevant street from the turbine pad and subdivided into other subclasses referred to the power wind turbines, in order to quantify the soil consumption related to each one. All processes have been processes developed integrating Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), using open source software.

AB  - This research aimed at exploiting the joint use of machine learning and polarimetry for improving the retrieval of surface soil moisture (SMC) from SAR acquisitions at C- and X-band.The study was conducted on an alpine test area in Italy and two agricultural areas in Canada, for which series of Radarsat-2 (RS2) and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) images were available along with direct measurements of SMC from in-situ stations. The analysis confirmed the sensitivity of SAR backscattering (sigma degrees) from both sensors to the SMC variations, with similar correlations (R similar or equal to 0.5). The comparison of SMC with the Compact Polarimetric (CP) parameters, computed from the RS2 acquisitions by Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) data simulator pointed out that the right and left polarized signals and the Shannon entropy intensity also have some sensitivity to SMC variations, with R similar or equal to 0.4 for all the three parameters.Based on these results, two different machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have been implemented and tested on the available data. On the South Tyrol test area, both SVR and ANN tested with different combinations of RS2 and CSK data were able to retrieve SMC with a RMSE between 4% and 6% of SMC and R between 0.78 and 0.88, depending on the combination of inputs. The ANN algorithm based on CP data was tested on the Canada areas, being able to estimate SMC with a RMSE between 2% and 5% of SMC and R between 0.85 and 0.96.

AB  - This study aims at merging SMAP and Sentinel-1 (S-1) data for obtaining a surface soil moisture (SMC) product improved in accuracy, spatial and temporal resolution that can be used for hydrological modelling in small basins. A method based on Artificial Neural Networks has been developed and validated in a test area in central Italy. All the S-1 images available on the area between 2014 and 2017 have been considered for the analysis, along with the corresponding SMAP acquisitions. Distributed SMC values, to be used as reference for implementing and validating the algorithm, have been derived from the available in-situ data by using the well-assessed Soil Water Balance hydrological model (SWBM). The research is still ongoing; however, some preliminary results show that the merged ANN SMC product is improved in resolution and accuracy with respect to the SMC obtainable from a single sensor.The ANN SMC was successfully assimilated in the MISC hydrological model for improving the model predictions in small and medium basins.

AB  - In 2015 the Jambi Province had been suffered from a big fire which destroying about 115,634 ha or 23% of the total area. This paper describes the measurement of the magnitude and direction of forest and land cover changes, especially in the burnt area of Harapan Rainforest, Jambi, occurred in 2015. The main objective of this study is to find out the magnitude as well as the direction of forest cover changes caused by fire. The magnitude and direction of changes were derived by using Change Vector Analysis (CVA) Approach on the basis of medium-resolution of Landsat 8 acquired in 2014 representing before fire condition and Landsat 8 recorded in 2016 representing after fire condition. The study shows that the magnitude of changes in the study site varied widely starting from slightly to heavily changes. The identified direction of the changes could be grouped into positive and negative directions, where the negative directions include degradation (D1) and deforestation (D2), while the positive directions include regrowth (D3) and revegetation (D4). The area suffering from degradation and deforestation are 3,540 ha and 3,106 ha respectively, while the area experiencing vegetation the vegetation growth and revegetation are 55 ha and 227 ha. The study concludes that the CVA could be used to find out the magnitude and change direction (positive and negative) effectively.

AB  - Changes in land cover can have negative impacts on the hydrological and hydraulic processes in river basins and watersheds such as increase in surface runoff and peak flows, and greater incidence, risk and vulnerability of flooding. In this study, the impacts of land-cover changes to the hydrologic and hydraulic behaviours of the Agusan River Basin (ARB), the third largest river basin in the Philippines, was analysed using an integrated approach involving Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS), and hydrologic and hydraulic models. Different land-cover classes in the ARB for the years 1995 and 2017 were mapped using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images. Using a post-classification change detection approach, changes in land-cover were then determined. The impacts of these changes in land-cover to the to the basin discharge were then estimated using a calibrated hydrologic model based on the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) under different extreme rainfall conditions. The impact of the changes in land-cover to flood depth and extent was also determined using a hydraulic model based on the HEC-RAS (River Analysis System). Land cover classification results revealed that the ARB is 67.7% forest in 1995 but have decreased to 62.8% in 2017. Agricultural areas in the basin were also found to have increased from 12.2% to 15.5% in the same period. Other notable land cover changes detected include the increase in built-up lands and range lands, and decrease in barren lands. HEC HMS and HEC RAS model simulation results showed that there was an increase in discharge, flood depth, and flood extents between 1995 and 2017, implying that that the detected changes in land cover have negative impacts to hydrologic and hydraulic behaviours of the ARB.

AB  - Obstetrical care currently requires the implementation of quality management. Efforts to improve prenatal care and institutional delivery have shifted maternal deaths to hospital settings. This mortality cannot be reduced without strong emphasis on obstetrical care safety. Implementing a system for reporting adverse events is a fundamental part of this management. This notification system allows to identify sentinel events, generate security alerts, find trends, and analyze events. The analysis is only possible by implementing validated methodologies such as barrier analysis, root cause analysis and FMEA (failure mode & effects analysis). The experience at HONADOMANI San Bartolome shows that it is possible to implement a risk management system in our setting.

AB  - In this study we present results of above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation for Sweden based on ALOS PALSAR backscatter data. The retrieval was performed within the framework of the BIOMASAR algorithm, and the validation was based on the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots. The main focus, however, is about the modelling framework on the retrieval of AGB by integrating PALSAR backscatter, ICESAT GLAS metrics and allometric functions to improve the estimation of AGB. To evaluate the AGB retrieval, the average stem volume for each Swedish county from the NFI plots and the corresponding pixels covered by the inventory plots was computed. The result show an high agreement in terms of an RMSE of 8.2%, a bias of -1.9 m(3)/ha and a R-2 value of 0.82. The results indicate that stem volume derived from ALOS PALSAR data can be used to support statistics for Sweden and spatially explicit give information on stem volume distribution across the country, albeit local fluctuations due to the still simplified modelling framework here implemented.

TI  - Monitoring long-term forest dynamics with scarce data: a multi-date classification implementation in the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Monitoring long-term forest dynamics is essential for assessing human-induced land-cover changes, and related studies are often based on the multi-decadal Landsat archive. However, in areas such as the Tropical Andes, scarce data and the resulting poor signal-to-noise ratio in time series data render the implementation of automated time-series analysis algorithms difficult. The aim of this research was to investigate a novel approach that combines image compositing, multi-sensor data fusion, and postclassification change detection that is applicable in data-scarce regions of the Tropical Andes, exemplified for a case study in Ecuador. We derived biennial deforestation and reforestation patterns for the period from 1992 to 2014, achieving accuracies of 82 +/- 3% for deforestation and 71 +/- 3% for reforestation mapping. Our research demonstrated that an adapted methodology allowed us to derive the forest dynamics from the Landsat time series, despite the abundant regional data gaps in the archive, namely across the Tropical Andes. This study, therefore, presented a novel methodology in support of monitoring long-term forest dynamics in areas with limited historical data availability.

AB  - Thirty-three years ago, an accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant released huge amounts of radioactive materials like cesium, strontium and plutonium into the atmosphere, which spread over a vast area. It is known that its effects can cause damage do the DNA of living beings, leading to death or altered fitness of the biota, but the effects of land abandonment under such conditions are not, as the vicinities of the power plant were permanently evacuated. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the state of primary production of the vegetation in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone after the accident, comparing with its previous state. Through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiation measurements, the relationship between these variables was assessed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), to understand how the vegetation responded to the radiation exposure. The data considered was Landsat satellite imagery and sampled areas registered on the field. The results show that the NDVI increased over the years after the accident and that it is independent of the current radiation measured. This suggests that to some level of radiation exposure, the positive effects of land abandonment and/or the negative effects of radiation on abundance of herbivore species surpass the long term negative effects of radiation exposure on the vegetation. Nonetheless, above some radiation threshold level, primary production is expected to be negatively affected.

AB  - The aim of this paper is the recognition of the basic forms of depiction of the cosmos in popular culture, in particular in literature and film. By showing the premises underlying procedures of artistic creations, the authors also draw up proprietary strategies thanks to which the presented worlds are characterized by their entirety and integrity. For achievement of this purpose, they show the non-artistic and non-aesthetic sources of the cosmic representations/ imagery. The authors show the consequence of the inescapable inhomogeneity of the image of the cosmos in fantasy, and secondly they analyze how strategies associated with the scientific vision of the cosmos are closer to a rational worldview and how they bring the massive public the latest advances in cosmology, astronomy and quantum physics.It is proved that that contemporary popular art is increasingly closely related to the modern state of scientific research in both the exact sciences and broadly understood religious studies or anthropology. The cosmos, thanks to popular creativity, becomes an acceptable, open and comprehensible space, while not being the most important challenge and mystery for humankind.The results obtained the numbers of tools in artistic criticism and sphere of humanistic reflection and journalism in branch of popular culture. They enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of popularity of fantastic creativity and its impact on the recipient's awareness and give important tools in the process of popularizing the latest scientific discoveries.

AB  - The ITERA observatory area is located on Mount Betung, which is adjacent to the Semangko active fault zone. This can be seen from the frequent occurrence of earthquakes in the western part of Sumatra. Therefore it is necessary to do mapping and research on the geological structure of Mount Betung. First, the identification of geological structure was carried out through Landsat 8 imagery with 753 composite bands. This composite band was the best in displaying geological structures. Seven geological structures were obtained in the form of faults at Mount Betung. 2 in the south, namely F1 and F2 faults, 2 in the north, F3 and F4 faults, and three faults around the Mount Betung peak, namely F5, F6, and F7. Some of these faults were strengthened by the discovery of 4 waterfalls in several parts of the fault. Talang Teluk waterfall on the fault in F1 fault, Talang Rabun waterfall on F2 fault, Gunung Betung waterfall on F3 fault, and Kubu Jambu waterfall in F4 fault. The four faults have an orientation towards the Northeast-Southwest. Joint data obtained in the field was processed to determine the type of fault. Based on joint data, it is estimated that faults in Mount Betung are normal faults. This fault is a normal fault system due to body force or gravity by its mass load. So that the active fault Semangko was not very influential on Mount Betung.

AB  - Mesoscale Convective Complex (MCC) is a mesoscale cloud convective system characterized by large, long-lived and quasi-circular pattern. The existence of MCC may trigger extreme weather events such as heavy rains which cause floods and landslides around the center of interest area. This paper aims to identify the presence of a storm cloud system which is observed as the MCC. For that purpose, this study used Himawari-8 satellite infrared channel data. Case of the study is the rain event in Bangka Belitung on 8 February 2016 which recorded 183.9 mm rainfall a day. Satellite data was processed using image processing software by applying MCC cloud system identification algorithm based on its physical characteristics, i.e. peak cloud temperature, coverage area, central point of cloud, cloud eccentricity and ellipse fitting, and lifetime of the cloud system. The final result of this study is able to yield the coordinates of latitude and longitude of MCC location, which are MCC cloud systems appeared around Bangka Belitung. This result confirmed that the occurrence of heavy rain on February 8th, 2016 in Bangka Belitung was caused by the presence of MCC around the interest area.

AB  - Data and disaster information is crucial to support disaster response, recovery, and relief process. Unfortunately, acquiring data during emergency situations is difficult. After a disaster occurred, information about the victim and the impact of the disaster must be collected immediately for aid distribution purposes. Collecting shelter location data with number of victims and their needs must be completed swiftly as a disaster response action. Furthermore, collecting information of damaged buildings is also essential to determine the amount of compensation for destroyed houses. Geographic Information System combined with remote sensing is practical and reliable to help all of these tasks. WorldView-3 high resolution imagery with 0.5 m spatial resolution provided by Digital Globe is used to interpret damaged building in Palu City study area. By comparing satellite imagery before and after disaster, damaged building information can be interpreted and extracted as a cartographic map. Cross validation with field data of damaged building demonstrated that accuracy of the interpretation is approximately 80.49 %. The result of the damaged building compared with shelter distribution data using service area accessibility analysis and then used to analyze optimum coverage of disaster mitigation shelters.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - "Crowdsourcing" uses masses of people to solve a specific problem, usually focusing on research strategies to reduce time, cost and effort to create data. Crowdsourcing intrinsically claims that groups can make relatively smarter and better decisions than the most intelligent individual among them. We investigated to see if crowdsourcing could be used to collect control points for usage in calculating post-classification accuracy assessments. For this purpose, a test was done using class values of randomly generated 1000 control points. Its goal was to explore the accuracy of a specific class values to be entered by three different users by utilizing majority voting method. While examining 3 data sets containing 1000 points, it could be observed that the class values of only 4 points were entered incorrectly. When the support vector machine classification results were evaluated, using the same 1000 control points generated by the experts and the crowdsourcing (containing 4 faulty points), the classification accuracies were found to be 85.0487% and 84.6154%, respectively. Results show that crowdsourcing offers a quicker and more reliable post-classification accuracy assessment for high-spatial resolution multispectral images.
