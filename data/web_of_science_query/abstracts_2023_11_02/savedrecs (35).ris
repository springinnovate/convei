M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to infer Korea's strategic culture based on the variables of identity and threat perception through the analysis of the president's speech. The attributes of Korean strategic culture inferred through text analysis of 258 presidential speeches related to security are as follows. First, the experience of colonial rule by Japanese imperialism is becoming a source of threat recognition in Korea. Second, trade-off occurs between threats and national identity. For example, if national identity is strengthened, the threat from North Korea is likely to be underestimated. Third, cognitive dissonance occurs in threat recognition. This phenomenon is strong when threats conflict with national identity. Fourth, the  conventional worldview of the international order based on Sinocentrism partly plays a role in recognizing threats. These attributes can mainly work in relations with Japan and China. In order to more comprehensively identify the attributes of Korean strategic culture, research is needed to expand the variables of strategic culture and apply various methodologies.

TI  - Rethinking the brain drain: A framework to analyze the future behavior of complex socio-economic systems
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - The brain drain crisis is among the most challenging issues of many developing countries, attributed to the compounding effects of multiple factors. As communities and their challenges become more complex, new sets of mixed research tools that critically investigate these issues as whole systems rather than isolated parts are crucial for future decision makings. In light of this, mixed research approaches offer the chance to overcome most of the limitations of individual methods and provide potential solutions to complicated problems that are more in-depth than a single form of research method. In this paper, by drawing on the complementary characteristics of Causal Layered Analysis and Participatory System Dynamics, a mixed approach for investigating the future behaviors of complex socio-economic systems and exploring the effectiveness of various policy interventions over time is proposed. Moreover, Iran's brain drain case study is presented for further assessment of the proposed approach. The implication of the proposed approach to skills mobility or the so-called brain drain phenomenon is the undisputable role of human capital efficiency in the future developments of the nation. Through this approach, in the first step, an issue is critically analyzed and unpacked into four layers, namely as litany, structure, worldview, and metaphor. In the second step, a participatory approach is implemented to systematically model the issue based on the results of the previous step via five stages. The utility of this approach is its ability to critically examine the future behaviors of complex systems under the effect of different policy interventions and scenarios. Therefore, the proposed approach will generate theoretical value for researchers in the field of futures studies and harbor practical value for policymakers who seek a better mechanism to critically investigate complex socio-economic systems.

TI  - Flow velocities of the debris-covered Miyar Glacier, western Himalaya, India
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal surface velocity measurements of the alpine valley type debris-covered Miyar Glacier of the Chandrabhaga (Chenab) basin, western Himalaya, were assessed based on the cross-correlation of Landsat images spanning nearly three decades (1992-2019). Long-term (1950-2015) temperature and precipitation trends were evaluated using Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) datasets. The mean velocity (1992-2019) of the Miyar Glacier is similar to 29 m/yr, with spatial patterns revealing that the debris-covered tongue is nearly stagnant (similar to 5 m/yr) compared to the debris-free up-glacier zone (similar to 35 m/yr). The transition zone from clean to debris-covered ice in the mid-ablation area shows the highest long-term mean velocities of similar to 60 m/yr during the observation period, likely resulting from a steep surface gradient and greater ice thickness than the other regions of this glacier. The slow-moving and nearly stagnant debris-covered area reveals the highest amount of surface lowering due to the expansion of supraglacial ponds. Miyar Glacier experiences summer speed-up of similar to 67-80% in seasonal velocity compared to winter, interpreted as a result from enhanced basal sliding during summer months due to warmer temperatures inputting more meltwater into the subsurface drainage system. Inter-annual velocity variations are greatest in the upper glacier, with higher velocities observed more frequently in recent decades. Future work should aim to elucidate the causes of this pattern, considering the overall rising air temperature trend in the western Himalaya.

TI  - Long-term tracing and staining of carbon nanoparticles for axillary lymph nodes in patients with locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The regression of positive nodes in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate this regression by injecting and tracing carbon nanoparticles (CNs) into the fusion node prior to NAC in patients with breast cancer. Methods: Guided by ultrasound, 0.3 mL of CNs suspension was injected in the fusion node prior to NAC in 110 patients with local advanced breast cancer. Then the patients underwent breast surgery and total axillary lymph node dissection following 2-6 cycles of NAC. The distribution by intercostobrachial nerves (ICBN) of positive nodes and black-stained nodes was researched, and the relationship between the distribution and lymphovascular invasion were investigated by response to NAC. Results: When patients were ranked by response to NAC (from sensitive to resistance), the number of positive nodes increased, as did the proportion of lymphovascular invasion, the number of black-stained nodes decreased. A significantly negative relationship was found between the number of positive nodes and the number of black-stained nodes (p < 0.001). The positive nodes in patients with sensitive consequence followed the rule from under the ICBN to above the ICBN. However, there was counterexample (skip metastasis) in the patients with resistance result. Conclusion: The regression of positive nodes follows the rule from upper to under, inner to outer in the patients with sensitive consequence to NAC. Long-term staining and tracing by CNs might provide an acceptable and feasible technique to investigate the regression of positive nodes, and would be a potential method for NAC-treated patients by using of ICBN.

TI  - A multimodality test outperforms three machine learning classifiers for identifying and mapping paddocks using time series satellite imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rotational grazing in paddocks is a strong indicator of intensive grassland management. Uncertainty in the extent of grassland management intensity is a reported source of uncertainty in greenhouse gas budgeting. This article outlines a method of detecting paddock locations in Sentinel 2 satellite imagery using a statistical multimodality test. The test was compared to three machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest and extreme gradient boosting). Photographic records of the Eurostat 2018 LUCAS survey were used as ground truth data to confirm the presence or absence of paddocks. The multimodality test achieved an overall accuracy of 88.4% versus the best machine learning accuracy of 82.4%. The test was also used to map paddock occurrence at a regional scale in the Republic of Ireland. Overall map accuracy was 85.7% versus validation data. The test can be applied in temperate grasslands with pre-mapped field boundaries where rotational grazing is practiced.

TI  - A remote sensing-guided forest inventory concept using multispectral 3D and height information from ZiYuan-3 satellite data
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased frequencies of storms and droughts due to climate change are changing central European forests more rapidly than in previous decades. To monitor these changes, multispectral 3D remote sensing (RS) data can provide relevant information for forest management and inventory. In this case study, data of the multispectral 3D-capable satellite system ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) were used in a RS-guided forest inventory concept to reduce the field sample size compared to the standard grid inventory. We first pre-stratified the forest area via the ZY-3 dataset into coniferous, broadleaved and mixed forest types using object-based image analysis. Each forest type was then split into three height strata using the ZY-3 stereo module-derived digital canopy height model (CHM). Due to limited sample sizes, we reduced the nine to six strata. Then, for each of the six strata, we randomly selected representative segments for inventory plot placement. We then conducted field inventories in these plots. The collected field data were used to calculate forest attributes, such as tree species composition, timber volume and canopy height at plot level (terrestrially measured tree height and height information from ZY-3 CHM). Subsequently, we compared the resulting forest attributes from the RS-guided inventory with the reference data from a grid inventory based only on field plots. The difference in mean timber volumes to the reference was +30.21 m(3)ha(-1) (8.99 per cent) for the RS-guided inventory with terrestrial height and -11.32 m(3)ha(-1) (-3.37 per cent) with height information from ZY-3 data. The relative efficiency (RE) indicator was used to compare the different sampling schemes. The RE as compared to a random reduction of the sample size was 1.22 for the RS-guided inventory with terrestrial height measurements and 1.85 with height information from ZY-3 data. The results show that the presented workflow based on 3D ZY-3 data is suitable to support forest inventories by reducing the sample size and hence potentially increase the inventory frequency.

TI  - The role of groundwater in the spatio-temporal variations of vegetation water use efficiency in the Ordos Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater influences the water and carbon cycle by supplying moisture to plants in the semi-arid and arid zones. However, little is known about the response of ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) to climate change in different groundwater depth (GD) sections. Recent research has shown that plant photosynthesis and growth are closely related to GD via field experiments but the wider recognition of GD effect on regional-scale ecosystems has not been yet established. In this study, we test whether the GD has an impact on ecosystem WUE and its variability to climate change at the regional scale. Based on the observed data of nearly 3000 wells, meteorological data (precipitation and pan evaporation), and the 0.01 degrees-resolution remote sensing datasets including gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), we explored the spatio-temporal variations of WUE and its composites (i.e., GPP and ET), and their characteristics depending on GD under different aridity conditions and biomes across the Ordos Plateau, a semi-arid to arid area in northern China. Results show that WUE increases with decreasing GD due to water availability in the semi-arid lands where WUE variability is mainly regulated by biological processes (i.e., GPP), while WUE is insensitive to the changes in GD across the arid zone where the physical processes (i.e., ET) control WUE change. However, when drought happens the groundwater-independent vegetation in the arid zone can also utilize groundwater, characterized by lower reductions of GPP with the decrease in GD. A dense vegetation condition (i. e., large NDVI) is more vulnerable to climatic disturbance over the semi-arid zone because it tends to decrease GPP and WUE, especially in the large GD regions. These findings have important implications for reasonable land use and groundwater management over the semi-arid and arid regions.

TI  - Design as a Factor in the Formation of Worldview Paradigms in Culture
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article highlights the importance of design in the formation of worldview paradigms in global culture. The research aims to investigate the design development as a part of the culture and its significance in the social development of society and worldview standards. The article uses general scientific methods of cognition, showing the transformation of design in the social and cultural sphere based on scientific and business literature. The research results show the chronology of design development as a factor determining the development of society and its worldview. In particular, the epoch of modernism, classical functionalism, postmodernism, post-industrialism, and digital design show their own particularities of design development. Furthermore, the article reveals the peculiarities of design development and its requirements depending on the development of society, progress, and civilization in general. The question of current and future trends in the development of design as a factor of worldview paradigms in the culture is based on digitalization, globalization, and the formation of design as an independent entity that determines man's place in the world and society.

TI  - Fear of death among voluntary migrants-qualitative pilot study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The studies presented here were aimed at answering the following questions: do voluntary migrants, when deciding to cross borders illegally, take into account the risk of losing their life, how much they fear it, and whether personality traits, such as sensation seeking or self-esteem and culture worldview, are associated with the fear of death. The research covered 16 voluntary migrants. A psychological interview and observation were used. Attempts were made to explain the fear of death and the related behaviours of migrants on the basis of two theories: sensation seeking theory by M. Zuckerman and terror management theory by Greenberg, Pyszczynski and Solomon. It turned out that the subjects rarely considered the risk of losing health or life on their way to the EU, and the level of fear of death was low, especially in men. The existence of relationships between the level of anxiety and sensation seeking, self-esteem and worldview has been noticed. The level of fear in women can be explained by their age, life experience, way of making decisions and awareness of dangers along the route to the UE. Women thought about passing away more often because they encountered the death of their relatives more often. Men often made decisions on an impulse. The contemplating death, second aspect of the thanatological attitude was absent in them. They had higher self-esteem than women, a more stable culture worldview, and a higher sensation seeking and propensity for risky behavior. These personality traits may have diminished the fear of death.

TI  - Multi-resolution analysis based data mining approach to assess vegetation dynamics in Jharkhand using time series MODIS products
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data using the Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) based Wavelet Transforms (WT) provides capacity to characterize the inter-annual and intra-annual vegetation variability on the ground at different scales and resolutions. The MRA was performed to decompose time series EVI at level 5 in order to analyze intra-annual, inter-annual trend and human-induced activities in Jharkhand state, India during the period 2001-2018. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope were performed to identify the trend and magnitude in the vegetation dynamics, respectively. Vegetation dynamics at the intra-annual (seasonality) scale indicated 43,941 km(2) of Jharkhand state showed decreasing pattern, while 41,963 km(2) shows increasing pattern. Further, inter-annual variability in the vegetation cover indicated 22,393 km(2) and 64,746 km(2) as decreasing and increasing trends, respectively. The results from this study can serve as guidelines for policy makers for monitoring and framing effective and sustainable strategies for conservation of green cover in Jharkhand state.

TI  - Factors affecting bighorn sheep activity at water developments in southwestern Arizona
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the efficacy of artificial water developments for desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) populations is an important conservation concern as projected climatic changes pose potentially severe effects to the species in the southwestern United States. We monitored daily visitation frequencies and temporal activity patterns of bighorn sheep at 20 water developments on the Barry M. Goldwater Range-East in Arizona, USA, from January 2015 to December 2018. We evaluated the effects of weather, landscape, and interspecific presence on these data using zero-inflated modeling and temporal activity analysis. Approximately 95% of visits by sheep occurred during summer primarily in response to relatively high temperatures and low precipitation. Conversely, sheep were nearly absent from developments during non-summer when vegetative moisture was relatively high, especially if temperature was low and precipitation high. The frequency of visits by bighorn sheep increased when interspecifics were present owing to high use of water developments by all species during summer. Bighorn sheep altered their temporal activity to avoid the high activity periods of predators and competitors in all seasons. Water developments with terrain offering antipredator protection also had greater frequencies of visits, but these features did not affect the probability of absence. Overall, our study indicates that water developments provide hydration and thermoregulatory relief to bighorn sheep during the hot and water-limited conditions of summer and sites lacking adequate antipredator terrain limit water development efficaciousness. We also find that temporal partition by sheep potentially reduces fitness during summer and recommend further analysis based on motion-sensitive cameras to explore this topic.

TI  - An estimation of the evapotranspiration of typical steppe areas using Landsat images and the METRIC model
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing excels in estimating regional evapotranspiration (ET). However, most remote sensing energy balance models require researchers to subjectively extract the characteristic parameters of the dry and wet limits of the underlying surfaces. The regional ET accuracy is affected by wrong determined ideal pixels. This study used Landsat images and the METRIC model to evaluate the effects of different dry and wet pixel combinations on the ET in the typical steppe areas. The ET spatiotemporal changes of the different land cover types were discussed. The results show that the surface temperature and leaf area index could determine the dry and wet limits recognition schemes in grassland areas. The water vapor flux data of an eddy covariance system verified that the relative error between the ETd,METRIC and ETd,GES of eight DOYs (day of the year) was 18.8% on average. The ETMETRIC values of the crop growth season and the ETIMS of eight silage maize irrigation monitoring stations were found to have a relative error of 11.1% on average. The spatial distribution of the ET of the different land cover types in the study area was as follows: ETwater > ETarable land > ETforest land > ETunutilized land > ETgrassland > ETurban land.

TI  - Reduced ecosystem resilience quantifies fine-scale heterogeneity in tropical forest mortality responses to drought
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitivity of forest mortality to drought in carbon-dense tropical forests remains fraught with uncertainty, while extreme droughts are predicted to be more frequent and intense. Here, the potential of temporal autocorrelation of high-frequency variability in Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), an indicator of ecosystem resilience, to predict spatial and temporal variations of forest biomass mortality is evaluated against in situ census observations for 64 site-year combinations in Costa Rican tropical dry forests during the 2015 ENSO drought. Temporal autocorrelation, within the optimal moving window of 24 months, demonstrated robust predictive power for in situ mortality (leave-one-out cross-validation R-2 = 0.54), which allows for estimates of annual biomass mortality patterns at 30 m resolution. Subsequent spatial analysis showed substantial fine-scale heterogeneity of forest mortality patterns, largely driven by drought intensity and ecosystem properties related to plant water use such as forest deciduousness and topography. Highly deciduous forest patches demonstrated much lower mortality sensitivity to drought stress than less deciduous forest patches after elevation was controlled. Our results highlight the potential of high-resolution remote sensing to "fingerprint" forest mortality and the significant role of ecosystem heterogeneity in forest biomass resistance to drought.

M3  - Article
AB  - Exopolysaccharide (EPS) was produced by Lacticaseibacillus paracasei ZY-1 isolated from Tibetan kefir grains, and the preliminary structure of two EPS fractions (EPS1 and EPS2) was investigated. NMR analysis revealed that the backbone of higher producing EPS1 was consisted of -> 6)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 ->, -> 2,6)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 ->, alpha-D-Manp-(1 ->, -> 2)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 ->, -> 3)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 ->, -> 6)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 ->. Furthermore, an eps gene cluster that encodes the glycosyltransferase and relevant proteins for EPS biosynthesis was identified on the basis of bioinformation analysis of the complete genome. RT-qPCR results indicated that wzd (ZY-1_2260) and wze (ZY-1_2259) might be essential genes involved in EPS production. Meanwhile, the synthetic mechanism of EPS1 in L. paracasei ZY-1 was further proposed. Besides, the crude and purified EPS showed certain scavenging activities against DPPH, hydroxyl and ABTS radicals. Results provided a better understanding of EPS biosynthesis in L. paracasei ZY-1 at the gene level.

AB  - The concept of green development as a rational grasp of the relationship between man and nature is not only an important embodiment of the line of thought of seeking truth from facts and advancing with the times but also a concrete application of Marxist materialistic dialectics combined with the current situation of China's development. Ecological consciousness is a value orientation that reflects the harmonious development of man and nature as a worldview and methodology to explore and reflect on the ecological and environmental problems of the current society. College students are an important force in promoting China's development in the future, and cultivating their good ecological consciousness with the concept of green development as a guide for action is of great significance at both the theoretical level and the practical level. Based on the review of online reviews, this study proposes that the content of positive reviews can be classified into praiseworthy reviews. In order to verify the objectivity of the content dimensions of the three types of positive comments, this study selected 1,800 positive comments as the research sample using stratified random sampling and conducted a content analysis of the comment samples one by one using the NET method. The content analysis results showed that praiseworthy comments appeared in almost all of the samples, constructive comments appeared in 23% of the samples, and prosocial comments appeared in only 14% of the sample. The results of the content analysis show that it is necessary to identify the dimensions of positive online comments because the single-dimensional constructs cannot effectively present the multidimensional information content contained in positive comments. By studying the geometric modeling method in soft tissue modeling technology, we propose covering the surface model on the outer surface of the physical model and using the tetrahedral mesh as the support skeleton of the physical model. Through the purification of the initial items and secondary testing, a scale with good reliability and validity for measuring the three constructs of praiseworthy, constructive, and prosocial comments was finally obtained.

TI  - Post-ecological effect and risk assessment of using modified clay in harmful algal bloom mitigation: An attempt based on the responses of zooplankton Brachionus plicatilis and bivalve Mytilus edulis
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - ABSTR A C T The modified clay is the only worldwide-accepted practical method for mitigating algal bloom. Is it ecologically safe? To evidence it, a simulative bloom-occurring system of Karenia mikimotoi was set up, and the sentinel organisms of rotifer Brachionus plicatilis in sea surface and blue mussel Mytilus edulis on the benthos were respectively included. The organisms' physiological responses were determined as the indicators to reflect the ecological impacts when clay settled from surface to the bottom during the mimic bloom-mitigating process. Modified clay at a concentration of 0.1 g/L effectively removed the K. mikimotoi at an 81% removal rate, and its addition would not significantly strengthen the negative impacts on population dynamics and reproductive activities of B. plicatilis induced by sole K. mikimotoi within the first 2 h. Even an alleviation was observed at 2 d indicated by the increase of survival rate, egg and larva production after clay addition compared with those of 2 h. When the clay particles settled to benthos, the physical damage to the gills and digestive glands of M. edulis were found via the tissue and SEM observation, especially in higher treatment groups of 0.5 and 1.0 g/L, and filtering rate, digestive enzymes, condition index, water content and mortality were also influenced. However, little impact was found in group of 0.1 g/L. Risk assessment based on the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) model further revealed that the complete key event-key event relationship-adverse outcome pathway was only clearly observed in 0.5 g/L and 1 g/L groups but not in 0.1 g/L group, inferring the small ecological risk of 0.1 g/L. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) based on the mussel's physiological responses further backed up the AOP outcoming. The combined results from rotifer to bivalve emphasized on one conclusion that modified clay at 0.1 g/L was effective and ecologically safe in coastal bloom mitigation.

TI  - Carbon sequestration capacity of terrestrial vegetation in China based on satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving carbon neutrality depends on carbon emission reduction and sequestration. However, research on vegetative carbon sequestration in China remains preliminary. In this study, we calculated the total carbon sequestration of terrestrial vegetation and that of different vegetation types in China from 2001-2019 using satellite data. Total vegetative carbon sequestration slowly increased but its increase was significantly lower than that of carbon emissions over the same period. Provinces with the strongest carbon sequestration capacity were mainly distributed in the south, whereas those with the lowest capacity were mainly in the west of Heihe-Tengchong Line. Woody grassland achieved the largest amount of carbon sequestration and grassland experienced the fastest growth. As sequestration ability varies by vegetation type and region, we suggest adopting a holistic regional approach that optimizes local vegetation growth environments, improves ecological compensation protection mechanisms (especially in urban areas) and develops other carbon sequestration pathways.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of surface ozone and its influencing factors across Tibet: A Geodetector-based study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reasons regarding surface ozone formation and distribution in remote regions is limited. Tibet is an important remote area on Earth, with various climates and extremely high elevation (average similar to 4000 m), which makes it a good place to study the spatiotemporal distribution of surface ozone and explore the causes. Based on ground monitoring data from 18 stations on Tibet between 2015 and 2019, the annual, seasonal, monthly, and diurnal variations of surface ozone were analyzed. The annual mean values (60.7-72.5 mu g/m(3)) presented an increasing trend during the past five years, with seasonal concentrations of surface ozone higher in spring than in winter. Spatially, both the ground observations and high-resolution remote sensing data indicated that the surface ozone was relatively high in the southwest regions of Tibet, and low in the southeast and northeast areas. Geodetector analysis found that relative humidity (RID, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and solar radiation (SR) were the top three individual factors affecting surface ozone distribution, while NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 showed less influence. All influencing factors showed an improvement through the two-factor interaction. The associations of RH boolean AND PM10 (q = 0.77), RH boolean AND NDVI (q = 0.72), and NDVICISR (q = 0.73) exhibited a strong impact on surface ozone distribution, suggesting that places with sparse vegetation cover, dry climate and strong SR would usually cause high atmospheric ozone burden. This could also explain why concentrations of surface ozone continue to increase in some remote areas worldwide with ecological deterioration and desertification.

The current scheme of manual hazard monitoring in rail transit still remains potential safety risks. Accurate rail scene understanding is an essential step towards a smart train. Limited by the closeness of railway scenes, not much research has been conducted on the perception and understanding of rail transit. In view of the above, we propose multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI), the first multimodal proximity remote sensing data set for rail scene understanding. MRSI consists of 27k images collected from freight rail and metro following the pixel and box annotations labeled and checked manually. We used a variety of sensing devices mounted on locomotives to record track scenes under different lighting and weather conditions, including straight, curve, and fork during daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as under rainy days. We also include an additional infrared thermometer in the metro environment, propose a new image registration method after synchronous acquisition, and thus construct MRSI combining spatial and radiometric properties. With this data set, we can achieve segmentation of the track area and recognition of obstacles by sensing the environment in front of the train, which lead to rail scene understanding. MRSI is publicly available at .

TI  - Significant light absorption of brown carbon during the 2020 California wildfires
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the contribution of brown carbon (BrC) to the absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) during the August to October 2020 California wildfires in Fresno, Monterey, and the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) was investigated using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) column measurements with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire pixel counts. There was an approximate three to five times increase in AAOD and fine-mode aerosols during intensive wildfires in August-October 2020 compared to the wildfires in the previous 18 years (2002-2019). Substantial daily variation in the contribution of BrC to AAOD was correlated with the fire pixel counts (correlation coefficients of 0.63, 0.40, and 0.57 at Fresno, Monterey, and UCSB, respectively). This variation was influenced by regional topography, atmospheric conditions, and distance from the fire. Between August and October 2020, the average contribution of BrC to AAOD at 440 nm due to wildfires was 35.3 +/- 5.6, 35.1 +/- 6.8, and 40.6 +/- 9.5% at Fresno, Monterey, and UCSB, respectively. This was approximately twice as high as for those sites without a direct wildfire influence. The BrC contribution with direct wildfire influence over the period of January- December 2020 at Fresno, Monterey, and UCSB (32.8 +/- 7.5, 31.6 +/- 7.9, and 40.0 +/- 3.5%, respectively) and from 2002 to 2019 (30.7 +/- 8.3, 28.5 +/- 4.8, and 35.7 +/- 14.6%, respectively) was approximately 20% greater than other BrC sources including vehicles, fossil fuel combustion, and residential heating.

TI  - Black fathers' personal histories, worldviews, and fathering behaviors
T2  - FAMILY RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We examined links between boyhood and fatherhood in a thematic analysis of Black men's narratives about their childhood histories, connection of these experiences to their views about fathering, and descriptions of their fathering relationships and behaviors. Background There remains a critical need to understand how Black men father in a sociohistorical context that defines them as absent or deficient. Method We conducted in-depth, semistructured qualitative interviews with 30 Black fathers with children in 4-year-old kindergarten through grade 12 education. We used life course theory and an integrative model of child development as conceptual frameworks to guide a mixed deductive-inductive analysis. Results We identified three categories and seven themes within the categories: Personal History (Intergenerational Relationships, Negotiating Race and Racism, Turning Points), Fathering Worldview (Being a Father: The Nurturer, The Educator; Fathering Black Children), and Fathering Relationships and Behaviors (Father-Child Interaction, Racial Armoring). We also identified fathers' explicit connections of their Personal Histories to their Fathering Worldviews and, thereby, their Fathering Relationships and Behaviors. Conclusion This article addresses ways that Black men make sense of their personal histories and connect these histories to how they raise their children. Implications This discussion of intergenerational linking of lives and turning points has significant implications for understanding Black family development in the racialized context of the United States and highlights the need for comprehensive mental health support for Black men and their families that focuses on racial trauma along with conceptual and empirical focus on impacts of anti-Blackness on individual and family well-being.

TI  - Probabilistic modelling of residual stresses in cold-formed rectangular hollow sections
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study revisits residual stress models of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (CFRHS). Residual stresses of CFRHS have a complex distribution that varies along the cross-sectional perimeter and through the material thickness. The distribution depends on the manufacturing methods and steel grades, which constantly evolve. Existing residual stress models are based on old measurements and for normal strength steel specimens (nominal yield strength fy,nom 460 MPa). This study evaluates the suitability of these models for modern CFRHS made of normal- and high-strength (fy,nom 460 MPa) steels. Evaluation is carried out as an extensive analysis for a data set, which is collected from the literature, and supplemented with new measurements made for grade S700 specimens. As a result of the evaluation, an updated residual stress model is proposed, which combines the best suitable features of the existing models with slight modifications. The proposed model is valid for CFRHS made of steel grades up to S960. The model can be used in the advanced analyses of CFRHS structures. Additionally, statistical information is provided for the residual stress components such that the model can be used in probabilistic modelling and reliability studies.

TI  - The giant steps in surgical downsizing toward a personalized treatment of vulvar cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article aims to highlight the importance of changes of personalized surgical treatment for vulvar cancer. Current international literature regarding surgical treatment of vulvar cancer was evaluated. This included several studies and systematic reviews. Radical surgery approach, such as en bloc resection, was the first therapeutic option and the standard care for many years, even if burdened with a high complication rate and frequently disfiguring. Taussing and Way introduced radical vulvectomy approach with en bloc bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy; modified radical vulvectomy was developed, with a wide radical excision of the primary tumor. The role of inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (mono or bilateral) changed in the years too, particularly with the advent of SLN biopsy as minimally invasive surgical approach for lymph node staging, in patients with unifocal cancer <4 cm, without suspicious groin nodes. More personalized and conservative surgical approach, consisting of wide local or wide radical excisions, is necessary to reduce complications as lymphedema or sexual disfunction. The optimal surgical management of vulvar cancer needs to consider dimensions, staging, depth of invasion, presence of carcinoma at the surgical margins of resection and grading, with the goal of making the treatment as individualized as possible.

TI  - Coseismic and Early Postseismic Slip Models of the 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo Earthquake (Western China) Estimated by Space-Based Geodetic Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The May 22nd, 2021, Mw ${\mathrm{M}}_{\mathrm{w}}$ 7.4 Maduo earthquake occurred on an intraplate fault of Bayan-Har block in the Tibet Plateau. Here, we derive the coseismic and early postseismic surface deformations from the Sentinel-1 (S1) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. We use the subpixel offsets of SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical images to determine the surface rupture traces. The fault geometry and coseismic fault slip distribution of multi-segmented ruptures are estimated by inverting InSAR interferograms and SAR pixel offsets. We show that at least five fault segments with curved geometry are activated, with a peak coseismic slip of about 5 m. The geodetic data inversion suggests that an NW-striking blind segment near the Eling Lake may have ruptured during the 2021 event. Postseismic slip inversion with the 60-day cumulative line-of-sight deformations, shows that the early afterslip of 0.1 similar to 0.3 m occurred mostly toward the downdip direction of the main coseismic slip asperities. The afterslip geodetic moment accounts for approximately 15.3% of the coseismic one. Coulomb stress analysis shows that the nucleation of the Maduo earthquake is partially facilitated by the 1947 M7.7 Dari earthquake.

TI  - Predictors of uncommon location of sentinel nodes in endometrial and cervical cancers
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel node mapping is widely used in the treatment of gynecologic cancers. The current study aimed to identify predictors of uncommon sentinel lymph node (SLN) locations.Methods: The current study included women who were operated for endometrial or cervical cancer with attempted sentinel lymph node mapping during surgical staging. Data were collected from electronic charts. The pelvis and the external ilia and obturator basins were common node locations. Para-aortic, pre-sacral, common iliac, internal iliac, and parametrial nodes were considered uncommon locations. We conducted analyses stratified according to common, uncommon, and very uncommon (para-aortic, pre-sacral, parametrial) node location sites.Results: A total of 304 women were enrolled in the current study; 15.8% had SLN in uncommon locations and 4.3% had very uncommon node locations. Body mass index (BMI) was a negative predictor for uncommon SLN locations (OR 0.88, p = 0.03). The use of either indocyanine green (ICG) or Tc99 & blue dye was an independent predictor for uncommon SLN locations (OR 8.24, p = 0.006). More recent surgeries and the presence of positive nodes were independent predictors for very uncommon node locations (OR 2.13, p = 0.011, and OR 9.3, p = 0.002, respectively).Conclusions: BMI, tracer type, surgical year, and positive nodes were independent predictors for uncommon SLN locations. These findings suggest that surgical effort, technique and experience may result in better identification of uncommon SLN locations.

TI  - Space-time evolution of land subsidence in the National Capital Region of India using ALOS-1 and Sentinel-1 SAR data: Evidence for groundwater overexploitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence due to groundwater extraction is increasingly becoming a major scientific and societal issue. In this study, ALOS-1 (2007-10) and Sentinel-1 (Nov.2014-19) datasets are utilized to compute vertical land subsidence in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. Two major subsidence zones located in Dwarka (12 km2) and Gurgaon (1 km2) area, showing subsidence rate up to 6.0 cm/year, are observed during 2007-10. Between Nov.2014-19, while a substantial reduction in the size (by - 6 km2) and subsidence rate (by - 3 cm/ year) is observed for the zone in Dwarka, significant enlargement (by - 11 km2) and enhanced subsidence rate (by 5 cm/year) are observed for the zone in Gurgaon. An emerging subsidence zone (4. 5 km2) subsiding at 3.6 cm/year is also detected in the Faridabad area. The deceleration of subsidence in the Dwarka area is due to stabilization of groundwater level post-2014. Residual compaction of the aquifer system in the Dwarka area halted after Sept. 2016, and at present, it shows elastic deformation. In Gurgaon and Faridabad, dominantly negative linear trends in vertical displacement, lack of seasonal signals, and ongoing groundwater depletion indicate continuous inelastic deformation of the aquifer system. The preferential disposition of subsidence zones on the western part of Delhi ridge indicates a dominantly confined aquifer system and aquifer compartmentalization by the Delhi ridge. Results presented here demonstrate that precise subsidence monitoring is vital to identify hotspots of groundwater exploitation, analyze aquifer characteristics at higher resolution and prepare precautionary and mitigatory measures for impending groundwater-related hazards.

TI  - Detection of melanoma, breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer sentinel lymph nodes by Tc-99m Tilmanocept (Lymphoseek (R))
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Technetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept or Lymphoseek (R) (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio) is a soluble, synthetic molecule with a small diameter (7 nm), which is comprised of technetium-99m chelated to a dextran backbone containing multiple units of mannose ligands with a high affinity for CD206, a receptor located on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells that are found in high concentration in lymph nodes. It enables quick transit from the injection site and rapid lymph node accumulation. The binding of mannose ligand and CD206 results in the internalization of the ligand and receptor into the cell. Once the Technetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept (Lymphoseek (R)) reaches the lymph node, it is readily internalized by the macrophages and dendritic cells within the draining lymph nodes. Technetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept (Lymphoseek (R)) has been extensively studied as a radioisotope for detection of sentinel lymph nodes in melanoma, breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in clinical trials. Based on its safety and ability to detect sentinel lymph nodes satisfactorily, it has been approved by the FDA to use as a radioisotope for preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for identification of sentinel lymph nodes in these types of cancer. Further, the FDA has expanded approval of Technetium-99m-labeled for sentinel lymph node mapping of all solid tumors as well as in pediatric patients.

TI  - Within-patient comparison between [<SUP>68</SUP>Ga]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy and [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-tilmanocept lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node detection in oral cancer: a pilot study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To compare sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification using [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy to [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept lymphoscintigraphy (including SPECT/CT) in early-stage oral cancer. Furthermore, to assess whether reliable intraoperative SLN localization can be performed with a conventional portable gamma-probe using [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept without the interference of [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept in these patients.Methods This prospective within-patient comparison pilot study evaluated SLN identification by [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy compared to conventional lymphoscintigraphy using [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept (similar to 74 MBq) in 10 early-stage oral cancer patients scheduled for SLN biopsy. After conventional [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept lymphoscintigraphy, patients underwent peritumoral administration of [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept (similar to 10 MBq) followed by PET/CT acquisition initiated 15 min after injection. Intraoperative SLN localization was performed under conventional portable gamma-probe guidance the next day; the location of harvested SLNs was correlated to both lymphoscintigraphic images in each patient.Results A total of 24 SLNs were identified by [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept lymphoscintigraphy, all except one were also identified by [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy. [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy identified 4 additional SLNs near the injection site, of which two harbored metastases. Lymphatic vessels transporting [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept were identified by PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy in 80% of patients, while draining lymphatic vessels were visualized by [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept lymphoscintigraphy in 20% of patients. Of the 33 SLNs identified by [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy, 30 (91%) were intraoperatively localized under conventional gamma-probe guidance.Conclusion [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy provided more accurate identification of SLNs and improved visualization of lymphatic vessels compared to [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept lymphoscintigraphy. When combined with peritumoral administration of [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept, SLNs detected by [Ga-68]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy can be reliably localized during surgery under conventional gamma-probe guidance.

TI  - Dust storm simulation over the Sahara Desert (Moroccan and Mauritanian regions) using HYSPLIT
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Saharan dust storms are major events that occur normally in the summer and affect the air quality in various regions of the world. In particular, Saharan regions in Morocco and Mauritania actively contribute to dust storms. The Saharan outbreak that took place between 14 and 19 of June 2020 was one of the most severe Saharan dust storms in recent years. This paper investigates the PM10 emissions and concentrations during the 4 days of the dust storm in the region of Western Sahara of Morocco and Mauritania and the transport of the PM10 from the area of study to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico using Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) software with PM10 emission model and cluster analysis. We also analyse the effect of the transported PM10 particles on the concentration level in the Southern parts of the United States and the Martinique islands. The results showed that the average PM10 concentration below the altitude of 100 m during the dust storm was higher than 100 mu g/m(3) in most of the regions such as Dakhla in Morocco, Nouakchott, Adrar and Tiris Zemmour in Mauritania. This is confirmed by Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values between 0.7 and 1 retrieved by MODIS-Aqua for those areas. Furthermore, PM10 particles transported across the Atlantic Ocean affected the concentrations observed in the Caribbean Basin, where hourly PM10 reached 372 mu g/m(3) and the dust top layer was found between 4 and 4.5 km above ground level. In addition, HYSPLIT cluster analysis results revealed several PM10 particle source areas in Western Sahara such as Bir Anzerane in Morocco, Nouakchott and Tichit in Mauritania that contributed to the increase of PM10 concentrations to an Unhealthy level in the Texas and Florida States in the United States.

TI  - Emerging Trends in Arctic Solar Absorption
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent satellite observations confirm that the Arctic is absorbing more solar radiation now than at the start of this century in response to declining Arctic sea ice and snow covers. Trends in the solar radiation input to Arctic ocean and land surfaces now each exceed interannual variability at the 95% confidence level, although all-sky trends have taken 20%-40% longer to emerge compared to clear-sky conditions. Clouds reduce mean solar absorption and secular trends over both land and ocean, but the effect of clouds on natural variability depends on the underlying surface. While clouds increase the time needed to unambiguously identify trends in nearly all Arctic regions, their masking effects are strongest over oceans. Clouds have extended the time to emergence of already observed clear-sky trends beyond the existing 21 years Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System record in half of eight Arctic seas, supporting the need for continued satellite-based radiative flux observations over the Arctic.

TI  - Regional matters: On the usefulness of regional land-cover datasets in times of global change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Unprecedented amounts of analysis-ready Earth Observation (EO) data, combined with increasing computational power and new algorithms, offer novel opportunities for analysing ecosystem dynamics across large geographic extents, and to support conservation planning and action. Much research effort has gone into developing global EO-based land-cover and land-use datasets, including tree cover, crop types, and surface water dynamics. Yet there are inherent trade-offs between regional and global EO products pertaining to class legends, availability of training/validation data, and accuracy. Acknowledging and understanding these trade-offs is paramount for both developing EO products and for answering science questions relevant for ecology or conservation studies based on these data. Here we provide context on the development of global EO-based land-cover and land-use datasets, and outline advantages and disadvantages of both regional and global datasets. We argue that both types of EO-derived land-cover datasets can be preferable, with regional data providing the context-specificity that is often required for policy making and implementation (e.g., land-use and management, conservation planning, payment schemes for ecosystem services), making use of regional knowledge, particularly important when moving from land cover to actors. Ensuring that global and regional land-cover and land-use products derived based on EO data are compatible and nested, both in terms of class legends and accuracy assessment, should be a key consideration when developing such data. Open access high-quality training and validation data derived as part of such efforts are of utmost importance. Likewise, global efforts to generate sets of essential variables for climate change, biodiversity, or eventually land use, which often require land-cover maps as inputs, should consider regionalized, hierarchical approaches to not sacrifice regional context. Global change impacts manifest in regions, and so must the policy and planning responses to these challenges. EO data should embrace that regions matter, perhaps more than ever, in an age of global data availability and processing.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of ecological environment quality in arid areas based on the remote sensing ecological distance index: A case study of Yuyang district in Yulin city, China
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological environment in arid areas of Northwest China has undergone considerable changes under the combined effects of climate change and human factors. Therefore, exploring the spatial and temporal evolution of the ecological environment quality is of great significance for the protection and management of the ecological environment in arid areas of Northwest China. This study adopted Yuyang district as the study area. Landsat Thematic Mapper/Operational Land Imager images from 1993 to 2018 were selected as the data source for the retrieval of important surface indicators and the construction of the remote sensing distance ecological index. The spatial distribution, trend, and grade classification of the ecological environment quality were monitored and analyzed. The results showed that (1) the ecological environment quality of Yuyang district from 1993 to 2018 showed an overall upward trend, mainly manifested as a sharp decline in the area of poor ecological environment from 84.81 to 53.36%. (2) The spatiotemporal changes in the ecological environment quality showed a downward trend in the central urban area and an upward trend in the noncentral urban area. (3) In general, rainfall and temperature had limited impact on the ecological environment quality. Urbanization seriously affected the local ecological environment quality and the implementation of the ecological restoration policies, regulations, and measures were the main drivers of the improvement to the ecological environment quality in other surrounding areas.

TI  - Mass transfer and tidally tilted pulsation in the Algol-type system TZ Dra
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oscillating eclipsing Algols (oEAs) are remarkable systems that allow us to determine accurate fundamental stellar parameters (mass, radius) and probe the stellar interiors through pulsations. TZDra is an oEA system containing a delta Scuti component. To examine particular characteristics of such close systems including pulsations and mass transfer, we present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic study of TZDra. With the analysis of high-resolution spectra, the orbital parameters were determined by the radial velocity analysis and the atmospheric parameters were derived for the primary component. The binary modelling and the pulsational frequency analysis was carried out using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data set. The H alpha line profiles show the signature of mass transfer from the cool to the hot binary component. The conclusion of mass transfer/mass-loss in the system was supported by the analysis of the orbital period changes. As a result, it was found that there is 3.52 x 10(-9) M-circle dot yr(-1) mass-loss from the system most probably through the hotspot and stellar winds. Additionally, most pulsation frequencies originating from the primary component were found to be spaced by harmonics of the orbital frequencies in particular, 12 doublets spaced by 2f(orb) were detected from which we infer that this star is a tidally tilted pulsator. A mean p-mode frequency spacing of approximate to 7.2 d(-1) was found as well.

TI  - Long-term oncological safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer: A post-hoc analysis of SENTICOL I and SENTICOL II cohorts
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To compare oncologic outcomes of patients with early-stage cervical cancer and negative nodes who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone (SLNB) versus pelvic lymphadenectomy (PL).Methods: An ancillary analysis of two prospective multicentric trials on SLN biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I and II) was conducted. Only patients with early-stage cervical cancer (IA to IIA FIGO stage), bilateral detection of SLN, negative SLN after ultrastaging and negative non-SLN after final pathologic examination were included. Risk-factors of recurrence and disease-specific mortality were determined by Cox proportional hazard models.Results: Between January 2005 and July 2012, 259 node-negative patients were analyzed: 87 in the SLNB group and 172 in the PL group. The median follow-up was 47 months [4-127]. During the follow-up, 21 patients (8.1%) experienced recurrences, including 4 nodal recurrences (1.9%), and 9 patients (3.5%) died of cervical cancer. Disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were similar between SLNB and PL groups, 85.1% vs. 80.4%, p = 0.24 and 90.8% vs. 97.2%, p = 0.22 respectively. By Cox multivariate analysis, SLNB compared to PL was not associated with DFS (HR = 1.78, 95%CI = [0.71-4.46], p = 0.22) neither with DSS (HR = 3.02, 95%CI = [0.69-13.18], p = 0.14). Only pathologic risk level according to the Sedlis criteria was an independent predictor of DFS and DSS.Conclusions: Omitting full pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with bilateral negative SLN does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of recurrence in this series. Survival non-inferiority needs to be confirmed by prospective trials. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Challenges in lower limb lymphoedema assessment based on limb volume change: Lessons learnt from the SENTIX prospective multicentre study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Lower limb lymphoedema (LLL) is the most disabling adverse effect of surgical staging of pelvic lymph nodes. However, the lack of standardisation of volumetric LLL assessment hinders direct comparison between the studies and makes LLL reporting unreliable. The aim of our study is to report outcomes from a prospective trial that have implications for LLL assessment standardisation.Methods. In the prospective international multicentre trial SENTIX, a group of 150 patients with stage IA1-IB2 cervical cancer treated by uterine surgery with bilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy was prospectively evaluated by objective LLL assessment, based on limb volume change (LVC) using circumferrential limb measurements and subjective patient-reported swelling. The assessments were conducted in six-month periods over 24 months post-surgery.Results. Patient LVC substantially fluctuated in both positive and negative directions, which were comparable in frequency up to +/- 14% change. Thirty-eight patients experienced persistent LVC increase >10% classified as LLL, with nine months median time to onset. Some 34.2% of cases experienced onset later than one year after the surgery. Thirty-three patients (22%) experienced transient oedema characterised as LVC >10%, which resolved without intervention between two consequent follow-up visits. No significant correlation between LVC >10% and a patient-reported swelling was observed.Conclusions. Given that we observed comparable fluctuations of the the lower-limb volumes after surgical treatment of cervical cancer in both positive and negative direction up to +/- 14%, the diagnostic threshold for LLL diagnosis based on LVC should be increased to >15% LVC. The distinction of transient oedema from persistent LLL requires repeated measurements. Also, as one-third of LLL cases are diagnosed >1-year post-surgery, a sufficient follow-up duration needs to be ensured. Patient-reported swelling correlated poorly with LVC and should only be used as an adjunct to objective LLL assessment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization and assessment of flood inundated areas of lower Brahmaputra River Basin using multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar data: A case study from NE India
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are known to be one of the greatest disasters in documented human history. In the Indian subcontinent, the Ganga-Brahmaputra plains annually accommodate monsoon-driven flooding of the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, causing widespread flood inundation and geomorphic changes. In the present study, we present flood inundation maps of Assam and suggest a possible geomorphic explanation for the frequent flood inundation areas. We have used a novel SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)-based approach for a comprehensive flood inundation mapping of Assam. The Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based data computing and analysis platform, is used to access and analyse the Sentinel SAR 1 GRD datasets for 30 events from 2018 to 2020. The Sentinel-2 imagery, WWF Hydrosheds, 90 m DEM (SRTM), and JRC Global Surface Water Dataset are also used to conduct the flood inundation mapping for 80,236 (1 x 1 km) grids in Assam and morphometric analysis in the lower Brahmaputra River Basin. We also carried out detailed mapping and geomorphic analysis on channel and sediment bar area and channel width in 100 (6.25 km wide) grids on the Brahmaputra River in Assam. Our results suggest that high flood inundation areas are well scattered in Assam, and Lakhimpur, Nagaon, Sibsagar, Sonitpur, and Barpeta are the most affected districts from 2018 to 2020. We also observe that the geomorphology can act as primary control over the frequent flood inundation in highlighted areas in Assam. On a basin scale, we recognize a low correlation between the stream power index, topographic wetness index, plan curvature, slope, and flood inundated areas, mainly due to the coarse resolution of the digital elevation model. In a braided river system like the Brahmaputra River, the channel and bar area and channel width are well correlated during flood events. Finally, the channel sinuosity also controls channel and bar area and width during regular and influential flood events.

TI  - Seasonal Variability in Local Carbon Dioxide Biomass Burning Sources Over Central and Eastern US Using Airborne In Situ Enhancement Ratios
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present observations of local enhancements in carbon dioxide (CO2) from local emissions sources over three eastern US regions during four deployments of the Atmospheric Carbon Transport-America (ACT-America) campaign between summer 2016 and spring 2018. Local CO2 emissions were characterized by carbon monoxide (CO) to CO2 enhancement ratios (i.e., Delta CO/Delta CO2) in air mass mixing observed during aircraft transects within the planetary boundary layer. By analyzing regional-scale variability of CO2 enhancements as a function of Delta CO/Delta CO2 enhancement ratios, observed relative contributions to CO2 emissions were separated into fossil fuel and biomass burning (BB) regimes across regions and seasons. CO2 emission contributions attributed to biomass burning (Delta CO/Delta CO2 > 4%) were negligible during summer and fall in all regions but climbed to similar to 9%-11% of observed combustion contributions in the South during winter and spring. Relative CO2 fire emission trends matched observed winter and spring BB contributions, but conflictingly predicted similar levels of BB during the fall. Satellite fire data from MODIS and VIIRS suggested the use of higher spatial resolution fire data that might improve modeled BB emissions but were not able to explain the bulk of the discrepancy.

TI  - An integrated assessment of the Good Environmental Status of Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Local, regional and global targets have been set to halt marine biodiversity loss. Europe has set its own policy targets to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) of marine ecosystems by implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) across member states. We combined an extensive dataset across five Mediterranean ecoregions including 26 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), their reference unprotected areas, and a no-trawl case study. Our aim was to assess if MPAs reach GES, if their effects are local or can be detected at ecoregion level or up to a Mediterranean scale, and which are the ecosystem components driving GES achievement. This was undertaken by using the analytical tool NEAT (Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool), which allows an integrated assessment of the status of marine systems. We adopted an ecosystem approach by integrating data from several ecosystem components: the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, macroalgae, sea urchins and fish. Thresholds to define the GES were set by dedicated workshops and literature review. In the Western Mediterranean, most MPAs are in good/high status, with P. oceanica and fish driving this result within MPAs. However, GES is achieved only at a local level, and the Mediterranean Sea, as a whole, results in a moderate environmental status. Macroalgal forests are overall in bad condition, confirming their status at risk. The results are significantly affected by the assumption that discrete observations over small spatial scales are representative of the total extension investigated. This calls for large-scale, dedicated assessments to realistically detect environmental status changes under different conditions. Understanding MPAs effectiveness in reaching GES is crucial to assess their role as sentinel observatories of marine systems. MPAs and trawling bans can locally contribute to the attainment of GES and to the fulfillment of the MSFD objectives. Building confidence in setting thresholds between GES and non-GES, investing in long-term monitoring, increasing the spatial extent of sampling areas, rethinking and broadening the scope of complementary tools of protection (e.g., Natura 2000 Sites), are indicated as solutions to ameliorate the status of the basin.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for stage II endometrial cancer: Recent utilization and outcome in the United States
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine trends and outcomes related to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for stage II endometrial cancer.Methods: This is a retrospective observational cohort study querying the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. The study population was 6,314 women with T2 endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy from 2010-2018. Exposure allocation was based on nodal evaluation type: lymphadenectomy (LND; n=4,915, 77.8%), SLN biopsy (n=340, 5.4%), or no surgical nodal evaluation (n=1,059, 16.8%). The main outcomes were (i) trends and characteristics related to nodal evaluation assessed by multinomial regression, and (ii) overall survival (OS) assessed by an inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine concurrent LND in women who underwent SLN biopsy.Results: The utilization of SLN biopsy increased from 1.6% to 16.1%, while the number of LND decreased from 81.5% to 65.7% between 2010-2018 (P<0.05). In multivariable analysis, the utilization of SLN biopsy increased 45% annually (adjusted-odds ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-1.54, P<0.001). The frequency of SLN biopsy alone exceeded the frequency of SLN biopsy with concurrent LND in 2017 (6.8% versus 3.4%), followed by continued increase in SLN biopsy alone (11.2% versus 4.9%) in 2018. In the weighted model, the 3-year OS rate was 79.9% for the SLN biopsy group and 78.6% for the LND group (hazard ratio 0.98, 95%Cl 0.80-1.20, P=0.831). Similarly, the SLN biopsy alone without concurrent LND had comparable OS compared to the LND group (hazard ratio 0.90, 95%CI 0.59-1.36, P=0.615).Conclusion: Utilization of SLN biopsy in stage II endometrial cancer increased significantly over time, and SLN biopsy-incorporated nodal assessment was not associated with worsened short-term survival outcome.

TI  - The Simultaneous Presence of Isolated Tumour Cells and Bone Marrow Micrometastases in Stage I and II Colon Cancer-Challenging the Theory of a Chronological Pathway of Tumour Cell Dissemination
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background According to the common tenet, tumour progression is a chronological process starting with lymphatic invasion. In this respect, the meaning of bone marrow micrometastases (BMM) in patients with lymph node negative colon cancer (CC) is unclear. This study examines the relationship of isolated tumour cells (ITC) in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and BMM in patients in early CC. Methods BM aspirates were taken from both pelvic crests and in vivo SLN mapping was done during open oncologic colon resection in patients with stage I and II CC. Stainings were performed with the pancytokeratin markers A45-B/B3 and AE1/AE3 as well as H&E. The correlation between the occurrence of ITC+ and BMM+ and their effects on survival was examined using Cox regression analysis. Results In a total of 78 patients with stage I and II CC, 11 patients (14%) were ITC+, 29 patients (37%) BMM+. Of these patients, only two demonstrated simultaneous ITC+ /BMM+. The occurrence of BMM+ was neither associated with ITC+ in standard correlation (kappa = - 0.13 [95% confidence interval [CI] = - 0.4-0.14], p = 0.342) nor univariate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.39, 95%CI:0.07-1.50, p = 0.180) or multivariate (OR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.09-2.95, p = 0.519) analyses. Combined detection of ITC+ /BMM+ demonstrated the poorest overall (HR = 61.60, 95%CI:17.69-214.52, p = 0.032) and recurrence free survival (HR = 61.60, 95%CI: 17.69-214.5, p = 0.032). Conclusions These results indicate that simultaneous and not interdependent presence of very early lymphatic and haematologic tumour spread may be considered as a relevant prognostic risk factor for patients with stage I and II CC, thereby suggesting the possible need to reconsider the common assumptions on tumour spread proposed by the prevalent theory of sequential tumour progression.

TI  - Relative contributions of temperature and salinity to steric sea level over the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative contributions of surface temperature and salinity to steric sea-level variations are investigated using satellite observations and reanalysis datasets. By defining a contribution factor, the relative roles of thermal and haline steric height variations are quantified over the South China Sea (SCS). The thermosteric height dominates the steric sea level variation in the northern SCS deep basin, while the contribution of the halosteric height increases southward. Further investigation reveals that this transition is related to the meridional imbalance of surface heat flux and precipitation variations. The revealed steric constitution distribution is not confined to the surface but extends within the upper layer to approximately 50m depth, and then the thermosteric component dominates from the depth underneath. The results of this study clarify the steric sea level constitution over the SCS, benefit the understanding of sea-level variations at the regional scale, and may further facilitate multisensor remote sensing data mining studies.

TI  - Designing an Efficient Emergency Response Airborne Mapping System with Multiple Sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource remote sensing data have been extensively used in disaster and emergency response management. Different types of visual and measured data, such as high-resolution orthoimages, real-time videos, accurate digital elevation models, and three-dimensional landscape maps, can enable producing effective rescue plans and aid the efficient dispatching of rescuers after disasters. Generally, such data are acquired using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with multiple sensors. For typical application scenarios, efficient and real-time access to data is more important in emergency response cases than in traditional application scenarios. In this study, an efficient emergency response airborne mapping system equipped with multiple sensors was designed. The system comprises groups of wide-angle cameras, a high-definition video camera, an infrared video camera, a LiDAR system, and a global navigation satellite system/inertial measurement unit. The wide-angle cameras had a visual field of 85 degrees x 105 degrees, facilitating the efficient operation of the mapping system. Numerous calibrations were performed on the constructed mapping system. In particular, initial calibration and self-calibration were performed to determine the relative pose between different wide-angle cameras to fuse all the acquired images. The mapping system was then tested in an area with altitudes of 1000 m-1250 m. The biases of the wide-angle cameras were small bias values (0.090 m, -0.018 m, and - 0.046m in the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively). Moreover, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) along the planer direction was smaller than that along the vertical direction (0.202 and 0.294 m, respectively). The LiDAR system achieved smaller biases (0.117, -0.020, and -0.039m in the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively) and a smaller RMSE in the vertical direction (0.192 m) than the wide-angle cameras; however, RMSE of the LiDAR system along the planar direction (0.276 m) was slightly larger. The proposed system shows potential for use in emergency response systems for efficiently acquiring data such as images and point clouds.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Syndromic surveillance systems monitor disease indicators to detect emergence of diseases and track their progression. Here, we report on a rapidly deployed active syndromic surveillance system for tracking COVID-19 in Israel. The system was a novel combination of active and passive components: Ads were shown to people searching for COVID-19 symptoms on the Google search engine. Those who clicked on the ads were referred to a chat bot which helped them decide whether they needed urgent medical care. Through its conversion optimization mechanism, the ad system was guided to focus on those people who required such care. Over 6 months, the ads were shown approximately 214,000 times and clicked on 12,000 times, and 722 people were informed they needed urgent care. Click rates on ads and the fraction of people deemed to require urgent care were correlated with the hospitalization rate (R-2 = 0.54 and R-2 = 0.50, respectively) with a lead time of 9 days. Males and younger people were more likely to use the system, and younger people were more likely to be determined to require urgent care (slope: - 0.009, P = 0.01). Thus, the system can assist in predicting case numbers and hospital load at a significant lead time and, simultaneously, help people determine if they need medical care.

TI  - Psychological perceptions and voluntary protective behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic in China: the roles of cultural worldview
T2  - HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The public's voluntary adoption of protective actions is key in risk management, especially when strict regulations no longer apply. This research uses a nationwide sample to understand how cultural worldview influences public adoption of four protective actions against the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) following the end of the first lockdown in China. Relying on Grid-Group Cultural Theory of risk and the Protective Action Decision Model, this research finds that cultural worldview rarely influences protective behaviors directly. However, mediational analyses reveal that cultural worldview can influence protective behaviors via protective action perception and trust in stakeholders but not via risk perception. This research finds that protective action perception and trust in stakeholders increase protective behaviors and the positive correlation between trust in stakeholders and protective behaviors is mediated by protective action perception. Moreover, hierarchy increases protective action perception and trust in stakeholders, individualism increases protective action perception but decreases trust in stakeholders, and fatalism decreases protective action perception. Other correlations of cultural worldview with protective action perception and trust in stakeholders vary with types of protective actions. These findings provide implications for behavioral governance and risk communication among diverse cultural groups.

TI  - Freeze/thaw onset detection combining SMAP and ASCAT data over Alaska: A machine learning approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, permafrost degrades gradually. To cope with the instability of the cryosphere, it is very important to strengthen the monitoring of the seasonal freeze-thaw cycle. At present, active and passive microwave remote sensing data are widely used in freeze/thaw (F/T) onset detection. There is some potential to improve accuracy through the combination of active and passive microwave data. Compared with the traditional method for combination, the machine learning algorithm has a stronger nonlinear expression ability. Therefore, it is advisable to use machine learning to combine multi-source data for freeze/thaw onset detection. In this study, the temporal change detection method is applied to SMAP data and ASCAT data respectively for preliminary detection. Then the Random Forest algorithm (RF) is used to combine the preliminary results of active and passive microwave data with site observation to estimate the freeze/thaw onsets more accurately. The method is validated with data obtained in Alaska from 2015 to 2019. The accuracy evaluation shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of freeze/thaw onset detection. The predicted distribution of the freeze/thaw cycle indicates that the variation of the freeze-thaw cycle is closely related to latitude. In general, the proposed method based on machine learning is promising in the research of freeze-thaw state monitoring.

TI  - Exploring the utility of Sentinel-2 for estimating maize chlorophyll content and leaf area index across different growth stages
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the utility of Sentinel-2 spectral data for estimating leaf area index (LAI), leaf and canopy chlorophyll content of maize at different growth stages. Vegetation indices based on the visible-near infrared and red-edge regions of the spectrum were computed from Sentinel-2 imagery acquired within one or two days of field data collection. Results showed that green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) and red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge), using the red-edge variant centred at 705 nm, consistently showed higher relationship to maize LAI with r(2) of 0.65 and 0.63 during the early stages of growth, respectively, and an r(2) of 0.79 and 0.81 during tassel stage, respectively. Regarding canopy chlorophyll content the results indicated the spectral advantage of the Sentinel-2 sensor with the presence of two red-edge bands for continuous monitoring of maize chlorophyll content. Overall, the results indicated that maize biophysical variables can be monitored at satellite level using Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - UCL: Unsupervised Curriculum Learning for water body classification from remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based Unsupervised Curriculum Learning approach for the recognition of water bodies to overcome the stated challenges for remote sensing based RGB imagery. The unsupervised nature of the presented algorithm eliminates the need for labelled training data. The problem is cast as a two class clustering problem (water and non-water), while clustering is done on deep features obtained by a pre-trained CNN. After initial clusters have been identified, representative samples from each cluster are chosen by the unsupervised curriculum learning algorithm for fine-tuning the feature extractor. The stated process is repeated iteratively until convergence. Three datasets have been used to evaluate the approach and show its effectiveness on varying scales: (i) SAT-6 dataset comprising high resolution aircraft images, (ii) Sentinel-2 of EuroSAT, comprising remote sensing images with low resolution, and (iii) PakSAT, a new dataset we created for this study. PakSAT is the first Pakistani Sentinel-2 dataset designed to classify water bodies of Pakistan. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the progressive learning behaviour of UCL and reported promising results of water classification on all three datasets. The obtained accuracies outperform the supervised methods in domain adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

M3  - Article
AB  - With limited natural resources in Nile Valley and Delta, reclamation of new lands is needed. The investigated farm is one of the old reclaimed areas in the eastern Nile Delta, covering 140.73 km(2). The main objectives of this research are; 1) assessing the vegetated areas using the normalized difference vegetation index and maximum likelihood classifier on multi-temporal remotely sensed data of 1978, 1984, 1994, 2004, 2014, and 2018, 2) detecting the changes in the vegetated areas over the assigned dates, and 3) evaluating the soil quality index (SQI) based on soil parameters (salinity, pH, sodium adsorption ratio, and organic matter) for the dominant cultivated crops in the study area. Eighty soil samples, at different depths, from 35 locations, were checked. The results reveal that the reclamation processes had been established in the 1980s using pivots irrigation system. In 2018, the vegetated area covered 73% of the study area, compared to 0% in 1978. High SQI is observed at a range of 0.8 to 0.9 that covers 75% to 93% of the study area. The results of this research can assess the decision-makers for more sustainable management plans in the study area and the Mediterranean region that share the same circumstances.

TI  - Assessing the efficiency of mitigation measures to reduce groundwater depletion and related land subsidence in Quer′etaro (Central Mexico) from decadal InSAR observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater overexploitation occurs throughout Central Mexico and is a major threat to the sustainable development of the region. The two most direct impacts are on groundwater/surface water interactions and uneven land subsidence causing ground fracturing. The latter implies frequent and costly repairs to linear urban infrastructure such as roads or water/gas distribution conduits. In 2011, the state of Quere ' taro drastically changed the water management scheme to solve the groundwater depletion and ground fracturing issues in the Quere ' taro Valley. Groundwater extraction was decreased by half and the missing portion was replaced by water imports transported through a major 123 km-long aqueduct infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate if this change in the water sourcing strategy has helped reducing groundwater overexploitation and the related ground fissuring. We present four consecutive radar interferometry-derived ground deformation time-series covering-75% of the period 2004-2020. We observed that maximum ground deformation has drastically decreased by a factor of-5 after 2011, from-25 to-50 mm/yr to--10 mm/yr, suggesting the effectiveness of the drastic water management change. However, while groundwater static pressure has recovered in the range [4, 10] m in the six years following the change, extraction has been constantly increasing. Interferometric observations based on Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 data, in 2013-2014 and 2017-2020 respectively, detect increasing subsidence rates up to--15 mm/yr. This suggests that the water management change only reduced the problem, and that a longer-term strategy will have to be implemented to fulfill the ever-increasing water demand in the region.

TI  - Deformation monitoring and thematic mapping of the Badaling Great Wall using very high-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The preventive monitoring and sustainable conservation of large-scale cultural heritage sites require satellitebased Earth observations. In this study, we present the first monitoring and thematic mapping results of the Badaling Great Wall (Beijing, China) using deformation indicators calculated from very high-resolution (VHR) multi-temporal spotlight TerraSAR-X data. The proposed coarse-fine search algorithm achieved high computational efficiency for calculating the unknown parameters of the two-tier network persistent scatterer synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (PSInSAR) approach. The spatiotemporal deformation anomalies, characterized by the absolute velocity, deformation deviation and acceleration, are informative to identify suspected hotspots for prioritizing monitoring activities. We provide an understandable method for thematic mapping and subsequent sustainable conservation of heritage sites by synergistically exploiting impacts from natural degradation and the tourism industry. We determine that the optimum tourist capacity of the site could be 1.0 million per month based on comparing pre- and post-COVID data (2019-2020). This study demonstrates the potential and performance of spaceborne PSInSAR tools for the intelligent management of large-scale architectural heritage sites by integrating InSAR deformation products with environmental and social data.

TI  - Calving cycle of Ninnis Glacier over the last 60 years
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Iceberg calving is one of the contributing ways for the mass loss from ice shelves in Antarctica; the calving cycles of most ice shelves are quite long. The mechanism of iceberg calving has not been well investigated because of the limited temporal coverage of satellite observations. The Ninnis Glacier (NG) has experienced three calving events in the past 60 years (1980-1982, 1998, and 2018), which provides an opportunity to capture the long-term pattern of calving for the first time. In our study, ARGON, Landsat, and ERS-2 images were combined with field measurements to characterize the evolution of the Ninnis Glacier, especially for the last calving event, which can be studied using high-quality observations. The time span was over 23 years for the 1st calving cycle and the average time span was similar to 18.5 years for each of the last two cycles. Supported by satellite-derived strain rates and ocean currents obtained from a numerical ocean model, we conclude that the calving of the Ninnis Glacier Tongue (NGT) was driven by the continuous impact of ocean current on the advected glacier tongue. According to a comparison among the three calving events, the calving area of the last calving event was similar to 750 km(2), only half of the 1st calving event, with breaking locations closer to the grounding line. We attribute these changes to the reduction of fast ice in this region, which can be related to the local oceanographic conditions.

TI  - A multi-sensor approach for characterising human-made structures by estimating area, volume and population based on sentinel data and deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several global and regional efforts have been undertaken to map human-made settlements and their characteristics, including building material, area, volume, and population. However, given the unprecedented amount of Earth observation data and processing power available, there is a timely need for developing novel approaches for mapping these characteristics at higher spatial and temporal resolution. Such information is key to effectively answering questions related to population growth, pollution, disaster management, risk assessments, spatial planning, and even generating business cases in peri-urban and rural areas. While such data is available from mapping agencies or commercial companies in some countries, there are many countries where this is not the case. The main objective of this study is to propose an Inception-ResNet inspired deep learning approach to estimate the characteristics and location of human-made structures, including estimates of population, based on Earth observation data from the Copernicus Programme. The study investigates the effects on prediction accuracy using data from different orbital directions and interferometric coherence from Sentinel 1 data and different band combinations of Sentinel 2 data as model input variables. The model is trained and evaluated on a nationwide Danish case study, where the national mapping agency provides high-quality open data on humanmade structures, which serves as the ground truth data for the study. Our findings reveal that it is possible to design models that, on average, perform within 2.6% total absolute percentage error for area predictions, 7.7% for volume and 17% for population at 10 by 10 m scale using only Copernicus data and deep learning models. The models achieved 98.68% binary accuracy for extracting structural area when all test sites were merged. Combining Sentinel 1 and 2 input variables yielded the best results, while adding interferometric coherence did not significantly improve accuracy. Furthermore, including data from both orbital directions of the Sentinel 1 constellation significantly improved model performance.

TI  - A reference data framework for the application of satellite time series to monitor forest disturbance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive and robust estimations of forest disturbance over time are lacking in many parts of the world. In recent years, Landsat satellite data has been used extensively to retrospectively map forest disturbance across several decades. Human interpretation of Landsat time series, in association with ancillary data, has emerged as an effective and affordable way to collect reference data, which is often used to calibrate and validate disturbance models. If the reference data is collected using a robust probability sampling protocol, estimates of disturbance can be derived directly from the reference dataset using simple calculations. In this paper, we present the results of a reference data project in New South Wales, Australia, undertaken to characterise three decades of canopy disturbance across 13 Mha of predominantly native eucalypt forests. Our results indicate that disturbance is a frequent occurrence, with 70% of the forest disturbed during the last 33 years and around 35% experiencing two or more disturbances. The most common disturbance agent was wildfire, however, most wildfire disturbance occurred in few years, with over 4 Mha burnt in 2019-20 alone. The second most common disturbance agent was drought, which together with fire, was strongly influenced by low rainfall in the preceding years. Forest recovery was often quite rapid following disturbance, particularly in the event of increased rainfall. In this study, we demonstrate the value of collecting information in a systematic and comprehensive framework, which can be used to address numerous monitoring questions regarding forest canopy disturbance.

TI  - A methodology to reconstruct LAI time series data based on generative adversarial network and improved Savitzky-Golay filter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality leaf area index (LAI) data is essential for regional and global ecology, climate and environment research. However, there are still many quality problems in the continuity of current LAI time series products. Here we developed a new comprehensive three-step reconstruction method (GANSG) for satellite-retrieved LAI time series data based on generative adversarial network, improving the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter and median absolute deviation filter. We applied GANSG to the reconstruction of MODIS LAI data in China from 2001 to 2019. The reconstruction results show that the new method based on the unsupervised deep learning framework has an advantage in interpolating low-quality LAI with high precision. The new method can better retain high-quality pixel information to smoothen the interpolated LAI time series by improving the traditional S-G filter. Compared with the five other methods, including the adaptive S-G filter, double logistic, asymmetric Gaussian, modified temporal spatial filter and spatial temporal S-G filter, qualitative analysis showed the new method has a more resilient ability to handle the continuous loss of high-quality pixels and identify the phenological features of biomes. Quantitative analysis based on station observation showed that the new method performs best among the other three methods, with the optimal correlation coefficient of 0.84 relative to station observation and the lowest root mean square error of 0.71 m(2)/m(2).

TI  - DOCC: Deep one-class crop classification via positive and unlabeled learning for multi-modal satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop mapping is an important task in agricultural resource monitoring, but it does usually require the ground-truth labels of all the land-cover types in the remotely sensed imagery. However, labeling each land cover type is time-consuming and labor-intensive. One-class classification, which only needs samples of the class of interest, can solve the problem of redundant labeling. However, the traditional one-class classifiers require well-designed features to realize fine classification, and are thus difficult to apply to complex multi modal remote sensing data, i.e., optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In this paper, a deep one-class crop (DOCC) framework that includes a deep one-class crop extraction module and a one-class crop extraction loss module is proposed for large-scale one-class crop mapping. The DOCC framework takes only the samples of one target class as the input to extract the crop of interest by positive and unlabeled learning and can automatically extract the features for one-class crop mapping, without requiring a large amount of labeling for all the land-cover type or feature design based on prior expert knowledge. Experiments conducted on multi-modal remote sensing data, i.e., Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral satellite data, Sentinel-2 multispectral time-series satellite data and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite data, illustrate that DOCC can automatically extract the effective features for one-class classification from multi-modal satellite imagery and reaches the highest F1 accuracy compared with other methods on respective satellite imagery. The results also reveal the different performance of multi-modal satellite imagery when they are used to extract different crop types. Meanwhile, the feasibility of DOCC for multi-modal data can be beneficial for large-scale mapping under different conditions when the samples of multi-class are difficult to obtain.

TI  - High-quality vegetation index product generation: A review of NDVI time series reconstruction techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from satellites has been ubiquitously utilized in the field of remote sensing. Nevertheless, there are multitudinous contaminations in NDVI time series because of the atmospheric disturbance, cloud cover, sensor failure, and so on. It is crucial to remove the noises prior to further applications. Numerous techniques have been proposed to alleviate this issue in the last few decades. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been a systematical study to summarize and analyze the status of NDVI time series reconstruction techniques since 1980s. As a result, our goal is to recapitulate the current approaches for reconstructing high-quality NDVI time series, followed by an interpretation on the principle, merits and demerits of different kinds of methods. They were mainly classified into temporal-based methods, frequency-based methods and hybrid methods. The evaluation approaches on the quality of NDVI reconstruction were introduced, accompanied with the future development tendency.

TI  - Precise orbit determination of FY-4 synchronous orbit satellite based on optical angle measurement data
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the precise orbit determination and accuracy evaluation requirements of the FY-1 synchronous orbit satellite, the ground optical angle measurement data were firstly used to perform precise orbit determination on the FY-4A satellite. The root mean square of the azimuth and altitude residuals arc 0.25 '' and 0.15 '' respectively. Compared with the orbit determination based only on ranging data, the position accuracy is less than 50 m in the arc with angle measurement data. The FY-4A satellite orbit was further jointly determined with combined angle measurement data and ranging data, and the orbit overlap accuracy was improved significantly to be better than 15m. Compared with the results of joint orbit determination, the accuracy of real-time orbit products based on only ranging data was evaluated. It is shown obviously that, with the accumulation of ranging data, the orbit accuracy can be gradually improved, e.g., the precision of orbit determination with ranging data can be gradually stabilized to about 20m in 6h.

TI  - Simple Polythiophene Solar Cells Approaching 10% Efficiency via Carbon Chain Length Modulation of Poly(3-alkylthiophene)
T2  - MACROMOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Poly(3-alkylthiophene)s are the most extensively studied polymeric materials in organic and hybrid solar cells due to the unique advantages of extremely low cost in material synthesis. However, the inferior power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are still the main obstacle in the commercial applications of poly(3-alkylthiophene)-based solar cells. In this contribution, the carbon chain length of poly(3-alkylthiophene) is modulated to reveal its impact on the molecular packing and charge transport behaviors in neat films and bulk heterojunction films with nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors for the first time. The odd-even effect can be clearly observed in poly(3-alkylthiophene):ZY-4Cl bulk heterojunction films, which has a great impact on the charge transport behavior and device performance. The poly(3-pentylthiophene) (P3PT) cell achieves a significantly high PCE of nearly 10% and a desirable fill factor of similar to 71%, which are the highest values of P3PT-based solar cells to date. The boosted efficiency is attributed to the altered van der Waals surfaces of alkyl segments through density functional theory calculation. This work reveals the odd-even effects of the carbon chain length modulation on the molecular packing and interaction of polythiophene:nonfullerene blends, which casts a new light on optimizing low-cost polythiophene solar cells and other promising electronics.

TI  - Machine learning with high-resolution aerial imagery and data fusion to improve and automate the detection of wetlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands serve many important ecosystem services, yet the United States lacks up-to-date, high-resolution wetland inventories. New, automated techniques for developing wetland segmentation maps from highresolution aerial imagery can improve our understanding of the location and amount of wetlands. We assembled training and testing data sets (patch sizes of 28 x 28 m2 and 56 x 56 m2) of high-resolution aerial imagery of wetlands using Illinois Natural History Survey wetland location data and National Agricultural Imagery Project data. Each patch was labeled as wetland or non-wetland. To augment these data sets with additional information, we incorporated digital surface and digital terrain models and topographic wetness index data in the same two patch sizes. Subsequently, we evaluated convolutional neural network (CNN) and Gaussian process-based machine learning methods to produce wetland segmentation maps. We developed the best performing method into a new CNN algorithm, WetSegNet. It exhibited an area under the curve of 98% when used with 56 x 56 m2 patch sizes. WetSegNet developed reliable wetland segmentation maps in test cases in which wetlands would have gone undetected using only the National Land Cover Database. The development of WetSegNet exemplifies the types of data sets and methods that are needed to accelerate the use of high-resolution aerial imagery towards an improved understanding of wetlands. This algorithm could be used by state and federal agencies or other groups to identify wetlands with higher accuracy and at a finer scale than previously possible.

TI  - Explicit and stepwise models for spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing images with deep neural networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial, sensor, and temporal differences can be observed in the process of spatiotemporal fusion because source images are from different sensors or moments. The existing spatiotemporal fusion methods have modelled the temporal difference, but they did not solve the spatial difference or the sensor difference to build complete models. In this paper, a step-by-step modelling framework is proposed, and three models are designed based on deep neural networks to model the spatial difference, sensor difference, and temporal difference in a separate and explicit way. The spatial difference is modelled with cascaded dual regression networks. The sensor difference is simulated with a four-layer convolutional neural network. The temporal difference is predicted with a generative adversarial network. The proposed method is compared with six algorithms for the reconstruction of Landsat-7 and Landsat-5 which validates the effectiveness of the spatial fusion strategy. The digital evaluation on radiometric, structural, and spectral loss illustrates that the proposed method can give the optimal performance steadily. The necessity of complete modelling is also tested by connecting the spatial and sensor models of the proposed method with one-pair fusion methods, and the steadily improved performance shows that all the difference models contribute to performance improvement.

TI  - Assessing the effects of irrigated agricultural expansions on Lake Urmia using multi-decadal Landsat imagery and a sample migration technique within Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agricultural expansion is one of the main reasons for water scarcity in the Lake Urmia basin. Although previous studies have analyzed the impact of cropland expansion on the Lake Urmia Shrinkage, there is a lack of comprehensive annual assessment of historical irrigation expansion in the Lake Urmia basin and its impact on water resources of this region. In this study, we developed an automatic and efficient workflow using Landsat and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) data, and a sample migration technique within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to comprehensively investigate the impact of irrigated agricultural expansion on the shrinkage of Lake Urmia, as one of the most severe environmental crisis in the world. Additionally, using the global surface water data, we proposed a fully automatic procedure to obtain reference samples from water bodies. The Lake Urmia basin was first classified into the water, irrigated, and Non-Water/Irrigated classes using the random forest algorithm. The average overall accuracy of the produced annual land cover maps during 1987-2020 was 92.2%, representing the great potential of the developed method for land cover mapping. We found that the irrigated lands expanded by nearly 890 km(2) during the study period. Coincident with this change, although the area of water bodies in Lake Urmia partially recovered after 2015 (reached from 1,050 km(2) in 2015 to 3,370 km(2) in 2020), it is currently far beyond its original condition (i.e.,similar to 5,400 km(2), average record during 1987-2000). Moreover, the information of the Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) from the GRACE and GRACE-FO data between 2003 and 2020 showed a dramatic decrease in TWS level (similar to-11.5 cm). The findings of this research will assist the local stakeholders and authorities to better understanding the environmental costs of irrigation expansion in the Lake Urmia basin.

TI  - Land uplift linked to managed aquifer recharge in the Perth Basin, Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While the link between groundwater extraction and land subsidence is well documented, observations of land uplift associated with groundwater replenishment are less so. In the Perth Basin, Western Australia, a programme of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) commenced in August 2017 and is designed to sustain levels of hydraulic head in aquifers valuable for extraction. Space-based TerraSAR-X satellite radar measurements were used to capture the first 3.5 years of MAR, providing an insight into the evolution of ground uplift in the Perth Basin that is spatially and temporally related to the MAR injection volumes and the injection-induced changes in hydraulic head. Significantly, the X-band InSAR has spatial coverage around the single injection point, and the time series begins prior to the start of the injection, rather than a generalised study of ground surface and aquifer change from multiple groundwater recharge contributions. This enables the observed ground uplift to be correlated with the time of initial injection, pause, then resumption with increased volumes. The X-band InSAR identified maximum displacements of up to 20 +/- 3 mm in the vicinity of the injection bores, but which subside when injection is paused. The spread of displacements from the injection site extends over 14 km southwards with the dispersion pattern identifying linear boundaries that sharply delineate displacements in the north-west and north-east. The extent of the region impacted by ground uplift is likely linked to the distribution of extraction bores and heterogeneities in the subsurface geology, including a persistent linear feature that has not yet been considered in hydrogeological models of the region. This article focusses on the immediate surface response to the MAR injection, and identifying the constraining physical features for the injected recharge, thus providing an additional insight into the challenging and complex Perth Basin. It also demonstrates the millimetric accuracy possible from X-band radar satellites that permits MAR volumes to be managed to avoid infrastructure damage that may undermine public confidence in the MAR program.

TI  - Prediction of butt rot volume in Norway spruce forest stands using harvester, remotely sensed and environmental data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Butt rot (BR) damage of a tree results from a decay caused by a pathogenic fungus. BR damages associated with Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) account for considerable economic losses in timber production across the northern hemisphere. While information on BR damages is critical for optimal decision-making in forest management, maps of BR damages are typically lacking in forest information systems. Timber volume damaged by BR was predicted at the stand-level in Norway using harvester information of 186,026 stems (clear-cuts), remotely sensed, and environmental data (e.g. climate and terrain characteristics). This study utilized Random Forests models with two sets of predictor variables: (1) predictor variables available after harvest (theoretical case) and (2) predictor variables available prior to harvest (mapping case). Our findings showed that forest attributes characterizing the maturity of forest, such as remote sensing-based height, harvested timber volume and quadratic mean diameter at breast height, were among the most important predictor variables. Remotely sensed predictor variables obtained from airborne laser scanning data and Sentinel-2 imagery were more important than the environmental variables. The theoretical case with a leave-stand-out cross-validation resulted in an RMSE of 11.4 m(3).ha(-1) (pseudo-R2: 0.66) whereas the mapping case resulted in a pseudo-R-2 of 0.60. When spatially distinct clusters of harvested forest stands were used as units in the cross-validation, the RMSE value and pseudo-R-2 associated with the mapping case were 15.6 m(3).ha(-1) and 0.37, respectively. The findings associated with the different cross-validation schemes indicated that the knowledge about the BR status of spatially close stands is of high importance for obtaining satisfactory error rates in the mapping of BR damages.

TI  - Countrywide mapping of shrub forest using multi-sensor data and bias correction techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The continual increase of shrub forest in the Swiss Alps over the past few decades impacts biodiversity, forest succession and the protective function of forests. Therefore, up-to-date and area-wide information on its distribution is of great interest. To detect the shrub forest areas for the whole of Switzerland (41,285 km2), we developed an approach that uses Random Forest (RF), bias correction techniques and data from multiple remote sensing sources. Manual aerial orthoimage interpretation of shrub forest areas was conducted in a nonprobabilistic way to derive initial training data. The multi-sensor and open access predictor data included digital terrain and vegetation height models obtained from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and stereo-imagery, as well as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter from Sentinel-1 and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2. To mitigate the expected bias due to the training data sampling strategy, two techniques using RF probability estimates were tested to improve mapping accuracy. 1) an iterative and semi-automated active learning technique was used to generate further training data and 2) threshold-moving related object growing was applied. Both techniques facilitated the production of a shrub forest map for the whole of Switzerland at a spatial resolution of 10 m. An accuracy assessment was performed using independent data covering 7640 regularly distributed National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots. We observed the influence of the bias correction techniques and found higher accuracies after each performed iteration. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the predicted shrub forest proportion was reduced from 6.04% to 2.68% while achieving a Mean Bias Error (MBE) of close to 0. The present study underscores the potential of combining multi-sensor data with bias correction techniques to provide cost-effective and accurate countrywide detection of shrub forest. Moreover, the map complements currently available NFI plot sample point data.

TI  - Mapping fractional woody cover in an extensive semi-arid woodland area at different spatial grains with Sentinel-2 and very high-resolution data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody canopy cover is an essential variable to characterize and monitor vegetation health, carbon accumulation and land-atmosphere exchange processes. Remote sensing-based global woody and forest cover maps are available, yet with varying qualities. In arid and semi-arid areas, existing global products often underestimate the presence of woody cover due to the sparse woody cover and bright soil background. Case studies on smaller regions have shown that a combination of collected field data and medium-to-high resolution free satellite data (e.g., Landsat / Sentinel-2) can provide woody cover estimates with practically-sufficient accuracies. However, most earlier studies focused on comparably small regions and relied on costly field data. Here, we present a fully remote sensing-based work-flow to derive woody cover estimates over an area covering more than 0.5 million km2. The work-flow is showcased over the Zagros Mountains, a semi-arid mountain range covering western Iran, the northeast of Iraq and some smaller fraction of southeast Turkey. We use the Google Earth Engine to create homogeneous Sentinel-2 mosaics of the region using data from several years. These data are combined with reference woody cover values derived by a semi-automatic procedure from Google (R) and Bing (R) very high resolution (VHR) imagery. Several random forest (RF) models at different spatial grains were trained and at each grain validated with iterative splits of the reference data into training and validation sets (100 repetitions). Best results (considering the trade-off between model performance and spatial detail) were obtained for the model with 40 m spatial grain which showed stable relationships between the VHR-derived reference data and the Sentinel-2 based estimates of woody cover density. The model resulted in median values of coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE of 0.67 and 0.11, respectively. Our work-flow is potentially also applicable to other arid and semi-arid regions and can contribute to improve currently available global woody cover products, which often perform poorly in semi-arid and arid regions. Comparisons between our woody cover products with common global woody or forest-cover products indicate a clear superiority of our approach. In future studies, these results may be further improved by taking into account regional differences in the drivers of woody-cover patterns along the environmental gradient of the Zagros area.

TI  - Lithological mapping enhancement by integrating Sentinel 2 and gamma-ray data utilizing support vector machine: A case study from Egypt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybrid data fusion mostly gives a better diagnosis to lithological units compared to single-source mapping techniques. Rock unit discrimination depends mainly on variations in the concentrations of chemical elements. Remote sensing datasets reflect these variations as different spectral reflectances, while gamma-ray spectrometric measurements enable recording the varied concentrations of K, Th, and U in these rock units. Accordingly, in this study, we use Support-Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm to classify combined high spectral resolution Sentinel 2 data with K, Th, and U content of the rocks to better differentiate a lithologically complex area in Egypt. SVM classifier has been trained and tested on a reference map (built from FCCs, principal and independent component analysis of remote sensing images, as well as previous geological maps) to allocate 13 lithological targets. K, Th, U, and total count maps are interpolated using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, cubically resampled, and fused with Sentinel 2 data. We concluded that incorporating any single chemical concentration in the allocation gives better results than using remote sensing data solely and raised the Overall Accuracy by 4.14%, 5.11%, and 6.83% by adding U, K, and Th, respectively. Moreover, blending the total count band (K + Th + U) with Sentinel 2 data outstandingly boosts the classification accuracy by 7.77 %. We performed field reconnaissance to verify the classification results. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating Sentinel 2 data with airborne geophysical spectrometric data, and the proposed approach may prove a more precise and sophisticated lithological map.

TI  - Refining and densifying the water inundation area and storage estimates of Poyang Lake by integrating Sentinel-1/2 and bathymetry data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is featured with high-frequency fluctuations and unique seasonal changes in water level and inundation areas, which plays a substantial part in regulating the runoff of the Yangtze River and maintaining the ecological balance of the region. Frequent observations enable more effectively reflecting the water budgets and related driving force of Poyang Lake. This study first utilized the Sentinel-1 SAR data and cloud-free Sentinel-2 images in conjugation with lake bathymetry to reconstruct the time series of the water inundation area and storage of Poyang Lake from 2017 to 2020. Further, a simple and straightforward method, named the Fitting Curves of each Block and Total area (FCoBT), is developed to reconstruct the complete inundation area of Poyang Lake from partially cloud-free Sentinel-2 images to densify the original time series. This method takes full advantage of the significant characteristics on the strong correlations of the block areas (one small part of lake area) varying with the complete lake areas, with a mean R2 and rho value of 0.94 and 0.98, respectively. The complete inundation area of Poyang Lake can be reconstructed from 113 scenes of partially cloudless Sentinel-2 images acquired from 2017 to 2020 by using the FCoBT. After integrating the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, a maximum of 13 measurements are available within one month, with the temporal intervals of 2-3 days. Results show that our reconstructed time series of water inundation area can finely depict significant seasonal fluctuation (wet season: from April to September, dry season: from October to the next March) and inter-annual variations (larger areas: 2017 and 2020, smaller areas: 2018 and 2019) of Poyang Lake during 2017-2020. Similar to the area change, the water storage of Poyang Lake also shows evident seasonal variation and inter-annual fluctuation, reaching the peaks in July and the lowest stages during November to February. This study cannot only provide an efficient and feasible remote sensing means of constructing long-term observations for highly variable lakes at high spatial-temporal resolutions, but also greatly refine our understanding on the intra-annual and inter-annual variations of Poyang Lake.

TI  - Iterative self-organizing SCEne-LEvel sampling (ISOSCELES) for large-scale building extraction
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks, including those related to remote-sensing image analysis. Successfully training a CNN to generalize well to unseen data, however, requires training on samples that represent the full distribution of variation of both the target classes and their surrounding contexts. With remote sensing data, acquiring a sufficiently representative training set is a challenge due to both the inherent multi-modal variability of satellite or aerial imagery and the general high cost of labeling data. To address this challenge, we have developed ISOSCELES, an Iterative Self-Organizing SCEne LEvel Sampling method for hierarchical sampling of large image sets. Using affinity propagation, ISOSCELES automates the selection of highly representative training images. Compared to random sampling or using available reference data, the distribution of the training is principally data driven, reducing the chance of oversampling uninformative areas or undersampling informative ones. In comparison to manual sample selection by an analyst, ISOSCELES exploits descriptive features, spectral and/or textural, and eliminates human bias in sample selection. Using a hierarchical sampling approach, ISOSCELES can obtain a training set that reflects both between-scene variability, such as in viewing angle and time of day, and within-scene variability at the level of individual training samples. We verify the method by demonstrating its superiority to stratified random sampling in the challenging task of adapting a pre-trained model to a new image and spatial domain for country-scale building extraction. Using a pair of hand-labeled training sets comprising 1,987 sample image chips, a total of 496,000,000 individually labeled pixels, we show, across three distinct model architectures, an increase in accuracy, as measured by F1-score, of 2.2-4.2%.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on land-use/land-cover (LULC) patterns plays an important role in the development plan of any area. In addition, the information on change in LULC is important in studying the type and magnitude of land conversion and the associated land and environmental degradation taking place in a given area. In the present study, we map and monitor the LULC change that has taken place in Morena district, Madhya Pradesh, India during the past 25 years (1994- 2018). Multi-season satellite data have been analysed along with ancillary information to prepare LULC maps at 1 : 50,000 scale for 1994 and 2018. These maps reveal that the area under built-up land has increased from 23.19 to 57.69 sq. km, mainly due to population growth. Double-cropped area has increased from 608.05 to 2050.08 sq. km due to reclamation of ravines. Ravine area in the district has decreased by about 22% during the above-mentioned period, indicating that the land reclamation measures taken by the people and the concerned government department have been effective in combating land degradation. The area under dense forest has decreased from 235.47 to 143.47 sq. km due to deforestation and forest degradation.

TI  - Evaluation of urban green space in terms of thermal environmental benefits using geographical detector analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) plays an indispensable role in urban spaces, providing important ecological services to compensate for natural environment functions damaged by rapid urbanization. Understanding the impact of the UGS landscape pattern on its environmental benefits in order to evaluate UGS quality is critical for increasing its use efficiency. Previous studies have frequently constructed evaluation indexes based on subjective assessment of UGS landscape patterns using principal component analysis, factor analysis, and other methods without combining the actual environmental benefits in a complex urban environment. We investigated the changes in land surface temperature (LST) under different UGS landscape patterns, which can help clarify the urban thermal environment effect of UGS, and constructed a comprehensive index, the Green Environmental Benefit Index (GEBI), for UGS evaluation. Our results show that: (1) spatial allocation and configuration of UGS impact LST at both landscape and class levels, and the impact varies significantly with different vegetation types and landscape patterns. (2) The influence of each pair of driving factors on UGS thermal environmental benefits is mutually enhanced, indicating that urban greening can be improved across multiple dimensions. (3) UGS evaluation based on GEBI is objective and compelling, where alleyways of the inner-city were identified as areas in need of greening optimization in the study area. Revealing more details of the UGS landscape pattern, this study can help to construct a scientific and objective evaluation model and provide a reference for urban greening optimization and planning.

T2  - Zhongguo gu shang = China journal of orthopaedics and traumatology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the femoral and tibial tunnel positions of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the modified transtibial (MTT) technique and anteromedial (AM) portal technique.METHODS: Between January 2017 and September 2020, 78 patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture underwent single-bundle reconstruction with the modified transtibial technique in 39 cases (group MTT) and through anteromedial approach in 39 cases (group AM). There were 25 males and 14 females in group MTT, with an average age of (37.0±2.3) years old; 27 males and 12 females in group AM, with an average age of (37.5±2.2) years old. CT scan of the affected knee was conducted one week after the surgery to measure and compare the femoral tunnels positioning (Fx, Fy), tibial tunnels positioning in the frontal plane(Tx1), tibial tunnels positioning in the sagittal plane (Ty1), and tibial tunnels positioning in the axial plane (Tx2, Ty2) in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction through Mimics software.RESULTS: Three-dimensional CT reconstruction after the surgery showed that the average Fx and Fy were(25.2±2.1)% and (34.9±3.0)% respectively and the Tx1 and Ty1 were (45.5±3.3)% and (44.7± 3.0)% respectively, while the Tx2 and Ty2 were (47.0±3.0)% and (39.9±4.2)% respectively in group MTT. In group AM, the average Fx and Fy were (26.0±2.0)% and (36.1±3.9)% respectively and the Tx1 and Ty1 were (46.5±3.1)% and (45.6± 3.1)% respectively, while the Tx2 and Ty2 were (47.4±2.5)% and (39.6±3.9)% respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the femoral and tibial tunnels between the two groups (P>0.05). Patients in both two groups obtained anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.CONCLUSION: Both the MTT and AM technique can achieve good anatomical positioning of the femoral and tibial tunnels, without significant differences in the positioning of the bone tunnels.

TI  - Automated delineation of agricultural field boundaries from Sentinel-2 images using recurrent residual U-Net
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineation of agricultural fields is desirable for operational monitoring of agricultural production and is essential to support food security. Due to large within-class variance of pixel values and small inter-class difference, automated field delineation remains to be a challenging task. In this study, a strategy is proposed to effectively address this issue. Firstly, a framework was developed using the Canny operator connected with the Watershed segmentation algorithm (CW) to quickly label the training dataset, which minimizes the workload of dataset generation in comparison with the commonly used manual vectorization. Secondly, a CW-trained deep semantic segmentation network, recurrent residual U-Net, was selected to mine the low level and deep semantic features. Finally, a boundary connecting method (to integrate fragmented boundaries) was used to generate the agricultural field boundary. The proposed methods are tested over smallholder agricultural landscape in Heilongjiang province, China, using Sentinel-2 imagery. Compared with the U-Net (overall accuracy (OA) 82.18%), the residual U-Net (ResU-Net, with OA 85.78%), traditional object-based image analysis (OBIA, with OA about 82%), and the existing 10-m resolution global land cover map (FROM-GLC10), the proposed method shows an improved performance (OA 89.28%, and Kappa 0.85). The successful application of the proposed method suggests that the recurrent residual U-Net model has great universality in agricultural field boundary extraction, and the automated technique has the potential of being applied to other regions.

TI  - Integration of ZiYuan-3 multispectral and stereo imagery for mapping urban vegetation using the hierarchy-based classifier
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation has important impacts on urban heat island, human living environments and even quality of life. The areal increase of urban vegetation has great contribution in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations. It is needed to accurately extract different urban vegetation types using high spatial resolution images, but the limitation of remotely sensed data and complexity of urban landscapes make it challenging. This research aims to explore the integration of multispectral and stereo imagery with high spatial resolution for vegetation classification in the urban landscape in East China. A hierarchy-based classifier based on optimization of selected variables in each tree node is developed to conduct urban vegetation classification through incorporation of canopy height features into spectral and textural data. The results show that use of canopy height features improved overall classification accuracy of 4.6% comparing with the dataset without use of canopy height features. The proposed hierarchy-based classifier can further improve the vegetation classification accuracy by 3% comparing with random forest. This research indicates that selection of proper variables from different source data, especially canopy height features, plays important roles in improving urban vegetation classification. This research provides a new insight for accurate urban vegetation classification using a hierarchy-based classification approach based on integration of spectral, spatial and canopy features.

TI  - Increasing control of climate warming on the greening of alpine pastures in central Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High-altitude environments are among the most sensitive to climate change, where impacts are amplified. To clarify alpine pasture dynamics in three typical mountains (i.e., Altay, Tianshan, and Kunlun) in central Asia, the change trends in the long-term summer peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were examined by applying three satellite sources: Landsat ETM+/OLI (1999-2020), Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (1981-2013), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (2000-2020). Satellite-derived NDVIs are reliable because similar variations can be observed during overlapping periods. The results show that the alpine pastures experienced overall greening. The most significant greening was observed in Kunlun Mountains and the high-altitude areas of Tianshan and Altay Mountains, where the annual average temperature is lower. Relationships between NDVI and potential driving factors, such as average precipitation (AP), surface soil water content (SSWC), total water storage (TWS), snow cover frequency, growing degree days (GDD), and average temperature (AT), were further analyzed. Over the last two decades, the optimal habitat of alpine pastures became warmer and wetter, as the AT, GDD, SSWC, TWS all showed increased trends. However, AP decreased at a rate of -0.625 mm/year, indicating that melting ice materials under current warming helped preserve moisture and soil water availability for pasture growth. Additionally, the primary factor regulating greenness patterns shifted from AP during 2002-2011 to GDD during 2012, 2014, and 2016-2020, indicating that the alpine pastures in central Asia have been increasingly dependent on climate warming. Our study highlights that the response of alpine pastures to climatic factors might change under ongoing climate change.

TI  - Assessing the performance of machine learning algorithms for soil salinity mapping in Google Earth Engine platform using Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 OLI data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization caused by natural and anthropogenic factors is an important environmental hazard especially in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Accumulation of salts in the soil is a major threat to crop production and global agriculture; therefore, rapid and precise detection of salt-affected lands is highly critical for preserving soil sustainability and supporting food production. Advancement in remote sensing techniques and machine-learning algorithms has started to contribute to fast and large-scale monitoring and mapping of soil salinization throughout the world. This paper aims to analyze the performance of three different machine-learning algorithms to map soil salinity using Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2A satellite images, and ground-based electrical conductivity (EC) measurements with the aid of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Classification and regression trees (CART), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) methods are implemented to create a correlation between ground measurements and satellite-derived environmental variables or spectral indices. After selecting the optimum five variables including wetness band, three soil salinity indices, and one vegetation index, soil salinity maps are generated in three machine-learning algorithms. The output soil salinity map in RF algorithm demonstrated the most reliable spatial distribution of various soil salinity classes in the selected study area. Despite CART provided slightly better prediction of soil salinity with R-squared (R-2) of 0.98 for Sentinel-2A data, and 0.96 for Landsat-8 OLI data in comparison with accuracy results of RF technique with R-2 of 0.96 for Sentinel-2A data and 0.94 for Landsat-8 OLI data, the output map of RF model estimated more reliable salinity levels in salt crusts, agricultural lands, drainage areas, and swamps. The corresponding result highly matched with visual interpretation. Soil salinity maps derived from SVR algorithms by using various combinations of input variables displayed relatively poor estimation of soil EC values compared to the other two methods.

TI  - Linear discontinuous ground deformation detection based on coherence analysis of pre and post event radar image pairs
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents information on how to use satellite interferometry to detect linear discontinuous ground deformation [LDGD] caused by underground mining. Assumptions were made based on the properties of the SAR signal correlation coefficient (coherence). Places of LDGD have been identified based on these assumptions. Changes taking place on the surface between two acquisitions lead to worse correlation between two radar images. This results in lower values of the SAR signal correlation coefficient in the coherence maps. Therefore, it was assumed that the formation of LDGD could reduce the coherence value compared to the previous state. The second assumption was an increase in the standard deviation of coherence, which is a classic measurement of variability. Therefore any changes in the surface should lead to increasing standard deviation of coherence compared to the previous state. Images from the Sentinel-1 satellite and provided by the ESA were used for analysis. The research is presented on the basis of two research areas located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin in the south of Poland. The area in which LDGD could occur was limited to 6 % of the total area in case 1 and 36 % in case 2 by applying an appropriate methodology of satellite image coherence analysis. This paper is an introduction to the development of a method of detecting LDGDs caused by underground mining and to study these issues further.

TI  - Utilizing an End-User Driven Process to Identify and Address Climate-Resilience Tool Needs in the US Gulf of Mexico
T2  - COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many tools have been generated in recent decades to support decision-makers in understanding and acting on climate science, causing stakeholders in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) to repeatedly express the need for guidance when selecting climate resilience tools. The Climate and Resilience Community of Practice (CoP), Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA), and the Northern Gulf of Mexico Sentinel Site Cooperative (Cooperative) developed and implemented an end-user driven process for tool creation. Research has suggested that integrating target end-users throughout tool development improves the probability a tool will be utilized, yet there is little practical guidance available on how to successfully design and implement an end-user driven tool development process. In this study, an end-user driven process and results from implementing the process during tool development are presented. Challenges, successful approaches, and lessons learned to support future tool development, especially for tools focused on sharing climate science are identified. Guidance is provided on needed expertise, timelines for engagement with target end-users, and methods on how to solicit, analyze, and assimilate end-user needs, perspectives, and priorities into a final product.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria and prevalence of molecular markers associated with artemisinin and partner drug resistance in Uganda
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In Uganda, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is first-line therapy and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) second-line therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of AL and DP in the management of uncomplicated falciparum malaria and measured the prevalence of molecular markers of resistance in three sentinel sites in Uganda from 2018 to 2019. Methods This was a randomized, open-label, phase IV clinical trial. Children aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to treatment with AL or DP and followed for 28 and 42 days, respectively. Genotyping was used to distinguish recrudescence from new infection, and a Bayesian algorithm was used to assign each treatment failure a posterior probability of recrudescence. For monitoring resistance, Pfk13 and Pfmdr1 genes were Sanger sequenced and plasmepsin-2 copy number was assessed by qPCR. Results There were no early treatment failures. The uncorrected 28-day cumulative efficacy of AL ranged from 41.2 to 71.2% and the PCR-corrected cumulative 28-day efficacy of AL ranged from 87.2 to 94.4%. The uncorrected 28-day cumulative efficacy of DP ranged from 95.8 to 97.9% and the PCR-corrected cumulative 28-day efficacy of DP ranged from 98.9 to 100%. The uncorrected 42-day efficacy of DP ranged from 73.5 to 87.4% and the PCR-corrected 42-day efficacy of DP ranged from 92.1 to 97.5%. There were no reported serious adverse events associated with any of the regimens. No resistance-associated mutations in the Pfk13 gene were found in the successfully sequenced samples. In the AL arm, the NFD haplotype (N86Y, Y184F, D1246Y) was the predominant Pfmdr1 haplotype, present in 78 of 127 (61%) and 76 of 110 (69%) of the day 0 and day of failure samples, respectively. All the day 0 samples in the DP arm had one copy of the plasmepsin-2 gene. Conclusions DP remains highly effective and safe for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. Recurrent infections with AL were common. In Busia and Arua, the 95% confidence interval for PCR-corrected AL efficacy fell below 90%. Further efficacy monitoring for AL, including pharmacokinetic studies, is recommended. Trial registration The trail was also registered with the ISRCTN registry with study Trial No. PACTR201811640750761

TI  - Satellite-based evaluation of temporal change in cultivated land in Southern Punjab (Multan region) through dynamics of vegetation and land surface temperature
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in urbanization has an important effect on cropping pattern and land use/land cover (LULC) through replacing areas of vegetation with commercial and residential coverage, thereby increasing the land surface temperature (LST). The LST information is significant to understand the environmental changes, urban climatology, anthropogenic activities, and ecological interactions, etc. Using remote sensing (RS) data, the present research provides a comprehensive study of LULC and LST changes in water scarce and climate prone Southern Punjab (Multan region), Pakistan, for 30 years (from 1990 to 2020). For this research, Landsat images were processed through supervised classification with maps of the Multan region. The LULC changes showed that sugarcane and rice (decreased by 2.9 and 1.6%, respectively) had less volatility of variation in comparison with both wheat and cotton (decreased by 5.3 and 6.6%, respectively). The analysis of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed that the vegetation decreased in the region both in minimum value (-0.05 [1990] to -0.15 [2020]) and maximum value (0.6 [1990] to 0.54 [2020]). The results showed that the built-up area was increased 3.5% during 1990-2020, and these were some of the major changes which increased the LST (from 27.6 to 28.5 degrees C) in the study area. The significant regression in our study clearly shows that NDVI and LST are negatively correlated with each other. The results suggested that increasing temperature in growing period had a greatest effect on all types of vegetation. Crop-based classification aids water policy managers and analysts to make a better policy with enhanced information based on the extent of the natural resources. So, the study of dynamics in major crops and surface temperature through satellite RS can play an important role in the rural development and planning for food security in the study area.

TI  - An era of Sentinels in flood management: Potential of Sentinel-1,-2, and-3 satellites for effective flood management
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The repetitive and destructive nature of floods across the globe causes significant economic damage, loss of human lives, and leaves the people living in flood-prone areas with fear and insecurity. With enough literature projecting an increase in flood frequency, severity, and magnitude in the future, there is a clear need for effective flood management strategies and timely implementation. The earth observatory satellites of the European Space Agency's Sentinel series, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3, have a great potential to combat these disastrous floods by their peerless surveillance capabilities that could assist in various phases of flood management. In this article, the technical specifications and operations of the microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard Sentinel-1, optical sensors onboard Sentinel-2 (Multispectral Instrument) and Sentinel-3 (Ocean and Land Color Instrument), and SAR altimeter onboard Sentinel-3 are described. Moreover, the observational capabilities of these three satellites and how these observations can meet the needs of researchers and flood disaster managers are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we reviewed how these satellites carrying a range of technologies that provide a broad spectrum of earth observations stand out among their predecessors and have bought a step-change in flood monitoring, understanding, and management to mitigate their adverse effects. Finally, the study is concluded by highlighting the revolution this fleet of Sentinel satellites has brought in the flood management studies and applications.

TI  - Detecting the distribution of grass aboveground biomass on a rangeland using Sentinel-2 MSI vegetation indices
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the grass biomass content of rangelands is potentially useful to rangeland managers. This study assessed the potential of image-derived vegetation indices to assess in-situ spatial variations in grass aboveground biomass (AGB). Sampling was conducted at the peak growth stage, at widely distributed sampling sites whose grass cover homogeneity was wider than 20 m. Up to three AGB samples per site were collected, in 1 m quadrats. Dry biomass weights were determined and averaged per site. Rainy season Sentinel-2 MSI images of the rangeland that corresponded with the fieldwork dates were obtained. Atmospheric correction of the images was performed using the Sen2Cor algorithm, which yielded 20 m resolution visible (vis), red edge (RE), near infrared (NIR), and short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. Seven biomass-sensitive vegetation indices that utilised Sentinel-2 MSI vis-RE-NIR-SWIR spectral ranges were then tested using the images, to determine which correlated best with the field-derived AGB. They were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Red Edge index (NDRE), Red Edge Inflection Point (REIP), Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI(2.1)mu(m)), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). In decreasing order of magnitude, the EVI, SAVI, NDVI, AFRI(2.1)mu(m), and NDWI had statistically significant correlations with AGB (p <= 0.05). The discontinuous canopies but high biomass of tall-grass species weakened the correlations. The EVI model of AGB was then used for depicting rangeland-scale, location-context spatial variations in AGB. Pixels with woody vegetation cover >= 50% were excluded using a binary mask that was developed through sub-pixel classification of a grass-senescence period Sentinel-2 MSI image. A statistically significant linear relationship (F = 21.192, p = 0.000) between EVI-predicted and actual AGB was established (r = 0.765, p < 0.001). The results from the studied savannah rangeland suggest higher vegetation index prediction accuracy at short-grass than tall-grass sites. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Retrieval of cloud liquid water path using radiosonde measurements: Comparison with MODIS and ERA5
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The phase of clouds plays a vital role in determining how clouds interact with the radiation. In this study, long-term radiosonde observations have been used to detect cloud layers and the liquid water path (LWP) is retrieved. The detected cloud layers are verified with the independent observations. All types of clouds shown similar diurnal variation. High occurrence of mixed clouds is observed in all the seasons. The retrieved LWP of liquid water clouds is in good agreement with those obtained from MODIS and ERA5. LWP estimated can be effectively used in various investigations in the absence of any direct observations.

TI  - Predicting forest stand attributes using the integration of airborne laser scanning and Worldview-3 data in a mixed forest in Turkey
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the capability of the combined LiDAR/WorldView-3 data in estimating the plot-level stand attributes (stem number-N, mean diameter-D, mean height-H, basal area-BA and volume-V) in a complex forest located in the northwest of Turkey. Total 135 plots were measured to determine the forest attributes. Prediction models were developed at three levels which are: i) the general level for all stands (including all plots), ii) forest type level (coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest), and iii) tree species level (Black pine stands, Maritime pine stands, Oak stands, Mixed stands). Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) modelling approaches were tested to predict stand attributes. The MLR regression modelling showed that the stand attributes were estimated with R-2 ranging from 0.71 (N and Vin Mixed) to 0.94 (H in Maritime pine) at tree species level, from 0.73 (BA in Broadleaved) to 0.95 (H in Conifer) at forest types level and from 0.77 (V) to 0.89 (H) at general level. The RF modelling indicated that the stand attributes were estimated with R-2 ranging from 0.69 (V in Mixed and Oak) to 0.94 (H in Maritime pine) at tree species level, from 0.72 (N in Broadleaved) to 0.95 (H in Conifer) at forest types level and from 0.81 (N and V) to 0.88 (D) at general level. The mean height had the highest prediction accuracy for almost all levels in both approaches. However, the stem number and basal area were generally estimated with the lower accuracies. The homogeneous coniferous stands provided the higher estimation accuracy than the broadleaved stands. Our results showed that the modelling approaches used here provide different performance for predicting different stand attributes. While the MLR approach performed better in estimating the stand attributes at the tree species level, the RF approach towards the general level provided higher accuracy estimation. In conclusion, the combination of aerial laser scanning and high resolution satellite data has high potential for predicting stand attributes in complex forest ecosystems. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Threats of climate change and land use patterns enhance the susceptibility of future floods in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this work is the future prediction of the floods in India due to climate and land change. Human activity and related carbon emissions are the primary cause of land use and climate change, which has a substantial impact on extreme weather conditions, such as floods. This study presents high-resolution flood susceptibility maps of different future periods (up to 2100) using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS modelling. To quantify the future flood susceptibility various flood causative factors, Global circulation model (GCM) rainfall and land use and land cover (LULC) data are envisaged. The present flood susceptibility model has been evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, where area under curve (AUC) value shows the 91.57% accuracy of this flood susceptibility model and it can be used for future flood susceptibility modelling. Based on the projected LULC, rainfall and flood susceptibility, the results of the study indicating maximum monthly rainfall will increase by approximately 40-50 mm in 2100, while the conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural and built-up land is about 0.071 million sq. km. and the severe flood event area will increase by up to 122% (0.15 million sq. km) from now on.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of early-stage ovarian cancer: A systematic review of the literature
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Review
AB  - The initial management of early-stage ovarian cancer consists of staging surgery including pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The use of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure in this setting may decrease the morbidity associated with this surgery. The objective of this review was to evaluate the feasibility of the SLN procedure in ovarian cancer diagnosed at an early stage by comparing the different techniques used and their accuracy. A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for articles in English or French about the SLN technique in ovarian cancer. Ten studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 179 patients. The main tracers used were Technetium-99 m, indocyanine green, and patent blue, and the most common site of injection was the proper ovarian and unfundibulopelvic ligaments. The overall detection rate was 87.7%. Of the small number of cases of lymph node metastasis reported, the SLN procedure had a sensitivity of 90.9% and a negative predictive value of 98.8%. The sentinel node procedure appears to be feasible and safe and could be reliable in determining the lymph node status of patients with early-stage ovarian cancer. C 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Hysteresis effects of meteorological variation-induced algal blooms: A case study based on satellite-observed data from Dianchi Lake, China (1988-2020)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of three top-priority eutrophic lakes in China, Dianchi Lake has received national attention due to its severe eutrophication in recent decades. Meteorological factors are the main factors driving the formation and persistence of algae blooms. In addition, meteorological variation-induced algal blooms usually have a hysteresis effect. However, there have been few quantitative studies on this hysteresis effect. In the present study, Landsat images were used to extract the dynamic characteristics of changes in algal blooms in Dianchi Lake from 1988 to 2020. The hysteresis effect of meteorological factors driving algal blooms was studied by employing the modified lag-correlation method. The results showed that the algal blooms in Dianchi Lake were most severe between 1998 and 2008. During the periods of algal blooms, the values of air temperature (AT) and precipitation (PP) were significantly higher, while those wind velocity (WV) and sunshine duration (SSD) were obviously lower, than the corresponding annual mean values. AT and PP were significantly positively correlated with algal bloom factors in both the formation and persistence stages of algal blooms, while SSD and WV both promoted their regression, but these effects were less significant in the persistence period than in the formation period. Moreover, rainfall led to a decrease in SSD and WV, indirectly contributing to algal blooms. Furthermore, AT, PP and SSD are the main factors impacting the duration of persistent blooms. The time periods during which each meteorological factor was most influential were as follows: 1) AT - 25-30 days before the maximum bloom. 2) PP - within the first 10 days before the maximum bloom. 3) Both SSD and WV -15-20 days before the maximum bloom. The results of this study support the prediction of algal blooms in Dianchi Lake.

TI  - Seasonal Evolution of Supraglacial Lakes on Baltoro Glacier From 2016 to 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The existence of supraglacial lakes influences debris-covered glaciers in two ways. The absorption of solar radiation in the water leads to a higher ice ablation, and water draining through the glacier to its bed leads to a higher velocity. Rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns provoke an increase in the supraglacial lakes in number and total area. However, the seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes and thus their potential for influencing mass balance and ice dynamics have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. We present a summertime series of supraglacial lake evolution on Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram from 2016 to 2020. The dense time series is enabled by a multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach based on optical (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X) remote sensing data. The mapping of the seasonal lake evolution uses a semi-automatic approach, which includes a random forest classifier applied separately to each sensor. A combination of linear regression and the Hausdorff distance is used to harmonize between SAR- and optical-derived lake areas, producing consistent and internally robust time series dynamics. Seasonal variations in the lake area are linked with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) based on air temperature and precipitation data derived from the climate reanalysis dataset ERA5-Land. The largest aggregated lake area was found in 2018 with 5.783 km(2), followed by 2019 with 4.703 km(2), and 2020 with 4.606 km(2). The years 2016 and 2017 showed the smallest areas with 3.606 and 3.653 km(2), respectively. Our data suggest that warmer spring seasons (April-May) with higher precipitation rates lead to increased formation of supraglacial lakes. The time series decomposition shows a linear increase in the lake area of 11.12 +/- 9.57% per year. Although the five-year observation period is too short to derive a significant trend, the tendency for a possible increase in the supraglacial lake area is in line with the pronounced positive anomalies of the SPI and STI during the observation period.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Land Classification Based on Deep Learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problems of high-resolution remote sensing images with many features and low classification accuracy using a single feature description, a remote sensing image land classification model based on deep learning from the perspective of ecological resource utilization is proposed. Firstly, the remote sensing image obtained by Gaofen-1 satellite is preprocessed, including multispectral data and panchromatic data. Then, the color, texture, shape, and local features are extracted from the image data, and the feature-level image fusion method is used to associate these features to realize the fusion of remote sensing image features. Finally, the fused image features are input into the trained depth belief network (DBN) for processing, and the land type is obtained by the Softmax classifier. Based on the Keras and TensorFlow platform, the experimental analysis of the proposed model shows that it can clearly classify all land types, and the overall accuracy, F1 value, and reasoning time of the classification results are 97.86%, 87.25%, and 128 ms, respectively, which are better than other comparative models.

TI  - Merging framework for estimating daily surface air temperature by integrating observations from multiple polar-orbiting satellites
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructing spatially continuous surface air temperature (SAT) is of great significance to climate and environmental studies. Substantial efforts have been made to estimate daily SAT based on land surface temperature (LST) derived from polar-orbiting satellites. However, previous studies are nearly all limited to estimating daily SAT based on MODIS LST from NASA's Terra or Aqua by applying different statistical learning methods. Various satellites from earth observation missions, particularly the missions for meteorological satellites, are capable of acquiring thermal infrared observations, but its implications for SAT estimation are significantly ignored. In this study, for the first time, we proposed a merging framework for estimating daily mean SAT by integrating LST datasets from multiple polar-orbiting satellites, including Metop-B from EUMETSAT's Polar System (EPS), SNPP and JPSS-1 from NOAA's Joint Polar Satellites System (JPSS), and Terra and Aqua from NASA's EOS. This study is also the first to explore the estimating of daily SAT based on LST derived from the meteorological satellites in EPS and JPSS. The framework integrates 10 estimation models based on different LST from the five satellites and generates daily merged SAT by averaging the daily SAT estimates from the models. Here we show that the framework significantly improves the spatial coverage of daily SAT estimates for cloudfree areas by an overall increase of 39% with respect to the mean coverage of the LST datasets from the five satellites. Daily coverage of the merged SAT from the framework is nearly all above 75% with an average of 91%. Compared to the SAT estimated from MODIS LST, overall increases in the coverage of daily SAT are 37%-51%. Estimation models in the framework all achieved comparable and satisfactory predicative performances with an average RMSE of 1.7-1.9 K for sample-based cross-validation, and 1.9-2.2 K for site-based cross-validation.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal direction of impervious surface area surface temperature in Pretoria, South Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, rapid urban growth has led to the conversion of natural lands into large man-made landscapes due to enhanced political and economic growth. This study assessed the spatio-temporal change characteristics of impervious surface area (ISA) expansion using its surface temperature (LST) at selected administrative subplace units (i.e., local region scale). ISA was estimated for 1995, 2005 and 2015 from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The spatio-temporal trends of ISA were assessed using an optimal analytical scale to aggregate ISA LST coupled with weighted standard deviational ellipse (SDE) method. The ISA was quantified with high predictive accuracy (i.e., AUROC = 0.8572 for 1995, AUROC = 0.8709 for 2005, AUROC = 0.8949 for 2015) using RF classifier. More than 70% of the selected administrative subplaces in Pretoria experienced an increase in growth rate (415.59%) between 1995 and 2015. LST computations from the Landsat TIRS bands yielded good results (RMSE = similar to 1.44OC, 1.40OC, similar to 0.86OC) for 1995, 2005 and 2015 respectively. Based on the hexagon polygon grid (90x90), the aggregated ISA surface temperature weighted SDE analysis results indicated ISA expansion in different directions at the selected administrative subplace units. Our findings can represent useful information for policymakers in evaluating urban development trends in Pretoria, City of Tshwane (COT).

TI  - Entomological surveillance of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), vectors of arboviruses, in an ecotourism park in Cachoeiras de Macacu, state of Rio de Janeiro-RJ, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arboviruses are arthropod-dependent viruses to complete their zoonotic cycle. Among the transmitting arthropods, culicids stand out, which participate in the cycle of several arboviruses that can affect humans. The present study aimed to identify species of culicidae and to point out the risk of circulation, emergency, or reemergence of pathogenic arboviruses to humans in the region of the Jequitiba headquarters of the Parque Estadual dos Tres Picos (PETP), in Cachoeiras de Macacu, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sampling was carried out at five Sample Points (SP) demarcated on trails from the headquarters, with CDC light traps, HP model with dry ice attached to the side, for 48 hours of activity each month. Additionally, active catches were made with a castro catcher in the period of one hour per day in the field, from six to eleven o'clock in the morning, in each PM. After the captures, thematic map was assembled using the ArcGIS 10 software and performing a multidimensional scaling (MDS). A total of 1151 specimens were captured and the presence of culicids already incriminated as vectors of arboviruses circulating in the region was observed: Aedes fluviatilis Lutz, 1904 (71 specimens); Aedes scapularis Rondani, 1848 (55 specimens); Haemagogus leococelaenus Dyar and Shannon, 1924 (29 specimens). In addition to the subgenus Culex (culex) spp. (163 specimens). In this sense, we highlight the importance of strengthening the actions of continuous entomological surveillance of the emergence and re-emergence of new arboviruses in ecotourism visitation parks.

TI  - Satellite based integrated approaches to modelling spatial carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to estimate and predict the aboveground biomass, carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India and relate these estimates with the land use changes. Many applications such as carbon stock and sequestration monitoring, forest degradation monitoring, and climate change mitigation, require precise and timely estimation of forest biomass. Although traditional field inventory can reliably estimate forest biomass, remote sensing is emerging as an alternate and fast approach to cover larger area with relative precision for biomass estimation. In this study, a combined approach of field inventory and Landsat OLI derived vegetation indices were used in spatial modelling of aboveground biomass and carbon stock in different land uses. A stepwise multilinear regression algorithm was used to derive the model that used Landsat derived NDVI, SAVI and ARVI as predicators. The predicted AGB ranged from 14.32 to 185.95 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 148.78 Mg ha(-1). The developed model that used combined vegetation indices showed correlation of R-2 = 0.79 with an RMSE of 51.04 Mg ha(-1). The present study also applied the empirical model (CO2FIX) to simulate the future scenario of carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of the different land uses. The carbon stock potential of different land uses were 182.31 Mg ha(-1), 158.91 Mg ha(-1), 134.98 Mg ha(-1), 169.26 Mg ha(-1), 133.84, 89.95 Mg ha(-1), 128.3 Mg ha(-1) and 61.36 Mg ha(-1) in Tropical forest, Subtropical forest, Temperate forest, Tropical plantation, Subtropical plantation, Temperate plantation, Shifting fallows and Agricultural land, respectively.

TI  - High spatio-temporal monitoring of century-old biochar effects on evapotranspiration through the ETLook model: a case study with UAV and satellite image fusion based on additive wavelet transform (AWT)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It can be challenging to fuse remotely-sensed images with large differences in spatial resolutions. In this paper, we used additive wavelet transform (AWT) to fuse Landsat-8 (30 m) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images (7 cm and 3.7 cm for thermal and multispectral images, respectively) as one of the primary studies. AWT image fusion generated sharpened Landsat-8 (L-8) images which were significantly correlated with coarse resolution images, while also well preserving the spatial details. Surface albedo (alpha(0)), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and surface temperature (ST) were computed from multispectral and thermal sensors on board of UAV and L-8 platforms. High-resolution UAV and AWT sharpened L-8 images were then used in ETLook model to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) across an agricultural farm enriched with century-old biochar. High spatio-temporal analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in alpha(0) across the biochar patches during the early development stages of winter wheat. Moreover, biochar significantly stimulated the development of wheat canopies towards the middle of the cropping season. There were however no impacts at the end of the season due to dense wheat canopies covering the aggravated dark colour soil across the biochar patches. ST was not affected by biochar either at the beginning or towards the end of the season. Neither was there any impact of biochar on actual ET over the season. Our approach can help to develop robust techniques for fusion of UAV and satellite images in light of climate-smart agriculture, and is also applicable to other farms with any specific precision agricultural treatments.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Urban Areas Using Remote Sensing: Case of Blantyre City
T2  - DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Blantyre City has experienced a wide range of changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This study used Remote Sensing (RS) to detect and quantify LULC changes that occurred in the city throughout a twenty-year study period, using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images from 1999 and 2010 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from 2019. A supervised classification method using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to classify and map LULC types. The kappa coefficient and the overall accuracy were used to ascertain the classification accuracy. Using the classified images, a postclassification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1999 and 2019. The study revealed that built-up land and agricultural land increased in their respective areas by 28.54 km(2) (194.81%) and 35.80 km(2) (27.16%) with corresponding annual change rates of 1.43 km center dot year(-1) and 1.79 km center dot year(-1). The area of bare land, forest land, herbaceous land, and waterbody, respectively, decreased by 0.05%, 90.52%, 71.67%, and 6.90%. The LULC changes in the study area were attributed to urbanization, population growth, social-economic growth, and climate change. The findings of this study provide information on the changes in LULC and driving factors, which Blantyre City authorities can utilize to develop sustainable development plans.

TI  - NESEA-Rice10: high-resolution annual paddy rice maps for Northeast and Southeast Asia from 2017 to 2019
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - An accurate paddy rice map is crucial for ensuring food security, particularly for Southeast and Northeast Asia. MODIS satellite data are useful for mapping paddy rice at continental scales but have a mixed-pixel problem caused by the coarse spatial resolution. To reduce the mixed pixels, we designed a rule-based method for mapping paddy rice by integrating time series Sentinel-1 and MODIS data. We demonstrated the method by generating annual paddy rice maps for Southeast and Northeast Asia in 2017-2019 (NESEA-Rice10). We compared the resultant paddy rice maps with available agricultural statistics at subnational levels and existing rice maps for some countries. The results demonstrated that the linear coefficient of determination (R-2) between our paddy rice maps and agricultural statistics ranged from 0.80 to 0.97. The paddy rice planting areas in 2017 were spatially consistent with the existing maps in Vietnam (R-2 = 0.93) and Northeast China (R-2 = 0.99). The spatial distribution of the 2017-2019 composite paddy rice map was consistent with that of the rice map from the International Rice Research Institute. The paddy rice planting area may have been underestimated in the region in which the flooding signal was not strong. The dataset is useful for water resource management, rice growth, and yield monitoring. The full product is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5645344 (Han et al., 2021a).

TI  - Cell size as driver and sentinel of phytoplankton community structure and functioning
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - 1. Body size is a decisive functional trait in many organisms, especially for phytoplankton, which span several orders of magnitude in cell volume. Therefore, the analysis of size as a functional trait driving species' performance has received wide attention in aquatic ecology, amended in recent decades by studies documenting changes in phytoplankton size in response to abiotic or biotic factors in the environment.2. We performed a systematic literature review to provide an overarching, partially quantitative synthesis of cell size as a driver and sentinel of phytoplankton ecology. We found consistent and significant allometric relationships between cell sizes and the functional performance of phytoplankton species (cellular rates of carbon fixation, respiration and exudation as well as resource affinities, uptake and content). Size scaling became weaker, absent or even negative when addressing C- or volume-specific rates or growth. C-specific photosynthesis and population growth rate peaked at intermediate cell sizes around 100 mu m(3).3. Additionally, we found a rich literature on sizes changing in response to warming, nutrients and pollutants. Whereas small cells tended to dominate under oligotrophic and warm conditions, there are a few notable exceptions, which indicates that other environmental or biotic constraints alter this general trend. Grazing seems a likely explanation, which we reviewed to understand both how size affects edibility and how size structure changes in response to grazing. Cell size also predisposes the strength and outcome of competitive interactions between algal species. Finally, we address size in a community context, where size-abundance scaling describes community composition and thereby the bio-diversity in phytoplankton assemblages.4. We conclude that (a) size is a highly predictive trait for phytoplankton metabolism at the cellular scale, with less strong and nonlinear implications for growth and specific metabolism and (b) size structure is a highly suitable sentinel of phytoplankton responses to changing environments.

M3  - Article
AB  - Bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister) (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae), has become a major pest of cole crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale) in California since its arrival in 2008. In this study we documented parasitism of B. hilaris eggs at a highly infested site in northern California by deploying sentinel B. hilaris eggs and collecting naturally-laid B. hilaris eggs in the soil. Two parasitoids, Gryon aetherium Talamas (Hymenoptera, Scelionidae) and Ooencyrtus californicus Girault (Hymenoptera, Encyrtidae), emerged from sentinel eggs, but only G. aetherium was documented attacking eggs in the soil. Gryon aetherium is currently being assessed as a classical biological control agent for B. hilaris in California, and mating experiments showed that crosses between G. aetherium from Pakistan and California yielded viable female offspring. This report marks the first known record of G. aetherium in the USA, and further work should be conducted to assess the potential of this parasitoid for biological control of B. hilaris.

TI  - Coal-based sulfur hybrid sorbent for removal of Hg0 from flue gas. Part 1. High inorganic sulfur coal
T2  - FUEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel sulfur hybrid mercury sorbent was successfully prepared by chemically activating high inorganic sulfur coal using potassium hydroxide (KOH). The optimal conditions for preparing the sorbent are at 800 degrees C with the ratio of KOH/coal at 2:4 by mass. The prepared sorbent, named ZY-2:4-800, containing 0.92% sulfur with a high specific surface area of 353 m2.g 1, has a wide temperature range for mercury removal. Between 60 and 180 degrees C, the Hg0 removal efficiencies of this sorbent keep above 95% within 2 hr under N2+O2+NO+SO2+H2O. This is because that O2 can slightly improve the mercury removal ability of the sorbent, and it shows great resistance to acid gas (NO and SO2) and H2O. The calculated Hg0 adsorption capacity of ZY-2:4-800 is 214.7 mu g.g 1, which is much higher than that of activated carbon sorbent (ACs) reported in the literature. Based on oS and Hg-TPDD analysis, it is revealed that the iron sulfide compounds in coal can be converted into active sites as S0, S22-, and CS during the preparation of the sorbents, and Hg interacts with these active sites and forms beta-HgS (metacinnabar). The excellent mercury removal performance and the low cost indicate that the as-prepared sorbent from the blend of the high inorganic-sulfur coal and KOH is a promising sorbent for mercury removal from flue gas. It is expected that this method could be applicable in converting other high-inorganic sulfur coals into efficient mercury sorbents.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Geodetic Mass Changes of Glaciers With Varying Debris Cover in the Pangong Region of Trans-Himalayan Ladakh, India Between 1990 and 2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers across the Himalayan arc are showing varying signs of recession. Glaciers in the eastern and western parts of the Himalayan arc are retreating more rapidly as compared to other regions. This differential retreat is often attributed to climatic, topographic, and geologic influences. The glaciers in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh are believed to be relatively stable as compared to other parts of the western Himalaya. The present study ascertained the area changes and frontal retreat of 87 glaciers in the Pangong Region between 1990 and 2019 using satellite data. The geodetic mass changes were also assessed using SRTM and TanDEM-X digital elevation models of 2000 and 2012 respectively. Besides, the glacier outlines were delineated manually and compared with existing regional and global glacier inventories that are available over the region. The GlabTop model was used to simulate the glacier-bed overdeepenings of four glaciers that are associated with a proglacial lake. The study also analyzed the impact of topographic influences and varying debris cover on glacier recession. This analysis indicated deglaciation of 6.7 +/- 0.1% (0.23% a(-1)) from 1990 to 2019 over the Pangong Region with clean-ice glaciers showing a higher retreat (8.4 +/- 0.28%) compared to the debris-covered glaciers (5.7 +/- 0.14%). However, the overall recession is lower compared to other parts of northwestern Himalayas. The glacier recession showed a positive correlation with mean glacier slope (r = 0.3) and debris cover (r = 0.1) with bigger size glaciers having retreated at a lesser pace compared to smaller ones. This underpins the need for in-situ data about debris thickness to precisely ascertain the role of debris on glacier recession in the Trans-Himalayan Ladakh where debris thickness data is absent. The mean glacier elevation did not indicate any influence on glacier recession. From 2000 to 12, the glaciers lost an ice mass amounting to 0.33 +/- 0.05 m we. per year. The formation of four new proglacial lakes, although small (<6 ha), need to be monitored using remote sensing data while the infrastructure development activities should not be permitted given glacial lake outburst flood risk.

TI  - "Some Vital Religion": Social Religion and the Science of Character Education in the United States, 1918-1932
T2  - SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of American public education has generally been considered as a steady transition from religious and sectarian to secular and pluralist, with the role of science in education increasing as the role of religion decreased. This article examines a conception of the role of religion in education that does not fit this narrative, the "social religion" of theorists of moral and character education in the 1920s. Relying on ideas of religious naturalism and with an orientation toward the practical effects of religious belief, this community of scholars asserted a concept of religion that would allow it to be at the heart of the common school project, uniting all under the common morality of the social good. Influenced both by liberal Protestant humanism and the scientific worldview pervasive in education reform at the time, these character educationists' ideas remind us of the historical contingency of categories like "religious" and of the antiquity of ideas we might classify under the heading of spirituality in American culture.

TI  - From Validation Statistics to Uncertainty Estimates: Application to VIIRS Ocean Color Radiometric Products at European Coastal Locations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty estimates are needed to assess ocean color products and qualify the agreement between missions. Comparison between field observations and satellite data, a process defined as validation, has been the traditional way to assess satellite products. However validation statistics can provide only an approximation for satellite data uncertainties as field measurements have their own uncertainties and as the validation process is imperfect, comparing data potentially differing in temporal, spatial or spectral characteristics. This study describes a method to interpret in terms of uncertainties the validation statistics obtained for ocean color remote sensing reflectance R-RS knowing the uncertainties associated with field data. This approach is applied to observations collected at sites part of the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) located in coastal regions of the European seas, and to R-RS data from the VIIRS sensors on-board the SNPP and JPSS1 platforms. Similar estimates of uncertainties sigma(VRS) (term accounting for non-systematic contributions to the uncertainty budget) are obtained for both missions, decreasing with wavelength from the interval 0.8-1.4 10(-3) sr(-1) in the blue to a maximum of 0.24 10(-3) sr(-1) in the red, values that are at least twice (but up to 8 times) the uncertainties reported for the field data. These uncertainty estimates are then used to qualify the agreement between the VIIRS products, defining the extent to which they agree within their stated uncertainty. Despite significant biases between the two missions, their R-RS products appear fairly compatible.

TI  - S-540956, a CpG Oligonucleotide Annealed to a Complementary Strand With an Amphiphilic Chain Unit, Acts as a Potent Cancer Vaccine Adjuvant by Targeting Draining Lymph Nodes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust induction of cancer-antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells is essential for the success of cancer peptide vaccines, which are composed of a peptide derived from a cancer-specific antigen and an immune-potentiating adjuvant, such as a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist. Efficient delivery of a vaccine antigen and an adjuvant to antigen-presenting cells in the draining lymph nodes (LNs) holds key to maximize vaccine efficacy. Here, we developed S-540956, a novel TLR9-agonistic adjuvant consisting of B-type CpG ODN2006 (also known as CpG7909), annealed to its complementary sequence oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) conjugated to a lipid; it could target both a cancer peptide antigen and a CpG-adjuvant in the draining LNs. S-540956 accumulation in the draining LNs and activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were significantly higher than that of ODN2006. Mechanistic analysis revealed that S-540956 enhanced the induction of MHC class I peptide-specific CD8(+) T cell responses via TLR9 in a CD4(+) T cell-independent manner. In mice, the therapeutic effect of S-540956-adjuvanted with a human papillomavirus (HPV)-E7 peptide vaccine against HPV-E7-expressing TC-1 tumors was significantly better than that of an ODN2006-adjuvanted vaccine. Our findings demonstrate a novel adjuvant discovery with the complementary strand conjugated to a lipid, which enabled draining LN targeting and increased ODN2006 accumulation in draining LNs, thereby enhancing the adjuvant effect. Our findings imply that S-540956 is a promising adjuvant for cancer peptide vaccines and has a high potential for applications in various vaccines, including recombinant protein vaccines.

TI  - Sentinel-1-derived coherence time-series for crop monitoring in Indian agriculture region
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing has been widely used for crop monitoring due to its high-resolution imaging and all-weather data acquisition capabilities. In this study, time-series interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence products generated from Sentinel-1 data were employed to monitor phenological stages, determine total cropping duration and estimate sowing as well as harvest dates for the Bengal-gram crop. The Bengal-gram crop was cultivated in the study region lies in Chhattisgarh, India, during the Rabi 2018-2019 season. Upon analysis, the temporal fluctuations in InSAR coherence were observed as a function of crop phenological stages as well as sowing and harvesting events. The lowest coherence value (i.e. 0.29) represents the peak vegetation. Sowing and harvesting dates were determined by observing the sudden shifts in coherence trend i.e. from high to low and low to high, respectively. The temporal analysis performed using InSAR coherence was also cross-verified with the time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) index derived using Sentinel-2 bands. Based on detailed analysis, we found that the time-series analysis of InSAR coherence provides reliable information on the crop growth stages and this approach can be used to monitor other crops as well.

TI  - Global maps of cropland extent and change show accelerated cropland expansion in the twenty-first century
T2  - NATURE FOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite observations provide an accurate and cost-effective solution to monitoring national and global progress towards Sustainable Development Goals. With a new global cropland dataset, this study reports that during the first two decades of the twenty-first century, the global cropland area increased by 9%, whereas the per-capita cropland area decreased by 10% and the per-capita annual cropland net primary production increased by 3.5%.Spatiotemporally consistent data on global cropland extent is essential for tracking progress towards sustainable food production. In the present study, we present an analysis of global cropland area change for the first two decades of the twenty-first century derived from satellite data time-series. We estimate that, in 2019, the cropland area was 1,244 Mha with a corresponding total annual net primary production (NPP) of 5.5 Pg C year(-1). From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9% and cropland NPP by 25%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5% as a result of intensified agricultural land use. The presented global, high-resolution, cropland map time-series supports monitoring of natural land appropriation at the local, national and international levels.

TI  - Evaluation of Various DEMs for Quantifying Soil Erosion Under Changing Land Use and Land Cover in the Himalaya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the serious environmental threats in the Himalayas, primarily exacerbated by the steep slopes, active tectonics, deforestation, and land system changes. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation was employed to quantify soil erosion from the Vishav watershed in the Kashmir Himalaya, India. Topography and land use/land cover (LULC) are important driving factors for soil erosion. Most often, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is used in erosion models without any evaluation and testing which sometimes leads to erroneous estimates of soil erosion. For the best topographic characterization of the watershed, four publicly available DEMs with almost identical resolution (similar to 30 m), were evaluated. The DEMs were compared with GPS measurements to determine the most reliable among the tested DEMs for soil erosion estimation. Statistical evaluation of the DEMs with GPS data indicated that the CARTO DEM is better with root mean square error (RMSE) of 18.2 m than the other three tested DEMs viz., Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Slope length and slope steepness factors were computed from the DEMs. Crop cover and management factors were generated from the satellite-derived LULC. Moreover, rainfall data of the nearest stations were used to compute rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility factor was derived from the soil texture data generated from 375 soil samples. The simulated erosion estimates from SRTM, ALOS, and CARTO DEMs showed similar spatial patterns contrary to the ASTER estimates which showed somewhat different patterns and magnitude. The mean erosion in the study area has almost doubled from 2.3 x 10(6) tons in 1981 to 4.6 x 10(6) tons in 2019 mainly driven by the anthropogenic LULC changes. The increased soil erosion is due to the degradation of forest cover, urbanization, steep slopes, and land system changes observed during the period. In absence of the observations, the simulated soil erosion was validated with the land degradation map of the watershed which showed a good correspondence. It is hoped that the results from this work would inform policymaking on soil and water conservation measures in the data-scarce mountainous Kashmir Himalaya.

TI  - Fusion and classification of multi-temporal SAR and optical imagery using convolutional neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image classification is difficult, especially for agricultural crops with identical phenological growth periods. In this context, multi-sensor image fusion allows a comprehensive representation of biophysical and structural information. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods are used for several applications due to their spatial-spectral interpretability. Hence, this study explores the potential of fused multi-temporal Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) images for Land Use/Land Cover classification over an agricultural area in India. For classification, Bayesian optimised 2D CNN-based DL and pixel-based SVM classifiers were used. For fusion, a CNN-based siamese network with Ratio-of-Laplacian pyramid method was used for the images acquired over the entire winter cropping period. This fusion strategy leads to better interpretability of results and also found that 2D CNN-based DL classifier performed well in terms of classification accuracy for both single-month (95.14% and 96.11%) as well as multi-temporal (99.87% and 99.91%) fusion in comparison to the SVM with classification accuracy for single-month (80.02% and 81.36%) and multi-temporal fusion (95.69% and 95.84%). Results indicate better performance by Vertical-Vertical polarised fused images than Vertical-Horizontal polarised fused images. Thus, implying the need to analyse classified images obtained by DL classifiers along with the classification accuracy.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bioreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by reducing microbes has attracted increasing concern. Here, Cr(VI) removal capacity of a Cr(VI)-resistant bacterium isolated from activated sludge was investigated. Based on its physio-biochemical attributes and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the strain was identified as Bacillus cereus ZY-2009. It grew normally in the media containing 10-100 mg/L Cr(VI), indicating its high resistance to Cr(VI). Under the optimal conditions of pH 7.0, inoculation amount 10%, and temperature 30 degrees C, Cr(VI) was effectively removed, with a removal rate of similar to 80%. Co-existing Fe3+ and Cu2+ greatly increased Cr(VI) removal, but Cd2+ showed significant inhibition. Cr(VI) was removed mainly via enzyme-mediated bioreduction but not biosorption. Cr(VI) was reduced by different cell fractions (i.e. extracellular secretions, cytoplasm, and cell envelope), implying that Cr(VI) can be reduced both extracellularly and intracellularly. This strain can be used in the bioremediation of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater, with Fe3+ and Cu2+ as stimulators.

TI  - Predicting poverty with vegetation index
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely predictions of the poverty status of communities in developing countries are critical to policymakers. Previous work has applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to high-resolution satellite imagery to perform community-level poverty prediction. Although promising, such imagery has limitations in predicting poverty among poor communities. We provide the first evidence that a publicly available, moderate-resolution vegetation index (the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]), can be used with CNNs to produce accurate poverty predictions contemporaneously among poor communities heavily dependent on agriculture. We also show that the NDVI can effectively detect consumption variation over time. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use remote sensing data to predict future-period consumption expenditure at the community level.

TI  - Upward Magma Migration Within the Multi-Level Plumbing System of the Changbaishan Volcano (China/North Korea) Revealed by the Modeling of 2018-2020 SAR Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changbaishan volcano (China/North Korea border) was responsible for the largest eruption of the first Millennium in 946 CE and is characterized by a multi-level plumbing system. It last erupted in 1903 and presently consists of a cone with summit caldera. An unrest episode occurred between 2002 and 2006, followed by subsidence. Here, we analyze the Changbaishan 2018-2020 deformations by using remote sensing data, detecting an up to 20 mm/yr, NW-SE elongated, Line of Sight movement of its southeastern flank and a -20 mm/yr Line of Sight movement of the southwestern flank. This reveals an unrest occurring during 2018-2020. Modeling results suggest that three active sources are responsible for the observed ground velocities: a deep tabular deflating source, a shallower inflating NW-SE elongated spheroid source, and a NW-SE striking dip-slip fault. The depth and geometry of the inferred sources are consistent with independent petrological and geophysical data. Our results reveal an upward magma migration from 14 to 7.7 km. The modeling of the leveling data of the 2002-2005 uplift and 2009-2011 subsidence depicts sources consistent with the 2018-2020 active system retrieved. The past uplift is interpreted as related to pressurization of the upper portion of the spheroid magma chamber, whereas the subsidence is consistent with the crystallization of its floor, this latter reactivated in 2018-2020. Therefore, Changbaishan is affected by an active magma recharge reactivating a NW-SE trending fault system. Satellite data analysis is a key tool to unravel the magma dynamics at poorly monitored and cross-border volcanoes.

TI  - How well can inverse analyses of high-resolution satellite data resolve heterogeneous methane fluxes? Observing system simulation experiments with the GEOS-Chem adjoint model (v35)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We perform observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) with the GEOS-Chem adjoint model to test how well methane emissions over North America can be resolved using measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and similar high-resolution satellite sensors. We focus analysis on the impacts of (i) spatial errors in the prior emissions and (ii) model transport errors. Along with a standard scale factor (SF) optimization we conduct a set of inversions using alternative formalisms that aim to overcome limitations in the SF-based approach that arise for missing sources. We show that 4D-Var analysis of the TROPOMI data can improve monthly emission estimates at 25 km even with a spatially biased prior or model transport errors (42 %-93% domain-wide bias reduction; R increases from 0.51 up to 0.73). However, when both errors are present, no single inversion framework can successfully improve both the overall bias and spatial distribution of fluxes relative to the prior on the 25 km model grid. In that case, the ensemblemean optimized fluxes have a domain-wide bias of 77 Gg d(-1) (comparable to that in the prior), with spurious source adjustments compensating for the transport errors. Increasing observational coverage through longer-timeframe inversions does not significantly change this picture. An inversion formalism that optimizes emission enhancements rather than scale factors exhibits the best performance for identifying missing sources, while an approach combining a uniform background emission with the prior inventory yields the best performance in terms of overall spatial fidelity - even in the presence of model transport errors. However, the standard SF optimization outperforms both of these for the magnitude of the domain-wide flux. For the common scenario in which prior errors are non-random, approximate posterior error reduction calculations (derived via gradient-based randomization) for the inversions reflect the sensitivity to observations but have no spatial correlation with the actual emission improvements. This demonstrates that such information content analysis can be used for general observing system characterization but does not describe the spatial accuracy of the posterior emissions or of the actual emission improvements. Findings here highlight the need for careful evaluation of potential missing sources in prior emission datasets and for robust accounting of model transport errors in inverse analyses of the methane budget.

TI  - Circular Economy indicators for supply chains: A systematic literature review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Recently, the Circular Economy paradigm has emerged as an alternative to linear and unsustainable production and consumption systems. However, no established indicator exists to assist the transition of supply chains to a higher degree of circularity; also, most of the literature on Circular Economy indicators has focused on the firm rather than on the supply chain as the level of analysis. Through a Systematic Literature Review, this paper examines decision support tools, and related indicators, employed for assessing the performance of Circular Supply Chains in the academic literature. In parallel, a content analysis and a template technique are employed to evaluate how Multi National Enterprises measure the effect of the adoption of Circular Economy practices in their reports. Results are synthesised in two composite indicators, which aggregate the most commonly employed metrics. Findings show that both academic literature and industrial practice show a scarce consideration of social and circularity measurements, rather focusing on classical environmental impacts and economic ones. In the academic literature, the economic dimension is prevalent; practitioners seem to evaluate and communicate more often the environmental impacts of already adopted Circular Economy practices. This article also recognises the different and sometimes hidden worldview assumptions in current Circular Economy indicators, highlighting that different paths toward Circular Supply Chains are possible depending on value and methodological choices. Future contributions should explicetly state these assumptions and their idea of a Circular Economy.

TI  - Effects of ecological projects on vegetation in the Three Gorges Area of Chongqing, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir and the resettlement project have caused increasing contradictions between human and land, and led to the deterioration of the ecological environment. In order to ameliorate ecological environment of the Three Gorges Area, the government carried out several ecological restoration projects to improve the vegetation coverage from 1990s. This paper aims to quantitatively analyze the impact of ecological projects on the vegetation in the Three Gorges Area of Chongqing, China. Landsat and MODIS data from 1992 to 2015 were used to estimate vegetation coverage. In addition, the land cover data of the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to explore the impact of ecological projects on land cover change. The cropland accounted for about 62% and the forestland accounted for about 34% of the total area. There was more than 90% of the study area covered with high or very high vegetation coverage. From 1992 to 2015, a total of 272.7 km(2) croplands were converted into forestland in the Ecological Migration Project (EMP), 795.6 km(2) in the Grain for Green Project (GGP), and 13.77 km(2) in the Ecological Restoration Zone Project (ERZP). Among the three projects, the GGP was the most powerful measure, with a contribution rate of 1.6%. The implementation of the ecological projects improved vegetation coverage, which indicated that the ecological projects measures were effective in ecological restoration.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological problems such as environmental degradation are urgent problems to be solved in karst areas. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to explore the landscape pattern and the relationship between landscape pattern and ecosystem service value (ESV) in karst areas. Based on the remote sensing data of Guiyang City, China, this paper uses landscape index method to evaluate landscape pattern, uses value equivalent factor method to estimate ESV, and uses gray correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between landscape pattern and ESV from patch type level and landscape level. The results showed that: (1) the landscape fragmentation slowed down, the complexity decreased, and the stability increased. (2) The total value of ESV shows an upward-downward-upward trend. Spatially, it showed a law of geographical center as the core, low in the middle and high in the surroundings. (3) ESV value is closely related to landscape aggregation and shape complexity.

AB  - Trout-perch are sampled from the Athabasca River in Alberta, Canada, as a sentinel species for environmental health. The performance of trout-perch populations is known to be influenced by the quality of the water in which they reside. Using climate, environmental, and water quality variables measured in the Athabasca River near trout-perch sampling locations is found to improve model fitting and the predictability of models for the adjusted body weight, adjusted gonad weight, and adjusted liver weight of trout-perch. Given a large number of covariables, three variable selection techniques: stepwise regression, the lasso, and the elastic net (EN) are considered for selecting a subset of relevant variables. The models selected by the lasso and EN are found to outperform the models selected by stepwise regression in general, and little difference is observed between the models selected by the lasso and EN. Uranium, tungsten, tellurium, pH, molybdenum, and antimony are selected for at least one fish response.

TI  - EFFECTS OF LAND USE CHANGE ON THE RIPARIAN ZONES' QUALITY ALONG THE ZAT RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: HIGH ATLAS OF MOROCCO
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the quality of riparian zones of Zat basin of Morocco by using the QBR index, and to analyze land use changes over 30 years along the Zat River and its tributaries by using remote sensing and Geographic Information System. Five land use/land cover classes were identified: Forest, building area, water, bare soil, and agricultural land using Landsat images. Also, the QBR index was evaluated in 14 localities distributed along the Zat River and its tributaries from 2018-2019. For instance, the total forest area was reduced from 959.07 ha (15.35%) in 1990 to 890.41 ha (14.25%) and 713.25 ha (11.41%) in 2005 and 2020, respectively. Whereas agricultural land and building area classes increased with an estimated rate of change of 24.99% and 33.81% respectively over the last 30 years. Furthermore, our results indicate that 35.7% of the banks in the riparian zone are of very poor quality, 14.3% of poor quality, 28.6% of average quality and 21.4% of good quality. The finding demonstrates that the low QBR score obtained by some sampling localities especially downstream is the result of multiple anthropogenic interventions in riparian ecosystems, including forest plantations, land use for agriculture, and road infrastructures.

TI  - Using Google Earth Engine to classify unique forest and agroforest classes using a mix of Sentinel 2a spectral data and topographical features: a Sri Lanka case study
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land cover classifications may lead to the loss of important local and national nuances such as forest and agroforestry classes. These classes are important to local contexts because they contribute to sustainable land management systems. This paper demonstrates the application of Sentinel-2A satellite images, elevation data, and the Google Earth Engine platform to generate more detailed, specialist land cover classification for forestry classes important in Sri Lanka deriving ten spectral, 16 textural, and three topographical features from the input datasets. The random forest classification model discriminates vegetation types as forest, forest plantations, shrub, grassland, home garden, and cultivation with an overall accuracy of 94% and kappa value of 0.91. Results indicate the elevation feature contributes the most to discriminate forest and agroforestry classes, and red band (664.6 nm) textural metrics derived from grey-level co-occurrence matrix analysis are more useful for separating the home garden from other land cover classes.

TI  - High-Resolution Melting Curve Analysis to Predict Extended Blood Group Phenotypes among Thai Donors and Patients
T2  - TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND HEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is an alternative method for red cell genotyping. Differences in melting curves between homozygous and heterozygous genotypes can predict phenotypes in blood group systems based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This study aimed to implement HRM analysis to predict additional extended blood group phenotypes in Thai donor and patient populations. Methods: Blood samples obtained from 300 unrelated Thai blood donors and 23 patients with chronic transfusions were included. HRM analysis was developed and validated in genotyping of KEL*01 and KEL*02, JK*01 and JK*02, FY*01, FY*02, and FY*02 N.01, DI*01 and DI*02, GYPB*03 and GYPB*04, RHCE*E and RHCE*e, and DO*01 and DO*02. Then genotyping results from HRM and polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) and phenotyping results were compared. Results: The validated genotyping results in known DNA controls by HRM analysis agreed with DNA sequencing. The genotyping results among 300 donors in 15 alleles by HRM analysis were in complete concordance with those obtained by serological testing and PCR-SSP. The sensitivity and specificity of the HRM assay were both 100%. Among patients, 13 had alloantibodies that possessed predicted antigen-negative phenotypes corresponding to those antibody specificities, and the highest probability of genotyped-matched donors was given to the remaining patients. Conclusions: We developed and implemented the HRM analysis assay for red cell genotyping to predict extended blood group antigens in Thai donor and patient populations. The data from this study may help inform about and support transfusion care of Thai patients to reduce the risk of alloimmunisation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The doctrine of original sin serves as a major challenge to apologetic theological reflection. The challenge is more demanding in times of the widespread scientific worldview, which renders biblical accounts on human evil less credible and questions the rationalization efforts produced by ancient and medieval theology. Recent developments in scientific anthropology offer a chance to better approach human negativity. So far, theologians have tried in the last years to apply those advances to update that doctrine, although not to the point which could lessen its mystery. Original sin expresses a general state of human frailty, whose origins escape scientific analysis.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganga/Ganges river bank erosion forced thousands of people to become landless and environmental refugees. river islands that emerged in this river segment may be alternative habitats for the environmental refugees. The present article intends to map Charland (river island), and the stability of Charland (island) to show the habitable area using time-series satellite images since 1987-2016. Instead of the factor-based approach usually used by scholars, in factor data sparse conditions, a result (charland planform)-based approach has been introduced for examining the stability of charland. From the analysis, it is found that the total area of the charland area excluding mainland charland is 237.64 km(2) and 286.82 km(2), respectively in the upper and lower reaches of the Farakka barrage during the post-monsoon period, whereas these are 261.21 km(2) and 311.48 km(2) during the pre-monsoon season. The seasonally submerged charland area is 48.22 km(2) due to the swelling of river water during the monsoon season. Only 22.9% of the area can be treated as stable charland since their appearance is consistent and they can be used for rehabilitation. Seasonally emerged, fertile charland could be used for agriculture during the pre-monsoon season.

TI  - Development of earth observational diagnostic drought prediction model for regional error calibration: A case study on agricultural drought in Kyrgyzstan
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural disaster that occurs globally and is a main trigger of secondary environmental and socio-economic damages, such as food insecurity, land degradation, and sand-dust storms. As climate change is being accelerated by human activities and environmental changes, both the severity and uncertainties of drought are increasing. In this study, a diagnostic drought prediction model (DDPM) was developed to reduce the uncertainties caused by environmental diversity at the regional level in Kyrgyzstan, by predicting drought with meteorological forecasts and satellite image diagnosis. The DDPM starts with applying a prognostic drought prediction model (PDPM) to 1) estimate future agricultural drought by explaining its relationship with the standardized precipitation index (SPI), an accumulated precipitation anomaly, and 2) compensate for regional variances, which were not reflected sufficiently in the PDPM, by taking advantage of preciseness in the time-series vegetation condition index (VCI), a satellite-based index representing land surface conditions. Comparing the prediction results with the monitored VCI from June to August, it was found that the DDPM outperformed the PDPM, which exploits only meteorological data, in both spatiotemporal and spatial accuracy. In particular, for June to August, respectively, the results of the DDPM (coefficient of determination [R-2] = 0.27, 0.36, and 0.4; root mean squared error [RMSE] = 0.16, 0.13, and 0.13) were more effective in explaining the spatial details of drought severity on a regional scale than those of the PDPM (R-2 = 0.09, 0.10, and 0.11; RMSE = 0.17, 0.15, and 0.16). The DDPM revealed the possibility of advanced drought assessment by integrating the earth observation big data comprising meteorological and satellite data. In particular, the advantage of data fusion is expected to be maximized in areas with high land surface heterogeneity or sparse weather stations by providing observational feedback to the PDPM. This research is anticipated to support policymakers and technical officials in establishing effective policies, action plans, and disaster early warning systems to reduce disaster risk and prevent environmental and socio-economic damage.

TI  - Using Network and Complexity Theories to Understand the Functionality of Referral Systems for Surgical Patients in Resource-Limited Settings, the Case of Malawi
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A functionally effective referral system that links district level hospitals (DLHs) with referral hospitals (RHs) facilitates surgical patients getting timely access to specialist surgical expertise not available locally. Most published studies from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have examined only selected aspects of such referral systems, which are often fragmented. Inadequate understanding of their functionality leads to missed opportunities for improvements. This research aimed to investigate the functionality of the referral system for surgical patients in Malawi, a low-income country.Methods: This study, conducted in 2017-2019, integrated principles from two theories. We used network theory to explore interprofessional relationships between DLHs and RHs at referral network, member (hospital) and community levels; and used principles from complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to unpack the mechanisms of network dynamics. The study employed mixed-methods, specifically surveys (n = 22 DLHs), interviews with clinicians (n = 20), and a database of incoming referrals at two sentinel RHs over a six-month period.Results: Obstacles to referral system functionality in Malawi included weaknesses in formal coordination structures, notably: unclear scope of practice of district surgical teams; lack of referral protocols; lack of referral communication standards; and misaligned organisational practices. Deficiencies in informal relationships included mistrust and uncollaborative operating environments, undermining coordination between DLHs and RHs. Poor system functionality adversely impacted the quality, efficiency and safety of patient referral-related care. Respondents identified aspects of the district-RH relationships, which could be leveraged to build more collaborative and productive inter-professional relationships in the future.Conclusion: Multi-level interventions are needed to address failures at both ends of the referral pathway. This study captured new insights into longstanding problems in referral systems in resource-limited settings, contributing to a better understanding of how to build more functional systems to optimise the continuum and quality of surgical care for rural populations in similar settings.

TI  - Desiccation of a saline lake as a lock-in phenomenon: A socio-hydrological perspective
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of how anthropogenic droughts occur in socio-hydrological systems is critical in studying resilience of these systems. This is especially relevant when a "lock-in" toward watershed desiccation occurs as an emergent outcome of coupling among social dynamics and surface and underground water processes. How the various processes collectively fit together to reinforce such a lock-in and what may be a critical or ignored feedback worsening the state of the socio-hydrological systems remains poorly understood. Here we tackle this gap by focusing on the case of Lake Urmia in Iran, a saline lake that faces the same fate as that of Aral Sea due to over-extraction of water sources that feed the lake. We develop an integrative, system-level understanding of how various anthropogenic, surface and underground environmental processes collectively generate the water scarcity and soil salinization issues in the study case. To this end, we investigate a paradoxical phenomenon wherein the increase of soil salinity has not noticeably affected the level of vegetation cover in Lake Urmia Basin. The outcome of our analysis may provide useful insights for informing policymakers how to cope with drought and water scarcity issues in many fragile saline lakes around the world that are currently under threat by overexploitation.

TI  - Dynamic IgG seropositivity after rollout of CoronaVac and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines in Chile: a sentinel surveillance study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background By July 14, 2021, 81.3 % of adults (aged >= 18 years) in Chile had received a first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 72.3% had received a second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with the majority of people given Sinovac's inactivated CoronaVac vaccine (75.3% of vaccines dispensed) or Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine (20.9% of vaccines dispensed). Due to the absence of simultaneous real-world data for these vaccines, we aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity between vaccines using a dynamic national monitoring strategy.Methods From March 12, 2021, 28 testing stations for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection were installed in hots pots based on cellular-phone mobility tracking within the most populated cities in Chile. Individuals voluntarily approaching the testing stations were invited to do a lateral flow test by finger prick and respond to a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination status (including type of vaccine if one was received), variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and comorbidities. We compared the proportion of individuals testing positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG across sites by week since vaccination between recipients of CoronaVac and BNT162b2. Unvaccinated participants served as a control population and were matched to vaccinated individuals on the basis of date of presentation to the testing station, gender, and age group. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if they were younger than 18 years, had no declared gender, had an invalid IgG test result, had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR, could not recall their vaccination status, or had been immunised against COVID-19 with vaccines other than CoronaVac or BNT162b2. Here, we report data collected up to July 2, 2021.Findings Of 64813 individuals enrolled, 56 261 were included in the final analysis, of whom 33 533 (59.6%) had received at least one dose of the CoronaVac vaccine, 8947 (15.9%) had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 13 781(24.5%) had not received a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of CoronaVac was 28.1% (95% CI 25.0-31.2; 220 of 783 individuals), reaching a peak of 77.4% (75.5-79.3; 1473 of 1902 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was 79.4% (75.7-83.1; 367 of 462 individuals), increasing to 96.5% (94.9-98.1; 497 of 515 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose and remaining above 92% until the end of the study. For unvaccinated individuals, IgG seropositivity ranged from 6.0% (4.4-7.6; 49 of 810 individuals) to 18.7% (12.5-24.9; 28 of 150 individuals) during the 5 month period. Regression analyses showed that IgG seropositivity was significantly lower in men than women and in people with diabetes or chronic diseases for CoronaVac vaccine recipients (p<0. 0001), and for individuals aged 60 years and older compared with people aged 18-39 years for both vaccines (p<0. 0001), 3-16 weeks after the second dose.Interpretation IgG seropositivity was lower after CoronaVac than after BNT162b2 and declined over time since vaccination for CoronaVac recipients but not BNT162b2 recipients. Prolonged IgG monitoring will allow further evaluation of seropositivity overtime, providing data, in conjunction with effectiveness studies, for possible future re-assessment of vaccination strategies.

TI  - Automated mapping of the seasonal evolution of surface meltwater and its links to climate on the Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface meltwater is widespread around the Antarctic Ice Sheet margin and has the potential to influence ice shelf stability, ice flow and ice-albedo feedbacks. Our understanding of the seasonal and multi-year evolution of Antarctic surface meltwater is limited. Attempts to generate robust meltwater cover time series have largely been constrained by computational expense or limited ice surface visibility associated with mapping from optical satellite imagery. Here, we add a novel method for calculating visibility metrics to an existing meltwater detection method within Google Earth Engine. This enables us to quantify uncertainty induced by cloud cover and variable image data coverage, allowing time series of surface meltwater area to be automatically generated over large spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate our method on the Amery Ice Shelf region of East Antarctica, analysing 4164 Landsat 7 and 8 optical images between 2005 and 2020. Results show high interannual variability in surface meltwater cover, with mapped cumulative lake area totals ranging from 384 to 3898 km(2) per melt season. By incorporating image visibility assessments, however, we estimate that cumulative total lake areas are on average 42 % higher than minimum mapped values. We show that modelled melt predictions from a regional climate model provide a good indication of lake cover in the Amery region and that annual lake coverage is typically highest in years with a negative austral summer SAM index. Our results demonstrate that our method could be scaled up to generate a multi-year time series record of surface water extent from optical imagery at a continent-wide scale.

TI  - A novel change detection method using remotely sensed image time series value and shape based dynamic time warping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image time series change detection methods provide comprehensive understanding of land cover changes. Traditional bi-temporal change detection methods in satellite image time series require consistent time series lengths and use only time series value or shape to calculate change magnitude maps, which may not fully utilize land cover change information. To address this challenge, we propose a change detection method using remotely sensed image time series value and shape based dynamic time warping (TSVS). Change magnitude maps were obtained from the time series trajectories of NDVI and MNDWI using time series value-based dynamic time warping method and time series shape-based dynamic time warping method. Change detection results were derived by clustering the polar coordinate space of time series value and shape using Gaussian mixture model method. Experiments using Landsat images show that the TSVS method improves about 2.75-5.10% compared to the CVA_GMM method, reducing the generation of false alarms.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use maps produced with high accuracy are extremely important as a basis for better use of the land as they are widely utilized in many areas such as agricultural policies, natural resources management, and environmental operations. This study aimed to produce a high accuracy land-use map using digital surface models (DSMs) produced using different interpolation methods and a random forest (RF) classifier. High spatial resolution Triplesat-2 images, Worldview-2 (WV-2) images, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images were used in this study. First, DSMs were produced from the point cloud using different interpolation methods. The image fusion process was applied and these fused images were classified using an RF classifier together with the DSMs. Overall results showed that the DSM obtained by the kriging method yielded better results than the other methods by increasing the classification accuracy by 7%-13%. In addition, the McNemar test was applied to the images resulting from the classification of fused images with and without using DSMs to investigate the statistical significance of the differences. McNemar test demonstrated that the chi 2 values were greater than 3.84, which revealed that the DSM produced via kriging interpolation had significantly increased the classification accuracy at a 95% confidence interval.

TI  - DroughtCast: A Machine Learning Forecast of the United States Drought Monitor
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most ecologically and economically devastating natural phenomena affecting the United States, causing the U.S. economy billions of dollars in damage, and driving widespread degradation of ecosystem health. Many drought indices are implemented to monitor the current extent and status of drought so stakeholders such as farmers and local governments can appropriately respond. Methods to forecast drought conditions weeks to months in advance are less common but would provide a more effective early warning system to enhance drought response, mitigation, and adaptation planning. To resolve this issue, we introduce DroughtCast, a machine learning framework for forecasting the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). DroughtCast operates on the knowledge that recent anomalies in hydrology and meteorology drive future changes in drought conditions. We use simulated meteorology and satellite observed soil moisture as inputs into a recurrent neural network to accurately forecast the USDM between 1 and 12 weeks into the future. Our analysis shows that precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature are the most important input variables when forecasting future drought conditions. Additionally, a case study of the 2017 Northern Plains Flash Drought shows that DroughtCast was able to forecast a very extreme drought event up to 12 weeks before its onset. Given the favorable forecasting skill of the model, DroughtCast may provide a promising tool for land managers and local governments in preparing for and mitigating the effects of drought.

TI  - Impacts of environmental pollution on mangrove phenology: Combining remotely sensed data and generalized additive models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been affected by anthropogenic activities that modify natural conditions and supply trace elements that affect mangrove health and development. In order to gain a better understanding of these ecosystems, and assess the influence of physicochemical (granulometry, pH, salinity and ORP) and geochemical variables (concentrations of V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Rb, Sr and Zr) on mangrove phenology, we combined field and satellite derived remotely sensed data. Phenology metrics in combination with Generalized Additive Models showed that start of the season was strongly influenced by Pb and Cu pollution as well as salinity and pH, with a large percentage of deviance explained (92.10%) by the model. Start of season exhibited non-linear delays as a response to pollution. Other phenology parameters such as the length of season, timing of the peak of season, and growth peak also indicated responses to both trace elements and physicochemical and geochemical variables, with percentages of deviance explained by the models ranging between 33.90% and 97.70%. While the peak of season showed delays as a response to increased pH and decreased salinity, growth peak exhibited a non-linear decrease as a response to increased Sr concentrations. These results suggest that trace element pollution is likely to lead to altered phenological patterns in mangroves.

TI  - Urban growth and land subsidence: Multi-decadal investigation using human settlement data and satellite InSAR in Morelia, Mexico
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited attention is typically paid to the cause-effect relationship between land subsidence due to aquifers overexploitation in expanding metropolises and urban growth models and patterns. This paper implements an integrated urban and satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) approach to investigate subsidence, multi-decadal urban growth and peopling trends in the Metropolitan Area of Morelia (ZMM) in the Mexican state of Michoacan. Stacking of JRCs Global Human Settlement Layer, DLR's World Settlement Footprint and INEGI's National Geostatistical Framework datasets reveals a predominant edge-expansion growth model, with urban densification in 1975-2020 and some sprawling in 1990-2000. Population of the ZMM doubled in the last 30 years, reaching over 1 million inhabitants. The ENVISAT and Sentinel-1 InSAR analysis confirms that subsidence is structurally-controlled by the main normal faults within the Cuitzeo half-graben. Differential sinking and ground discontinuities are aligned with buried tectonic faults and contrasting compressible sediment thickness. Non-linearly deforming subsidence bowls develop at extraction wells in both old and newly urbanized sectors of the ZMM. Maximum vertical displacement velocities increased from -2.5 cm/year in 2003-2010 to -9.0 cm/year in 2014-2021, with subsidence migrating towards recently urbanized zones. More than 250 new groundwater wells were added to the public registry since 2000, many of which within new urban sectors. Time-lapse InSAR reveals a 4 km(2) rapidly subsiding bowl that formed at the largest social housing neighbourhood of Villas del Pedregal, as building lots were progressively completed and sold, and new wells registered. With angular distortions due to the differential subsidence reaching 0.12% in 2014-2021, new buildings and roads are exposed to fracturing and surface faulting risk of comparable level as the city historic building blocks located along the main faults. By providing useful insights into the relationship between urban growth and land subsidence in the ZMM, the approach proves valuable for application to other metropolises worldwide.

TI  - A composite drought index developed for detecting large-scale drought characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have projected that drought will become more severe under changing climatic conditions which will have a profound impact on terrestrial ecosystems around the world. While a wide range of drought indices has been extensively applied to assess droughts, various issues have been raised, such as over- or underestimation of drought conditions, feature extraction techniques, or transformations used to develop the indices. In this study, a new composite drought index (CDI) was developed using the integration of potential and actual evapotranspiration, climatic water balance, and precipitation. The proposed CDI was evaluated by comparing it with soil moisture, Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), scaled crop yield index (sCYI), evaluation integrated drought index (EIDI), and standardized runoff index (SRI) in China. Our results demonstrate that together with PDSI, CDI performs well in monitoring drought over 2417 grid cells obtained from in-situ latitude and longitude. It was found that CDI performs better than the PDSI and EIDI for reliable soil moisture detection and stable drought monitoring in the study area. Compared to PDSI, CDI shows a more positive correlation with sCYI for seasonal maize and wheat. CDI has less false alarm ratio in the detection of mild to extreme drought events compared to PDSI.

TI  - Decline in Thermal Habitat Conditions for the Endangered Delta Smelt as Seen from Landsat Satellites (1985-2019)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses Landsat 5, 7, and 8 level 2 collection 2 surface temperature to examine habitat suitability conditions spanning 1985-2019, relative to the thermal tolerance of the endemic and endangered delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and two non-native fish, the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and Mississippi silverside (Menidia beryllina) in the upper San Francisco Estuary. This product was validated using thermal radiometer data collected from 2008 to 2019 from a validation site on a platform in the Salton Sea (RMSE = 0.78 degrees C, r = 0.99, R-2 = 0.99, p < 0.01, and n = 237). Thermally unsuitable habitat, indicated by annual maximum water surface temperatures exceeding critical thermal maximum temperatures for each species, increased by 1.5 km(2) yr(-1) for the delta smelt with an inverse relationship to the delta smelt abundance index from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (r = -0.44, R-2 = 0.2, p < 0.01). Quantile and Theil-Sen regression showed that the delta smelt are unable to thrive when the thermally unsuitable habitat exceeds 107 km(2). A habitat unsuitable for the delta smelt but survivable for the non-natives is expanding by 0.82 km(2) yr(-1). Warming waters in the San Francisco Estuary are reducing the available habitat for the delta smelt.

M3  - Article
AB  - Hotspots of endemic biodiversity, tropical cloud forests teem with ecosystem services such as drinking water, food, building materials, and carbon sequestration. Unfortunately, already threatened by climate change, the cloud forests in our study area are being further endangered during the Covid pandemic. These forests in northern Ecuador are being razed by city dwellers building country homes to escape the Covid virus, as well as by illegal miners desperate for money. Between August 2019 and July 2021, our study area of 52 square kilometers lost 1.17% of its tree cover. We base this estimate on simulations from the predictive model we built using Artificial Intelligence, satellite images, and cloud technology. When simulating tree cover, this model achieved an accuracy between 96 and 100 percent. To train the model, we developed a visual and interactive application to rapidly annotate satellite image pixels with land use and land cover classes. We codified our algorithms in an R package-loRax-that researchers, environmental organizations, and governmental agencies can readily deploy to monitor forest loss all over the world.

TI  - A wildfire growth prediction and evaluation approach using Landsat and MODIS data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing wildfire occurrence due to global climate changes urged the improvement of present wildfire growth prediction and evaluation methods. This study aimed to propose novel solutions to their two primary limitations, including the lack of robust fuel classification method and the low spatial resolution of wildfire growth accuracy assessment while ensuring wide applicability using open data satellite missions and software. The first objective was to create a robust two-step fuel model classification method consisted of the supervised machine learning classification of generalized land cover classes in the 1st level and their individual unsupervised classification to vegetation subtypes in the 2nd level. The second objective was creating a wildfire prediction accuracy assessment method using MODIS 250 m images, which overcome the limitations of low spatial resolution while preserving sub-daily temporal resolution. The wildfire on the Korcula island in Croatia was analyzed in the study, being specific for its long duration from 18 to 24 July 2015. The wildfire ignition occurred in the isolated area, which prolonged the response time from emergency agencies. Random Forest (RF) with input Landsat 8 spectral bands and indices resulted in the highest classification accuracy in the 1st classification level with an overall agreement of 83.6%. The vegetation subclasses from the 2nd classification level were matched to the 13 standard fuel models for the input in FARSITE software. The predicted wildfire evaluation showed the highest mean accuracy of 0.906 for the first two days, which decreased to 0.722 in the latter stages of the active wildfire caused by overprediction. The proposed two-step fuel model classification presented a costefficient solution to the fuel map creation in any part of the world, with a disadvantage of no in-situ ground truth identification and accuracy assessment for 2nd classification level. The evaluation of wildfire growth prediction with 250 m images enabled high spatial and temporal resolution of the assessment, while its limitations of wildfire overprediction and the negative effects of wildfire smoke in MODIS images should be addressed in future research.

TI  - A simple model of ozone-temperature coupling in the tropical lower stratosphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations show strong correlations between large-scale ozone and temperature variations in the tropical lower stratosphere across a wide range of timescales. We quantify this behavior using monthly records of ozone and temperature data from Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesonde (SHADOZ) tropical balloon measurements (1998-2016), along with global satellite data from Aura microwave limb sounder and GPS radio occultation over 2004-2018. The observational data demonstrate strong in-phase ozone-temperature coherence spanning sub-seasonal, annual and interannual timescales, and the slope of the temperature-ozone relationship (T / O-3) varies as a function of timescale and altitude. We compare the observations to idealized calculations based on the coupled zonal mean thermodynamic and ozone continuity equations, including ozone radiative feedbacks on temperature, where both temperature and ozone respond in a coupled manner to variations in the tropical upwelling Brewer-Dobson circulation. These calculations can approximately explain the observed (T / O-3) amplitude and phase relationships, including sensitivity to timescale and altitude, and highlight distinct balances for "fast" variations (periods < 150 d, controlled by transport across background vertical gradients) and "slow" coupling (seasonal and interannual variations, controlled by radiative balances).

TI  - Assessing the effects of climate variability and vegetation conversion on variations of net primary productivity in the mountainous area of North China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Climate variability and land use changes are the two main factors contributing to spatial-temporal variations of NPP, and accurate estimations of these factors are crucial for understanding carbon cycling. In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of NPP with climate variability and vegetation conversion in the mountainous area of North China were investigated over 2000-2018 by utilizing the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and remote sensing data, which provides a better understanding of how NPP varied after the implementation of the Grain to Green Program. The results indicate that the annual NPP follows a rising trend at a rate of 7.18 gC/m2.yr and with a mean value of 395.80 gC/m2.yr. Spatially, significant regional heterogeneity was detected in NPP with gradients decreasing from the southeast to the northwest, while steep increases were found in northern Hebei and southern Shanxi. Regarding different vegetation types, the mean annual NPP decreased following the order of broadleaf forest > mixed forest > needleleaf forest > shrubland > grassland > cropland. Furthermore, all vegetation types showed an increasing trend during the study period. Over the conversion from cropland (with low NPP) to forest (with high NPP), the NPP of cropland increased by 9.27 gC/m2.yr, suggesting that in relatively water-scarce regions, forest could fully utilize limited water resources for its growth. Among various meteorological factors, precipitation and DSI had a higher correlation with NPP in the mountainous area of North China. This shows that moisture indexes rather than temperature and solar radiation are the main driving factors of regional NPP. Finally, the combined effects of meteorological factors on NPP were quantified, and the cumulative contribution rate of precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, and DSI to NPP variation is 68%. These results will aid future water resources management and fragile ecosystem optimization to guarantee the sustainable utilization of water resources.

TI  - An integrated remote sensing and model approach for assessing forest carbon fluxes in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plays an important role in reducing pressure on the natural environment, weaking the influence of greenhouse effects, and sequestrating atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far, due to the lack of complete understanding of forest ecosystem processes and the limitations on the scope of application of evaluation methods, there are still great uncertainties in the researches on carbon fluxes of forest ecosystems in China at the national level. En this study, an individual tree species FORCCHN model, which could flexibly use the inventory data as the initial field (more accurately) or use the remote sensing information to inverse initial field was applied. The dynamics of key carbon cycle fluxes (net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP)) and carbon sequestration of forest ecosystems in China from 1982 to 2019 were simulated based on remote sensing data and FORCCI IN model. The results showed that forest ecosystems in China had great carbon sequestration potential over the past 39 years. From 1982 to 2019, the NPP of Chinese forests presented a fluctuated increase. Total NPP from 2011 to 2019 ranged from 0.91 PgC.a(-1) to 1.14 PgC.a(-1). Annual average NEP of forest ecosystems in China from 2011 to 2019 was 0.199 PgC.a(-1 )(1Pg = 10(15) g). Influenced by climate, soil and vegetation, carbon sequestration potential in Chinese forest ecosystems presented obvious regional differences in space. The spatial distribution of NEP gradually increased from Northwest to Southeast China. From 2011 to 2019, forests in Yunnan Province had the strongest carbon storage capacity (72.79 TgC.a(-1) Tg = 10(12) g), followed by forests in Guangxi (18.49 TgC.a(-1)) and forests in Guangdong (10.01 TgC.a(-1)). Our results not only address concerns about carbon sequestration but also reflect the importance of Chinese forest resources in the development of the national economy and society.

TI  - Riometer absorption during four similar storms
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Absorption level by riometer was estimated at high-latitudes during four moderate magnetic storms that occurred in 2018 and were similar by several features. The data of riometer absorption at 30 MHz was obtained from Sodankyla center dot Geophysical Observatory in Finland (67.36 degrees N, 26.63 degrees E). Particle precipitations were estimated by POES satellite data. According to our results, the character of development of the magnetic disturbance and the similarity/difference of Space Weather parameter variations (IMF magnitude, solar wind parameters, Dst variation) did not played the leading role in the absorption peak value. The absorption level in the auroral oval during the considered similar moderate magnetic disturbances depended on the combination of factors: simultaneous electron bursts of particular energies, the number of precipitating particles in these bursts and the moment of the storm at which such precipitation bursts occurred. The highest absorption was caused by the large electron precipitations with energies of >40 keV and >130 keV that occurred just after the maximal storm development at the very beginning of the recovery phase of the storm.

TI  - Using community-based interviews to determine population size, distribution and nest site characteristics of Pallas's fish eagle in north-east Bangladesh
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Pallas's fish eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus was recategorized from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2017 because of evidence that there is only a single population, which is declining as a result of continuous, widespread loss and degradation of freshwater wetlands. To determine the species' status in Bangladesh, we conducted a large-scale community-based interview survey in north-east Bangladesh in 2017-2020. We also examined nest site habitat characteristics through field surveys and remotely sensed data. We conducted a total of 955 interviews in an area of 4,150 km(2), through which we were able to determine the presence of 53 breeding pairs at a mean density of 1.2 nests per 100 km(2). There was a higher nest density (3.7-4.8 nests per 100 km(2)) in some locations, which we identify as priority conservation areas. The majority of nests (62.2%) were close together and on tall trees with an open canopy structure. Nests were located within or close to (< 100 m) human settlements, and within 500 m of wetlands and rivers. Felling of nest trees, removal of nests by local people and loss of permanent wetlands (14.6% during 2010-2020) appeared to be the main threats. High nesting density in our study area suggests that the freshwater wetlands in north-east Bangladesh possibly hold the largest population of Pallas's fish eagle globally.

TI  - Observing Sucrose Accumulation With Sentinel-1 Backscatter
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study the impact of sucrose accumulation in Sentinel-1 backscatter observations is presented and compared to Planet optical observations. Sugarcane yield data from a sugarcane plantation in Xinavane, Mozambique are used for this study. The database contains sugarcane yield of 387 fields over two seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020). The relation between sugarcane yield and Sentinel-1 VV and VH backscatter observation is analyzed by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data as derived from Planet Scope optical imagery as a benchmark. The different satellite observations were compared over time to sugarcane yield to understand how the relation between the observations and yield evolves during the growing season. A negative correlation between yield and Cross Ratio (CR) from Sentinel-1 backscatter was found while a positive correlation between yield and Planet NDVI was observed. An additional modeling study on the dielectric properties of the crop revealed how the CR could be affected by sucrose accumulation during the growing season and supported the opposite correlations. The results shows CR contains information on sucrose content in the sugarcane plant. This sets a basis for further development of sucrose monitoring and prediction using a combination of radar and optical imagery.

TI  - Broadening the reach of the FDA Sentinel system: A roadmap for integrating electronic health record data in a causal analysis framework
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel System is a major component of the United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approach to active medical product safety surveillance. While Sentinel has historically relied on large quantities of health insurance claims data, leveraging longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) that contain more detailed clinical information, as structured and unstructured features, may address some of the current gaps in capabilities. We identify key challenges when using EHR data to investigate medical product safety in a scalable and accelerated way, outline potential solutions, and describe the Sentinel Innovation Center's initiatives to put solutions into practice by expanding and strengthening the existing system with a query-ready, large-scale data infrastructure of linked EHR and claims data. We describe our initiatives in four strategic priority areas: (1) data infrastructure, (2) feature engineering, (3) causal inference, and (4) detection analytics, with the goal of incorporating emerging data science innovations to maximize the utility of EHR data for medical product safety surveillance.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Data Classification Method Based on Spectrum Sharing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing remote sensing data classification methods cannot achieve the sharing of remote sensing image spectrum, leading to poor fusion and classification of remote sensing data. Therefore, a high spatial resolution remote sensing data classification method based on spectrum sharing is proposed. A page frame recovery algorithm (PFRA) is introduced to allocate the wireless spectrum resources in low-frequency band, and a dynamic spectrum sharing mechanism is designed between the primary and secondary users of remote sensing images. Based on this, D-S evidence theory is used to fuse high spatial resolution remote sensing data and correct the pixel brightness of the fused multispectral image. The initial data are normalized, the feature of spectral image is extracted, the convolution neural network classification model is constructed, and the remote sensing image is segmented. Experimental results show that the proposed method takes shorter time and has higher accuracy for high spatial resolution image segmentation. High spatial resolution remote sensing data classification is more efficient, and the accuracy of data classification and remote sensing image fusion are more ideal.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continental earthquakes, especially shallow earthquakes, can cause disasters in populated areas. On 20 May 2016, a moderate magnitude earthquake (Mw 6.0) ruptured on Northern Territory of Australia. With the aim of seismic hazard assessment, coseismic and postsesmic deformation of the Petermann earthquake has been determined using ALOS-2 ascending and Sentinel-1A descending images. The coseismic deformation field suggests that the earthquake ruptured in the NNW direction with a length of about 20 km, a rake angle of 57.1 degrees and a moment magnitude of Mw 6.06. The maximum slip of 1.31 m can be observed at the depth of 1.25 km. The small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR was utilized to obtain the postseismic deformation from 69 Sentinel-1A images in a descending orbit. The spatiotemporal evolution of the postseismic deformation presents a gradually decaying trend, with a maximum displacement of 5.4 cm within 858 days after the mainshock. Our afterslip model suggests that the maximum slip of 0.28 m occurred at the depth of 0.25 km with a slight shift to the northwest compared to the coseismic slip. The static Coulomb failure stress (CFS) changes at various depths were calculated, indicating the consistency between high loaded stress zones and aftershock distribution. (c) 2021 COSPAR.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the Great Mekong Subregion (GMS) has experienced dramatic changes in impervious surface areas (ISA) during the last few decades, which have a profound impact on human society and ecosystems. To quantify the impacts of rapid urbanization, it is essential to examine spatial distribution and dynamic change of ISA in the GMS. Thus we the applied object-based image analysis (OBIA) method to map ISA in the GMS from 1992 to 2019 using nighttime light data and Landsat images. Meanwhile, spatiotemporal changes of ISA across the GMS during the study period were analyzed. Our results show that (1) the OBIA algorithm was effective for mapping ISA in the GMS, with the overall accuracy reaching 92.28%. (2) The ISA in the GMS reached 17671.47 km(2) in 2019, which is 4.36 times more than that in 1992. (3) The increase of ISA in the GMS mainly occurred in 10 metropolitan cities with the highest population densities, accounting for similar to 93% of the GMS's total in 2019. There are different possible major driving factors for each city and member state. Monitoring the spatiotemporal changes of ISA in rapidly urbanized areas is crucial for promoting sustainable urban development and reducing the impact of urbanization.

TI  - 'Blessed is the One who Stands in the Beginning' (L. 18): Revisiting Protological Eschatology in the Gospel of Thomas
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its (re)discovery, the Gospel of Thomas has been a central site of debate in the study of Christian origins. Some scholars regard Thomas as a 'fifth gospel'; others an 'anti-Jewish' text dependent on the Synoptics. This article revisits one of Thomas's most distinctive themes: protological eschatology. This article argues that logion 18 represents a worldview characterized by an Urzeit/Endzeit correlation, a motif relatively common in apocalyptic Judaism, and reminiscent of arguments from creation characteristic of the historical Jesus.

TI  - Satellite model of<i> foF2</i> in winter high-latitude ionosphere describing the trough structure
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An empirical foF2 model was constructed for the winter high-latitude ionosphere taking into account the structure of the ionization trough. This model describes the trough position and its shape in terms of longitudinal-latitudinal variations in foF2 in geographic latitude intervals of 40-85 degrees N and 40-85 degrees S. The model is valid for November to February in the Northern hemisphere and May-August in the Southern hemisphere. The simulation describes quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp from 0 to 3+ for all local time (LT) and universal time (UT) hours at any solar activity level in the interval F10.7 = 70-200 s.f.u. The model is based on the Cosmos-900, Interkosmos-19 and CHAMP satellite data. The radio occultation observation data obtained from the GRACE, CHAMP and COSMIC/FORMOSAT experiments were partially used. The International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) was also used; thus, the ground-based station data were indirectly considered. Within the model framework, the variations in the trough minimum position with longitude and local time were identified and studied in detail. The latitudinal and longitudinal variations in foF2 were also revealed and investigated. The constructed model more adequately reproduces variations in foF2 than the IRI-2016 model. The new model is available on the IZMIRAN website: http://www.izmiran.ru/ionosphere/sm-mit/. (c) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remote Sensing Big Data Analysis of the Lower Yellow River Ecological Environment Based on Internet of Things
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper collects data on the ecological environment of the lower Yellow River through an IoT approach and provides an in-depth analysis of the ecological remote sensing big data. An impervious fusion of multisource remote sensing data cooperation and multimachine learning algorithm cooperation is proposed. The water surface extraction method has improved the extraction accuracy of the construction land and rural settlements in the Yellow River Delta. The data system, big data management platform, and application scenarios of the environmental data resource center are designed specifically, respectively. Based on the spherical mesh information structure to sort out environmental data, an environmental data system containing data characteristics such as information source, timeliness, and presentation is formed. According to the characteristics of various types of environmental data, the corresponding data access, storage, and analysis support system is designed to form the big data management platform. Strengthen the construction of ecological interception projects for farmland receding water. Speed up the construction of sewage treatment facilities. Carry out waste and sewage pipeline network investigation, speed up the construction of urban sewage collection pipeline network, and improve the waste and sewage collection rate and treatment rate. The management platform adopts the Hadoop framework, which is conducive to the storage of massive data and the utilization of unstructured data. Combined with the relevant national policy requirements and the current environmental protection work status, the application scenarios of environmental big data in environmental decision-making, supervision, and public services are sorted out to form a complete data resource center framework. Gray correlation analysis is used to identify the key influencing factors of different types of cities to elaborate the contents of the construction of water ecological civilization in different types of cities and to build a framework of ideas for the construction of urban water ecological civilization to improve the health of urban water ecological civilization. To realize the sustainable development of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, blind logging and reclamation should be avoided in the process of land development, and more efforts should be made to protect tamarisk scrub and reed scrub, which are vegetation communities with positive effects on the regional ecological environment. In urban planning, the proportion of green area and water area within the city should be reasonably increased, so that the city can develop towards a livable city that is more conducive to human-land harmony and sustainability.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes and practices related to influenza and influenza vaccine among healthcare workers in Chongqing, China-a cross-sectional study
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza is associated with a substantial disease burden, and influenza vaccination is recommended to all healthcare workers. We aimed to assess healthcare workers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices about influenza and its vaccine in Chongqing, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted at selected hospitals from September to November 2019, in which healthcare workers filled in a self-administered questionnaire. Both sentinel (42.92%) and non-sentinel hospitals (57.08%) were included. The majority were nurses (52.48%) and physicians (32.37%). Half (50.42%) of the respondents had a good command of knowledge, and the proportion of healthcare workers having a positive attitude accounted for 62.68%. The primary information sources were colleagues (58.81%), followed by television, newspapers and media (30.18%). The number of healthcare workers reported having got vaccinated last year was only 237 (16.78%), and the main reason was protecting themselves from influenza (93.25%). While the most common reasons given for not getting vaccinated were having no time (65.70%), believing it is unnecessary to get vaccinated (29.62%), worrying about the quality of influenza vaccine (27.49%) or the adverse reactions (25.70%). Factors associated with self-reported high vaccination were sentinel hospital (aOR: 1.427; 95% CI: 1.057-1.925), high-risk department (aOR: 1.919; 95% CI: 1.423-2.589), positive attitude (aOR: 2.429; 95% CI: 1.697-3.477) and taking the initiative to learn influenza information (aOR: 3.000; 95% CI: 1.983-4.538). We concluded that healthcare workers in Chongqing had some misconceptions although many of them showed a positive attitude toward the influenza vaccine. Various strategies, including educational training and on-site vaccination, are necessary to improve the knowledge and overall vaccination coverage.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Infants aged <6 months are vulnerable to severe influenza disease and no vaccine is approved for use in this age group. We aimed to describe the epidemiology, risk factors associated with severe outcomes and management of influenza in Australian infants aged Incident cases aged <6 months of laboratory-confirmed influenza were captured through two national active prospective sentinel hospital-based surveillance systems in Australia from 2011 to 2019, inclusive. Demographic and clinical features, disease risk factors and outcomes (intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of stay) and oseltamivir use were analysed. The proportion of infant influenza hospitalisations and nosocomial cases among all hospitalisations were also reported. Results Of 680 hospitalised infants aged <6 months, 57.9% were male and 14.5% were Indigenous Australian. Median age was 2.6 months, 19.2% were born premature and 19.0% had a comorbidity, excluding prematurity. Overall, 77.9% had influenza A. Nosocomial cases accounted for 7.8%. ICU admission occurred in 14.7% and oseltamivir was prescribed for 18.8%. Factors associated with ICU admission included age <1 month (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.47-10.60), comorbidity (aOR 7.69, 95% CI: 4.04-14.64) and prematurity (aOR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.40-4.81). The proportion of infants with influenza among all infant hospitalisations ranged 1.0-2.6% in the 2019 influenza season. Conclusion Infants aged <6 months, and particularly neonates, experience serious disease from influenza. This data underpins the need for preventative strategies such as maternal immunisation and continued investigation into the possibility of safe and efficacious vaccination prior to 6 months of age.

M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the growing energy demand and the eminent global warming, there is special interest in the prediction of irradiance based on the reflectance obtained from satellites such as NASA Landsat, since it allows to know where it is more efficient to place photovoltaic receivers. Although there are studies for obtaining regression models with alternative Kernel functions, their performance for classification models is unknown and it is here where this research focuses. The study couples alternative Kernel functions to the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm for classification problems, where the best configuration for these algorithms is explored to finally obtain a set of irradiance maps zoned by class.

TI  - Method for geostationary satellite thermal infrared data simulation from polar-orbiting MODIS sensors
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation of thermal images plays an important role in the pre-evaluation of the data acquisition characteristics of sensors. This work addressed an operational method for the time-series thermal infrared (TIR) data of geostationary satellite simulated from polar-orbiting MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors based on Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) under cloud-free conditions. The data procedure, including the land surface emissivity (LSE), time-series land surface temperature (LST), time-series atmospheric parameters, sensor performance, can be described as follows. Firstly, MODIS LST product filtering rules are developed due to its data quality. Then, a Diurnal Temperature Cycle (DTC) model with four parameters is used to acquire the time-series LSTs. The spatial and spectral matching method are adopted from MODIS LST&LSE product. A temporal interpolation method is used to obtain the time-series atmospheric parameters from the atmospheric profile provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Then, the time-series TIR data at sensors were modeled using this method. Compared with the time-series TOA brightness temperature of MSG/ SEVIRI geostationary satellite, the results show that the modeling accuracy is achieved with root mean square errors (RMSEs) 2.39K, 2.81K, 1.06K, and 1.29K at MODIS overpass times, and the mean and RMSE are -0.09K and 1.61K for all cloud-free pixels at the UTC time spanning from 08:00 to 05:00, which can be well reconstruct the time-series real scenes using the proposed method.

T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The restriction of mobility due to preventive social isolation has improved air quality in many regions of the world. At the same time, global and regional atmospheric phenomena such as biomass burning or dust transport from Sahara can exacerbate particulate matter (PM) mass. In this study, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were evaluated in industrial and urban areas during the lockdown period due to COVID-19 in northern Colombia. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations obtained from the spaceborne MODIS (MOD04-3k) and the active fire data was obtained from VIIRS Active Fire. We measured surface contamination at several stations to quantify the PM10 and PM2.5 changes associated with the general closure of anthropogenic and industrial activities driven by COVID-19 and by the macroscale and/or mesoscale contributions. In the industrial zone, a slight decrease in daily concentrations was detected at the stations located near the mining operations. In the urban area, the decrease is more salient in COVID-19 lockdown. A reduction rate in the daily averages of PM10 of 23.3%, 6.0%, and 19.0% was observed in the SCa, SBi, and SUn stations, respectively. The biomass burning episode has contributed 52% to the daily average of PM10 and 45% to the daily average of PM2.5. The episode due to the passage of Saharan dust through the Caribbean Sea has contributed 79% to the daily average of PM10 (150.75 mu g/m3) and on 57% to the daily average of PM2.5.

TI  - Celebrating 75 Years of Wisconsin's Northern Highland Fishery Research Area: The Past, Present, and Future
T2  - FISHERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - On June 20, 2021, the Northern Highland Fishery Research Area (NHFRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary of continuous fisheries population monitoring and compulsory angler creel census on five lakes in northern Wisconsin. In 1946, five lakes were designated as experimental fisheries research lakes and all anglers have been required to adhere to the compulsory creel census to record catch information. We review the history of the NHFRA, its role in evaluating experimental regulations, how data derived from the NHFRA were paramount in developing a critical Walleye Sander vitreus management plan for a joint tribal subsistence and recreational angling fishery, discuss the NHFRA as a training ground for early career fisheries professionals, and speculate on its future. By learning from the past and adapting to new challenges and emerging fisheries research needs, the NHFRA is poised to add to its 75-year legacy of research and training to inform science-based decision making and to prepare generations of new fisheries professionals. The 75-year history of the NHFRA exemplifies the importance of adaptation, long-term data, establishing sentinel lakes for observations of environmental change, field stations, and partnerships for successful fisheries management.

TI  - Mapping carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization zones in Yahyali Province (Eastern Taurus-Turkey) using ASTER data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first record of the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in Turkey dates back to the Roman period. The carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in Turkey are economically important and found in the Aladaglar - Zamanti Province. Mineral exploration and geological mapping through the utilization of the traditional geological method still remain very challenging in many high terrains (High mountains). In this study, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) remote sensing data were used for mapping the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in the Yahyali region of Turkey. The Band Ratio (BR), Least square fitting method (Ls-fit), Band Ratio Color Composite (BRCC), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to map the Pb-Zn mineralization zone. The results of this investigation show the spatial distribution of Fe-Mg - OH/CO3, hydroxyl-bearing and iron oxide minerals. Field work and laboratory analysis were carried out to verify the occurrence of alteration zones and highly prospective locations and to confirm the availability of alteration and potential zones of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization in the study area. Spatial correlation and distribution were observed between the previous geological map, active and abandoned mines, and the result obtained from the remote sensing data. Different techniques applied to the Aster data image in this study are recommended for carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn and lithological mapping in hostile terrains. (c) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A machine learning approach for accurate crop type mapping using combined SAR and optical time series data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A country's food needs mainly depend upon its agriculture resources and require reliable information related to crop health, distribution, and acreage estimation to manage and monitor resources to implement a sustainable agricultural system. Different methodologies have been used to collect this information. However, the availability of earth resource satellite data with improved spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, such as the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program satellites Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2), are creating more practicability to generate crop type maps. S1 and S2, both operating in a constellation of twin satellites, carry a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multispectral Instrument (MSI). Vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH), and vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) channels of S1 were used to exploit the temporal backscatter of crops present in the study area. In this research, a machine learning random forest classification algorithm is used for accurate crop type mapping through the combination of SAR (S1) and optical (S2) time-series data. Random forest classifier has produced considerable improved accuracies of crop type mapping in previous studies as it uses ensemble decision trees trained on sample data which permit the vote in favor of the most popular land use/ land cover class. The key objectives of this study are to investigate the classification accuracies for different data combinations. Three plots of data are tested (i) S1 (ii) S2 (iii) S1 & S2. A combination of SAR and optical data turn out with the best overall accuracy of 97% and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. Space-borne SAR and optical data add a new aspect of crop type mapping, which increases the classification accuracy by including valuable parameters and beating the drawbacks of each other. By comparing the results, it can be concluded that combining all-weather accessible SAR and spectrally rich optical data accomplished more accurate outcomes. It would be an imperative advance for the future endeavor to estimate crop biomass and biophysical parameters. (c) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Method of calculating land surface temperatures based on the low-altitude UAV thermal infrared remote sensing data and the near-ground meteorological data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous urbanization has greatly changed the underlying surfaces, which leads to great impacts on the urban thermal environment. The land surface temperatures (LSTs) have gained considerable attention as a typical indicator for studying the urban thermal environment. Accounting for the deficiency of existing calculation methods in calculation principle of LSTs from the low-altitude thermal infrared remote (TIR) sensing data, this study proposes a method to retrieve the LSTs at a block scale with high temporal and spatial resolution for the effective evaluation of micro urban thermal environment. Thus, the thermal infrared radiation transmission equation is rewritten according to the actual thermal infrared transmission process. The final calculation form of LSTs is given, in which the multi-source data is employed. Ultimately, to verify the accuracy of this method in calculating the LSTs, an application case is designed. The results indicate that the temperature differences between the calculated LSTs and the measured LSTs ranges from -1.73 K to 1.45 K, and the absolute accuracy of the method is 0.09 K based on the correctly obtained multi-source data. This method is available for the quantitative analysis of the urban thermal environment and urban heat island effect at a block scale.

TI  - Middle and low latitudes hemispheric asymmetries in ΣO/N2 and TEC during intense magnetic storms of solar cycle 24
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We have investigated the global hemispheric differences in thermospheric Sigma O/N-2 and its impact on the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) at mid- and low-latitudes. Four intense storms of solar cycle 24 (SC-24) have been considered, three of them occurred in Spring equinox and one in Summer solstice season. It is found that the mid-latitudes region has exhibited a large decrease in Sigma O/N-2 during all the phases of the storms under consideration, which corresponds well to the observed negative storm effects. This decrease is directly related with the storm intensity. The maximum reduction in the Sigma O/N-2 is observed for the St. Patrick day storm of 2015 (which was the most intense geomagnetic storm of SC-24), whereas the respective minimum decrease is found for the storm of April 2012. Strong hemispheric asymmetries, in Sigma O/N-2 variation, have been observed at the mid-latitudes sector, and can be associated with the asymmetric energy input as indicated by polar cap (PC) indices. The high speed solar winds streams (HSSWs) during the recovery phases of March 2013 and 2015 storms have caused a significant reduction in Sigma O/N-2 at mid-latitudes, which could not be reproduced by the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere electrodynamics (CTIPe) model. On the other hand the low-latitudes region depicts an enhancement in Sigma O/N-2 during all the storms except for the early recovery phases. The positive storm effect at low-latitudes agrees well with this Sigma O/N-2 increase, thus indicating that the composition change is one of the major drivers of TEC enhancement at low-latitudes. The CTIPe model showed discrepancies in reproducing the satellite data for all the considered storms, especially during the recovery phases. Furthermore, the model is failed to replicate the hemispheric asymmetries at low and mid-latitudes during the main and early recovery phases. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Impact of Mortality Salience on Purchase Intention and Creativity Evaluation on Products During COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the environment of COVID-19, people are faced with mortality salience (MS) and socioeconomic crisis. According to the terror management theory, the MS would lead to particular consumption attitudes and behaviors caused by the self-esteem and cultural worldview defense. The creativity as a potential value of products needs to be examined to explore how the MS changed the creativity evaluation of three types of products categorized into normal, renovative, and innovative products, based on the degree of originality (Zhang et al., 2019). Two experiments were conducted to examine (1) the MS effect on the creativity and purchase intention evaluation and (2) both MS and country-of-origin effect on the evaluations. The results show that usefulness and purchase intention are affected by both effects, and the novelty is mainly affected by MS.

TI  - The feasibility of patient reported outcome measures for the care of penile cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UROLOGICAL NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When used in routine clinical practice, Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMS) can give patients tacit approval to discuss embarrassing topics, which could be particularly useful for urological nursing. The aim of this study was to assess whether it would be feasible to use two such measures for penile cancer; one for body image (the Male Genital Self-Image Scale; MGSIS-5) and another for lymphedema (the Groin and Lower Limb Lymphedema questionnaire; G3L-20). Study packs were posted to penile cancer patients who had received (i) sentinel node biopsy only, (ii) inguinal node dissection only, and (iii) inguinal node dissection with post-operative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The two measures (MGSIS-5 and G3L-20) were complemented with those specific to sexual function (IIEF) and cancer (EORTC-QLQ-C30 version 3) and a modified Lymphoedema Genitourinary Cancer Questionnaire (mLGUCQ). Twenty patients returned questionnaires. Validity and reliability analyses are presented but low participant numbers mean that results need treating with caution. Results show sufficient feasibility for the MGSIS-5 and the G3L-20 to warrant another study to attract larger numbers of participants, either over a longer time frame or at multiple sites. In these further studies, we would recommend adding (1) more Likert responses, (2) the timeframe to the MGIS and (3) exploring either the use of sexual desire psychometric measures or the addition of sexual desire items to the MGSIS for this patient group.

TI  - The potential of nighttime light remote sensing data to evaluate the development of digital economy: A case study of China at the city level
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the new and crucial fields of economic development, the digital economy refers to the economic activities associated with digital technologies and information. The traditional measurement mainly relies on the statistical data, which are regionally specific and labour cost. As an appropriate proxy for socio-economic activities, nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data was used in this study to explore its potential in estimating the digital economy. Then, the Zipf's law was used to evaluate the growth of the digital economy at the city level. The results show that the total NTL intensity has a logarithmic relationship with the digital economy index and can be estimated for each cities' digital economy growth in China from 2017 to 2020 (R (2) approximate to 0.7). An unbalanced distribution and a decentralized polycentric structure of digital economy are found among all cities in China. But the top 100 cities have a relative harmonious development with a better goodness of Zipf's law. Finally, four main incentives behind the digital economy growth were concluded for three stages of the digital economy growth. This study could enrich the understanding of digital economy and have valuable implications for its future growth in China.

TI  - Effects of riparian vegetation on evapotranspiration processes and water quality of small plain streams
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian vegetation provides a wide range of ecosystem services including water quality regulation, flooding avoidance, and the natural control of stream temperatures. Changes in land use and the increase of anthropogenic activities in the proximity of rivers affect the growth and development of riparian buffers. The aim of the work was to assess the effects of riparian vegetation on the evapotranspiration processes and the water quality of small plain streams using remote sensing resources and in-situ monitoring. The area of study considered two neighboring basins of small plain streams (Glavacioc and Ilfov) from Romania. The data obtained from in-situ monitoring performed in 2019 was used in the Penman-Monteith algorithm to calculate the potential evapotranspiration (PET) based on a series of specific parameters. The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), computed from LANDSAT 8 images, has been used to assess the vegetation status at the basin scale. The GNDVI fluctuations were linked to the variations in precipitation regimes and land use modifications. Remote sensing data have shown changes in GNDVI between June and September 2019 in both riparian areas resulting in an intense spread of cattail (Typha spp.). Surface waters arriving at the entrance control sections had a basic pH and were loaded with nitrates and ammonium ion (NH4+), which had decreased at the downstream section after passing the cattail phytosociological associations and the riparian patches, thus acting as buffer areas. The current anthropogenic pressures on the riparian areas might have degenerative effects on the integrity of the vegetation structure. Thus, for effective and sustainable management, it is essential to identify the main stressors and to assess to what extent they affect the riparian ecosystem as a whole.

TI  - The effect of Christianity on the tradition and culture of the Idoma people of Nigeria: A comparative study
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Some of the traditions and cultural beliefs and practices of the Idoma people of Nigeria have been influenced both positively and negatively as a result of the advent of Christianity in the area. The aim of this research is to investigate some of the cultural beliefs and practices of the Idoma people before the advent of Christianity, the people's response to the new faith and the propelling factors behind the responses of the people. In doing so, a comparative study on these beliefs and practices after the advent of Christianity in Idoma traditional society was done. The study adopts a qualitative phenomenological research design and descriptive method for data analysis. Personal interviews form a primary source of data collection, while the secondary source includes library sources. This method of study was chosen to allow the data collected to speak for themselves without any interference from the researchers. The study unveils that the advent of Christianity in the Idoma traditional society had some impact and consequences on the traditional and cultural practices of the people, such as death and burial ceremonies, the Aje-alekwu festival and widowhood practices among others. The study recommends that there should be a synergy between Idoma traditional beliefs and practices and Christianity for peaceful co-existence, progress and development in the area. Contribution: It is erroneously believed that in the contemporary society, traditional religious practices are going to die and become a thing of the past. However, one would observe from this study that Idoma people still hold their traditional beliefs and practices in high esteem despite the influence of Christianity in the area.

TI  - Richer of Senones and the peculiar story of Sibylla of Marsal: pseudo-sanctity, mendicants and the end of the world in the <i>Gesta Senoniensis Ecclesiae</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDIEVAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the story of a thirteenth-century pseudo-saint named Sibylla of Marsal, as told by contemporary monk and chronicler Richer of Senones in Book 4 of his Gesta Senoniensis Ecclesiae. According to Richer, Sibylla achieved local fame as a holy woman by feigning sanctity using various props, including a demon costume that she wore to frighten villagers. By analysing the organisation of Book 4 of the Gesta, this study explores the context and motivations for Richer's portrayal of Sibylla and first situates Sibylla within Richer's apocalyptic worldview. Sibylla's story also offered Richer an opportunity to denigrate the mendicant orders. Finally, Sibylla's chapter in the Gesta reveals Richer's distrust of emerging methods for discerning spirits.

TI  - Primary Small Cell Malignancies of the Breast: Are They Rare Malignancies?
T2  - ACTA CYTOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - In contrast with the other organs such as the lung, small cell tumors have been less studied in the breast due to their relatively less frequency. Although rare, neuroendocrine neoplasms, some lymphomas, and some small cell sarcomas such as undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma can be seen in small cell morphology in the breast. Many cytological specimens such as fine-needle aspiration biopsies and touch imprint cytology are used for diagnosis and further prognostic/predictive marker determination in primary breast masses, sentinel and axillary lymph nodes, and metastatic masses. Lobular carcinoma deserves to be considered in the small cell tumor group because of its small, monomorphic, discohesive, scant cytoplasmic cytological features. Since so many different types of tumors in the breast can have small cell characteristics, they should be divided into small cell neuroendocrine tumors and small cell nonneuroendocrine tumors. When evaluating small cell breast tumors cytologically, wide tumor diversity should be kept in mind, and clinical, hematological, and radiological features should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Monitoring global reservoirs using ICESat-2: Assessment on spatial coverage and application potential
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is essential for monitoring surface water dynamics on Earth. Space-borne altimeter observations have become an important data source to supplement in-situ measurements of water levels. The applications of satellite radar altimetry in monitoring reservoirs at global or regional scales have been well demonstrated in many previous studies. However, studies on medium- and small-sized reservoirs are limited due to the coarser footprints and relatively low vertical accuracy. In anticipation of new satellite laser altimetry missions, we aim to demonstrate the coverage performance of ICESat-2 for global reservoirs and to further explore its application potential in monitoring the long-term changes in water level and storage of reservoirs by integrating Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets. In the first 18 months of the ICESat-2 mission, we find that ICESat-2 observations can cover 6231 out of 7250 reservoirs worldwide inventoried in the GRanD database with a size ranging from 0.1 km(2) to 67166.2 km(2), which accounts for nearly 86% in count and about 99% in area and capacity for the whole of GRanD-inventoried reservoir. We then select 40 reservoirs of different sizes and shapes located in different continents to establish the hypsometric curves. Most of these reservoirs show robust fitting in the hypsometric curves, with the R-2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.99 and the RMSE values from 0.37 m to 1.01 m. As a new global satellite altimetry dataset, ICESat-2 shows excellent potential in reconstructing long-term water levels with the hypsometric curve method for various reservoirs. We also find that the ICESat-2 ATL13 product misses a small proportion of reservoirs for various reasons, including their small size, latitudinal narrow shape, and data inconsistency between the HydroLAKES as water mask of the ICESat-2 ATL13 product and the updated GRanD data sets. With the continued observation of ICESat-2 and possibly updated inland water body mask for the ATL13 product in the future, many reservoirs can be routinely monitored with high accuracy. Our findings confirm the powerful capacity of ICESat-2 and are expected to enhance our understanding of reservoir behavior in global hydrological processes and water resource management.

TI  - Benchmarking statistical modelling approaches with multi-source remote sensing data for millet yield monitoring: a case study of the groundnut basin in central Senegal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sub-Saharan Africa, smallholder farms play a key role in agriculture, occupying most of the agricultural land. Design policies for increasing smallholder productivity remains a safe way to establish sustainable food systems and boost local economies. However, efforts are still needed in order to achieve accurate and timely monitoring in smallholder farming systems. With the advent of modern Earth Observation programmes such as the Sentinel satellites, which provide quasi-synchronous and high-resolution multi-source information over any area of the continental surfaces, new opportunities are opened up to accurately map crop yields in smallholder farming systems. This study intends to estimate and forecast millet yields in central Senegal, making the use of multi-source (synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and optical) image time series and state-of-the-art machine learning models. A Random Forest (RF) model explained up to 50% of the millet yield variability, while deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) showed promise results but performed lower. We also found that the concatenation of SAR polarizations and vegetation indices improved our crop yield modelling, but such improvement was tightly related to the modelling approach, namely RF and CNN. Using RF to forecast millet yields, we achieved stable and satisfactory accuracy 2 weeks before the harvest period.

TI  - Intercomparison of global terrestrial carbon fluxes estimated by MODIS and Earth system models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth system models (ESMs) have been widely used to simulate global terrestrial carbon fluxes, including gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). Assessment of such GPP and NPP products can be valuable for understanding the efficacy of certain ESMs in simulating the global carbon cycle and future climate impacts. In this work, we studied the model performance of 22 ESMs participating in the fifth and sixth phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) by comparing historical GPP and NPP simulations with satellite data from MODIS and further evaluating potential model improvement from CMIP5 to CMIP6. In CMIP6, the average global total GPP and NPP estimated by the 22 ESMs are 16% and 13% higher than MODIS data, respectively. The multi-model ensembles (MME) of the 22 ESMs can fairly reproduce the spatial distribution, zonal distribution and seasonal variations of both GPP and NPP from MODIS. They perform much better in simulating GPP and NPP for grasslands, wetlands, croplands and other biomes than forests. However, there are noticeable differences among individual ESM simulations in terms of overall fluxes, temporal and spatial flux distributions, and fluxes by biome and region. The MME consistently outperforms all individual models in nearly every respect. Even though several ESMs have been improved in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5, there is still much work to be done to improve individual ESM and overall CMIP performance. Future work needs to focus on more comprehensive model mechanisms and parametrizations, higher resolution and more reasonable coupling of land surface schemes and atmospheric/oceanic schemes.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural network with random field model for lake ice mapping from Sentinel-1 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely information on lake ice cover conditions is critical in support of commercial shipping, winter-road transportation, and winter leisure activities such as snowmobiling and ice fishing. Monitoring of lake ice extent and ice phenology (i.e. dates associated with freeze-up/break-up and ice duration) is also valuable for improving numerical weather prediction (NWP) and for climate monitoring. The availability of free synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 A/B constellation provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop operational algorithms for lake ice cover mapping at a temporal frequency not available until now from SAR missions (ca. every 1-5 days depending on latitude). For NWP, rapid and accurate mapping of ice cover and open water areas in lake-rich regions is required. However, the classification of SAR imagery using traditional machine learning (ML) approaches is challenging due to the large data volume generated by imaging systems such as Sentinel-1 SAR as well as the complexity of radar signatures as a function of sensor and target characteristics. For lakes specifically, radar backscatter can vary greatly with incidence angle, polarization and surface properties (e.g. calm and wind-roughed open water, new thin ice, surface roughness due to the presence of pressure ridges, ice type, melting of ice and on-ice snow). To address the challenge of large-scale lake ice mapping, we investigate the GPU-boosted deep neural network approach that is efficient at handling big complex data. In this paper, we design a novel maximum a posterior (MAP) approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and conditional random field (CRF) for better addressing the challenges of operational lake ice mapping. The proposed approach is tested on 17 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization (VV and VH) SAR images, where eight are used for training and validation and nine used for out-of-sample testing. To identify the optimal network architecture, an independent validation set is used to evaluate the performance of a series of six CNNs with increasing model complexity. The best model overcomes the noise effect in Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and the lake ice signature ambiguity issue; it achieves average classification accuracies of 97.10% and 97.14% for open water and ice, respectively, on the validation set. Moreover, the best model outperforms the last-ranked model by about 2% in terms of mean overall accuracy (OA), demonstrating the improvement and importance of model selection. The use of CRF can consistently improve the CNN by reducing the artefacts and noise effect in ice maps, outperforming the CNN model when used alone by about 3% in terms of mean OA on the validation set. The proposed CNN-CRF approach also achieves high accuracy on the nine test scenes, achieving a mean OA of 93.10%, demonstrating strong generalization capability that is important for SAR lake ice mapping.

TI  - A multi-year cross-validation experiment for estimating rice plant area index (PAI) over the JECAM-India test site from simulated RADARSAT constellation mission (RCM) compact polarimetric SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the cross-validation approach, strategies for estimating biophysical parameters are still pre-operational with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In this regard, the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) SAR inter-comparison experiments provide an opportunity for the potential implementation of cross-validation strategies for biophysical parameters retrieval utilizing the next-generation compact polarimetric (CP) modes available from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). This work first uses the conventional semi-empirical Water Cloud Model (WCM) modified by exploiting the scattering power decompositions of CP measurements to estimate the Plant Area Index (PAI) for rice. The modified WCM (MWCM) is then inverted using the scattering power components from the iS Omega decomposition. We compare the PAI estimates using MWCM-iS Omega between the estimates obtained from (1) the conventional WCM using the RH and RV backscatter intensities and (2) MWCM-m. decomposition scattering powers. We exploit a time series of simulated compactpol SAR data over the JECAM test site in Vijayawada, India, throughout 2018 and 2019. We use the C-band RADARSAT-2 full-pol data to simulate the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) compact-pol mode data. Utilizing the advantage of systematically collected multi-year SAR data and in-situ measurements, the present research also assesses the calibrated model transferability performances to another data set and cross-validation of a model in a multi-year experiment setting. The comparative analysis indicates potential improvements in PAI estimation with MWCM-iS Omega scattering powers. A high range of correlation coefficient (r = 0:84. 0:06) between the estimated and observed PAI is observed with good Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0:778 perpendicular to 0:107 m2 m-2, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0:601 +/- 0:103 m(2) m(-2).

TI  - Demonstration of large area forest volume and primary production estimation approach based on Sentinel-2 imagery and process based ecosystem modelling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass and carbon monitoring play a key role in climate change mitigation. Operational large area monitoring approaches are needed to enable forestry stakeholders to meet the increasing monitoring and reporting requirements. Here, we demonstrate the functionality of a cloud-based approach utilizing Sentinel-2 composite imagery and process-based ecosystem model to produce large area forest volume and primary production estimates. We describe the main components of the approach and implementation of the processing pipeline into the Forestry TEP cloud processing platform and produce four large area output maps: (1) Growing stock volume (GSV), (2) Gross primary productivity (GPP), (3) Net primary productivity (NPP) and (4) Stem volume increment (SVI), covering Finland and the Russian boreal forests until the Ural Mountains in 10 m spatial resolution. The accuracy of the forest structural variables evaluated in Finland reach pixel level relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values comparable to earlier studies (basal area 39.4%, growing stock volume 58.5%, diameter 35.5% and height 33.5%), although most of the earlier studies have concentrated on smaller study areas. This can be considered a positive sign for the feasibility of the approach for large area primary production modelling, since forest structural variables are the main input for the process-based ecosystem model used in the study. The full coverage output maps show consistent quality throughout the target area, with major regional variations clearly visible, and with noticeable fine details when zoomed into full resolution. The demonstration conducted in this study lays foundation for further development of an operational large area forest monitoring system that allows annual reporting of forest biomass and carbon balance from forest stand level to regional analyses. The system is seamlessly aligned with process based ecosystem modelling, enabling forecasting and future scenario simulation.

TI  - Testing ASTER and Sentinel-2 MSI Images to Discriminate Igneous and Metamorphic Rock Units in the Chadormalu Paleocrater, Central Iran
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last fifty years, satellite images have been used to map the Earth's surface at a variety of scales. Two satellite multispectral sensors (Sentinel-2 MSI and ASTER) have great utility for lithological discrimination in areas of good rock exposures. This study was conducted in order to test the ability of these sensors to discriminate igneous and metamorphic lithologies in the Chadormalu paleocrater and evaluate the image types and processing methodologies. The MNF (Minimum Noise Fraction) transform, Mathematical Evaluation Method (MEM), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Mixture Tuned Matched Filter (MTMF), and band ratios were performed on near and short wave infrared ASTER and Sentinel-2 bands. Comparison of the results from several methods demonstrates that the MEM method can detect lithological units with very low false detection and better matching with ground truth data. Moreover, this study indicates that the results produced by the MEM algorithm on Sentinel-2 MSI data are more accurate than the results produced with ASTER data in the same area. Therefore, the MEM algorithm seems to be well suited for image classification involving multispectral databases such as ASTER and Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - A novel unsupervised forest change detection method based on the integration of a multiresolution singular value decomposition fusion and an edge-aware Markov Random Field algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a leading natural wealth, forests play an essential role in the development and prosperity of countries. Hence, monitoring their changes can lead to proper management and planning in conserving these resources. This study presents a novel unsupervised forest change detection method comprising two main steps: (1) generating a reliable difference image, i.e. sensitive to forest changes, and (2) producing a change map in which forest changes and their details (e.g. edges) are well characterized. In step (1), the vegetation indices- and spectral-based difference images were first calculated using a novel weighted angular operator. Afterwards, the difference images were combined using the 2D-multiresolution singular value decomposition (2D-MSVD) fusion approach to generate a noise-resistant difference image, in which forest changes are accurately highlighted. In step (2), the expectation-maximization gaussian mixture model (EMGMM) was first applied to the fused difference image to reach an initial binary change map. Next, an edge-aware MRF (EAMRF) model was initialized by the EMGMM-derived change map and then was adopted to achieve the final change map. Experimental results were achieved by utilizing five bi-temporal images acquired by the Landsat 5 and 8, and Sentinel 2 satellite sensors. The results indicated the efficacy of the proposed fused difference image in reflecting the forest changes. Compared with the traditional MRF method, the boundaries and geometrical shapes of changed regions were well preserved in the change maps obtained by EAMRF. The edge penalty function embedded in EAMRF also made this model converge in less running time compared to the traditional MRF algorithm. Furthermore, EAMRF outperformed the other change detection methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative results, demonstrating its high potential for forest change detection applications.

TI  - Global intercomparison of functional pyrodiversity from two satellite sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires create substantial ecosystem disturbances, which affect biodiversity and climate processes. Previously, satellite-derived burned areas were assessed, and fire patches and morphological traits related to fire spread functions identified. The cut-off value in days is a critical parameter for the algorithms used to identify fire patches, as it identifies when two contiguous burned pixels should be grouped together as one patch. Our understanding of how fire patches and their morphologies change with the cut-off values between satellite sensors is currently insufficient for model development and pyrogeographic studies. We have addressed this using the FRY v1.0 global database of fire patch functional traits, with cut-off values of 3, 5, 9, and 14 days, derived from two burned area products, the MERIS Fire_cci version 4.1 and MODIS MCD64A1 collection 6, from two satellite sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions. We intercompared the FRY products with functional diversity trait methods that assess their morphological pyrodiversity structures and dissimilarities. We have assessed the functional pyrodiversity of the FRY products with four cut-off values, for fire patches >= 300 ha, on 1 degrees resolution tiles for the world and Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) region scales, from 2005-2011. The functional structures and dissimilarities between the FRY products varied with the regions, while cut-off value sensitivity varied with the regions and between the satellite sensor products. These variations in functional structures and dissimilarities mirrored the regional fire spread processes and satellite sensor resolutions. The functional pyrodiversity that varied with the regions and similar cut-off values did not lead to the best agreement between the satellite sensor products. These variations reinforce the need to combine high temporal resolution optical sensors with radar in tropical regions, to consistently meet the monitoring requirements and for international organizations, to enable improved assessments of climate and biodiversity.

TI  - Respiratory syncytial virus in pediatric influenza-like illness cases in Lombardy, Northern Italy, during seven consecutive winter seasons (from 2014-2015 to 2020-2021)
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract illness in young children and can also cause influenza-like illness (ILI). Here we investigated the epidemiological features of RSV infection in pediatric ILI cases in Lombardy (a region in Northern Italy accounting nearly 10 million inhabitants) from 2014-2015 to 2020-2021 winter seasons. Material and Methods Data for this study were retrieved and statistically analyzed from the database of virological influenza surveillance of the regional reference laboratory for Lombardy within the Italian influenza surveillance network (InfluNet). Results RSV accounted for nearly 19% of pediatric ILI with a risk of infection nearly two-fold greater than that of individuals >= 15 years. RSV positivity rate increased to 28% considering 0-5 years old children. Although in children <= 5 years the risk of infection from influenza viruses resulted nearly two-fold higher than the risk of RSV infection, the age group 4-6 months and 7-12 months showed a five-fold greater risk of infection from RSV than from influenza. Children <= 5 years of age with pre-existing underlying health conditions had a nearly five-fold greater risk of getting RSV infection than otherwise healthy 0-5 years old children. RSV was identified in ILI cases <15 years of age in all considered winter seasons except in the 2020-2021 season. Discussion Sentinel surveillance of ILI allowed us to identify groups at higher risk of RSV and influenza infection and to define the start, duration, timing, and intensity of the RSV and influenza community circulation. This surveillance approach can be implemented to assess the RSV circulation and impact in a real-time manner.

TI  - Merkel Cell Carcinoma: Evaluation of the Clinico-Pathological Characteristics, Treatment Strategies and Prognostic Factors in a Monocentric Retrospective Series (n=143)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. The incidence of the disease has undergone a significant increase in recent years, which is caused by an increase in the average age of the population and in the use of immunosuppressive therapies. MCC is an aggressive pathology, which metastasizes early to the lymph nodes. These characteristics impose an accurate diagnostic analysis of the regional lymph node district with radiography, clinical examination and sentinel node biopsy. In recent years, there has been a breakthrough in the treatment of the advanced pathology thanks to the introduction of monoclonal antibodies acting on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. This study aimed to describe the clinico-pathological characteristics, treatment strategies and prognostic factors of MCC. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted involving 143 consecutive patients who were diagnosed and/or treated for MCC. These patients were referred to the Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS and to the University Hospital of Padua (a third-level center) in the period between December 1991 and January 2020. In the majority of cases, diagnosis took place at the IOV. However, some patients were diagnosed elsewhere and subsequently referred to the IOV for a review of the diagnosis or to begin specific therapeutic regimens. Results143 patients, with an average age of 71 years, were affected mainly with autoimmune and neoplastic comorbidities. Our analysis has shown that age, autoimmune comorbidities and the use of therapy with immunomodulating drugs (which include corticosteroids, statins and beta-blockers) are associated with a negative prognosis. In this sense, male sex is also a negative prognostic factor. ConclusionsAutoimmune and neoplastic comorbidities were frequent in the studied population. The use of drugs with immunomodulatory effects was also found to be a common feature of the population under examination. The use of this type of medication is considered a negative prognostic factor. The relevance of a multidisciplinary approach to the patient with MCC is confirmed, with the aim of assessing the risks and benefits related to the use of immunomodulating therapy in the individual patient.

TI  - Evidential data integration to produce porphyry Cu prospectivity map, using a combination of knowledge and data-driven methods
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Producing an accurate and valid mineral prospectivity map is one of the most significant parts of mineral exploration studies. For this purpose, it is needed to obtain valid evidential layers and integrate them with an accurate methodology. Knowledge and data-driven methods are two primary techniques applied to combine various evidential layers for mineral prospectivity mapping, of which each of them includes a variety of analytical techniques. In this study, in the first step, satellite data, aeromagnetic and airborne radiometric data, stream sediment geochemical data and geological data were applied to create valid remote sensing, geophysical, geochemical, lineaments and lithological evidential layers of the study area that are an essential factor in recognition porphyry copper mineralization, then in the second step, based on the known mineralization occurrences data, the evidential layers were weighted. Finally, these layers were integrated using fuzzy logic and index overlay methods in a combination of knowledge and data-driven way. Validation of each layer was done using available data in the second step. The final mineral prospectivity map was evaluated, and the confirmation of this layer detected that the final mineral prospectivity map obtained from data-driven multi-index overlay method has a higher ore prediction rate of 76%, which identifies 24% of the area as potential zones for further exploration.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Groundwater Levels in California Reveals Ecosystems at Risk
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are increasingly threatened worldwide, but the shallow groundwater resources that they are reliant upon are seldom monitored. In this study, we used satellite-based remote sensing to predict groundwater levels under groundwater dependent ecosystems across California, USA. Depth to groundwater was modelled for a 35-years period (1985-2019) within all groundwater dependent ecosystems across the state (n = 95,135). Our model was developed within Google Earth Engine using Landsat satellite imagery, climate data, and field-based groundwater data [n = 627 shallow (< 30 m) monitoring wells] as predictors in a Random Forest model. Our findings show that 1) 44% of groundwater dependent ecosystems have experienced a significant long-term (1985-2019) decline in groundwater levels compared to 28% with a significant increase; 2) groundwater level declines have intensified during the most recent two decades, with 39% of groundwater dependent ecosystems experiencing declines in the 2003-2019 period compared to 27% in the 1985-2002 period; and 3) groundwater declines are most prevalent within GDEs existing in areas of the state where sustainable groundwater management is absent. Our results indicate that declining shallow groundwater levels may be adversely impacting California's groundwater dependent ecosystems. Particularly where groundwater levels have fallen beneath plant roots or streams thereby affecting key life processes, such as forest recruitment/succession, or hydrological processes, such as streamflow that affects aquatic habitat. In the absence of groundwater monitoring well data, our model and findings can be used to help state and local water agencies fill in data gaps of shallow groundwater conditions, evaluate potential effects on GDEs, and improve sustainable groundwater management policy in California.

TI  - An analysis on deep learning approaches: addressing the challenges in remote sensing image retrieval
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A considerable volume of high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) data is generated with the intense space explorations happening globally. Remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) is a fundamental task in the remote sensing domain, providing excellent opportunities for a broad spectrum of applications. Difficulty in describing the heterogeneous remote sensing image (RSI) content and the availability in huge volumes is challenging in many analyses and certainly needs many added processing challenges. Also, the popularity of using deep learning (DL) techniques is also increased in the remote sensing domain. The practice of using DL methods to strengthen the efficiency of RSIR frameworks has a very broad prospect. Thus, HRRS data brings new challenges for deep-learning-based RSIR (DL-RSIR) tasks, especially when the data is experienced as 'big data.' This article systematically reviews many existing works, concentrating on the advancements and current trends related to DL-RSIR. Also, it narrates the challenges incorporated with the RSIR tasks and how to utilize DL techniques and frameworks to address them. Almost all potential factors that could influence the DL-RSIR performance are analysed, and many evaluations are performed with a comparative analysis. The observations and recommendations presented can help researchers to bring new insights into designing DL-RSIR frameworks.

TI  - Permafrost Dynamics and Degradation in Polar Arctic From Satellite Radar Observations, Yamal Peninsula
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate permafrost surface features revealed from satellite radar data in the Siberian arctic at the Yamal peninsula. Surface dynamics analysis based on SRTM and TanDEM-X DEMs shows up to 2 m net loss of surface relief between 2000 and 2014 indicating a highly dynamic landscape. Surface features for the past 14 years reflect an increase in small stream channels and a number of new lakes that developed, likely caused by permafrost thaw. We used Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to measure permafrost surface changes. Owing to limited observation data we analyzed only 2 years. The InSAR time-series has detected surface displacements in three distinct spatial locations during 2017 and 2018. At these three locations, 60-120 mm/yr rates of seasonal surface permafrost changes are observed. Spatial location of seasonal ground displacements aligns well with lithology. One of them is located on marine sediments and is linked to anthropogenic impact on permafrost stability. Two other areas are located within alluvial sediments and are at the top of topographic elevated zones. We discuss the influence of the geologic environment and the potential effect of local upwelling of gas. These combined analyses of InSAR time-series with analysis of geomorphic features from DEMs present an important tool for continuous process monitoring of surface dynamics as part of a global warming risk assessment.

TI  - Increasing fragmentation and squeezing of coastal wetlands: Status, drivers, and sustainable protection from the perspective of remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands arc of great ecological and economic value but face significant degradation and losses because of human activities. Nevertheless, the changes in spatiotcmporal landscape patterns, which have occurred as a result of coastal wetland losses, have not been well documented under the rapid urbanization in coastal zones. In this study, an algorithm based on periodic tidal inundations and full time-series indices was developed to map the detailed status and trends in the coastal wetlands in Fujian Province from 1994 to 2018 by using more than archived 5000 Landsat images. The results showed that in 2018, there were 1136.56 km(2) of coastal wetlands along the coast of Fujian with an overall accuracy of 95.63%, which were mainly distributed in estuaries and bays. These coastal wetlands consisted of tidal flats, low marshes, and high marshes with proportions of 84.91%, 13.05%, and 2.04%, respectively. An unprecedented loss of coastal wetlands has occurred in Fujian Province, with an annual rate of 15.44 km(2)/a from 1994 to 2018. Many coastal wetlands were reclaimed, dredged, and converted into inland areas for aquaculture ponds, ports, and built-up areas in different urbanization periods, which has led to a great loss of coastal spaces with an area of 476.87 km(2). The interplay between the loss of coastal wetlands and seaward urbanization will lead to severe fragmentation and squeezing effects in the coastal zone and will weaken the coastal protection from marine disasters that is provided by coastal wetlands. Therefore, we conceived two conceptional frameworks for sustainable coastal protection based on the current situations of the coastal communities to provide a trade-off between economic development and the protection of coastal developing countries in the world.

TI  - Seasonal trends and cycles of lake-level variations over the Tibetan Plateau using multi-sensor altimetry data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The large number of lakes, little influenced by humans, on the Tibetan Plateau, form a natural laboratory for exploring cryosphere-hydrosphere-atmosphere processes under global warming. The water levels of these alpine lakes respond directly to water balance, but are mainly known only on the interannual scale. Seasonal variations are still poorly described due to limited gauge measurements. Here, the seasonal trends and cycles of lake-level changes on the Tibetan Plateau were examined using altimetry data from ICESat (132 available lakes), Cryosat-2 (244 lakes), Sentinel-3A (125 lakes), Sentinel-3B (120 lakes), and ICESat-2 (356 lakes). Bias between altimetry data sets was removed, and a validation against in-situ lake-level measurements from Qinghai Lake between 2003 and 2020 revealed a good performance (R-2 > 0.80, RMSE < 0.12 m). The mean annual trend of lake level between 2003 and 2020 is 0.20 +/- 0.01 m/yr, with similar rates (0.18-0.20 m/yr) in three different seasons. The rate was slightly greater (0.22 +/- 0.02 m/yr) between 2010 and 2020, but seasonal trends were again similar in this period (0.21-0.25 m/yr). Declining water levels for lakes around Nam Co were identified, with a mean negative rate of -0.09 +/- 0.02 m/yr. Furthermore, during 2016-2020, an accelerated lake-level rise was found, with a mean rate of 0.43 +/- 0.05 m/yr (0.47-0.53 m/yr in four seasons). Lake levels in the southern TP are shown to have increased during 2016-2019: a reversal of the pre-2016 observations of declining levels. The seasonal cycles of lake-level variations show that the majority of lakes have a peak water level in August-September, followed by October-November. The features of the peaks vary distinctly in different climate regions, with the timing of the peak occurring gradually later as one moves from southwest to northeast. The seasonal cycles of water level and terrestrial water storage from GRACE data are highly consistent. The spatial pattern of lake-level changes during the seasonal period of rising lake levels also matches precipitation variations well, as does lake volume change with terrestrial water storage budget. The study reveals the tremendous potential of multi-sensor altimetry data for detecting seasonal features of lake-level variation, which is a great asset for understanding Earth's water dynamics and balance.

TI  - Development of a fine-resolution snow depth product based on the snow cover probability for the Tibetan Plateau: Validation and spatial-temporal analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remotely sensed snow depth (SD) data are essential for monitoring and modeling hydrological processes in cold regions. While the available passive microwave SD data have been widely used by the community, the coarse spatial resolution (typically at 0.25 degrees) of these data impedes the explicit representation of the hydrological processes in snow-dominated regions, especially in mountainous regions with complex terrain. To improve the spatial resolution and quality of passive microwave SD data for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), we develop a spatial-temporal downscaling method to produce a 19-year, daily 0.05 degrees SD product by combining the existing high temporal resolution daily SD data and the high spatial resolution 8-day cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based snow cover probability (SCP) data, the latter of which were produced using an new advanced temporal filter algorithm. Validations against the observed SD data from 92 meteorological stations suggest that the newly-developed 0.05 degrees SD product greatly improves upon the original 0.25 degrees version. Based on this 0.05 degrees SD product, we found that higher SD values are mainly distributed on the southeastern and eastern TP as well as the Himalaya and Karakoram, while much lower SD values occur on the inner TP. During 2000-2018, the TP-averaged annual SD showed a slight (p > 0.05) increasing trend because there were little changes in SD for most grids across the TP. Regarding different basins within TP, the annual SD during 2000-2018 slightly increased over most basins except for the Amu Dayra, Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Inner TP, where the basin-scale SD showed insignificant decreasing tendencies. In general, the spatial-temporal variations in the SD across the TP were very heterogeneous because SD was affected by multiple climatic factors. The newly-developed 0.05 degrees SD product could facilitate our understanding of the hydrological processes on the TP through a more explicit representation of the gridded-based snow water information.

TI  - DAGDU: center location of tropical cyclones using Deviation Angle Gradient Distribution Uniformity from infrared satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical cyclone (TC) is a strong weather system that forms on the surface of the ocean. It is important to locate the TC centre when monitoring and forecasting. Infrared geostationary satellite images are reliable sources of TC location due to their high temporal resolution and wide regional coverage. A novel method for locating the centre of tropical cyclones by deviation angle gradient distribution uniformity is proposed in this paper. A region of interest is first intercepted from an infrared image with a spatial resolution of 5 km per pixel derived from the China FY-2 C and FY-2E geostationary satellites. The Bezier histogram segmentation method and K-means clustering segmentation method are then used to obtain the binary image in which the infrared brightness temperature changes drastically. Next, Hough transformation is utilized to reduce the search range of the centre location of the tropical cyclone. Finally, the deviation angle gradient distribution uniformity matrix is calculated from each pixel in the detection area as the reference centre, and the maximum value location of the matrix is considered to be the corresponding tropical cyclone centre. The methodology of this study could achieve good performance compared with the best track data of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).

TI  - Deep learning-based landslide susceptibility mapping
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are considered as one of the most devastating natural hazards in Iran, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Landslide susceptibility maps for landslide prone areas can be used to plan for and mitigate the consequences of catastrophic landsliding events. Here, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN-DNN) for mapping landslide susceptibility, and evaluated it on the Isfahan province, Iran, which has not previously been assessed on such a scale. The proposed model was trained and validated using training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets, each containing relevant data on historical landslides, field records and remote sensing images, and a range of geomorphological, geological, environmental and human activity factors as covariates. The CNN-DNN model prediction accuracy was tested using a wide range of statistics from the confusion matrix and error indices from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The CNN-DNN model was evaluated comprehensively by comparing it to several state-of-the-art benchmark machine learning techniques including the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB) and decision tree (DT) classifiers. The CNN-DNN model for landslide susceptibility mapping was found to predict more accurately than the benchmark algorithms, with an AUC = 90.9%, IRs = 84.8%, MSE = 0.17, RMSE = 0.40, and MAPE = 0.42. The map provided by the CNN-DNN clearly revealed a high-susceptibility area in the west and southwest, related to the main Zagros trend in the province. These findings can be of great utility for landslide risk management and land use planning in the Isfahan province.

TI  - Conceptualizations of Knowledge in Structuring Approaches to Moral Development: A Process-Relational Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Like other aspects of child development, views of the nature and development of morality depend on philosophical assumptions or worldviews presupposed by researchers. We analyze assumptions regarding knowledge linked to two contrasting worldviews: Cartesian-split-mechanistic and process-relational. We examine the implications of these worldviews for approaches to moral development, including relations between morality and social outcomes, and the concepts of information, meaning, interaction and computation. It is crucial to understand how researchers view these interrelated concepts in order to understand approaches to moral development. Within the Cartesian-split-mechanistic worldview, knowledge is viewed as representation and meaning is mechanistic and fixed. Both nativism and empiricism are based in this worldview, differing in whether the source of representations is assumed to be primarily internal or external. Morality is assumed to pre-exist, either in the genome or the culture. We discuss problems with these conceptions and endorse the process-relational paradigm, according to which knowledge is constructed through interaction, and morality begins in activity as a process of coordinating perspectives, rather than the application of fixed rules. The contrast is between beginning with the mind or beginning with social activity in explaining the mind.

TI  - The Fractal Nature of Clouds in Global Storm-Resolving Models
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds in observations are fractals: they show self-similarity across scales ranging from 1 to 1,000 km. This includes individual storms and large-scale cloud structures typical of organized convection. It is not known whether global storm-resolving models reproduce the observed fractal scaling laws for clouds and organized convection. We compute the fractal dimension of clouds using Himawari satellite data and compare this to global storm-resolving model simulations completed as part of the DYAMOND intercomparison project. We find cloud fields in these simulations are indeed fractal, and reproduce the observed fractal dimension to within 10%. We find the fractal dimension is sensitive to the choice of boundary layer parametrization scheme used in each model simulation, and not to the convection parametrization as might have been expected.

TI  - Coastal Polynya Disrupts the Acoustic Backscatter Diurnal Signal Over the Eastern Laptev Sea Shelf
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton is one of the largest species migrations to occur globally and is a key driver of regional ecosystems and the marine carbon pump. The dramatic changes in the Arctic environment in recent years, mainly associated with sea-ice decline, may have wide significance for the Arctic shelf ecosystems including DVM. Observations have revealed the occurrence of DVM in ice-covered Arctic waters, however, there have yet to be observations of DVM from the extensive Siberian shelves in the Eurasian Arctic and no analysis of how the sea-ice decline may affect DVM. Here, 2 yearlong time series of acoustic backscatter, collected by moored acoustic Doppler current profilers in the eastern Laptev Sea from August 1998 to August 1999, were used to examine the annual cycle of acoustic scattering, and therefore the annual cycle of DVM in the area. The acoustic time series were used along with atmospheric and oceanic reanalysis and satellite data. Our observations show that DVM did not occur during polar night and polar day, but is active during the spring and fall transition periods when there is a diurnal cycle in light conditions. DVM began beneath the fast ice at the end of polar night and increased in intensity through spring. However, the formation of a large polynya along the landfast ice edge in late March 1999 caused DVM to abruptly cease near the fast ice edge, while DVM persisted through spring to the start of polar day at the onshore mooring. We associate this cessation of synchronized DVM similar to 1 month ahead of polar day with a predator-avoidance behavior of zooplankton in response to higher polar cod abundance near the polynya. During polar day, the intensity of acoustic scattering was attributed to the riverine suspended particles. Overall, our results highlight the occurrence of DVM on the Siberian shelves, the cessation of synchronized DVM when a polynya opens up nearby, and the potential impact of significant trends toward a more extensive Laptev Sea polynya as part of changing ice conditions in the Eurasian Arctic and their impact on the Arctic shelf ecology.

TI  - Are Differences in Dysphagia Assessment, Oral Care Provision, or Nasogastric Tube Insertion Associated with Stroke-Associated Pneumonia? A Nationwide Survey Linked to National Stroke Registry Data
T2  - CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a common complication associated with poor outcomes. Early dysphagia screening and specialist assessment is associated with a reduced risk of SAP. Evidence about oral care and nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is equivocal. This study aimed to expose variations in dysphagia management practices and explore their associations with SAP. Participants and Methods: Speech pathologists from 166 stroke units in England and Wales were surveyed about dysphagia assessment and management, oral care, and NGT placement. Survey data were then linked to the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), the national register of stroke. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were fitted to estimate the association between dysphagia management practices and SAP incidence. Results: 113 hospitals completed the survey (68%). Variation was evident in dysphagia screening protocols (DSPs), oral care, and NGT practice while specialist swallow assessment data patterns were more consistent. Multivariable analysis showed no evidence of an association in incidence of SAP when using a water-only hospital DSP compared to a multiconsistency DSP (B -0.688, 95% CI: -2.912 to 1.536), when using written swallow assessment guidelines compared to not using written guidelines (B 0.671, 95% CI: -1.567 to 2.908), when teams inserted NGTs overnight compared to teams which did not (B -0.505, 95% CI: -2.759 to 1.749), and when teams had a written oral care protocol compared to those which did not (B -1.339, 95% CI: -3.551 to 0.873). Discussion and Conclusion: Variation exists in dysphagia screening and management, but there was no evidence of an association between clinical practice patterns and incidence of SAP. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to examine association with SAP.

TI  - Crop loss identification at field parcel scale using satellite remote sensing and machine learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying crop loss at field parcel scale using satellite images is challenging: first, crop loss is caused by many factors during the growing season; second, reliable reference data about crop loss are lacking; third, there are many ways to define crop loss. This study investigates the feasibility of using satellite images to train machine learning (ML) models to classify agricultural field parcels into those with and without crop loss. The reference data for this study was provided by Finnish Food Authority (FFA) containing crop loss information of approximately 1.4 million field parcels in Finland covering about 3.5 million ha from 2000 to 2015. This reference data was combined with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 7 images, in which more than 80% of the possible data are missing. Despite the hard problem with extremely noisy data, among the four ML models we tested, random forest (with mean imputation and missing value indicators) achieved the average AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.688 +/- 0.059 over all 16 years with the range [0.602, 0.795] in identifying new crop-loss fields based on reference fields of the same year. To our knowledge, this is one of the first large scale benchmark study of using machine learning for crop loss classification at field parcel scale. The classification setting and trained models have numerous potential applications, for example, allowing government agencies or insurance companies to verify crop-loss claims by farmers and realise efficient agricultural monitoring.

TI  - Green Energy Sources Assessment Using Sentinel-1 Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to the growing use of Green Energy Sources (GESs), the activities of mapping, monitoring, measurement, and detection of various GESs have become crucial. Assessing and measuring GESs are very complex since different environmental conditions occur. This importance is even greater when researchers face a shortage of measuring instruments and tools in many parts of the world. GES assessment is a challenging task that requires accurate and continuous measurement methods. Currently, traditional methods are very time-consuming and require spending money and human sources. So, the use of accurate and fast measurement methods and tools assessing measuring GESs potential are seriously recommended, which can greatly help the growth of the use of GESs, especially to cover and focus large areas. Satellite remote sensing is used to observe the environment in many fields and new and fast applications. Satellites remote sensing technologies and techniques for GESs assessing are fast, accurate, and can help to reduce costs and decision-making risks of GESs converters installations projects and provide suitable products to the public end-users. These could also be used to identify regions of interest for energy converter installations and to accurately identify new areas with interesting potentials. In this case, researchers can dramatically reduce the possibility of significant error in assessment methods. There is a lack of in-situ measuring tools mainly due to their high economic costs in the interested areas; an accurate analysis was carried out to assess the GESs energy potential. Since there are only limited options for further expanding the measurement over large areas, the use of satellites makes it easier to overcome in-situ limitations. Actually, to use and develop it as much as possible, a correct interdisciplinary understanding is needed. Satellite remote sensing technology for identifying suitable areas for GESs power plants could be a powerful tool that is constantly increasing in its new and fast applications but requires good planning to apply it in various GESs converters installations projects. In this article, a comprehensive review on wind, wave, biomass, geothermal sources assessment using Sentinel-1 (S-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite estimation has been summarized along with the different techniques available to measure GESs using satellites. In the paper, several of the successful estimation techniques were introduced in each section and compared for the understanding of limitations and strengths of different methods of GESs availability evaluation.

TI  - Analysis of site-specific N balances in heterogeneous croplands using digital methods
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatial variability of nitrogen (N) balances were determined on heterogeneous arable fields in southern Germany using digital methods (combine yield sensing system, tractor mounted multispectral sensor and satellite data, vegetation indices, and models). The aim of this study is to precisely localize N surplus and nitrogen loss potentials through a high spatial resolution. The spatial variability of plant properties (yield, N uptake) were determined in order to calculate the N balances. The spatial variability of soil properties (soil organic carbon content, soil total nitrogen content, available water capacity) were determined to identify the causes of high or low N surplus on sub fields. N surplus, yield, and N uptake determined using different digital methods showed similar spatial variability. N surplus determined in test plots correlated best with N surplus calculated using tractor mounted multispectral sensor data (up to r = 0.67). Site-specific N balancing identified zones with high N loss potential (N surplus up to over 100 kg ha- 1), even if, on average, N inputs and N outputs are almost balanced (N surplus = 0). Soil properties showed considerable spatial variation within the fields. Soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen content was closely correlated in all fields (up to r = 0.97) and were most closely positively correlated with yield and N uptake (up to r = 0.62) and negatively correlated with N surplus (up to r = - 0.62). The combine yield sensor data showed weaker correlations with soil parameters than tractor mounted multispectral sensor and satellite data. Based on these results, digital technologies are suitable for the calculation of site-specific N surplus. However, their accuracy must be further improved before they can be used to make precise management decisions. Site-specific N balancing using digital methods makes it possible to identify N loss potentials at a sub field scale.

TI  - Northeast China Cold Vortex Observed by FY-3 MWTS-2 and MetOp AMSU-A
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The northeast China cold vortex (NCCV) refers to a closed low-pressure system over northeast China extending from China-Siberia to the northwest Pacific coast region. It is cut off from the westerly jet belt in the middle and upper troposphere, has a cold core, lasts several days, and could bring heavy rain events in late spring and summer that are of great challenge to weather forecasters. This study investigates the possibility of observing temperature structures of NCCVs by two microwave temperature sounders, that is, the Microwave Temperature Sounder-2 (MWTS-2) and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) onboard the two polar-orbiting operational environmental satellites (POES) Fenyun-3 satellite FY-3D and Meteorological Operational satellite MetOp-B, respectively. The MWTS-2 and AMSU-A together provide 3D atmospheric temperatures in the middle and upper troposphere, as well as the lower stratosphere four times daily. Both limb-corrected direct observations of brightness temperature and retrievals of atmospheric temperature within NCCVs are characterized by cold and warm cores below and above the tropopause, respectively, comparing favorably with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 reanalysis. Compared with the ERA5 reanalysis in June 2019, the MWTS-2 retrieved atmospheric temperatures have no scan-dependent biases, the biases are smaller than +/- 0.2K, and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are smaller than and 2.0K at all altitudes. This study suggests the possibility of using multiple POES microwave-temperature-sounding observations for near-real-time monitoring of NCCVs' 3D temperature structures.

TI  - Seasonal Change in Satellite-Retrieved Lower-Tropospheric Ice-Cloud Fraction Over the Southern Ocean
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the temperature and fraction of lower-tropospheric ice cloud over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (SO) using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation satellite data. Over the SO, the maximum low-level ice-cloud fraction below 2 km is observed at cold temperatures (<-25 degrees C); however, local maxima of low-level ice-cloud fraction are observed at temperatures >-7.5 degrees C (>-17.5 degrees C) during summer (winter). High fractions of low-level ice cloud observed at higher temperatures over near-coastal Antarctic sea ice areas in summer, coincident with the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations, and over coastal Antarctic ice-covered areas in winter, suggest that marine aerosols act as ice-nucleating particles for ice-cloud formation during summer and winter.

TI  - Land use/land cover change and its impact on surface urban heat island and urban thermal comfort in a metropolitan city
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing urban heat island intensity (UHII)is a matter of concern for the sustainable urban planning and maintaining urban thermal comfort in the metropolitan cities of developing countries like India. Therefore, in the current research, the land use/land cover (LU/LC) change and its impact on the surface UHI intensity (SUHII) and urban thermal comfort has been analyzed using Landsat datasets and geographically weighted regression (GWR) in Delhi metropolitan city. The result shows that the built-up area has increased from 315.18 to 720.24 sq. km in Delhi during 1991 to 2018 while other LU/LC types have declined. This has resulted in a substantial increase in LST and SUHII. The minimum, maximum and mean SUHII has increased by 1.26 degrees C, 4.6 degrees C and 1.18 degrees C during 1991 to 2018 and hence, the thermal comfort has declined in the city. The GWR analysis showed that the performance of GWR model was very good in showing the association between LU/LC and SUHII and the LU/LC pattern has significant impact on SUHII. The outcome of this research can be utilized for the formulation of SUHI mitigation strategies and maintaining urban thermal comfort in Delhi and cities with similar geographical conditions.

TI  - Unraveling pathways of elevated ozone induced by the 2020 lockdown in Europe by an observationally constrained regional model using TROPOMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions about how emissions are changing during the COVID-19 lockdown periods cannot be answered by observations of atmospheric trace gas concentrations alone, in part due to simultaneous changes in atmospheric transport, emissions, dynamics, photochemistry, and chemical feedback. A chemical transport model simulation benefiting from a multi-species inversion framework using well-characterized observations should differentiate those influences enabling to closely examine changes in emissions. Accordingly, we jointly constrain NO, and VOC emissions using well-characterized TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO and NO2 columns during the months of March, April, and May 2020 (lockdown) and 2019 (baseline). We observe a noticeable decline in the magnitude of NOx emissions in March 2020 (14 %-31 %) in several major cities including Paris, London, Madrid, and Milan, expanding further to Rome, Brussels, Frankfurt, Warsaw, Belgrade, Kyiv, and Moscow (34 %-51 %) in April. However, NOx emissions remain at somewhat similar values or even higher in some portions of the UK, Poland, and Moscow in March 2020 compared to the baseline, possibly due to the timeline of restrictions. Comparisons against surface monitoring stations indicate that the constrained model underrepresents the reduction in surface NO2. This underrepresentation correlates with the TROPOMI frequency impacted by cloudiness. During the month of April, when ample TROPOMI samples are present, the surface NO2 reductions occurring in polluted areas are described fairly well by the model (model: -21 +/- 17 %, observation: -29 +/- 21 %). The observational constraint on VOC emissions is found to be generally weak except for lower latitudes. Results support an increase in surface ozone during the lockdown. In April, the constrained model features a reasonable agreement with maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone changes observed at the surface (r = 0.43), specifically over central Europe where ozone enhancements prevail (model: +3.73 +/- 3.94 %, +1.79 ppbv, observation: +7.35 +/- 11.27 %, +3.76 ppbv). The model suggests that physical processes (dry deposition, advection, and diffusion) decrease MDA8 surface ozone in the same month on average by -4.83 ppbv, while ozone production rates dampened by largely negative J(NO2)[NO2]-k(NO)(+O3)[NO][O-3] become less negative, leading ozone to increase by +5.89 ppbv. Experiments involving fixed anthropogenic emissions suggest that meteorology contributes to 42 % enhancement in MDA8 surface ozone over the same region with the remaining part (58 %) coming from changes in anthropogenic emissions. Results illustrate the capability of satellite data of major ozone precursors to help atmospheric models capture ozone changes induced by abrupt emission anomalies.

TI  - Regional differentiation in the ecological effects of land cover change in China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover changes driven by either land degradation or land development have caused distinct alterations of the global environment. China has experienced a large area of land degradation and development, while the environmental responses to the national land cover changes are still vague. Based on remote-sensed datasets, we analyzed the multiple ecological effects (temperature, biomass formation, and observed greenness) of land cover changes in China and their regional differences through neighbourhood analysis and Geogdetector, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for mitigating land degradation and sustainable land development. The results showed that the conversion of cultivated land to grassland and shrubland led to reductions in the greenness effect (-0.017) and biomass formation effect (-0.015 kg C m(-)(2)), while the conversion of forest to grassland and shrubland led to a reduction in greenness (-0.01) and an increase in temperature (0.079 degrees C). As the amplitude of the change in the land cover fraction increased, these trends became more obvious and irreversible. The same land cover change could have either positive or negative ecological effects in different climatic regions and at different elevation levels. In particular, the conversion of forests to grassland and shrubland had a warming effect on all climatic regions and elevation levels. The results can provide a regionally differentiated basis for improving China's current land use policy regarding the balance between cultivated land and natural land.

TI  - The sum of small parts: changing landscape fire regimes across multiple small landholdings in north-western Australia with collaborative fire management
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural process in tropical savannas, but contemporary cycles of recurrent, extensive, severe fires threaten biodiversity and other values. In northern Australia, prescribed burning to reduce wildfire incidence is incentivised through a regulated emissions abatement program. However, only certain vegetation types are eligible; also, managers of small land parcels are disadvantaged by the program's transaction costs and interannual variability in management outcomes. Both impediments apply to landholders of the Dampier Peninsula, north-west Australia. Nevertheless, Indigenous rangers, pastoralists and other stakeholders have collaborated for 5 years to manage fire across their small holdings (300-2060 km(2)). We used remote sensing imagery to examine the project's performance against seven fire regime targets related to biodiversity, cultural and pastoral values. At the scale both of individual landholders and the entire Peninsula (18 500 km(2)), the project significantly reduced the extent of annual fire, high-severity fire, mid-late dry season fire, fire frequency and severe fire frequency. The project significantly increased the graininess of burnt and unburnt areas and the extent unburnt for 3+ years more than tripled. The project demonstrates that cross-tenure collaboration can overcome the challenges of managing fire on small land parcels. However, this project's sustainability depends on securing ongoing funding.

TI  - Global evaluation of the precipitable-water-vapor product from MERSI-II (Medium Resolution Spectral Imager) on board the Fengyun-3D satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapor plays a key role in Earth's radiation balance and hydrological cycle, and the precipitable-water-vapor (PWV) product under clear-sky conditions has been routinely provided by the advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-Il) on board Fengyun-3D since 2018. The global evaluation of the PWV product derived from MERSI-II is performed herein by comparing it with PWV from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) based on a total of 462 sites (57 219 matchups) during 2018-2021. The monthly averaged PWV from MERSI-II presents a decreasing distribution of PWV from the tropics to the polar regions. In general, a sound consistency exists between PWV values of MERSI-II and IGRA; their correlation coefficient is 0.951, and their root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.36 cm. The histogram of mean bias (MB) shows that the MB is concentrated around zero and mostly located within the range from -1.00 cm to 0.50 cm. For most sites, PWV is underestimated with the MB between -0.41 and 0.05 cm. However, there is also an overestimated PWV, which is mostly distributed in the area surrounding the Black Sea and the middle of South America. There is a slight underestimation of MERSI-II PWV for all seasons with the MB value below -0.18 cm, with the bias being the largest magnitude in summer. This is probably due to the presence of thin clouds, which weaken the radiation signal observed by the satellite. We also find that there is a larger bias in the Southern Hemisphere, with a large value and significant variation in PWV. The binned error analysis revealed that the MB and RMSE increased with the increasing value of PWV, but there is an overestimation for PWV smaller than 1.0 cm. In addition, there is a higher MB and RMSE with a larger spatial distance between the footprint of the satellite and the IGRA station, and the RMSE ranged from 0.33 to 0.47 cm. There is a notable dependency on solar zenith angle of the deviations between MERSI-II and IGRA PWV products.

TI  - The Earth Observation-based Anomaly Detection (EOAD) system: A simple, scalable approach to mapping in-field and farm-scale anomalies using widely available satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To feed the world increasing population, expansion in the area under arable cultivation is expected, with the majority projected to occur in Sub-Sahara Africa and Latin American countries. However, many existing Precision Agriculture (PA) techniques are difficult to transfer to agricultural systems in these regions as they rely on prohibitively expensive crop monitoring systems. Satellite Earth Observation (EO) has the ability to provide affordable solutions, particularly to identify yield-limiting conditions within site-specific management zones (MZs). This paper presents the Earth Observation-based Anomaly Detection (EOAD) approach, a novel system for the detection of in-field anomalies through automatic thresholding of optical Vegetation Index data, based on their deviation from a normal distribution. The EOAD sets dynamic thresholds for the pixel values within a parcel by removing the atypical values in increments from the tails towards the median until the distribution is normal. The distribution normality is assessed based upon measures of skewness and kurtosis for each iteration. The anomaly detection approach demonstrated a strong agreement, 80% overall accuracy, with identified in-field anomalies when applied to rice plots in the Ibague Plateau, Colombia, using both Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery. Areas identified as anomalous during the booting stage were shown to be significantly (p <= 0.005) associated with a decrease in final yield. Additionally, the percentage of anomalies detected with the EOAD improved the detection of underperforming plots in early growth stages. Using freely available data and software, this automated approach demonstrates an exciting potential for use in improving agricultural practices in low-resource regions.

TI  - DRSNet: Novel architecture for small patch and low-resolution remote sensing image scene classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mainstream architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition follow the protocol of shrinking input data size to extract semantic information. However, poor overall accuracy (OA) may be achieved when dealing with small input size and low-resolution images with classic CNNs. This paper proposes a novel, deep CNN architecture called DRSNet for small patch size Landsat 8 remote sensing (RS) image recognition. A module called residual inception channel attention block is applied for feature extraction, which combines the advantages of Inception-ResNet and channel attention. Pooling layers are replaced with reduction modules to prevent representational bottleneck. Unlike existing CNN structures, DRSNet adopts upsampling steps before final pooling layers, retrieving lost information caused by previous downsampling steps. Compared with existing state-of-the-art CNNs, DRSNet achieves the highest classification accuracy in our RS data set. Experimental results show that our model improves OA by 2%-9%, accelerates convergence speed, and effectively reduces loss. DRSNet also exhibits impressive results and outperforms baseline CNNs in three public data sets, namely, EuroSAT, Brazilian Coffee Scenes, and UCMerced Land Use. The proposed network is practical for large-scale land surface classification using free, low-resolution RS data; hence, it could be useful for nongovernment organizations or governments of developing countries.

TI  - Potential of remote sensing data-crop model assimilation and seasonal weather forecasts for early-season crop yield forecasting over a large area
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional crop yield forecasting before harvest is critical for managing climate risk, optimizing agronomic management, and making food trade policy. The advantage of remote sensing data-crop model assimilation for yield estimates has been well recognized, however its potential for early-season crop yield forecasting has not yet been investigated. In this study, combining a crop model, remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) assimilation and weather forecasts, we conducted yield forecasting for winter wheat in the central North China Plain during 2008-2015. Sequential forecasting was conducted to assess the yield forecasting potential and the effects of LAI assimilation and multiple weather forecasts with different lead times. Results showed that forecasting skill increased with shortening of lead time. Assimilating remote sensing LAI into crop model was valuable and critical to improve yield forecasting skills. The uncertainties from weather forecasts could weaken the forecasting skills; and using historical weather observations performed better than using weather forecasts outputted by climate models. In general, winter wheat yield in the central North China Plain could be reliably forecasted with a lead time from five weeks (mean MAPE < 10%, ROC score > 0.8, ACC> 0.65) to two months (mean MAPE <12%, ROC score> 0.75, ACC > 0.55) before harvest. The study highlights that current available data can provide fair yield forecasting; nevertheless the remote sensing LAI data and weather forecasts need further improvements to improve yield forecasting skills and provide valuable suggestions for stakeholders to respond to the forecasts timely.

TI  - A Comparison of Model-Assisted Estimators, With and Without Data-Driven Transformations of Auxiliary Variables, With Application to Forest Inventory
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest information is requested at many levels and for many purposes. Sampling-based national forest inventories (NFIs) can provide reliable estimates on national and regional levels. By combining expensive field plot data with different sources of remotely sensed information, from airplanes and/or satellite platforms, the precision in estimators of forest variables can be improved. This paper focuses on the design-based model-assisted approach to using NFI data together with remotely sensed data to estimate forest variables for small areas, where the variables studied are total growing stock volume, volume of Norway spruce (Picea abies), and volume of broad-leaved trees. Remote sensing variables may be highly correlated with one another and some may have poor predictive ability for target forest variables, and therefore model selection and/or coefficient shrinkage may be appropriate to improve the efficiency of model-assisted estimators of forest variables. For this purpose, one can use modern shrinkage estimators based on lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression methods. In a simulation study using real NFI data, Sentinel 2 remote-sensing data, and a national airborne laser scanning (ALS) campaign, we show that shrinkage estimators offer advantages over the (weighted) ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator in a model-assisted setting. For example, for a sample size n of about 900 and with 72 auxiliary variables, the RMSE was up to 41% larger when based on OLS. We propose a data-driven method for finding suitable transformations of auxiliary variables, and show that it can improve estimators of forest variables. For example, when estimating volume of Norway spruce, using a smaller expert selection of auxiliary variables, transformations reduced the RMSE by up to 10%. The overall best results in terms of RMSE were obtained using shrinkage estimators and a larger set of 72 auxiliary variables. However, for this larger set of variables, the use of transformations yielded at most small improvements of RMSE, and at worst large increases of RMSE, except in combination with ridge and elastic net regression.

TI  - The ARYA crop yield forecasting algorithm: Application to the main wheat exporting countries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is the most important commodity traded in the international food market. Thus, accurate and timely information on wheat production can help mitigate food price fluctuations. Within the existing operational regional and global scale agricultural monitoring systems that provide information on global crop yield and area forecasts, there are still fundamental gaps: #1. Lack of quantitative Earth Observation (EO) derived crop in-formation, #2. Lack of global but detailed (national or subnational level) and timely crop production forecasts and #3. Lack of information on forecast uncertainties. In this study we present the Agriculture Remotely-sensed Yield Algorithm (ARYA) an EO-based method, advancing the state of EO-data application and usage (addressing gap #1) to forecast wheat yield. The algorithm is based on the evolution of the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) using MODIS data at 1 km resolution and the Growing Degree Days (GDD) from reanalysis data. Additionally, we explore how Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be included into the model and whether this parameter adds any value to the model performance when combined with the optical information. ARYA is implemented at the national and subnational level to forecast winter wheat yield in the main wheat exporting countries of US, Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany, Australia and Argentina from 2001 to 2019 (covering over 70% of wheat exports globally) in a timely manner by providing daily forecasts (addressing gap #2). The results show that ARYA provides yield estimations with RMSE's within 0.3 +/- 0.1 t/ha at national level and 0.6 +/- 0,1 t/ha at subnational level after Day Of the Year (DOY) 140 (mid May) in the Northern Hemisphere and DOY 280 (beginning of October) in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that ARYA can provide crop yield estimates of wheat yield with 5-15% error at national and 7-20% error at subnational level starting from 2 to 2.5 months prior to harvest.

TI  - Reproducibility of sentinel node detection in endometrial cancer by ICG fundic & cervical injection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to study the reproducibility of the dual injection technique of IndoCyanine Green (ICG) in the cervix and fundus in endometrial cancer. Methods: Between June 2014, and December 2019, 278 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer at our institution. In all cases, under a prospective cohort study, we performed Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) biopsy with dual cervical and fundal ICG injection. Lymphadenectomy was also performed if intermediate or high-risk criteria were present. All cases were performed independently by three surgeons, with the same protocol and system, and their results were compared. Results: Global, aortic, pelvic and bilateral pelvic detection rates (DRs) were 93.45%, 67.27%, 90.18% and 67.64%. There were no significant differences for DRs between the three surgeons. The probability of finding a positive SLN was 8.8% (SD 2.8), 21% (SD 4.1) and12% (SD 3.3), respectively, with a significant chi-squared difference (p = 0.041), which was statistically associated with preoperative risk factors (p < 0.001) and not to a surgeon's factor in a multivariate logistic regression. Conclusions: The SLN biopsy with both cervical and fundal ICG injection offers good overall detection rates and improved mapping of the aortic area and can be reproduced with similar results among different surgeons.

TI  - Comparison of the backpropagation network and the random forest algorithm based on sampling distribution effects consideration for estimating nonphotosynthetic vegetation cover
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) plays a crucial role in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Remote sensing methods can extract NPV information accurately and quantitatively, which helps in studying the water use, community health, and climate response of vegetation communities. This study used the backpropagation network (BP) and random forest (RF) methods to test NPV cover extraction from Landsat 8-OLI images in Mu Us Sandy Land. Pixel-level NPV cover, photosynthetic vegetation (PV) cover, and bare soil (BS) cover from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field sampling data were used to model the BP and RF. After the generalisation ability of the NPV detection model of BP and RF was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation, the influence of the distribution of sampling data on BP and RF fitting results was also evaluated. The results were as follows: 1. Considering the selection of appropriate parameters and input layers, both BP and RF exhibited high accuracy in detecting NPV, and the detection accuracy of the RF algorithm for PV and BS was slightly higher than that of the BP algorithm (R-RF-NPV(2) = 0.8426, R-BP-NPV(2) = 0.8277, R-RF-PV(2) = 0.8606, R-BP-PV(2) = 0.8514, R-RF-BS(2) = 0.8123, R-BP-BS(2) = 0.7396). 2. When the BP and RF algorithms were used for geospatial continuous value prediction, the distribution of samples affected the final prediction results. The RF algorithm is less sensitive to the sample data distribution. 3. The random sampling method is the best method for collecting training samples. Even with uniform sampling, when there was a large difference between the distribution of the sampling value and the distribution of the real value, the fitting result would have a large deviation. This paper provides suggestions for the fitting of nonphotosynthetic vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions and provides a new method for evaluating the results of remote sensing regression fitting.

It is therefore a good indicator of climate warming, which will likely have dramatic impacts on lake ice phenology in northern latitudes. Beside the climate change aspect, lake ice data are important regarding transport and safety issues. In addition, changes in ice cover affect the ecology of the lake and water quality. A new method for accessing lake ice extent (LIE) using optical satellite data was developed at the Finnish Environment Institute. The resulting ICEmod method is based on multidimensional Gaussian distributions calculated for training data using several reflectance and thermal bands and their-related indices. Three alternative classes are provided for a lake ice pixel: (i) open water, (ii) ice cover, and (iii) cloud. The main advantages of ICEmod are the utilization of several spectral bands, inclusion of simultaneous cloud detection, definition of statistical probability for each pixel, the simplicity of processing and easy transition between different satellite sensors. This novel method is applied in the provision of the Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR)-based 0.005 degrees Lake Ice Extent product (LIE-NH) for the Northern Hemisphere under the Global Land Service, a component of the Copernicus Land Service. The 0.005 degrees resolution LIE products based on ICEmod applied to SLSTR (an extensive subset corresponding to LIE-NH) were validated against high-resolution Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument-images covering lakes in the different parts of the Northern Hemisphere, most of them representing both open water and ice pixels. The gained overall classification accuracy is 96%. The resulting omission error for ice is 6% and omission mainly occurs in lakes where the ice is very dark and fragmented. The ICEmod method is not always able to separate dark ice from open water if there is water on the top of the dark ice, while misclassifications do not occur if the water layer is on white ice. The commission error for ice is 2.5% and is mostly related to the ambiguity in the definition of a ice-pixel: i.e. whether a 0.005 degrees LIE pixel should be classified as ice or open water when the area within the pixel is partially ice-covered. When the lake is completely ice-covered or ice-free, the overall accuracy is 100%. According to the tentative qualitative comparison with European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Lake Ice Cover (LIC) product, LIE-NH may provide more accurate lake ice information, and it also provides lake ice data for more than 13 000 lakes while LIC operates for 250 lakes only.

AB  - Scientific data supporting rational arguments for human-made causes of climate and environmental changes might be persuasive in some contexts. Law, policy, activism and The Earth Charter similarly appear insufficient to change attitudes and behaviours. Even biblical and theological arguments fail to move some Christians beyond apathy and climate denial. Decades of ecological theology and calls for ecological conversion suggest that appeals to reason and facts are limited without an affective epistemology that join knowledge and experience to produce worldview transformation through emotions, such as awe. Contribution: Departing from appeal to scientific data and arguments alone, the primary claim is that ecological conversion is not singularly a rational act. For broader engagement and action to mitigate climate and environmental degradation, experiential and affective encounter with nature promise wider participation and transformation.

TI  - Quantifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of multi-dimensional karst ecosystem stability with Landsat time series in southwest China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale quantification of ecosystem stability in multiple dimensions is crucial to understanding underlying ecological processes and informing ecological management decision-making. However, historically this field has been limited to spatiotemporal scales based on the use of discrete ground-based measurements. The objective of this study was to quantify ecosystem stability in multiple dimensions in a karst peak cluster depression region in southwest China, using dense Landsat time series from 1988 to 2018. Three components of ecosystem stability, namely resistance, resilience, and variability, were derived by applying a time decomposition algorithm, and then the correlations of each component were analyzed to explore the dimensionality of ecosystem stability. Our results revealed following: (1) of the entire karst area, 87.97% of the pixels were disturbed in the past 31 years, the majority of the maximum disturbance events occurred during 2004 in the northeast and mid-west of Guangxi. (2) Only 0.03% of the pixels showed high resistance, whereas a wide part of the study area showed low resilience, with 72.95 % of the pixels had low recovery rate and 39.27% of the pixels being able to be restored to their original state after the disturbance. The south area showed lower variance compared to other areas in karst regions. (3) Correlations between different ecosystem stability indicators obtained from dense remote sensing time series were only weakly correlated or uncorrelated, which provided satellite-scale evidence that it is necessary to conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of ecosystem stability, and the effective dimensionalities of ecosystem stability were significantly influenced by different disturbance intensities. These findings expand the understanding of the internal self-maintenance and self-recovery of the ecosystem in response to disturbances, and provide a theoretical basis for ecological engineering construction and regional environmental governance assessment.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMNs) fled into Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh due to internal conflict. Considering the public health situation, a surveillance network was established to identify the enteric pathogens and early detection of cholera epidemics. The purpose of this manuscript is to report the clinical, epidemiological determinants of cholera and other enteric pathogens among hospitalized diarrheal patients from FDMNs and host community.Methods. A total of 11 sentinel surveillance sites were established around the camps in Ukhia and Teknaf Upazila, Cox's Bazar. Rapid diagnostic testing was conducted for immediate detection of cholera cases. Stool samples were transferred to the Infectious Diseases Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b) laboratory for culture.Results. A total of 8134 participants with diarrhea were enrolled from 2017 to 2019: 4881 were FDMNs and 3253 were from the Bangladeshi host community. Among the FDMNs, the proportion of Vibrio cholerae was 0.7%, the proportion of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was 4.9%, and the proportion of Shigella was 1.5%. The distributions from host community were 1.2% V cholerae, 1.8% ETEC, and 1.1% Shigella. Similar risk factors have been identified for the diarrheal pathogens for both communities.Conclusions. This surveillance helped to monitor the situation of diarrheal diseases including cholera in refugee camps as well as in the neighboring host community. These findings lead policymakers to take immediate preventive measures.

TI  - Multiscale leaf area index assimilation for Moso bamboo forest based on Sentinel-2 and MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important driving factor in forest ecosystems carbon cycle, the acquisition of multiscale LAI can illustrate the carbon cycle at different scales and its dynamic response to environmental changes. Moso bamboo forest (MBF) has strong carbon sequestration capability and unique phenological characteristics of on-years and off-years. In this study, based on the MODIS LAI and Sentinel-2 reflectance products in 2018-2019, we coupled the Hierarchical Bayesian Network (HBN) algorithm, LAI dynamic model and PROSAIL model to acquire multiscale spatiotemporal assimilated LAI (500-m, 100-m, 20-m) of MBF. First, the results showed that band7 (B7) and band8a (B8a) of Sentinel-2 were highly sensitive to LAI; the simulated leaf and canopy reflectance by PROSAIL demonstrated higher accuracies and lower errors in these two bands. Second, after applying the Savitzky-Golay smoothing, compared with the observed LAI (Obs_eLAI), the accuracy of MODIS LAI was improved by 121%, and the error was reduced by 24%. Third, there was a significant correlation between the multiscale assimilated LAI (HBN_LAIs) and Obs_eLAI (R2500m HBN LAI = 0.80,R2100m HBN LAI = 0.82,R220m HBN LAI = 0.80). Finally, the assimilated results in 2018 (off-year) were better than those in 2019 (on-year); the variations in multiscale spatiotemporal assimilated LAI were consistent with the actual growth trends of MBF. This study provides a feasible way to accurately obtain multiscale high-resolution LAI for the carbon cycle simulation of bamboo forests.

TI  - Analysis of recurring patchiness in satellite-derived chlorophyll a to aid the selection of representative sites for lake water quality monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Horizontal patchiness of water quality attributes in lakes substantially influences the ability to accurately determine an average condition of a lake from traditional in situ sampling. Therefore, spatial variability has to be accounted for in monitoring programmes which aim at determining the states and trends of ecosystem attributes. We used five years of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data and conducted spatial analyses of surface chlorophyll a (Chl) concentration to map its variability and provide concrete recommendations for resource managers to design in situ sampling programmes. First, we developed a regional calibration of Chl predictions by C2RCC, an openly available processor for atmospheric corrections and water constituent retrieval, using in situ data from eleven temperate lakes in the central North Island of Aotearoa New Zealand. Using 93 match-up samples, we re-fitted C2RCC's partitioning of constituent absorption coefficients to achieve an improved prediction accuracy for Chl (r(2) = 0.79, root mean square error = 5.4 mg m(-3)). The new relationship was applied to all cloud-free images for thirteen regional lakes for further spatial analysis. We found that the medians calculated within areas of different sizes around in situ sampling locations may increase or decrease, illustrating an unpredictable uncertainty of the representativeness of any in situ sample. We went on to summarise five years of spatial variability by assessing each pixel for its tendency to be near the lake median Chl, higher (near the upper quartile) or lower (near the lower quartile). This spatiotemporal analysis revealed recurring patchiness that we converted to an indication of the representativeness of any location in the lake useful for the selection of more representative sites for future monitoring programmes.

TI  - Two periods of geodetic glacier mass balance at Eastern Nyainqentanglha derived from multi-platform bistatic SAR interferometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bistatic SAR interferometry is an essential technique of observing glacier height changes and geodetic mass balance. Eastern Nyainqentanglha distributes the majority parts of monsoonal temperate glaciers and presented the quickest glacier mass loss rate at High-mountains Asia. Most recent studies on glacier mass balance at Highmountains Asia focus on the decadal-scale. Here we obtained TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X SAR images observed in -2012 and -2017, together with the SRTM DEM that observed in 2000 we derived geodetic glacier mass balances in two periods (2000 - -2012/-2012 - -2017). We proposed three InSAR processing procedures for deriving geodetic glacier mass balance of the second period, which yielded basically identical results. Topography differencing between two DEMs derived both by TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X can provide geodetic glacier mass balance information at a sub-decadal scale. The patterns of glacier mass balance were almost identical before and after -2012 and showed with slightly increasing rates of mass loss. Glaciers distributed at the southeastern, which were most clean-ice type, presented with quicker loss rates than the glaciers at the northwestern part, which were most debris-covered type. Yanong glacier, which was the largest glacier and belong to laketerminating type showed the quickest mass loss rate. Decreasing precipitation, increasing temperature and downward shortwave radiation could be responsible for the quick glacier mass loss.

TI  - Automatic mapping of national surface water with OpenStreetMap and Sentinel-2 MSI data using deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale mapping activities can benefit from the vastly increasing availability of earth observation (EO) data, especially when combined with volunteered geographical information (VGI) using machine learning (ML). Highresolution maps of inland surface water bodies are important for water supply and natural disaster mitigation as well as for monitoring, managing, and preserving landscapes and ecosystems. In this paper, we propose an automatic surface water mapping workflow by training a deep residual neural network (ResNet) based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and Sentinel-2 multispectral data, where the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) superpixel algorithm was employed for generating object-based training samples. As a case study, we produced an open surface water layer for Germany using a national ResNet model at a 10 m spatial resolution, which was then harmonized with OSM data for final surface water products. Moreover, we evaluated the mapping accuracy of our open water products via conducting expert validation campaigns, and comparing to existing water products, namely the WasserBLIcK and Global Surface Water Layer (GSWL). Using 4,600 validation samples in Germany, the proposed model (ResNet+SNIC) achieved an overall accuracy of 86.32% and competitive detection rates over the WasserBLIcK (87.47%) and GSWL (98.61%). This study provides comprehensive insights into how to best explore the synergy of VGI and ML of EO data in a large-scale surface water mapping task.

TI  - Tree species diversity mapping using UAS-based digital aerial photogrammetry point clouds and multispectral imageries in a subtropical forest invaded by moso bamboo (<i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) tends to invade any surrounding forest areas due to its aggressive characteristics (fast growth and clonal reproduction), where it changes the species composition and canopy structure of the forests, and has negative effects on forest diversity and ecosystem functions. Unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based remote sensing has the capacity to provide high-resolution, continuous spatial data that can be used to detect forest invasion dynamics. In this study, UAS-based RGB and multispectral image data and digital aerial photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) were acquired and used to detect areas of bamboo invasion in a subtropical forest of Southern China. First, a point cloud segmentation (PCS) method was applied for individual tree detection (ITD) using photogrammetric point clouds (PPCs). A random forest (RF) classifier was used to perform tree species classification based on PPC metrics, vegetation indices, and texture metrics. Finally, based on the results of the ITD and tree species classification, alpha-diversity (i.e., the species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener (H'), Simpson (D), and Pielou's evenness index(J)) and the spatial variation in species composition along the altitude gradient (beta-diversity) in the invaded forests were assessed. Results demonstrated that PCS worked well for tree detection in invaded forests (F-1-score = 80.63%), and the overall accuracy of tree species classification was 75.69%, with a kappa accuracy of 73.76%. The forest diversity analysis showed that all alpha-diversity values were generally predicted well (R-2 = 0.84-0.91, RMSE = 0.05-0.84). The diversity showed a decreasing tendency with increasing bamboo invasion, and the predominantly broad-leaved invaded forests had higher diversity than the predominantly coniferous invaded forests. The human intervention had a significant impact on bamboo invasion. The ANOVA of the dispersion of the dissimilarities along the elevation gradient showed significant differences in abundance-weighted similarity among the altitude classes (ANOVA of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, F-4,F-40 = 6.453, P = 0.0004***; ANOVA of the Jaccard dissimilarity, F-4,F-40 = 5.20, P = 0.0017**). This study indicated the potential benefits of using UAS-based remote sensing data to identify tree species and predict forest diversity in bamboo-invaded forests. Our results suggested that tree species diversity can be directly estimated using individual tree detection results based on PPC data instead of modelling the relationship between field-measured indices and remote sensing data-derived metrics, and revealed the influence of human intervention on bamboo invasion.

TI  - Pine Forest Management and Disturbance in Northern Poland: Combining High-Resolution 100-Year-Old Paleoecological and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has compelled to strengthen the resilience of European forests. Due to repeated droughts and heatwaves, weakened trees become vulnerable to insect outbreaks, pathogen invasions, and strong winds. This study combines high-resolution analysis of a 100-year-old high-resolution peat archive synthesized from the Martwe peatland in Poland with remote sensing data. We present the first REVEALS based vegetation reconstruction in a tornado-hit area from Poland on the background of previous forest management in monocultural even-aged stands - Tuchola Pinewoods. During the 20th century, the pine monocultures surrounding the peatland were affected by clear-cutting and insect outbreaks. In 2012, a tornado, destroyed ca. 550 ha of pine forest around the peatland. The palynological record reflects these major events of the past 100 years as well as changes in forest practices. Our study showed the strong relationships between the decrease of Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) in palynological record as well as planting patterns after the tornado. Moreover, past forestry practices [such as domination of Pinus sylvestris, the collapse of Picea abies (Norway spruce), low share of Betula spec. (birch) due to Pinus sylvestris promotion and probable also to a lesser by removal of Betula as a "forest weed," and low plant coverage of tree species due to clear-cutting and cutting after insect outbreaks] were well identified in the proxy record. In monocultures managed over decades, the reconstruction of vegetation may be challenging due to changes in the age composition of the Pinus sylvestris stands. We found that through historical, remote sensing, and paleoecological data, the dynamics of disturbances such as insect outbreaks and tornadoes, as well as the changing perceptions of local society about forests, can be determined.

TI  - Urban spatial expansion and its impacts on ecosystem service value of typical oasis cities around Tarim Basin, northwest China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of rapid urbanization, the change of urban land use structure has a great impact on ecological environments, and determination of impacts of urban spatial expansion (USE) on the urban ecosystem service value (ESV) is of particular significance to sustainable development in arid regions. To archive a better understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of USE, and to quantitatively describe the impact of USE on ESV, five typical oasis cities around the Tarim Basin are selected as research areas. Based on classifying the land use types from LandsatTM/ETM+/OLI imagery data between 1990 and 2015, the urban spatio-temporal dynamic changes are quantitatively analyzed, ESV changes of each land use types and each ecosystem functions were estimated, and USE impacts on ESV is determined. The results are concluded as follows: (1) Over the researched 25 years, the largest USE area occurred in Korla, followed by 63.65 km(2), and the smallest is in Artux, followed by 2.91 km2. (2) Farmland and unused land has a great contribution to the USE, and the reduction of farmland in five cities were 2.68 km(2) in Korla, 5.13 km(2) in Aksu, 0.54 km(2) in Artux, 28.42 km(2) in Kashgar, and 14.25 km(2) in Hotan during the 1990-2015 years. (3) Both of the expansion speed and expansion intensity are maximal in Hotan (followed by 8.38% and 25.89%) and minimal in Artux. (4) There are the highest compactness, the lowest fractal dimension, and the simplest and most stable shape in Artux. In contrast, Korla has the lowest compactness and highest fractal dimension, and is the most complex, disperse and unstable city. (5) The total ESV of the five cities is reduced at 45.36 million CNY with a decrease rate of 21.54%. Among these cities, only Korla shows an increasing trend of ESV (23.72 million CNY), but the other four cities shows a decreasing trend with 20.98 million CNY in Aksu, 0.15 million CNY in Artux, 35.76 million CNY in Kashgar, and 12.20 million CNY in Hotan. (6) USE has a great effect on the ESV changes, and the increasing runoff, temperature and precipitation are impacting the ESV in some positive ways. (7) Waste treatment, water conservation and soil formation functions are the top three ecosystem functions with high service value, and ecosystem function of the five cities belong to a provision function. In light of these findings, this study conveys important strategies for regional sustainable development and plan in the arid ecologically fragile regions.

TI  - Learning main drivers of crop progress and failure in Europe with interpretable machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A wide variety of methods exist nowadays to address the important problem of estimating crop yields from available remote sensing and climate data. Among the different approaches, machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly adopted, since they allow exploiting all the information on crop progress and environmental conditions and their relations with crop yield, achieving reliable and accurate estimations. However, interpreting the relationships learned by the ML models, and hence getting insights about the problem, remains a complex and usually unexplored task. Without accountability, confidence and trust in the ML models can be compromised. Here, we develop interpretable ML approaches for crop yield estimation that allow us investigating the most informative agro-ecological drivers and influencial regions learned by the models. We conduct a set of experiments to learn the selection of agro-ecological drivers leading to best estimations of main crops grown in Europe: corn, barley and wheat. As input data, we consider a variety of multi-scale Earth observation products sensitive to canopy greenness (e.g. EVI and LAI), its water-uptake dynamics (e.g. VOD) and available water (soil moisture), as well as climatic variables from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (e.g. temperature and radiation). Our results show that the best performances (R-2>0.55 for corn and R-2 >0.8 for both barley and wheat) are obtained when descriptors of soil, vegetation, and atmosphere status are used as input in the ML models. This combination of variables outperforms the results obtained using single variables as inputs or all variables altogether. We then further analyze the relations of input features with crop yield in the developed models by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We show how the information learned by the GPR model allows us to identify atypical or anomalous crop seasons across the study region, and investigate the underlying factors behind crop progress and failure in Europe.

TI  - Evaluation of axillary response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy with sentinel node biopsy and axillary wire in node-positive breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the safety and reliability of directed axillary dissection with sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and marked lymph node biopsy (MLNB) with axillary wire on the clipped node, for the selection of patients who are candidates for conservative axillary treatment after the diagnosis of node-positive breast cancer who show a complete axillary response after neoadjuvant treatment. Materials: A prospective cohort study was carried out at Miguel Servet University Hospital in Zaragoza. 66 patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer and initial histological axillary involvement were finally included, in which the biopsied node was marked with a titanium clip prior to the start of neoadjuvant treatment. All patients underwent axillary sampling using SNB or Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) by SNB and MLNB with axillary wire on the clipped node before performing lymphadenectomy. Results: The detection rate (DR) of the SNB was 100% with a mean of 1.8 sentinel nodes studied. In 14 patients, axillary sampling was performed only with SNB, with a false negative rate (FNR) of 14.29%, which decreased when 2 or more nodes were removed or when clipped node was removed. In 51 cases, double marking with SNB and MLNB with axillary wire was performed, which ensures excision of the clipped node in 96.1% of cases with a FNR of 1.96%. The negative predictive value (NPV) of the sample when the clipped node is studied was 96.8%. Conclusions: Targeted axillary dissection with SNB and MLNB with axillary wire on the clipped node is a safe and effective strategy for the selection of patients who are candidates for conservative axillary treatment after neoadjuvant treatment, avoiding unnecessary lymphadenectomies.

TI  - Imaging features of sentinel lymph node mapped by multidetector-row computed tomography lymphography in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis
T2  - BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Accurately assessing axillary lymph node (ALN) status in breast cancer is vital for clinical decision making and prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapped by multidetector-row computed tomography lymphography (MDCT-LG) for ALN metastasis in breast cancer patients. Methods 112 patients with breast cancer who underwent preoperative MDCT-LG examination were included in the study. Long-axis diameter, short-axis diameter, ratio of long-/short-axis and cortical thickness were measured. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate independent predictors associated with ALN metastasis. The prediction of ALN metastasis was determined with related variables of SLN using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results Among the 112 cases, 35 (30.8%) cases had ALN metastasis. The cortical thickness in metastatic ALN group was significantly thicker than that in non-metastatic ALN group (4.0 +/- 1.2 mm vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 mm, P < 0.001). Multi-logistic regression analysis indicated that cortical thickness of > 3.3 mm (OR 24.53, 95% CI 6.58-91.48, P < 0.001) had higher risk for ALN metastasis. The best sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value(NPV) and AUC of MDCT-LG for ALN metastasis prediction based on the single variable of cortical thickness were 76.2%, 88.5%, 90.2% and 0.872 (95% CI 0.773-0.939, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion ALN status can be predicted using the imaging features of SLN which was mapped on MDCT-LG in breast cancer patients. Besides, it may be helpful to select true negative lymph nodes in patients with early breast cancer, and SLN biopsy can be avoided in clinically and radiographically negative axilla.

TI  - Pixel-level rice planting information monitoring in Fujin City based on time-series SAR imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the core issues of agricultural remote sensing, the mapping of crop planting and dynamic monitoring of crop growth in the urban area have always been limited by complex climatic conditions that induced optical image shortages. Considering that the backscattering signals of SAR image data are sensitive to crop phenological period, the paper presents a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) model to realize the wide-area planting thematic mapping at the pixel level. Taking Fujin City of Heilongjiang province in China as a specific study area, we selected rice as the typical research object and obtained urban-scale rice planting thematic mapping using Sentinel-1A image data derived from April to October 2020. Based on the proposed FCN classification method, the rice extraction precision is up to 95.7%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.90. Comparative analysis indicated that the proposed model is superior to the traditional random forest classification model in extraction precision and kappa coefficient. Further analysis showed that the rice growth cycle in Fujin City was consistent with the time series of VH/VV polarization coefficient ratio and had prominent phenological cycle characteristics. Relevant research data and results proved that high-precision planting thematic mapping at an urban scale could be achieved based on time series SAR image data sets. And the proposed FCN classification model is helping to dynamic monitoring of crop growth and related phenological research.

TI  - Risk factors for incidence of dementia in primary care practice: a retrospective cohort study in older adults
T2  - FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The dementias are long-term, chronic conditions caused by progressive neurological degeneration. Current literature suggests that cardiovascular disease risk factors may contribute to the onset of dementia; however, evidence of these associations is inconsistent. Objectives This study aimed to examine the impact of risk factors on dementia onset in older adults diagnosed and managed in Canadian primary care settings. Methods A retrospective cohort study was employed utilizing electronic medical records data in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). Patients aged 65+ years with no dementia diagnosis at baseline who were followed from 2009 to 2017 with a run-in year to exclude existing undiagnosed dementia cases. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate risk. Results Age was associated with an increased incidence risk of dementia in both examined age groups: 65-79 years (13%) and 80+ years (5%). History of depression increased dementia risk by 38% and 34% in the age groups. There were significant associations with lower social deprivation area quintile, smoking history, osteoarthritis, and diabetes mellitus in patients aged 65-79 years but not in those aged 80+ years. Sex, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and the use of antihypertensive medications and statins were not associated with risk of incident dementia diagnosis. Conclusions The association between chronic health conditions and dementia onset is complicated. Primary care electronic medical record data might be useful for research in this topic, though follow-up time is still relatively short to observe a clear causal relationship. Future studies with more complete data may provide evidence for dementia preventive strategies within primary care practice.

TI  - Leaf nitrogen content estimation using top-of-canopy airborne hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote estimation of leaf nitrogen content is a critical requirement for precision farm management. Precise knowledge of nitrogen distribution in the crop enables farmers to decide the fertilisation amount required at specific locations on the farm. Importantly, nitrogen related molecules in plants are transported using water molecules, and water molecules surround the amide bonds (a plant protein created from nitrogen). Consequently, the nitrogen in various crop parts loses its activity in the absence of sufficient water molecules. The association of water molecules around plant proteins makes the optical remote estimation of plant nitrogen challenging as nitrogen and water molecules simultaneously affect the reflectance data. Moreover, the coarse spatial resolution of satellite data and sparse canopy coverage at early growth stages of the crop make it challenging to estimate leaf-level nitrogen contents. Accordingly, this research developed a leaf nitrogen content estimation model using drone-based top-of-canopy 400-1000 nm pure pixel hyperspectral images collected from a maize research farm treated with different water and nitrogen levels. Leaf level spectral signatures were also collected using a field spectroradiometer and used to identify indices more sensitive to nitrogen than water. The leaves were also destructively sampled for obtaining ground truth leaf water and nitrogen content. Red-edge region bands of electromagnetic spectra were identified to be sensitive to leaf nitrogen content. A synthetic data was created using maximum and minimum values of these indices and crop growth stage information, which was further used for training a gradient-boosting machine model to estimate leaf nitrogen content from drone-based hyperspectral images. The estimated leaf nitrogen content values from drone observations were critically analysed with respect to leaf water content values. For water-stressed areas, the model gave an R2 and RMSE of 0.63 and 2.74 mg/g, respectively. However, the model did not perform adequately for well irrigated areas, having an R2 and RMSE of 0.26 and 4.54 mg/g, respectively.

TI  - Disaggregated PROBA-V data allows monitoring individual crop phenology at a higher observation frequency than Sentinel-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based monitoring of crop phenology is commonly built on the analysis of Vegetation Index (VI) time series by extracting phenological metrics. The relatively fine detection of the various timings in crops growth during their development cycle depends on the density and regularity of valid observations. Medium spatial resolution (MSR) daily observations provide consistent cloud-free n-day composite time series, suitable for phenological applications, but do not offer an adequate spatial resolution. MSR pixels are generally mixed pixels or "mixels", composed of several land cover classes, which complicate crop-specific monitoring from space. To address the MSR mixel problem, we implemented a spatial disaggregation (SD) approach that estimates a cropspecific VI based on the crop fraction in a mixel provided by a land use map. First, SD was applied on synthetic MSR data (i.e. Sentinel-2 data aggregated at 300 m) in order to test the method in an ideal case. After validation, the method was applied to PROBA-V data, using 300 m and 10-day composites over a large area around Paris, for four main crops (i.e. winter cereals, spring barley, oilseed rape and maize) in 2016-2017. The evaluation of SD was done by comparing disaggregated data with reference data (i.e. Sentinel-2 10 m). Indeed, two main results were observed, i) SD was able to reconstruct the crop-specific VI time series of all crops and ii) PROBA-V data increased the number of crop-specific VI valid observations at certain stages of the crop's growth period compared to Sentinel-2 data, this with a consistent and regular revisit throughout the growth cycle. In conclusion, SD can be used to improve the exploitation of MSR data in seasonal crop monitoring, especially during the transition periods when the VI of crops are likely to change quickly. This paves the way for monitoring crop phenology over fragmented landscapes, from sensors such as MODIS or SPOT-VEGETATION, even for years before Sentinel-2 launch.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Up to 60% of patients with a precancerous endometrial lesion will ultimately be diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. In the context of endometrial carcinoma, adequate surgical staging- including lymph-node assessment-should be performed and dictate the necessity of postoperative adjuvant treatments. Our main objective was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of preoperative identifying concomitant endometrial cancer in patients with confirmed precancerous endometrial lesions. Methods: All women diagnosed with a precancerous lesion between 2010 and 2018 in our center were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were then divided into groups according to whether or not a PET/CT was performed preoperatively and the presence of endometrial carcinoma at the final pathology. Results: A total of 128 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 66 underwent PET/CT. The sensitivity of PET/CT in identifying carcinoma was 78.3%, with a specificity of 79.1%. PET/CT failed to identify carcinoma in 5 out of 66 patients (7.6%). In the PET/CT group, 18 of 23 patients (78.3%) had adequate surgical staging, compared to only 4 of 31 patients (12.9%) in the mapping.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Resolution Improvement of Actual Evapotranspiration Maps Using Landsat and MODIS Data Fusion
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Producing daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) maps with high spatial resolution has always been a challenge for remote sensing research. This study assessed the feasibility of producing daily ETa maps with a high spatial resolution (30 m) for the sugarcane farmlands of Amir Kabir Sugarcane Agro-industry (Khuzestan, Iran) using three different scenarios. In the first scenario, the reflectance bands of Landsat 8 were predicted from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) algorithm. Also, the thermal bands of Landsat 8 were predicted by the spatiotemporal adaptive data fusion algorithm for temperature mapping (SADFAT). Then, ETa amounts were calculated employing such bands and the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL). In the second scenario, the input data needed by SEBAL were downscaled using the MODIS images and different methods. Then, using the downscaled data and SEBAL, daily ETa amounts with a spatial resolution of 30 m were calculated. In the third scenario, ETa data acquired by MODIS were downscaled to the scale of Landsat 8. In the second and third scenarios, downscaling of the data was carried out by the ratio, regression, and neural networks methods with two different approaches. In the first approach, the Landsat image on day 1 and the relationship between the two MODIS images on day 1 and the other days were used. In the second approach, the simulated image on the previous day and the relationship between the two consecutive images of MODIS were used. Comparing the simulated ETa amounts with the ETa amounts derived from Landsat 8, the first scenario had the best result with an RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.68 mm day(-1). The neural networks method used in the third scenario with the second approach had the worst result with an RMSE of 2.25 mm day(-1), which was however a better result than the ETa amounts derived from MODIS with an RMSE of 3.19 mm day(-1). The method developed in this study offers an efficient and inexpensive way to produce daily ETa maps with a high spatial resolution. Furthermore, we suggest that STARFM and SADFAT algorithms have acceptable accuracies in the simulation of reflectance and thermal bands of Landsat 8 images for homogeneous areas.

TI  - Country-wide mapping of harvest areas and post-harvest forest recovery using Landsat time series data in Japan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of forest harvesting and subsequent vegetation recovery provides valuable insights for effective forest management. Although Landsat time series data offers spatially explicit information regarding large-area forest disturbance and recovery, the detailed characterization of country-wide harvest and postharvest recovery is insufficient. Despite the importance of planting in harvest areas, the mapping of areas replanted by forest management after harvest are not usually considered. This study investigated an approach to detect harvest and other forest disturbance areas country-wide and to characterize post-harvest recovery using annual Landsat time series data from 1984 to 2020. To do so, a random forest algorithm was used to classify disturbance agents and stable land cover classes using predictor variables derived from the LandTrendr temporal segmentation of five spectral indices and topographic and climate data. Post-harvest recovery was characterized as forest species composition (i.e., coniferous/broadleaved forests) and then used to link replanted areas in harvest areas. The disturbance agents/stable land cover classification achieved producer's and user's accuracies of 80.1% (+/- 4.8%) and 93.8% (+/- 3.8%), respectively, for the forest harvest class. The overall accuracy of postharvest recovery was high (83.9%) and a comparison with statistical data of replanted areas for entire Japan showed good agreement in trends and estimated area with a root mean square error of 2687.8 ha (15.2%). Overall, harvested forest area accounted for 4.6% of the total land area in Japan during the past 35 years. The results indicated that approximately 60.0% of coniferous plantation forests were recovered as coniferous forests. The spatial and temporal distribution of coniferous forests after harvest presumably represented the replanting activity of forest management in harvest areas. The approach presented in this study has the potential to provide valuable information on country-wide replantation activity in harvest areas using Landsat time series data.

TI  - Long-term variations in aerosol optical properties, types, and radiative forcing in the Sichuan Basin, Southwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term variations in aerosol optical properties, types, and radiative forcing over the Sichuan Basin (SCB) and surrounding regions in Southwest China were investigated based on two-decade data (2001-2020) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation, and the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer model. The results showed that the aerosol optical depth (AOD550nm) in the SCB, a major polluted region in Southwest China, experienced an increasing tendency at a rate of +0.052 yr-1 during 2001-2006; thereafter, it decreased speedy up from -0.020 to -0.058 yr-1 over recent years, whereas the interannual variation in angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE470-660nm) presented a persistently increasing trend during 2001-2020, with a rate of +0.014 yr-1. An improved atmospheric environment but an enhanced fine particle contribution to regional aerosols in the SCB was observed. Over the polluted SCB region, the dominant aerosol types were biomass burning/urban industrial and mixedtype aerosols with the proportions of 80.7%-87.5% in regional aerosols, with a higher frequency of clean aerosols in recent years, reflecting an effect of controlling anthropogenic emission in the SCB owing to governmental regulation. By contrast, few changes were observed in the aerosol types and amounts in the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP), where clean continental aerosols dominate with high proportion of 93.7% in the clean atmospheric environment. A significant decline in polluted anthropogenic aerosols was observed below 3 km over the SCB, resulting in the regional aerosol extinction coefficients at 532 nm (EC532nm) were declined by -0.22 km-1 from 2013 to 2020. Notably, the decreases in aerosol radiative forcing within the atmosphere were found in

TI  - Potential of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Sentinel-1 time-series for the monitoring of phenological cycles in a deciduous forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual time-series of the two satellites C-band SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Sentinel-1A and 1B data over five years were used to characterize the phenological cycle of a temperate deciduous forest. Six phenological metrics of the start (SOS), middle (MOS) and end (EOS) of budburst and leaf expansion stage in spring, and the start (SOF), middle (MOF) and end (EOF) of leaf senescence in autumn were extracted using an asymmetric double sigmoid function (ADS) fitted to the time-series of the ratio (VV/VH) of backscattering at co-polarization VV (vertical-vertical) and at cross polarization VH (vertical-horizontal). Phenological metrics were also derived from other four vegetation proxies (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI time-series from Sentinel-2A and 2B images, and in situ measurements of NDVI measurements, Leaf Area Index LAI and litterfall temporal dynamics). These estimated phenological metrics were compared to phenological observations obtained by visual observations from the ground, achieved using binoculars by three inter-calibrated observers, on a bi-weekly basis during the budburst and weekly during the senescence. We observe a decrease in the backscattering coefficient (sigma 0) at VH cross polarization during the leaf development and the expansion phase in spring and an increase during the senescence phase, contrary to what is usually observed on various types of crops. In vertical polarization, sigma 0VV shows very little variation throughout the year. S-1 time-series of VV/VH ratio provide a good description of the seasonal vegetation cycle allowing the estimation of spring and autumn phenological metrics. Estimates provided by VV/VH of budburst dates using MOS criterion differ by approximately 8 days on average (mean average deviation) from phenological observations. During senescence phase, estimates using MOF criterion are later and deviate by about 20 days from phenological observations of leaf senescence while the differences are of the order of 2 to 4 days between the phenological observations and estimates based on in situ NDVI and LAI time-series, respectively. A deviation of about 7 days, comparable to that observed during budburst, is obtained between the estimates of senescence (MOF) from S-1 and those determined from the in situ monitoring of litterfall. While in spring, leaf emergence and expansion described by LAI or NDVI explain the increase of VV/VH (or the decrease of sigma 0VH), during senescence, S-1 VV/VH is decorrelated from LAI or NDVI and is better explained by litterfall temporal dynamics. This behavior resulted in a hysteresis phenomenon observed on the relationships between VV/VH and NDVI or LAI. For the same LAI or NDVI, the response of VV/ VH is different depending on the phenological phase considered. This study shows the high potential offered by Sentinel-1 SAR C-band time-series for the detection of forest phenology, thus overcoming the limitations caused by cloud cover in optical remote sensing of vegetation phenology.

TI  - The modified layer-by-layer weakening solar radiation models based on relative humidity and air quality index
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has a significant weakening effect on solar radiation. Therefore, it is important for the development and utilization of solar energy to establish a solar radiation model under the influence of fog and haze. Based on the analysis of existing layer-by-layer weakening solar radiation models, the discontinuous meteorological data provided by MODIS satellite are replaced by continuous measured data from meteorological stations. The beam solar radiation model and diffuse solar radiation model are modified by using relative humidity (phi) and air quality index (AQI). The results show that the correction effects of these modified models are better. The R value of beam solar radiation models have increased by 5.74%, the R value of diffuse solar radiation models have increased by 41.27%, and other statistical parameters (RSE, RMSE and NSE) have also been improved to a certain extent. The calculated value of the modified models is closer to the measured data. In addition, the order of correction parameters also has an effect on the results. The research shows that the best correction effect is to use relative humidity first and then AQI. According to this method, the layer-by-layer weakening solar radiation models can be more accurate and reliable. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validation and comparison of surface shortwave and longwave radiation products over the three poles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has currently become a great concern to the international community, among which the three poles (the Arctic, Antarctic, and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) are the most serious. In this paper, in order to improve the understanding of the matter and energy cycle in the three poles and even the world, eleven shortwave products, (namely, CERES-SYN, ERA5, MERRA-2, NCEP-CFSR, JRA-55, GLDAS, BESS_Rad, MCD18A1, ISCCPHXG-SSR, GLASS and APP-x), and seven longwave products, (CERES-SYN, ERA5, MERRA-2, NCEP-CFSR, JRA55, GLDAS, and APP-x) are evaluated and inter-compared in terms of accuracy. During the assessment, the ground measurements collected from four independent ground observation networks (BSRN, CEOP, TPDC, and NMC) are used as reference, and the being compared products are aggregated to the same spatial and temporal scales to make them comparable. To better examine their performance, the eleven radiation products are comprehensively compared in multiple spatial (original scale and 1 degrees x 1 degrees) and temporal scales (1-hourly, 3-hourly, daily, and monthly means, and instantaneous). The results show that in the three poles, CERES-SYN and ERA5 show overall better accuracy, at daily, 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolutions. The (r)bias and (r)RMSE are less than (3%)5 W/m2 and (23%)40 W/m2 for SWDR, and less than (3%)7 W/m(2) and (15%)25 W/m(2) for LWDR, respectively, over the polar regions (the Arctic and Antarctic), which are generally better than that of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for most products. The remote sensing products and reanalysis products have their own advantages and disadvantages at different regions. In addition, with the spatio-temporal resolution decreasing, the accuracy of radiation products will gradually increase, except for the products of MCD18A1, ISCCP-HXG-SSR, NCEP-CFSR and GLDAS.

TI  - FrMLNet: Framelet-Based Multilevel Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Most modern satellites can provide two types of images: 1) panchromatic (PAN) image and 2) multispectral (MS) image. The former has high spatial resolution and low spectral resolution, while the latter has high spectral resolution and low spatial resolution. To obtain images with both high spectral and spatial resolution, pansharpening has emerged to fuse the spatial information of the PAN image and the spectral information of the MS image. However, most pansharpening methods fail to preserve spatial and spectral information simultaneously. In this article, we propose a framelet-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for pansharpening which makes it possible to pursue both high spectral and high spatial resolution. Our network consists of three subnetworks: 1) feature embedding net; 2) feature fusion net; and 3) framelet prediction net. Different from conventional CNN methods directly inferring high-resolution MS images, our approach learns to predict their framelet coefficients from available PAN and MS images. The introduction of multilevel feature aggregation and hybrid residual connection makes full use of spatial information of PAN image and spectral information of MS image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments at reduced- and full-resolution demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more appealing results than other state-of-the-art pansharpening methods.

TI  - Radiance-based retrieval of total water vapor content from sentinel-3A OLCI NIR channels using ground-based GPS measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We calibrated the integrated water vapor (IWV) data retrieved from near-infrared (NIR) channels of the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3A satellite using in-situ GPS-sensed IWV observations. Unlike conventional water vapor retrieval methodologies relying upon radiative transfer code, this method utilized a regression equation to empirically estimate GPS IWV from two NIR absorption channels at 900 nm and 940 nm. The GPS IWV data were used as reference to define the relationship between the measured radiance ratio and IWV. We collected IWV data from June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019 from 453 GPS stations situated in the inland and coastal areas of Australia. The retrieval approach was analyzed by using different sample sizes and training datasets. The evaluation results between June 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020 in Australia indicated that the algorithm could reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the operational OLCI IWV products by 12.91% from 3.114 to 2.712 mm at the O19 channel, by 10.69% to 2.781 mm at the O20 channel, and by 11.75% to 2.748 mm for the weighted mean IWV when compared with GPS reference IWV data. When compared to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reference IWV data, the RMSE was reduced by 12.94% from 3.154 to 2.745 mm, by 11.04% to 2.805 mm, and by 11.93% to 2.777 mm, at the O19 channel, O20 channel, and the weighted mean, respectively. The spatiotemporal performance of the OLCI IWV measurements was improved in both station-scale and daily-scale after applying the new empirical regression retrieval method. The seasonal and land-surface-type dependence of the retrieval approach was also discussed in this research.

TI  - The damage of urban vegetation from super typhoon is associated with landscape factors: Evidence from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have investigated the impacts of typhoons on natural vegetation, but the influencing factor of urban vegetation damage from super typhoon is not clear. Therefore, this study investigated the vegetation damage patterns in eight cities affected by Typhoon Mangkhut (the 2nd strongest tropical storm worldwide in 2018) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 images. The vegetation damage maps have an overall accuracy of 97% using the very high-resolution WorldView-3 images as reference data. The results show that (1) The typhoon-induced vegetation damage show high spatial heterogeneity in urban areas and varies with land cover types. Residential greenspace and street trees are more susceptible to typhoon disturbance than natural vegetation. (2) Wind intensity is still an important factor in urban vegetation damage (r(2) = 0.43, P value <0.001). (3) Urban vegetation damage positively relates to vegetation sparseness for all cities (r: 0.39-0.89, P value <0.01), whereas negatively correlated to the height of surrounding buildings (r =-0.57, P value <0.01), suggesting that both biotic and abiotic factors of the urban environment have influences on the resistance of vegetation to storms. This study provides insights into the resistance and resilience of urban vegetation to strong typhoons that can be used for urban forestry planning and management.

TI  - Cotton yield estimation model based on machine learning using time series UAV remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield prediction is of great practical significance for farmers to make reasonable decisions, such as decisions on crop insurance, storage demand, cash flow budget, fertilizer, water and other input factors. The traditional yield measurement method is sampling surveys, which require a large area of destructive sampling of cotton fields and consume considerable time and labor costs. This study established a cotton yield estimation model based on time series Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data. The U-Net semantic segmentation network is used to recognize and extract the boll opening pixels in high-resolution visible images, and the boll opening pixel percentage (BOP) is calculated according to the network extraction results. By combining the multispectral images and the pixel coverage of cotton bolls, a Bayesian regularization BP (back propagation) neural network was used to predict cotton yields. In order to simplify the input parameters of the model, the stepwise sensitivity analysis method is used to eliminate redundant variables and obtain the optimal input feature set. The experimental results show that the R2 of the proposed model is 0.853 at the scale of 0.81 m2 (average results of ten-fold cross validation). This study provides a method that can simultaneously meet the requirements of large-area and small-scale forecasting of cotton yields and provides a new idea for cotton yield measurement and breeding screening.

TI  - Intra-day global horizontal irradiance forecast using FY-4A clear sky index
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forecasting of Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) plays an irreplaceable role in power system expansion, power generation production scheduling, maintenance scheduling and ensuring continuous power supply. A method for GHI forecasting based on FY-4A satellite images is proposed, called FY-4A-Heliosat. This method is derived from the clear sky model (MCclear) and the future clear sky index (CSI), which is obtained by comparing the continuous cloud albedo (CAL) maps derived from AGRI satellite images according to Heliosat-2 method. The forecast horizon is 30 min to 3 h with a 30-min horizon resolution. The combination of climatology and persistence model (CP) is chosen as reference forecasts. Under all sky conditions, the results show that compared with CP model, FY-4A-Heliosat model is better in most cases and seasons. The FY-4A-Heliosat method underestimates the GHI in four seasons for all time horizons. Annual studies indicate that the FY-4A-Heliosat method performs better than the CP method for all forecast horizons; the nRMSE is 17% to 25% for the annual performance. Forecasts with change in cloud conditions show that: the FY-4A-Heliosat method performs better than the CP method in clear, partially cloudy, overcast and clear-to-cloudy conditions. For the cloudy-to clear set, the FY-4A-Heliosat method needs to be improved future. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for very short term GHI forecasting.

TI  - Mapping forest in the southern Great Plains with ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Landsat 7/8 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States, comprising the states Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, spans diverse climatic regions. In recent decades, woody plant continues to expand and form forest (above 2 m in height) across the SGP. However, our knowledge of the forest amount and distribution in this region is very limited. This study aims to map forest, especially evergreen forest (above 2 m in height) in the SGP for the time period of 2015-2017. Annual mosaic data of HH and HV polarization backscattering (25 m) from Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) aboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), along with their difference (HH-HV) and ratio (HH/HV) were utilized. With the four bands (HH, HV, difference, ratio) of 2017, decision rules of forest were developed based on 30 randomly selected forest plots (as of 2017) across the study area. With the decision rules, a PALSAR-2 based forest map was created for each year from 2015 to 2017. Then an annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold of 0.5, derived from Landsat 8 data of 2017 and the 30 forest plots, was used to filter potential commission error of rough surface and building in each PALSAR-2 based forest map. After that, a forest map circa 2016 was generated, in which each forest pixel was identified as such at least twice during 2015 and 2017. Lastly, a threshold of seasonal NDVI change (0.3) was derived to extract evergreen forest out of the forest map circa 2016. Accuracy assessment for the result forest map suggests a user's accuracy of 99.2% and a producer's accuracy of 88.7% for forest. Accuracy assessment for the evergreen forest map suggests a user's accuracy of 97.3% and a producer's accuracy of 90.5% for evergreen forest. The result forest map, especially the evergreen forest map, paves the way for follow-up studies on forest resource and woody plant encroachment in the SGP.

TI  - A feasible framework to downscale NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery using multi-source spatial variables and geographically weighted regression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud-free monthly composite of global nighttime light (NTL) data of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) day/night band (DNB) provides indispensable indications of human activities and settlements. However, the coarse spatial resolution (15 arc sec) of NTL imagery greatly restricts its application potential. This study proposes a feasible framework to downscale NPP-VIIRS NTL using muti-source spatial variables and geographically weighted regression (GWR) method. High-resolution auxiliary variables were acquired from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and social media platforms. GWR-based downscaling procedures were consequently implemented to obtain NTL at a 100-m resolution. The downscaled NTL data were validated against Loujia1-01 imagery based on the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results suggest that the data quality was suitably improved after downscaling, yielding higher R-2 (0.604 vs. 0.568) and lower RMSE (8.828 vs. 9.870 nW/cm(2)/sr) values than those of the original NTL data. Finally, the NTL was extendedly applied to detect impervious surfaces, and the downscaled NTL had higher accuracy than the original NTL. Therefore, this study facilitates data quality improvement of NPP-VIIRS NTL imagery by downscaling, thus enabling more accurate applications.

TI  - Field test of the surface soil moisture mapping using Sentinel-1 radar data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil surface moisture is one of the key parameters for describing the hydrological state and assessing the potential availability of water for irrigated plants. Because the radar backscattering coefficient is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 data may support soil surface moisture mapping at high spatial resolution by detecting spatial and temporal changes at the field scale for precision irrigation management. This mapping is required to control soil water erosion and preferential water flow to improve irrigation water efficiency and minimise negative impacts on surface and ground water bodies. Direct observations of soil surface moisture (5-cm thickness) were performed at an experimental plot in the study site of the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Irrigated Agriculture, near the village Vodnyy, Volgograd region. Soil surface moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 was performed at the same location. A second set of soil surface moisture was calculated for the soil sampling sites using the permittivity model, based on the estimates of soil surface characteristics: a) reflectivity, obtained by the neural network method from Sentinel-1 observations; b) roughness, obtained from the geodata of the stereoscopic survey with unmanned aerial vehicle Phantom 4 Pro. The raster set of soil surface moisture geodata was obtained based on the reflectivity geodata raster set to solve the inverse problem using a permittivity model that considers the soil texture of the experimental plot. The determination coefficient (0.948) and standard deviation (2.04%) were obtained by comparing both sets of soil moisture point geodata taken from the same soil sampling sites. The values confirmed a satisfactory linear correlation between the directly measured and indirectly modelled sets. A comparison of the two sets of geodata indicated a satisfactory reproduction of the first set by the second set. As a result, the developed method can be considered as the scientific and methodological basis of the new tech-nology of soil surface moisture monitoring by radar, which is one of the basic characteristics used in precision ir-rigation management.

TI  - Evaluating a spatiotemporal shape-matching model for the generation of synthetic high spatiotemporal resolution time series of multiple satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data are required to monitor land surface biophysical properties and their seasonal and inter-annual dynamics at sub-field to field scales. To generate such time series, various algorithms have been developed to fuse infrequent cloud-free Landsat observations with daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. An early and widely used Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) was developed based on the assumptions that observations from the two sensors are consistent in terms of spatial aggregation and temporal variation. These assumptions are not always valid in the real world, especially in a complex heterogeneous region. In this study, we investigated a Spatiotemporal Shape-Matching Model (SSMM) to generate synthetic time series of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data. The SSMM, which is conceptually different from the image pair-based STARFM and STARFM-like approaches, makes full use of all spatiotemporally matched fine and coarse resolution data in an entire time series to establish a temporally uniformed fusion model for a given fine resolution pixel. The SSMM assumes that the temporal shapes of both the fine and coarse resolution time series are similar, but their magnitudes and phenological phases could differ largely even for the same vegetation type. This study assessed the capability of the SSMM to generate high spatiotemporal resolution time series of two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2). Specifically, we generated the synthetic 30 m time series using the SSMM and STARFM algorithms in the northeastern United States based on 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data and 30 m Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observations. We then evaluated the SSMM-derived 30 m time series across 15 land cover types and various degrees of heterogeneity. The result indicates that the SSMM is able to effectively generate synthetic time series in all different land cover types, which has advantages over the STARFM approach. Although the SSMM performance is degraded in heterogeneous regions, it can explain 82-91% of variations in 30 m EVI2 time series and produce constant root mean square error (0.053-0.056) across various levels of heterogeneity. Moreover, the SSMM can explain 87%-93% and 69%-87% of variation in 30 m EVI2 time series, respectively, with the models established using more than 10 pairs and 4-10 pairs of fine and coarse resolution observations. This suggests that the SSMM is also capable of generating high spatiotemporal resolution time series using historical Landsat time series with limited cloud-free observations, which are critical for studying vegetation dynamics and monitoring crop conditions.

TI  - A new method for monitoring start of season (SOS) of forest based on multisource remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As a sensitive indicator of climate change, forest phenology (e.g., the start of season (SOS)) has profound impacts on the global carbon cycle. Traditional phenological observations are based on surface observation networks. Generally, the outcomes of this manner are less representative and hard to implement in wide forested regions. Remote sensing based observation of forest SOS has currently been a popular way. Those sensors with coarse spatial resolution have been widely used to estimate forest SOS, but they create serious estimation errors in areas of high heterogeneity. Medium-resolution sensors, such as Landsat, face significant challenges in SOS monitoring due to the long revisit period. In this study, we aimed to develop a new method to estimate forest SOS from 2013 to 2019. First, we collected all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, and then redefined the linear regression coefficients for the bandpass adjustment to weaken the surface reflectance (SR) differences in different sensors. Subsequently, we improved and developed the modified continuous change detection and classification (MCCDC) model to generate daily vegetation index curves. Finally, we adopted the logistic regression model to test the potential of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface water index (LSWI) in evaluating the annual SOS. The reduced root mean square error (RMSE) for all bands after the integration indicated that the adjustment was successful. We visually compared Landsat's synthetic images with the actual acquired images and found that their respective false-colour composites were highly similar. Assessing the SOS from the EVI, NDVI and LSWI showed different estimated results. By comparing the annual SOS derived from the three indices with the field observations, it was found that the SOS based on the EVI maintained a low consistency with the field observations. The SOS accuracy from LSWI was the highest and most forest SOS from LSWI in the study area were mainly concentrated in 80-150 days. These three indices all showed that the SOS always fluctuated by +/- 4 days from 2013 to 2019. Facing the lack of clear remote sensing images with medium spatial resolution in cloudy and rainy areas, this study proposes an improved method to generate clear daily vegetation index images at a spatial resolution of 30 m, making annual SOS monitoring promising and feasible.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), referred to as the "Queen of Forages" because of its importance among forage crops, provides high quality forage for the livestock industry. The timing and frequency of alfalfa hay harvesting have implications on its quality and quantity. With ever-increasing capability, it is possible to use satellite remote sensing data to monitor alfalfa harvests. This study investigated the potential of using satellite remote sensing to capture frequent harvesting events on an alfalfa field in central Oklahoma. Both passive remote sensing data, namely Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat-7 and -8, Sentinel-2, Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), and active remote sensing data, namely Sentinel-1, were included. Our results indicate that good quality optical remote sensing datasets (i.e., cloud and cloud shadow free) with both fine spatial (<= 100 m) and high temporal (effective observation at 8-day intervals or better) resolutions are necessary to detect frequent alfalfa harvesting events, challenged by possible adverse weather conditions and quick regrowth of vegetation after harvest. Landsat (7 and 8) and Sentinel-2 were more sensitive to changes in vegetation indices after harvest than MODIS due to their higher spatial resolutions, which helped avoid the mixed pixel issue in MODIS caused by its coarser spatial resolution (similar to 500 m). Combining Landsat (7 and 8) with Sentinel-2 imageries through linear regression between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, up to one week apart, increased the accuracy of detecting frequent alfalfa harvesting events. The responses of HLS to alfalfa harvesting events were similar with fused Landsat and Sentinel-2 data using their linear relationship of NDVI values. However, the high noise level in the HLS data needs to be minimized before it can be used to detect alfalfa harvests at the regional scale. In most cases, both Sentinel-1 radar backscatter coefficients (vertical transmit and vertical receive, VV + vertical transmit and horizontal receive, VH) and interferometric coherence from Sentinel-1 Simple Look Complex (SLC) data were decreased by harvesting events in small incident angle observations (34.31 degrees). No consistent relationships existed between backscatter or coherence and alfalfa harvests in larger incident angle observations (45.11 degrees). Future studies should focus on small incident angle observations instead of processing all of the radar data, which has big data volume and is time-consuming. Overall, active radar has the potential to detect alfalfa harvesting events. However, it is visually less intuitive than optical data with incident angles, quantity harvested, and soil moisture being the compounding factors. This study illustrates that combining multiple optical sensors with a fine spatial resolution (e.g., Landsat-7, 8, and Sentinel-2) and/or fusing radar with optical remote sensing to increase the temporal resolution are promising approaches to detect frequent alfalfa harvesting events and other hay harvesting activities.

TI  - Image super-resolution with dense-sampling residual channel-spatial attention networks for multi-temporal remote sensing image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Image super-resolution (SR) techniques can benefit a wide range of applications in the remote sensing (RS) community, including image classification. This issue is particularly relevant for image classification on time series data, considering RS datasets that feature long temporal coverage generally have a limited spatial resolution. Recent advances in deep learning brought new opportunities for enhancing the spatial resolution of historic RS data. Numerous convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods showed superior performance in terms of developing efficient end-to-end SR models for natural images. However, such models were rarely exploited for promoting image classification based on multispectral RS data. This paper proposes a novel CNN based framework to enhance the spatial resolution of time series multispectral RS images. Thereby, the proposed SR model employs Residual Channel Attention Networks (RCAN) as a backbone structure, whereas based on this structure the proposed models uniquely integrate tailored channel-spatial attention and dense-sampling mechanisms for performance improvement. Subsequently, state-of-the-art CNN-based classifiers are incorporated to produce classification maps based on the enhanced time series data. The experiments proved that the proposed SR model can enable unambiguously better performance compared to RCAN and other (deep learning-based) SR techniques, especially in a domain adaptation context, i.e., leveraging Sentinel-2 images for generating SR Landsat images. Furthermore, the experimental results confirmed that the enhanced multi-temporal RS images can bring substantial improvement on fine-grained multi-temporal land use classification.

TI  - Modeling the supply, demand, and stress of water resources using ecosystem services concept in Sirvan River Basin (Kurdistan-Iran)
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources modeling can provide valuable information to planners. In this respect, water yield is an ecosystem service with significant roles in the sustainability of societies and ecosystems. The present study aimed to model the supply and demand of water resources and identify their scarcity and stress in the Sirvan river basin. For this purpose, we employed the ecosystem services concept as new thinking in earth sciences and using soil, climate, and land use data. Firstly, the Landsat satellite images of 2019 were prepared after different corrections, and the land use map was produced. Then, precipitation, evapotranspiration, root restricting layer depth, and evapotranspiration coefficients of the land uses were prepared and modeled in InVEST 3.8.9 software environment. The findings indicated that the water yield in this river basin is 5,381 million m(3), with sub-basins 5, 11, and 1 having the highest water yield per year and sub-basin 2 having the lowest water yield. Moreover, sub-basins 5 and 11 had the highest water consumption. Based on the estimated water scarcity and stress index, sub-basin 8 has experienced water scarcity and sub-basin 4 water stress. We conclude that applying the InVEST Water Yield model to assess water resource status at the basin and sub-basins level can provide suitable results for planning.

TI  - Investigating molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Malaria vector control in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is plagued by several major challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, lack of access to health care systems and preventative measures, and more recently the widespread emergence of insecticide resistance among Anopheles mosquitoes. Across 26 provinces, insecticide resistance has been reported from multiple sentinel sites. However, to date, investigation of molecular resistance mechanisms among Anopheles vector populations in DRC has been more limited. Methods Adult Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and Anopheles funestus s.l. were collected from two sites in Sud-Kivu province and one site in Haut-Uele province and PCR-screened for the presence of 11 resistance mutations, to provide additional information on frequency of resistance mechanisms in the eastern DRC, and to critically evaluate the utility of these markers for prospective country-wide resistance monitoring. Results L1014F-kdr and L1014S-kdr were present in 75.9% and 56.7% of An. gambiae s.l. screened, respectively, with some individuals harbouring both resistant alleles. Across the three study sites, L43F-CYP4J5 allele frequency ranged from 0.42 to 0.52, with evidence for ongoing selection. G119S-ace1 was also identified in all sites but at lower levels. A triple mutant haplotype (comprising the point mutation CYP6P4-I236M, the insertion of a partial Zanzibar-like transposable element and duplication of CYP6AA1) was present at high frequencies. In An. funestus s.l. cis-regulatory polymorphisms in CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b were detected, with allele frequencies ranging from 0.82 to 0.98 and 0.65 to 0.83, respectively. Conclusions This study screened the most up-to-date panel of DNA-based resistance markers in An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus s.l. from the eastern DRC, where resistance data is lacking. Several new candidate markers (CYP4J5, G119S-ace1, the triple mutant, CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b) were identified, which are diagnostic of resistance to major insecticide classes, and warrant future, larger-scale monitoring in the DRC to inform vector control decisions by the National Malaria Control Programme.

TI  - Fires in Amazonian Blackwater Floodplain Forests: Causes, Human Dimension, and Implications for Conservation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon basin is being increasingly affected by anthropogenic fires, however, most studies focus on the impact of fires on terrestrial upland forests and do not consider the vast, annually inundated floodplains along the large rivers. Among these, the nutrient-poor, blackwater floodplain forests (igapos) have been shown to be particularly susceptible to fires. In this study we analyzed a 35-year time series (1982/1983-2016/2017) of Landsat Thematic Mapper from the Jau National Park (Central Amazonia) and its surroundings. Our overall objective was to identify and delineate fire scars in the igapo floodplains and relate the resulting time series of annual burned area to the presence of human populations and interannual variability of regional hydroclimatic factors. We estimated hydroclimatic parameters for the study region using ground-based instrumental data (maximum monthly temperature-T-max, precipitation-P, maximum cumulative water deficit-MCWD, baseflow index-BFI, minimum water level-WLmin90 of the major rivers) and large-scale climate anomalies (Oceanic Nino Index-ONI), considering the potential dry season of the non-flooded period of the igapo floodplains from September to February. Using a wetland mask, we identified 518,135 ha of igapo floodplains in the study region, out of which 17,524 ha (3.4%) burned within the study period, distributed across 254 fire scars. About 79% of the fires occurred close to human settlements (<10 km distance), suggesting that human activities are the main source of ignition. Over 92.4% of the burned area is associated with El Nino events. Non-linear regression models indicate highly significant relationships (p < 0.001) with hydroclimatic parameters, positive with T-max (R(2)adj. = 0.83) and the ONI (R(2)adj. = 0.74) and negative with P (R(2)adj. = 0.88), MCWD (R(2)adj. = 0.90), WLmin90 (R(2)adj. = 0.61) and BFI (R(2)adj. = 0.80). Hydroclimatic conditions were of outstanding magnitude in particular during the El Nino event in 2015/2016, which was responsible for 42.8% of the total burned floodplain area. We discuss these results under a historical background of El Nino occurrences and a political, demographic, and socioeconomic panorama of the study region considering the past 400 years, suggesting that disturbance of igapos by fires is not a recent phenomenon. Concluding remarks focus on current demands to increase the conservation to prevent and mitigate the impacts of fire in this vulnerable ecosystem.

TI  - Fish otolith microchemistry as a biomarker of the world's largest mining disaster
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fundao dam collapse occurred in late 2015, resulting in the largest disaster in the world involving mine tailings, releasing at least 50 million m3 of iron ore tailings into the Doce river basin (Brazil). Studies realized along the Doce river after the disaster showed high concentrations of some elements above recommended Brazilian standards in different environmental matrices such as Al, Ba, Co, Fe, Hg, Mn, and Ni. This study aims to test the hypothesis that otolith microchemistry can be used as a pollution biomarker over time, that is, the otoliths sampled in the directly impacted area (Doce estuary) will present higher concentrations of the chemical elements in relation to the two other indirectly impacted estuaries (Ipiranga and Sao Mateus). The marine catfish Genidens genidens was chosen as a sentinel species, as this species presents several features that characterize it as a key species of the estuarine environment. The hypothesis was tested from a comparison between estuaries of the element/Ca ratios (Ba, Fe, and Mn) from the otolith edge (representing more recent deposition) and through the elemental composition profile, from core to edge of otolith. For the otolith edge analyses, it was possible to determine significant differences between estuaries in all three element:Ca ratios (Ba, Fe, and Mn). For the profile analysis (from core to edge), the Doce river showed consistent concentrations of Fe:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios higher than those of the Ipiranga and Sao Mateus estuaries throughout the life of the fish. In otoliths sampled in the Doce estuary, the possible identified peak of the Ba:Ca and Mn:Ca ratios, was probably associated with the Fundao Dam disaster. The present study showed that otolith microchemistry can be used as a sclerochronological biomarker of metallic aquatic pollution.

TI  - Is image-guided core needle biopsy of borderline axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients clinically helpful?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: When borderline axillary lymph nodes (bALN) are identified on ultrasound (US) for breast cancer (BC) patients, preoperative management is unclear. We aimed to evaluate if core needle biopsy (CNB) for bALN is clinically helpful or disruptive.Methods: Retrospective review of BC patients with bALN from 2014 to 2019 was performed. Clinicopathologic data were compared for those who did and did not have CNB.Results: CNB (n = 34) and no CNB (n = 31) were similar with respect to clinicopathologic factors. Surgical LN-positive rate was the same between cohorts (p = 0.26). CNB was disruptive in 58.8 %; all had CNB for pN0 disease. CNB was helpful in 34.2 %: 14.7 % proceeded directly to axillary dissection; 17.6 % had positive LN localized after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Conclusions: CNB for bALN is more likely clinically disruptive and did not impact surgical LN positive rate. BC patients with bALN should undergo CNB only if it will change clinical management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Iran's Africa-Pivot Policy
T2  - MIDDLE EAST POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa is a pivotal continent for Iran, as the Islamic Republic aims to expand its influence in wider global vistas. Iran experiences frequent setbacks in developing its Africa policy, but the continent continues to offer ample opportunities to support Tehran. This is partly because revolutionary Iran's Africa policy evolves through a wide array of piecemeal political, security, maritime, economic, and cultural activities. A host of Iranian organizations implement Iran's Africa policy, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the Quds Force, the naval forces, inter-parliamentary groups, friendship associations, and local chambers of commerce, as well as charities, religious seminaries, and universities. This article explores Iran's policies and their impact across the African continent. It also shows how Iran's activities evolve as the country seizes opportunities to expand bilateral and regional ties with African countries while retracting its involvement when it is unable to ensure strong bonds. The ebb and flow in Iranian Africa policy challenges but continually offers Tehran a chance to explore its foreign relations across the continent; as a result, Africa will play a vital role in sustaining Iran's international contacts, ability to circumvent sanctions, and capacity to withstand pressures from rival powers. The undeniable spread of Islam across Africameans that Iran will make efforts to win followers and propagate its brand of religion and revolutionary worldview as part of measures to build strategic depth across the continent.

TI  - Life prognosis of sentinel node navigation surgery for early-stage gastric cancer: Outcome of lymphatic basin dissection
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDLymphatic basin dissection is a sentinel node biopsy method that is specific for gastric cancer. In this method, the dyed lymphatic system is dissected en bloc, and sentinel nodes are identified at the back table (ex vivo). Even with lymphatic basin dissection, blood flow to the residual stomach can be preserved, and function-preserving curative gastrectomy can be performed. The oncological safety of function-preserving curative gastrectomy combined with lymphatic basin dissection has not yet been fully investigated. We hypothesized that the oncological safety of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) is not inferior to that of the guidelines.AIMTo investigate the life prognosis of SNNS for gastric cancer in comparison with guidelines surgery.METHODSThis was a retrospective cohort study. Patients were selected from gastric cancer patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy from April 1999 to March 2016. Patients from April 1999 to August 2008 were from the Department of Surgery II, Kanazawa University Hospital, and patients from August 2009 to March 2016 were from the Department of Surgical Oncology, Kanazawa Medical University Hospital. Patients who were diagnosed with gastric cancer, which was preoperatively diagnosed as superficial type (type 0), 5 cm or less in length, clinical T1-2 and node negative, and underwent various gastrectomies guided by sentinel node navigation were retrospectively collected. The overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) of these patients (SNNS group) were investigated. Patients with gastric cancer of the same stage and who underwent guidelines gastrectomy with standard nodal dissection were also selected as the control group.RESULTSA total of 239 patients in the SNNS group and 423 patients in the control group were included. Pathological nodal metastasis was observed in 10.5% and 10.4% of the SNNS and control groups, respectively. The diagnostic abilities of sentinel node biopsy were 84% and 98.6% for sensitivity and accuracy, respectively. In the SNNS group, 81.6% of patients underwent modified gastrectomy or function-preserving curative gastrectomy with lymphatic basin dissection, in which the extent of nodal dissection was further reduced compared to the guidelines. The OS rate in the SNNS group was 96.8% at 5 years and was significantly better than 91.3% in the control group (P = 0.0014). The RFS rates were equal in both groups. After propensity score matching, there were 231 patients in both groups, and the cumulative recurrence rate was 0.43% at 5 years in the SNNS group and 1.30% in the control group, which was not statistically different.CONCLUSIONThe oncological safety of patients who undergo gastrectomy guided by sentinel node navigation is not inferior to that of the guidelines surgery.

TI  - Estimating population and urban areas at risk of coastal hazards, 1990-2015: how data choices matter
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The accurate estimation of population living in the low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ) - and at heightened risk from sea level rise - is critically important for policymakers and risk managers worldwide. This characterization of potential exposure depends on robust representations not only of coastal elevation and spatial population data but also of settlements along the urban-rural continuum. The empirical basis for LECZ estimation has improved considerably in the 13 years since it was first estimated that 10% of the world's population - and an even greater share of the urban population - lived in the LECZ (McGranahan et al., 2007a). Those estimates were constrained in several ways, not only most notably by a single 10m LECZ but also by a dichotomous urban-rural proxy and population from a single source. This paper updates those initial estimates with newer, improved inputs and provides a range of estimates, along with sensitivity analyses that reveal the importance of understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data. We estimate that between 750 million and nearly 1.1 billion persons globally, in 2015, live in the <= 10m LECZ, with the variation depending on the elevation and population data sources used. The variations are considerably greater at more disaggregated levels, when finer elevation bands (e.g., the <= 5m LECZ) or differing delineations between urban, quasi-urban and rural populations are considered. Despite these variations, there is general agreement that the LECZ is disproportionately home to urban dwellers and that the urban population in the LECZ has grown more than urban areas outside the LECZ since 1990. We describe the main results across these new elevation, population and urban-proxy data sources in order to guide future research and improvements to characterizing risk in low-elevation coastal zones (https://doi.org/10.7927/d1x1-d702, CIESIN and CIDR, 2021).

TI  - Symptom clusters: Revisiting the concept in nursing care for cancer patients
T2  - NURSING FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies on symptom clusters among cancer patients have been conducted intensively. However, the concept seems not to be well defined, hindering its utilization in clinical practice.Aim: The aim of this paper is to reconceptualize symptom cluster and discuss areas of future research.Results: A cluster of symptoms should not be viewed as simply as a group of symptoms appearing together. It should be clinically relevant, and symptom members should be interactive or have a mutual etiology. A cluster is declared as stable if its "quality" or "nature" is remained instead of merely having the same number of symptoms. Importantly, each symptom cluster should have a sentinel symptom. The sentinel symptom could be the one that predicts the presence of the cluster or could be the one that significantly interacts with other symptoms. The search for symptom clusters, which are common among various patient groups, might be helpful in some aspects. However, to better understand them, symptom clusters should be examined in specific populations.Conclusion: The nature of the relationship between symptom members, clinical relevance, sentinel symptom, stability, and prevalence are important features of a symptom cluster. More explorations into these properties by future studies are suggested.

TI  - Solar origins of a strong stealth CME detected by Solar Orbiter
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims. We aim to locate the origin of a stealth coronal mass ejection (CME) detected in situ by the MAG instrument on board Solar Orbiter and make connections between the CME observed at the Sun and the interplanetary CME (ICME) measured in situ. Methods. Remote sensing data were analysed using advanced image processing techniques to identify the source region of the stealth CME, and the global magnetic field at the time of the eruption was examined using potential field source surface models. The observations of the stealth CME at the Sun were compared with the magnetic field measured by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, and plasma properties were measured by the Wind spacecraft. Results. The source of the CME is found to be a quiet Sun cavity in the northern hemisphere. We find that the stealth CME has a strong magnetic field in situ, despite originating from a quiet Sun region with an extremely weak magnetic field. Conclusions. The interaction of the ICME with its surrounding environment is the likely cause of a higher magnetic field strength measured in situ. Stealth CMEs require multi-wavelength and multi-viewpoint observations in order to confidently locate the source region; however, their elusive signatures still pose many problems for space weather forecasting. The findings have implications for Solar Orbiter observing sequences with instruments such as EUI that are designed to capture stealth CMEs.

TI  - Detection of the sentinel lymph node with hybrid tracer (ICG-[<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-albumin nanocolloid) in intermediate- and high-risk endometrial cancer: a feasibility study
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Indocyanine green (ICG) is frequently used for the detection of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in gynecology, but it carries the loss of the presurgical SLN mapping provided by [Tc-99m]-based colloids. Hybrid tracers such as ICG-[Tc-99m]Tc-albumin nanocolloid combine the benefits of both components. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of this hybrid tracer injected by transvaginal ultrasound-guided myometrial injection of radiotracer (TUMIR) approach in the detection of SLNs in patients with intermediate- and high-risk EC. Methods Fifty-two patients with intermediate- and high-risk EC underwent SLN biopsy after injection of a hybrid tracer using the TUMIR approach, followed by pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. SLNs were detected preoperatively by lymphoscintigraphic study and intraoperatively by gamma probe and near-infrared (NIR) optical laparoscopic camera. Results Preoperative lymphatic drainage was obtained in 69% and intraoperative detection in 71.4% of patients. A total of 146 SLNs (4.17 SLNs/patient) were biopsied. Pelvic bilateral detection was observed in 57% of the women and paraaortic drainage in 34% of the patients. The radioactive component allowed the detection of SLN in 97.1% of the patients, while the fluorescent component detected 80%. In more than 17% of the patients with intraoperative detection, SLNs were detected only by the radioactive signal. Lymph node metastasis was identified in 14.3% of patients submitted to SLNB. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for metastatic involvement were 100%. Conclusion TUMIR injection of a hybrid tracer in patients with intermediate- and high-risk EC combines the benefits of the radiotracer and the fluorescence methods with a single tracer. The method increases the paraaortic detection rate and allows a potential increase in SLN detection. Notwithstanding, based on our findings, the radioactive component of the hybrid tracer cannot be obviated.

TI  - Pelvic sentinel lymph nodes have minimal impact on survival in melanoma patients
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lower limb or trunk melanoma often presents with femoral and pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The benefits of harvesting pelvic lymph nodes remain controversial. In this retrospective study, the frequency and predictors of pelvic SLNs (PSLNs), and the impact of PSLNs on survival and staging was investigated. Methods Altogether 285 patients with cutaneous melanoma located in the lower limb or trunk underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy of the inguinal/iliac lymph node basin at Helsinki University Hospital from 2009-2013. Patient characteristics, detailed pathology reports and follow-up data were retrieved from hospital files. Subgroups of patients categorized by presence of PSLNs were compared for outcome parameters including progression-free survival, melanoma-specific survival and groin recurrence. Results Superficial femoral/inguinal SLNs were present in all patients and 199 (69.8 per cent) also had PSLNs removed. Median number of SLNs per patient was five and median number of PSLNs was two. Sixty-three patients (22.1 per cent) had metastases in their SLNs and seven (2.5 per cent) had metastases in PSLNs. A single patient had metastases solely in PSLNs, while superficial SLNs remained negative. Harvesting PSLNs or the number of PSLNs retrieved had no impact on progression-free survival or overall survival. The removal of PSLNs did not affect the risk of postoperative seroma or lymphoedema. The only predictor of positive PSLNs was radioactivity count equal to or more than that of the hottest superficial SLNs. Conclusion Pelvic SLNs have minimal clinical impact on the outcome of melanoma patients especially in cases with negative superficial femoral/inguinal SLNs. Removal of PSLNs should be considered when they are the most radioactive nodes or equal to the hottest superficial femoral/inguinal SLNs in lymphoscintigraphy or during surgery. Preliminary results were presented in part at the International Sentinel Node Society Biennial Meeting, Tokyo, Japan, 11-13 October 2018.There is no consensus regarding the management of sentinel lymph nodes located in the pelvis in melanoma patients. In this study, the outcomes of 285 melanoma patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy of the inguinal/iliac lymph node basin were analysed. Pelvic sentinel lymph nodes had minimal impact on survival and staging of melanoma patients, and removal of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes may be considered when they are the most radioactive nodes in lymphoscintigraphy or during surgery.

TI  - A New Algorithm for Extracting Winter Wheat Planting Area Based on Ownership Parcel Vector Data and Medium-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the complex planting area with scattered parcels, combining the parcel vector data with remote sensing images to extract the winter wheat planting information can make up for the deficiency of the classification from remote sensing images simply. It is a feasible direction for precision agricultural subsidies, but it is difficult to collect large-scale parcel data and obtain high spatial resolution or time-series remote sensing images in mass production. It is a beneficial exploration of making use of existing parcel data generated by the ground survey and medium-resolution remote sensing images with suitable time and spatial resolution to extract winter wheat planting areas for large-scale precision agricultural subsidies. Therefore, this paper proposes a new algorithm to extract winter wheat planting areas based on ownership parcel data and medium-resolution remote sensing images for improving classification accuracy. Initially, the segmentation of the image is carried out. To this end, the parcel data is used to generate the region of interest (ROI) of each parcel. Second, the homogeneity of each ROI is detected by its statistical indices (mean value and standard deviation). Third, the parallelepiped classifier and rule-based feature extraction classification methods are utilized to conduct the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous ROIs. Finally, two classification results are combined as the final classification result. The new algorithm was applied to a complex planting area of 103.60 km(2) in central China based on the ownership parcel data and Gaofen-1 PMS and WFV remote sensing images in this paper. The experimental results show that the new algorithm can effectively extract winter wheat planting area, eliminate the problem of salt-and-pepper noise, and obtain high-precision classification results (kappa = 0.9279, overall accuracy = 96.41%, user's accuracy = 99.16%, producer's accuracy = 93.39%, commission errors = 0.84%, and omission errors = 6.61%) when the size of ownership parcels matches the spatial resolution of remote sensing images.

TI  - Estimating 2010-2015 anthropogenic and natural methane emissions in Canada using ECCC surface and GOSAT satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane emissions in Canada have both anthropogenic and natural sources. Anthropogenic emissions are estimated to be 4.1 Tg a(-1) from 2010-2015 in the National Inventory Report submitted to the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Natural emissions, which are mostly due to boreal wetlands, are the largest methane source in Canada and highly uncertain, on the order of similar to 20 Tg a(-1) in biosphere process models. Aircraft studies over the last several years have provided "snapshot" emissions that conflict with inventory estimates. Here we use surface data from the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in situ network and space-borne data from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) to determine 2010-2015 anthropogenic and natural methane emissions in Canada in a Bayesian inverse modelling framework. We use GEOS-Chem to simulate anthropogenic emissions comparable to the National Inventory and wetlands emissions using an ensemble ofWetCHARTS v1.0 scenarios in addition to other minor natural sources. We conduct a comparative analysis of the monthly natural emissions and yearly anthropogenic emissions optimized by surface and satellite data independently. Mean 2010-2015 posterior emissions using ECCC surface data are 6.0 +/- 0.4 Tg a(-1) for total anthropogenic and 11.6 +/- 1.2 Tg a(-1) for total natural emissions. These results agree with our posterior emissions of 6.5 +/- 0.7 Tg a(-1) for total anthropogenic and 11.7 +/- 1.2 Tg a(-1) for total natural emissions using GOSAT data. The seasonal pattern of posterior natural emissions using either dataset shows slower to start emissions in the spring and a less intense peak in the summer compared to the mean of WetCHARTS scenarios. We combine ECCC and GOSAT data to characterize limitations towards sectoral and provincial-level inversions. We estimate energy C agriculture emissions to be 5.1 +/- 1.0 Tg a(-1), which is 59% higher than the national inventory. We attribute 39% higher anthropogenic emissions to Western Canada than the prior. Natural emissions are lower across Canada. Inversion results are verified against independent aircraft data and surface data, which show better agreement with posterior emissions. This study shows a readjustment of the Canadian methane budget is necessary to better match atmospheric observations with lower natural emissions partially offset by higher anthropogenic emissions.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance to detect disease outbreaks using time between emergency department presentations
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Early warning of disease outbreaks is paramount for health jurisdictions. The objective of the present study was to develop syndromic surveillance monitoring plans from routinely collected ED data with application to detecting disease outbreaks. Methods The study involved secondary data analysis of ED presentations to major public hospitals in Queensland and South Australia spanning 2017-2020. Monitoring plans were developed for all major Queensland and South Australian public hospitals using an adaptation of Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages - a process control method used in detecting anomalies in industrial production processes. The methods rely on setting a threshold (control limit) relating to the time between an event of interest (e.g. flu outbreak) using ED presentations as a signal to monitor. An outbreak is flagged as this time gets significantly smaller, and each event offers a decision point on whether an outbreak has occurred. The models incorporate differing levels of temporal memory to cover outbreaks of different sizes. Results The novel approach to real-time outbreak detection indicates outbreaks for individual hospitals coinciding with the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Queensland and South Australia as well as the large 2017 and 2019 influenza seasons. Conclusion Outbreak detection models demonstrate the ability to quickly flag an outbreak based on clinician-assigned ED diagnoses. An implemented syndromic surveillance approach can pick up geographic outbreaks quickly so they can be contained. Such capability can help with surveillance related to the current COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemics.

TI  - Evaluating maize yield response to fertilizer and soil in Mexico using ground and satellite approaches
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop management recommendations that are tailored to local conditions offer promise for improved farmer livelihoods, input use efficiency, and crop output. An important step towards achieving localized recommendations is to establish repeatable, low-cost approaches to diagnosing nutrient constraints. Satellite remote sensing is particularly attractive in this context for its ability to monitor crop conditions and provide yield estimates at much lower expenses than extensive field measurements. Here we evaluate nutrient constraints for maize yields in central Mexico by utilizing an extensive field dataset on soil properties, fertilizer practices, and yields that were collected as part of the MasAgro program. We also compare insights from satellite-based yield estimates to those derived from crop-cut yields. Overall we find strong positive associations between maize yields and fertilizer inputs for N, P, and K in farms at lower elevations, characterized by larger, commercial farms. In higher elevations where farms are typically smaller and use less responsive varieties, we still find significant but slightly less positive associations with N and P. In both regions, we observe significant negative associations between yield and soil pH, consistent with an unmet need for micronutrient fertilizers in the region. Satellitebased yields were able to reproduce the positive associations and large yield response to fertilizer N and P, but were not sensitive enough to detect significant effects of secondary factors, namely fertilizer K and soil pH. We conclude by suggesting specific interventions that could be experimentally tested in the region.

TI  - 'The Franco Way': The American Right and the Spanish Civil War, 1936-9
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The following article is an intellectual and cultural history of the American supporters of Francisco Franco (hereafter referred to as American Francoites) and the Nationalist Movement during the Spanish Civil War. This article examines political pamphlets, magazines, radio broadcasts, journal articles, and books to reconstruct the American Francoite worldview. Like pro-Franco Catholics across the globe, American Francoites insisted the war was not between democracy and fascism but communism and Christianity; as Americans, they believed that supporting Franco was critical in fulfilling a patriotic and providential duty to protect Western Christendom from godless communism. Investigating the American Francoite worldview contributes to a recent body of scholarship detailing the rise of transnational anticommunism and nationalism as a constellation of culturally contingent reactions to the growth and spread of international communism. American Francoites emerged as one peculiar form of anticommunist American nationalism. In conclusion, this article argues that the political myths perpetuated by the pro-Franco argument - that the war was a battle between godless communism and Western Christendom - survived both the Spanish Civil War and Franco himself, merging easily into the 'new conservatism' of the postwar period and continuing to inform the beliefs and attitudes of the present right.

TI  - Viral infection among children under the age of 5 with diarrhea in Shenyang from 2018 to 2020: A hospital-based study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death among children, especially in the age under 5, but few studies are available on viral diarrhea in Shenyang. To understand the infection status and the relevant epidemiological characteristics of viral diarrhea and to fill gaps of the distribution of viruses across Shenyang in children under the age of 5 with diarrhea, from 2018 to 2020, stool specimens of children with diarrhea aged 0-59 months and surveillance data were collected in Sentinel Hospital of Shenyang. Specimens were then tested to determine the type of viruses, the seasonal and spatial patterns for major viruses were determined. Viruses were identified in 47.9% of the 897 samples from children with diarrhea. The main viruses of stool samples were rotavirus (16.9%, predominant type G9P[8]), calicivirus (14.7%), adenovirus (11.8%), and astrovirus (4.5%). Viral infections were mainly detected in the age of 0-12 months. In the area of Shenyang, Huanggu had the most cases (198, 22.1%), followed by Dadong (137, 15.3%) and Hunnan (135, 15.1%). The positive rate of viruses varied among patients of different ages, seasons, and regions. Public health entities and the government should develop corresponding measures for different age groups, seasons, and regions.

TI  - An integrated remote sensing, aeromagnetic and field study of the Ablah shear zone (Asir Terrane, Saudi Arabia): Structural styles and implications for the tectonic evolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An integration of merged remote-sensing data having different spatial/spectral resolutions with aeromagnetic data and detailed field investigation is used to identify the composite Neoproterozoic rock complexes and define the structural architecture of the Ablah Shear Zone (ASZ). The SPOT and Landsat-8 data are processed as color composite images allowed the separation of different lithologic units and associated structures. Aeromagnetic data were analyzed using the Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) and Reduced to the Pole (RTP) methods. The resulted anomalies show seven N-S opposite-dipping thrust faults that affect the shallow crustal rocks and coalesce together at about 1.5 to 2 km depth where the rock magnetic polarities inversed. This thin-skinned thrusting was initiated by a contractional tectonic regime in the E-W direction and superposed later by a transpresssion tectonic regime in the ENE-WSW direction. This study deals with the thin-skinned thrusting deformation in the ASZ that could be occurred during the deformation of the other shear zones that affect the internal part of the Asir tectonic terrane. Two controversial tectonic meanings describe the tectonic evolution of the ASZ, the first one is the thin-skinned thrusting tectonic that indicating shallow earth s crust deformation and the second one is the occurrence of some ophiolitic slices that indicating suturing tectonic deformation. The absent of the complete ophiolitic section encourages us regarding the ASZ as a structural shearing zone rather than a suture zone.

TI  - From Alex to Riefenstahl: Nazism, propaganda, and Stanley Kubrick's <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> (1971)
T2  - HISTORICAL JOURNAL OF FILM RADIO AND TELEVISION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article I will argue that graphic violence, though an essential component of A Clockwork Orange, is a side effect of the film's broader exploration of the subjectivity-sapping power of authoritarianism, and its cinematic correlative: propaganda. I will suggest that A Clockwork Orange may indeed be seen as a powerful reflection on the power of propaganda, through a strategy of mise en abyme of auctorial figures which forces the viewers to either submit to such figures, or to develop a critical resistance. In a first part, I draw on recent empirical studies based on archival material in order to delve into the history of Kubrick's fascination with authoritarianism - especially Nazism - so as to argue that one of the director's main source of interest in these regimes lied in their use of cinema to subjugate the masses. In the second part I draw on the narratological approach of Mario Falsetto, presenting the film as an interweaving of various auctorial figures struggling in order to gain directorial power and fascinate the viewers into submission, thus drawing attention for the need to establish a critical distance against all directorial figures, including the film's own "master of images". I will also draw on recent empirical approaches - most notably Filippo Ulivieri's - in order to suggest that Kubrick's own persona thus becomes part of such a reflection, as the director's construction of his own image as a tyrannical figure encourages a certain state of submissive spectatorship later questioned by the film's mise en abyme. Finally, I will discuss the film's reception and argue that the debates surrounding A Clockwork Orange suggest Kubrick's meta-filmic reflection on propaganda was misunderstood by a certain part of the public who, instead of developing a critical distance, either submitted to Alex's worldview unquestioningly - hence the issue of copycat crimes - or, on the contrary, fully rejected the film as a depraved object, two attitudes that are antithetic to the critical distancing the film hoped to create.

TI  - Optimizing a backscatter forward operator using Sentinel-1 data over irrigated land
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, the amount of water used for agricultural purposes is rising, and the quantification of irrigation is becoming a crucial topic. Because of the limited availability of in situ observations, an increasing number of studies is focusing on the synergistic use of models and satellite data to detect and quantify irrigation. The parameterization of irrigation in large-scale land surface models (LSMs) is improving, but it is still hampered by the lack of information about dynamic crop rotations, or the extent of irrigated areas, and the mostly unknown timing and amount of irrigation. On the other hand, remote sensing observations offer an opportunity to fill this gap as they are directly affected by, and hence potentially able to detect, irrigation. Therefore, combining LSMs and satellite information through data assimilation can offer the optimal way to quantify the water used for irrigation.This work represents the first and necessary step towards building a reliable LSM data assimilation system which, in future analysis, will investigate the potential of high-resolution radar backscatter observations from Sentinel-1 to improve irrigation quantification. Specifically, the aim of this study is to couple the Noah-MP LSM running within the NASA Land Information System (LIS), with a backscatter observation operator for simulating unbiased backscatter predictions over irrigated lands. In this context, we first tested how well modelled surface soil moisture (SSM) and vegetation estimates, with or without irrigation simulation, are able to capture the signal of aggregated 1 km Sentinel-1 backscatter observations over the Po Valley, an important agricultural area in northern Italy. Next, Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, together with simulated SSM and leaf area index (LAI), were used to optimize a Water Cloud Model (WCM), which will represent the observation operator in future data assimilation experiments. The WCM was calibrated with and without an irrigation scheme in Noah-MP and considering two different cost functions. Results demonstrate that using an irrigation scheme provides a better calibration of the WCM, even if the simulated irrigation estimates are inaccurate. The Bayesian optimization is shown to result in the best unbiased calibrated system, with minimal chances of having error cross-correlations between the model and observations. Our time series analysis further confirms that Sentinel-1 is able to track the impact of human activities on the water cycle, highlighting its potential to improve irrigation, soil moisture, and vegetation estimates via future data assimilation.

TI  - Impacts of sectoral, regional, species, and day-specific emissions on air pollution and public health in Washington, DC
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel source attribution approach that incorporates satellite data into GEOS-Chem adjoint simulations to characterize the species-specific, regional, and sectoral contributions of daily emissions for 3 air pollutants: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O-3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This approach is implemented for Washington, DC, first for 2011, to identify urban pollution sources, and again for 2016, to examine the pollution response to changes in anthropogenic emissions. In 2011, anthropogenic emissions contributed an estimated 263 (uncertainty: 130-444) PM2.5- and O-3-attributable premature deaths and 1,120 (391-1795) NO2 attributable new pediatric asthma cases in DC. PM2.5 exposure was responsible for 90% of these premature deaths. On-road vehicle emissions contributed 51% of NO2-attributable new asthma cases and 23% of pollution-attributable premature deaths, making it the largest contributing individual sector to DC's air pollution-related health burden. Regional emissions, originating from Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, were the most responsible for pollution-related health impacts in DC, contributing 57% of premature deaths impacts and 89% of asthma cases. Emissions from distant states contributed 34% more to PM2.5 exposure in the wintertime than in the summertime, occurring in parallel with strong wintertime westerlies and a reduced photochemical sink. Emission reductions between 2011 and 2016 resulted in health benefits of 76 (28-149) fewer pollution-attributable premature deaths and 227 (2-617) fewer NO2-attributable pediatric asthma cases. The largest sectors contributing to decreases in pollution-related premature deaths were energy generation units (26%) and on-road vehicles (20%). Decreases in NO2-attributable pediatric asthma cases were mostly due to emission reductions from on-road vehicles (63%). Emission reductions from energy generation units were found to impact PM2.5 more than O-3, while on-road vehicle emission reductions impacted O-3 proportionally more than PM2.5. This novel method is capable of capturing the sources of urban pollution at fine spatial and temporal scales and is applicable to many urban environments, globally.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To gain quantifiable and explainable changes in LULC about Hakaluki Haor in Bangladesh, this study employed Landsat satellite data to interpret LULC from 2000 to 2019. Four change detection analyses (2000-2005, 2005-2010, 2010-2015, and 2015-2019) were done to detect the shifting process of different LULC classes. There was significant rapid growth in human settlement (91.61 km(2)) between 2000 and 2019, while the same period witnessed a reduction in water bodies (-28.69 km(2)), dense vegetation (-47.01 km(2)), cropland (-12.96 km(2)) and bare land (-2.95 km(2)). Furthermore, interviews with local communities were conducted to identify the contributing factors for the changes. The major factors responsible for the changes of LULC were population pressure (29.41%), climatic variation (20.91%), anthropogenic factors (16.34%), sedimentation (14.38%), lack of awareness of policies (11.76%) and inappropriate development interventions (7.19%). The findings and given recommendations will help policymakers to establish the appropriate land use plans for Hakaluki Haor region.

TI  - Bones, carnivores, and grassland fires. Actualistic taphonomy of faunal assemblages from two caves in Central Argentina and its implication for the fossil record
T2  - HISTORICAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to identify the potential accumulator of two modern non-digested bone assemblages recovered from El Laurel (EL) and El Pulgar (EP) caves, both located in Characato (Cordoba province, Central Argentina), as well as to evaluate the role of recent wildfires in its formation. For this purpose, we combined a detailed taphonomic analysis of bones and remote sensing data analysis in GIS. Our results and its comparison with other actualistic studies from different latitudes show that the assemblages are likely to be averaged accumulations produced and modified by different small carnivores (foxes and felids) that inhabit the area, including Lycalopex culpaeus smithersi, Leopardus geoffroyi and/or Lycalopex gymnocercus. On the other hand, remote sensing analyses showed that fires differentially affected the caves - EL was the most affected-, especially due to variations in their surrounding environments and fuel availability. This difference in fire severity between both caves is reflected in the frequency of burnt specimens and the extension of burning in the bone surface of their assemblages.

TI  - The Little Auk <i>Alle alle</i>: an ecological indicator of a changing Arctic and a model organism
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The Little Auk Alle alle is a small planktivorous auk breeding colonially in the High Arctic. Owing to its large population size and bi-environmental lifestyle, resulting in the large-scale transport of matter from sea to land, the Little Auk is one of the most important components of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the Arctic. As a result of globalization, which facilitates access to remote areas of the Earth, a growing number of studies is being dedicated to this endemic Arctic seabird. Research has focussed primarily on the importance of the Little Auk as an ecological indicator reacting to the climatic and oceanological changes that are particularly evident in the Arctic as a result of Arctic amplification (warming is more rapid in the Arctic than in any other region on Earth). Importantly, the species is also used as a model to investigate matter and energy flow through the ecosystem, mate choice, parental care and biological rhythms. Here, we review the natural history of the Little Auk, highlighting studies with the potential to provide answers to universal questions regarding the response of seabirds to climate variability and avian reproductive behaviour, e.g. threshold of foraging flexibility in response to environmental variability, carry-over effects between the breeding and non-breeding periods, the reasons for the transition from bi- to uni-parental care, parental coordination mechanisms.

TI  - Using topographic attributes to predict the density of vegetation layers in a wet eucalypt forest
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the structure of forest vegetation with field surveys or high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data is costly. We tested whether landscape topography and underlying geology could predict the vegetation density of a 19 km(2) area of wet eucalypt forest at the Warra Long-Term Ecological Research Supersite, Tasmania, Australia. Using spatial layers for 12 topographic attributes derived from digital terrain models (DTMs) and a geology layer, we predicted the vegetation density of three strata with a high degree of accuracy (validation root mean square error ranged from 9.0% to 13.7%). The DTMs with 30 m resolution provided greater predictive accuracy than DTMs with higher resolution. The importance of different variables depended on spatial resolution and strata. Among the predictor variables, geology generally had the highest predictive importance, followed by solar radiation. Topographic Position Index, aspect, and System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) Wetness Index had moderate importance. This study demonstrates that geological and topographic attributes can provide useful predictions for the density of vegetation layers in a tall wet sclerophyll primary forest. Given the good performance of the model based on 30 m DTM resolution, the predictive power of the models could be tested on a larger geographical area using lower-density LiDAR point clouds combined with medium-resolution satellite data.

TI  - Site Characteristics Mediate the Relationship Between Forest Productivity and Satellite Measured Solar Induced Fluorescence
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) can provide key information about the state of photosynthesis and offers the prospect of defining remote sensing-based estimation of Gross Primary Production (GPP). There is strong theoretical support for the link between SIF and GPP and this relationship has been empirically demonstrated using ground-based, airborne, and satellite-based SIF observations, as well as modeling. However, most evaluations have been based on monthly and annual scales, yet the GPP:SIF relations can be strongly influenced by both vegetation structure and physiology. At the monthly timescales, the structural response often dominates but short-term physiological variations can strongly impact the GPP:SIF relations. Here, we test how well SIF can predict the inter-daily variation of GPP during the growing season and under stress conditions, while taking into account the local effect of sites and abiotic conditions. We compare the accuracy of GPP predictions from SIF at different timescales (half-hourly, daily, and weekly), while evaluating effect of adding environmental variables to the relationship. We utilize observations for years 2018-2019 at 31 mid-latitudes, forested, eddy covariance (EC) flux sites in North America and Europe and use TROPOMI satellite data for SIF. Our results show that SIF is a good predictor of GPP, when accounting for inter-site variation, probably due to differences in canopy structure. Seasonally averaged leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and canopy conductance provide a predictor to the site-level effect. We show that fPAR is the main factor driving errors in the linear model at high temporal resolution. Adding water stress indicators, namely canopy conductance, to a multi-linear SIF-based GPP model provides the best improvement in the model precision at the three considered timescales, showing the importance of accounting for water stress in GPP predictions, independent of the SIF signal. SIF is a promising predictor for GPP among other remote sensing variables, but more focus should be placed on including canopy structure, and water stress effects in the relationship, especially when considering intra-seasonal, and inter- and intra-daily resolutions.

TI  - Ovarian tissue cryopreservation in a patient with breast cancer during pregnancy: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF OVARIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fertility preservation using ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) in patients with certain diseases, especially those needing chemo- or radiotherapy, is becoming routine in various Western countries. Our hospital is the first and until now the only centre in China to use this method. The question of whether treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy (PrBC) should be similar to non-pregnant young patients with breast cancer is controversial. To our knowledge, this is the first report worldwide to use OTC as fertility preservation for PrBC. Case presentation During the 29th week of pregnancy, a 24-year-old woman underwent needle aspiration cytology of a left breast tumour. Ultrasound and cytology revealed BI-RADS 4a grade. Oncologists recommended termination of the pregnancy. Caesarean section was performed at week 32, and ovarian tissue samples were collected for OTC to preserve fertility and ovarian endocrine function. Twenty-three ovarian cortex slices were cryopreserved. It is estimated that 13,000 follicles were cryopreserved. Breast nodules and sentinel lymph node biopsy suggested invasive micropapillary carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was started within 1 week after diagnosis. After six courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy and goserelin acetate, left mastectomy and left axillary lymph node dissection were performed. In total, 23 doses of radiotherapy, eight trastuzumab targeted therapy treatments, and 17 pertuzumab + trastuzumab double targeted therapy treatments were performed after breast cancer surgery. Until now, more than 2 years after delivery, the ovarian function still is good, and no signs of a negative impact of OTC have been observed. Goserelin acetate injections, administered every 28 days, are planned to last for the next 5 years. In addition, endocrine therapy with anastrozole was started after breast cancer surgery and also is scheduled for 5 years. Conclusion OTC for fertility preservation in patients with PrBC does not delay breast surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, which is essential for effective treatment of breast cancer. We assess this method as a promising fertility preservation method which was used here for the first time worldwide in a patient who developed breast cancer during pregnancy.

TI  - Estimation of actual evapotranspiration using TDTM model and MODIS derived variables
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to contribute to improve ETa estimation in semiarid environments by proposing two variations to the TDMT model. These variations are based on the use of MODIS products from TERRA or AQUA satellites and on the use of NDVI instead of EVI, to estimate the fraction of vegetation cover. The proposed changes were validated with the original methodology for the 2012-2014 period with data obtained from two flux towers (ES-LJu and ES-Amo). The best results were obtained when using the alternative methodology (RMSE of 0.64-0.67 mm in ES-Lju and of 0.97-1.02 mm in ES-Amo). Additionally, a correction of the temporal systematic errors of the model based on RandomForest is proposed. With this correction, RMSE of 0.31-0.35 mm in ES-Lju and 0.30-0.34 mm in ES-Amo were obtained. The spatial distribution obtained with this corrected model is the most consistent with the characteristics of the study area.

TI  - Semi-field evaluation of novel chemical lures for <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, and <i>Anopheles minimus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in Thailand
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Entomological surveillance is an important means of assessing the efficacy of insect vector management programs and estimating disease transmission thresholds. Among baited traps, Biogents' BG-Sentinel (BGS) trap baited with BG-Lure is considered to have the most similar outcome to, and be a possible replacement for, human-landing catches for the epidemiologically relevant monitoring of adult Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. In contrast to the BGS trap, the Black Hole ultraviolet (UV) light trap, which is widely used to catch nocturnal flying insects, is not baited with synthetic human odor-mimicking lures.Methods: We evaluated the 12-lactic acid-based Kasetsart University (KU)-lures nos. 1-6 as novel candidate chemical lures for the diurnal species Ae. aegypti and the nocturnal species Cx. quinquefasciatus using two commercial traps (the BGS trap and the Black Hole UV light trap) in a semi-field screen (SFS) house. Firstly, we optimized the dose of each KU-lure in an SFS house (140 m(3)). Secondly, six different candidate KU-lures were screened by comparing their percent attraction using a single discriminating dose (0.5 g). Finally, we evaluated the synergism of the KU-lures selected in this way with commercially available traps.Results: BGS traps baited with KU-lure no. 1 exhibited the greatest percent attraction for Ae. aegypti (29.5% +/- 14.3%), whereas those baited with KU-lure no. 6 most strongly attracted Cx. quinquefasciatus (33.3% +/- 10.7%). Interestingly, BGS traps treated with 10 g BG-Lure did not significantly attract more Ae. aegypti or Cx. quinquefasciatus than the untreated BGS traps. CO2 at a flow rate of 250 ml/min most strongly attracted both Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus (42.2% +/- 14.2% and 75.1% +/- 16.9%, respectively). BGS and Black Hole UV light traps with KU-lure no. 6 exhibited a stronger attraction for Cx. quinquefasciatus than untreated traps, and the percent attraction did not differ between the treated traps.Conclusions: Synergistic effects of KU-lures nos. 1 and 6 with the mosquito traps were demonstrated for both the diurnal and nocturnal species in the SFS house assays. However, further studies are urgently needed for the development of species-specific lures to increase trap efficacy in the field for local vector mosquitoes in Thailand.

TI  - Variability of the snowline altitude in the eastern Tibetan Plateau from 1995 to 2016 using Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The glacier snowline can be used as an indicator of a glacier's equilibrium line, which is a pivotal parameter for studying the effect of climate change on glaciers. However, the relationship between snowline altitudes (SLAs) and climatic regime, as well as the comparison between different glacier types, has received less attention. Using Google Earth Engine, we first developed an automated algorithm that employs the Otsu thresholding method to distinguish snow-covered areas from clean ice on a near-infrared band of Landsat imagery available from 1995 to 2016 and further to delineate glacier SLAs in the three regions of the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). The three study regions, Sepu Kangri (maritime), Bu'Gyai Kangri (continental), and western Qiajajima (continental), in the eastern TP have different climate regimes and are on a latitudinal transect from south to north. We then investigated the impacts of climatic factors on the SLA and its variability over the period studied. The results over the eastern TP indicate that (1) the SLA increased by 94, 55, and 49 m from south to north during the 22-year period, with the SLA variations of maritime glaciers being the most pronounced; (2) the southern maritime glaciers were mainly affected by precipitation, whereas the northern continental glaciers were influenced by temperature. Owing to the difference in primary climatic factors affecting snowlines, continental glaciers were found to have higher SLAs on the south slope, whereas maritime glaciers had higher SLAs on the north slope.

TI  - Developing Global Citizens through International Studies: Enhancing Student Voices and Active Learning in Short-Term Study Abroad Courses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Educating global citizens has become part of higher education in international studies. Scholars argue that education includes having a global worldview that critically evaluates complex challenges in an ever-changing environment. Most agree that something more than classroom lecture is required to transform students' perspectives, but debates exist about exactly what "more" means. Short-term study abroad courses have evolved as one way to offer a global experience to students, especially those who must balance work, school, and family life while also facing the economic restraints of higher education. These programs, however, have been criticized as providing little more than a voyeuristic view into the lives of others with no real experience with cultures, development of global citizenship, or true engagement with global issues. This study assesses the impact of a short-term study abroad program on students' perceptions of their role as global citizens and identifies pedagogical tools that increase the likelihood that students will embrace global citizenship as a transformative learning experience. Using reflection papers and photo elicitation, this article shows that immersive short-term study abroad experiences that include extensive community engagement have the potential to change students' perception of the world and the way they see their role in it.

TI  - Observations from C-Band SAR Fully Polarimetric Parameters of Mobile Sea Ice Based on Radar Scattering Mechanisms to Support Operational Sea Ice Monitoring
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fully polarimetric (FP) SAR systems offer parameters that describe and quantify the scattering mechanisms from the surface cover. These are usually derived from decomposition of matrices derived from the original scattering matrix from observations at each pixel. Power from scattering mechanisms have potential for retrieval of sea ice information, which cannot be derived using traditional backscatter (magnitude or phase) measured by single- or dual-polarization SAR systems. This study investigates the potential of selected FP parameters that represent the power of three scattering mechanisms, in addition to the total power, in identifying ice types and surface features for operational use. Parameters were obtained from a set of 62 RADARSAT-2 Quad-pol data over Resolute Passage, central Arctic, during the period September-December 2017. A scattering-based color-composite scheme was developed. Analysis of the examined color images was supported by information from regional ice charts and SAR image interpretations from the Canadian Ice Service. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed color-composite tool. Open water, new ice, multi-year ice and a few surface features including rafted, ridged and smooth/rough surfaces can be identified better in the color images. Physical interpretation of the relative power from the given scattering mechanisms is explained for the relevant ice types and surfaces.

TI  - Monitoring the particulate phosphorus concentration of inland waters on the Yangtze Plain and understanding its relationship with driving factors based on OLCI data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of particulate phosphorus concentration (C-pp) and understanding its regulating factors is essential to improve our understanding of its impact on inland water eutrophication. However, few studies have assessed this in eutrophic inland lakes, owing to a lack of suitable bio-optical algorithms allowing the use of remote sensing data. Herein, a novel semi-analytical algorithm of C(pp )was developed to estimate C(pp )in lakes on the Yangtze Plain, China. The independent validations of the proposed algorithm showed a satisfying performance with the mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error less than 27% and 27 mu g/L, respectively. The Ocean and Land Color Instrument observations revealed a remarkable spatiotemporal heterogeneity of C(pp )in 23 lakes on the Yangtze Plain from 2016 to 2020, with the lowest value in December (62.91 +/- 34.59 mu g/L) and the highest C(pp )in August (114.9 +/- 51.69 mu g/L). Among the 23 examined lakes, the highest mean C(pp )was found in Lake Poyang (124.58 +/- 44.71 mu g/L), while the lowest value was found in lake Qiandao (33.51 +/- 4.71 mu g/L). Additionally, 13 lakes demonstrated significant decreasing or increasing trends (P < 0.05) of annual mean C(pp )during the observation period. The driving factor analysis revealed that four natural factors (wind speed, air temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration) and two anthropogenic factors (the normalized difference vegetation index and nighttime light) combined explained more than 91% of the variation in C-pp, while the impacts of these factors on C-pp  showed consid-erable differences among lakes. This study offered a novel and scalable algorithm for the study of the spatiotemporal variation of C(pp )in inland waters and provided new insights into the regulating factors in water cutrophication.

TI  - An improved genetic algorithm for the integrated satellite imaging and data transmission scheduling problem
T2  - COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of Integrated Satellite Imaging and Data Transmission Scheduling Problem (ISIDTSP) has assumed increasing importance due to the growing number of satellites observing large quantities of targets and seeking to transmit their images to the ground stations. This paper formulates the ISIDTSP as a mixed integer programming model and develops an improved genetic algorithm. With regard to the individual representation, a novel idea of encoding and decoding is adopted to match the specific request with the corresponding satellite-ground resources, and a conception of conflicting request set is proposed to limit the chromosome length, thereby reducing the algorithmic time complexity. For the trade-off between diversity and convergence, several effective operators are introduced, including the population initialization based on the way of uniform design, the multi-point greedy mutation and the adaptive selection. Evaluations with two test cases demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and show its ability to obtain high-quality solutions within an acceptable time period for the large scale optimization instances.

TI  - Rational design and construction of multi-copy biomanufacturing islands in mammalian cells
T2  - NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cell line development is a critical step in the establishment of a biopharmaceutical manufacturing process. Current protocols rely on random transgene integration and amplification. Due to considerable variability in transgene integration profiles, this workflow results in laborious screening campaigns before stable producers can be identified. Alternative approaches for transgene dosage increase and integration are therefore highly desirable. In this study, we present a novel strategy for the rapid design, construction, and genomic integration of engineered multiple-copy gene constructs consisting of up to 10 gene expression cassettes. Key to this strategy is the diversification, at the sequence level, of the individual gene cassettes without altering their protein products. We show a computational workflow for coding and regulatory sequence diversification and optimization followed by experimental assembly of up to nine gene copies and a sentinel reporter on a contiguous scaffold. Transient transfections in CHO cells indicates that protein expression increases with the gene copy number on the scaffold. Further, we stably integrate these cassettes into a pre-validated genomic locus. Altogether, our findings point to the feasibility of engineering a fully mapped multi-copy recombinant protein 'production island' in a mammalian cell line with greatly reduced screening effort, improved stability, and predictable product titers.

TI  - Regional Crop Characterization Using Multi-Temporal Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Earth Observations Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop biophysical parameters, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass, are essential for estimating crop productivity, yield modeling, and agronomic management. This study used several features extracted from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and spectral vegetation indices extracted from Sentinel-2 optical data to estimate crop LAI and wet and dry biomass. Various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were trained and assessed for three major crops (wheat, soybeans and canola). ANN provided the best accuracy for all wheat parameters and soybean LAI and canola wet biomass and LAI. RFR led to higher accuracy for soybean dry and wet biomass. However, SVR could accurately estimate only canola dry biomass. All data were then pooled to investigate if a single algorithm could estimate biophysical parameters for all crops. The RFR model accurately estimated wet and dry biomass and LAI across all crop types in this scenario. This generic model is fast and accurate and can be easily applied for crop mapping and monitoring over large geographies using cloud computing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine.

TI  - Is Axillary Assessment of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast Necessary in All Cases?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staging of the axilla in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a point of controversy. We aimed to assess whether there is a group of patients in whom axillary assessment can be avoided and whether the likelihood of underdiagnosis of infiltrating carcinoma is sufficient to justify this evaluation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study of patients who were operated on between 2008 and 2018 in three Spanish hospitals, with a diagnosis by radiological or excisional biopsy of DCIS and clinically and radiologically negative axilla.RESULTS: A total of 530 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS were studied. An axillary assessment was performed in 77% of the patients. In 397 patients, selective sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Axillary involvement was found in 7.2% of all patients, which dropped to 2.15% if we only included DCIS diagnosed after a definitive anatomical pathology analysis. Underdiagnosis was correlated with the type of biopsy performed: the risk was 1.34 times as high if the biopsy was performed with a core needle. The risk of lymph node metastasis was higher when there was lymphovascular invasion and when mastectomy was performed.CONCLUSIONS: We propose an axilla management algorithm in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS. The patients who would benefit from sentinel lymph node biopsy would be those who are not candidates for breast-conserving surgery, those with a BIRADS 5 lesion biopsied by core-needle biopsy, and those whose definitive diagnosis is lymphovascular invasion.

TI  - ML-TOMCAT: machine-learning-based satellite-corrected global stratospheric ozone profile data set from a chemical transport model
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - High-quality stratospheric ozone profile data sets are a key requirement for accurate quantification and attribution of long-term ozone changes. Satellite instruments provide stratospheric ozone profile measurements over typical mission durations of 5-15 years. Various methodologies have then been applied to merge and homogenise the different satellite data in order to create long-term observation-based ozone profile data sets with minimal data gaps. However, individual satellite instruments use different measurement methods, sampling patterns and retrieval algorithms which complicate the merging of these different data sets. In contrast, atmospheric chemical models can produce chemically consistent long-term ozone simulations based on specified changes in external forcings, but they are subject to the deficiencies associated with incomplete understanding of complex atmospheric processes and uncertain photochemical parameters.Here, we use chemically self-consistent output from the TOMCAT 3-D chemical transport model (CTM) and a random-forest (RF) ensemble learning method to create a merged 42-year (1979-2020) stratospheric ozone profile data set (ML-TOMCAT V1.0). The underlying CTM simulation was forced by meteorological reanalyses, specified trends in long-lived source gases, solar flux and aerosol variations. The RF is trained using the Stratospheric Water and OzOne Satellite Homogenized (SWOOSH) data set over the time periods of the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) from the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) (1991-1998) and Aura (2005-2016) missions. We find that ML-TOMCAT shows excellent agreement with available independent satellite-based data sets which use pressure as a vertical coordinate (e.g. GOZCARDS, SWOOSH for non-MLS periods) but weaker agreement with the data sets which are altitude-based (e.g. SAGE-CCI-OMPS, SCIAMACHY-OMPS). We find that at almost all stratospheric levels ML-TOMCAT ozone concentrations are well within uncertainties of the observational data sets. The ML-TOMCAT (V1.0) data set is ideally suited for the evaluation of chemical model ozone profiles from the tropopause to 0.1 hPa and is freely available via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5651194 (Dhomse et al., 2021).

TI  - Cultural Management of Terror and Worry During the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Religiosity and a Dream of Human Solidarity Help the Polish People Cope
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which involves the threat of contracting a potentially fatal disease, can be understood as a source of terror. According to terror management theory, people shield themselves from terror by adopting culturally specific worldviews and protecting self-esteem. The study investigates the protective role of worldviews that are culturally specific to Poles: religiosity and social solidarity. The hypothesis was that Poles who tend to worry, entertain these worldviews and are more likely to maintain high self-esteem and concentrate on the current moment (carpe diem), which theoretically allows them to reduce future-related anxiety. Path analysis confirmed that self-esteem, the centrality of religiosity, and expectation of solidarity due to the COVID-19 pandemic mediate the relationship between the worry trait and carpe diem.

TI  - Thermokarst Landscape Development Detected by Multiple-Geospatial Data in Churapcha, Eastern Siberia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst is a typical process that indicates widespread permafrost degradation in yedoma landscapes. The Lena-Aldan interfluvial area in Central Yakutia in eastern Siberia is now facing extensive landscape changes with surface subsidence due to thermokarst development during the past few decades. To clarify the spatial extent and rate of subsidence, multiple spatial datasets, including GIS and remote sensing observations, were used to analyze the Churapcha rural locality, which has a typical yedoma landscape in Central Yakutia. Land cover classification maps for 1945 and 2009 provide basic information on anthropogenic disturbance to the natural landscape of boreal forest and dry grassland. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data revealed activated surface subsidence of 2 cm/yr in the disturbed area, comprising mainly abandoned agricultural fields. Remote sensing with an unmanned aerial system also provided high-resolution information on polygonal relief formed by thermokarst development at a disused airfield where InSAR analysis exhibited extensive subsidence. It is worth noting that some historically deforested areas have likely recovered to the original landscape without further thermokarst development. Spatial information on historical land-use change is helpful because most areas with thermokarst development correspond to locations where land was used by humans in the past. Going forward, the integrated analysis of geospatial information will be essential for assessing permafrost degradation.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of open-data sources in cloud computing was explored in rainfall-run-off modelling through the Soil Conservation Services curve number (SCS CN) model. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) has a petabytes catalogue of global remote sensing and GIS datasets, numerous functions and algorithms to manipulate and visualize datasets rapidly. In this study, an algorithm has been developed to prepare dynamic CN maps in GEE using OpenLandMap Soil Texture and MODIS land use/land cover (LULC) data through ternary function and climate hazards group infrared precipitation rainfall collection for input rainfall and creation of antecedent moisture condition. The capabilities of the developed algorithm were demonstrated for Shipra, Kuttiyadi and Bah river catchments in India. However, it can be used with different satellite data for estimating the run-off and impact of LULC change on run-off for any part of the world and any desired period. The developed algorithm not only utilizes GEF and the public archive database for estimating the run-off at basin/subbasin scales for the planning of water resources, but also provides a quick evaluation of the impact of LULC change on run-off over time.

TI  - The epidemic volatility index, a novel early warning tool for identifying new waves in an epidemic
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early warning tools are crucial for the timely application of intervention strategies and the mitigation of the adverse health, social and economic effects associated with outbreaks of epidemic potential such as COVID-19. This paper introduces, the Epidemic Volatility Index (EVI), a new, conceptually simple, early warning tool for oncoming epidemic waves. EVI is based on the volatility of newly reported cases per unit of time, ideally per day, and issues an early warning when the volatility change rate exceeds a threshold. Data on the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are used to demonstrate the use of EVI. Results from the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and New York State are presented here, based on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, from January 22, 2020, until April 13, 2021. Live daily updated predictions for all world countries and each of the United States of America are publicly available online. For Italy, the overall sensitivity for EVI was 0.82 (95% Confidence Intervals: 0.75; 0.89) and the specificity was 0.91 (0.88; 0.94). For New York, the corresponding values were 0.55 (0.47; 0.64) and 0.88 (0.84; 0.91). Consecutive issuance of early warnings is a strong indicator of main epidemic waves in any country or state. EVI's application to data from the current COVID-19 pandemic revealed a consistent and stable performance in terms of detecting new waves. The application of EVI to other epidemics and syndromic surveillance tasks in combination with existing early warning systems will enhance our ability to act swiftly and thereby enhance containment of outbreaks.

TI  - Sustainable intelligence and cultural worldview as triggers to preserve heritage tourism resources
T2  - TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This empirical study examines residents' decision-making process in preserving Jeju Batdam as a World Agricultural Heritage Site. Accordingly, it extends the model of goal-directed behavior (MGB) by including cultural worldview and sustainable intelligence as triggers of desire and behavioral intentions of residents to preserve the agricultural heritage tourism resources. This study collected 368 valid responses from residents using quota sampling method. Results revealed that the cultural worldview and sustainable intelligence play a significant role in influencing residents' behaviors toward the preservation of an agricultural heritage tourism resource (Batdam). Results also showed that attitude, positive and negative anticipated emotions, and perceived behavioral control increase desire, which stimulates residents' behavioral intention to preserve the heritage. Desire mediates the effects of attitude, perceived behavioral control, and positive and negative anticipated emotions on the residents' intention to preserve the heritage. Findings contribute to deepening the knowledge of sustainable agricultural heritage management by better understanding of residents' decision-making process in preserving heritage resources. The outcomes of this study also provide policy implications with sustainable development and management policies of agricultural heritage sites.

TI  - Glyoxal tropospheric column retrievals from TROPOMI - multi-satellite intercomparison and ground-based validation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first global glyoxal (CHOCHO) tropospheric column product derived from the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. Atmospheric glyoxal results from the oxidation of other non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and from direct emissions caused by combustion processes. Therefore, this product is a useful indicator of VOC emissions. It is generated with an improved version of the BIRA-IASB scientific retrieval algorithm relying on the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) approach. Among the algorithmic updates, the DOAS fit now includes corrections to mitigate the impact of spectral misfits caused by scene brightness inhomogeneity and strong NO2 absorption. The product comes along with a full error characterization, which allows for providing random and systematic error estimates for every observation. Systematic errors are typically in the range of 1 x 10(14)-3 x 10(14) molec.cm(-2) (similar to 30 %-70 % in emission regimes) and originate mostly from a priori data uncertainties and spectral interferences with other absorbing species. The latter may be at the origin, at least partly, of an enhanced glyoxal signal over equatorial oceans, and further investigation is needed to mitigate them. Random errors are large (> 6 x 10(14) molec. cm(-2)) but can be reduced by averaging observations in space and/or time. Benefiting from a high signal-to-noise ratio and a large number of small-size observations, TROPOMI provides glyoxal tropospheric column fields with an unprecedented level of detail.Using the same retrieval algorithmic baseline, glyoxal column data sets are also generated from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on Aura and from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) on board Metop-A and Metop-B. Those four data sets are intercompared over large-scale regions worldwide and show a high level of consistency. The satellite glyoxal columns are also compared to glyoxal columns retrieved from ground-based Multi-AXis DOAS (MAX-DOAS) instruments at nine stations in Asia and Europe. In general, the satellite and MAX-DOAS instruments provide consistent glyoxal columns both in terms of absolute values and variability. Correlation coefficients between TROPOMI and MAX-DOAS glyoxal columns range between 0.61 and 0.87. The correlation is only poorer at one mid-latitude station, where satellite data appear to be biased low during wintertime. The mean absolute glyoxal columns from satellite and MAX-DOAS generally agree well for low/moderate columns with differences of less than 1 x 10(14) molec.cm(-2). A larger bias is identified at two sites where the MAX-DOAS columns are very large. Despite this systematic bias, the consistency of the satellite and MAX-DOAS glyoxal seasonal variability is high.

TI  - Estimation of Surface and Near-Surface Air Temperatures in Arid Northwest China Using Landsat Satellite Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air (Ta) and land surface (Ts) temperatures are essential parameters for research in the fields of agriculture, hydrology, and ecological changes, which require accurate datasets with different temporal and spatial resolutions. However, the sparse spatial distribution of meteorological stations in Northwest China may not effectively provide high-precision Ta data. And it is not clear whether it is necessary to improve the accuracy of Ts which has the most influence on Ta. In response to this situation, the main objective of this study is to estimate Ta for Northwest China using multiple linear regression models (MLR) and random forest (RF) algorithms, based on Landsat 8 images and auxiliary data collected from 2014 to 2019. Ts, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), surface albedo, elevation, wind speed, and Julian day were variables to be selected, then used to estimate the daily average Ta after analysis and adjustment. Also, the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) method for calculating Ts would be corrected by NDVI (RTE-NDVI). The results show that: 1) The accuracy of the surface temperature (Ts) was improved by using RTE-NDVI; 2) Both MLR and RF models are suitable for estimating Ta in areas with few meteorological stations; 3) Analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of errors, it is found that the MLR model performs well in spring and summer, and is lower in autumn, and the accuracy is higher in plain areas away from mountains than in mountainous areas and nearby areas. This study shows that through appropriate selection and combination of variables, the accuracy of estimating the pixel-scale Ta from satellite remote sensing data can be improved in the area that has less meteorological data.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the first systematic comparison of MAIAC Collection 6 MCD19A1 daily surface reflectance (SR) product with standard MODIS SR (MOD/MYD09). The study was limited to four tiles located in mid-Atlantic United States (H11V05), Canada (H12V03), central Amazon (H11V09), and North-Eastern China (H27V05) and used over 5000 MODIS granules in 2018. Overall, there is a remarkable agreement between the best quality pixels of the two products, in particular in the Red and NIR bands. Over selected tiles, the evaluation found that MAIAC provides from 4 to 25% more high-quality retrievals than MOD09 annually, with the largest difference in tropical regions, confirming results of the previous studies. The comparison of spectral characteristics showed a systematic MAIAC-MOD09 difference increasing from NIR to Blue, typical of biases of a Lambertian assumption in MOD09 algorithm. Over the North-Eastern China, MCD19A1 SR is found more stable at wide range of aerosol optical depth (AOD) variations, whereas MOD09 SR shows a consistent positive bias increasing with AOD and at shorter wavelengths. The observed SR differences can be attributed to differences in cloud detection, aerosol retrieval and in atmospheric correction which is performed using an accurate BRDF-coupled radiative transfer model in MAIAC and a Lambertian surface model in MOD09. While this study is not representative of the global performance because of its limited geographical coverage, it should help the land community to better understand the differences between the two products.

TI  - How weather events modify aerosol particle size distributions in the Amazon boundary layer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the effect of weather events on the aerosol particle size distribution (PSD) at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO). This research combines in situ measurements of PSD and remote sensing data of lightning density, brightness temperature, cloud top height, cloud liquid water, and rain rate and vertical velocity. Measurements were obtained by scanning mobility particle sizers (SMPSs), the new generation of GOES satellites (GOES-16), the SIPAM S-band radar and the LAP 3000 radar wind profiler recently installed at the ATTO-Campina site. The combined data allow exploring changes in PSD due to different meteorological processes. The average diurnal cycle shows a higher abundance of ultrafine particles (N-UFP) in the early morning, which is coupled with relatively lower concentrations in Aitken (N-AIT) and accumulation (N-ACC) mode particles. From the early morning to the middle of the afternoon, an inverse behavior is observed, where N-UFP decreases and N-AIT and N-ACC increase, reflecting a typical particle growth process. Composite figures show an increase of N-UFP before, during and after lightning was detected by the satellite above ATTO. These findings strongly indicate a close relationship between vertical transport and deep convective clouds. Lightning density is connected to a large increase in N-UFP, beginning approximately 100 min before the maximum lightning density and reaching peak values around 200 min later. In addition, the removal of N-ACC by convective transport was found. Both the increase in N-UFP and the decrease in N-ACC appear in parallel with the increasing intensity of lightning activity. The N-UFP increases exponentially with the thunderstorm intensity. In contrast, N-AIT and N-ACC show a different behavior, decreasing from approximately 100 min before the maximum lightning activity and reaching a minimum at the time of maximum lightning activity. The effect of cloud top height, cloud liquid water and rain rate shows the same behavior, but with different patterns between seasons. The convective processes do not occur continually but are probably modulated by gravity waves in the range of 1 to 5 h, creating a complex mechanism of interaction with a succession of updrafts and downdrafts, clouds, and clear-sky situations.The radar wind profiler measured the vertical distribution of the vertical velocity. These profiles show that downdrafts are mainly located below 10 km, while aircraft observations during the ACRIDICON-CHUVA campaign had shown maximum concentrations of ultrafine particles mainly above 10 km. Our study opens new scientific questions to be evaluated in order to understand the intricate physical and chemical mechanisms involved in the production of new particles in Amazonia.

TI  - EPOCH: enhanced procedure for operational change detection using historical invariant features and PCA guided multivariate statistical technique
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we have presented a methodology developed for automatic historical change detection using multi-decadal time-lapse remote sensing images, which we call as EPOCH. The unpaired bi-temporal images are spatially aligned using Mode Improved Scale Invariant Feature Transform (M-SIFT) to achieve sub-pixel co-registration accuracy. The surface changes are detected using Guided Image Filter Enhanced Multivariate Alteration Detection (GIF-MAD). The guidance image is extracted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and an operational processing framework is devised to generate change detection map. EPOCH is evaluated with Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) images and Landsat multi-temporal images that observe Earth for more than three decades. The procedure is generalized to detect changes using different satellite images over one of our neighboring planet Mars. EPOCH is compared with state-of-the-art techniques, and found to have closest consensus with ground truth data. The proposed approach achieved an overall accuracy of 90.9% with kappa value of 0.81.

TI  - Right-Wing Psychedelia: Case Studies in Cultural Plasticity and Political Pluripotency
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent media advocacy for the nascent psychedelic medicine industry has emphasized the potential for psychedelics to improve society, pointing to research studies that have linked psychedelics to increased environmental concern and liberal politics. However, research supporting the hypothesis that psychedelics induce a shift in political beliefs must address the many historical and contemporary cases of psychedelic users who remained authoritarian in their views after taking psychedelics or became radicalized after extensive experience with them. We propose that the common anecdotal accounts of psychedelics precipitating radical shifts in political or religious beliefs result from the contextual factors of set and setting, and have no particular directional basis on the axes of conservatism-liberalism or authoritarianism-egalitarianism. Instead, we argue that any experience which challenges a person's fundamental worldview-including a psychedelic experience-can precipitate shifts in any direction of political belief. We suggest that the historical record supports the concept of psychedelics as "politically pluripotent," non-specific amplifiers of the political set and setting. Contrary to recent assertions, we show that conservative, hierarchy-based ideologies are able to assimilate psychedelic experiences of interconnection, as expressed by thought leaders like Jordan Peterson, corporadelic actors, and members of several neo-Nazi organizations.

TI  - Contrasting surface velocities between lake- and land-terminating glaciers in the Himalayan region
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Meltwater from Himalayan glaciers sustains the flow of rivers such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra on which over half a billion people depend for day-to-day needs. Upstream areas are likely to be affected substantially by climate change, and changes in the magnitude and timing of meltwater supply are expected to occur in coming decades. About 10 % of the Himalayan glacier population terminates into proglacial lakes, and such lake-terminating glaciers are known to exhibit higher-than-average total mass losses. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms driving exacerbated ice loss from lake-terminating glaciers in the Himalaya. Here we examine a composite (2017-2019) glacier surface velocity dataset, derived from Sentinel 2 imagery, covering central and eastern Himalayan glaciers larger than 3 km(2). We find that centre flow line velocities of lake-terminating glaciers (N = 70; u(median): 18.83 m yr(-1); IQR - interquartile range - uncertainty estimate: 18.55-19.06 m yr(-1)) are on average more than double those of land-terminating glaciers (N = 249; u(median): 8.24 m yr(-1); IQR uncertainty estimate: 8.17-8.35 m yr(-1)) and show substantially more heterogeneity than land-terminating glaciers around glacier termini. We attribute this large heterogeneity to the varying influence of lakes on glacier dynamics, resulting in differential rates of dynamic thinning, which causes about half of the lake-terminating glacier population to accelerate towards the glacier termini. Numerical ice-flow model experiments show that changes in the force balance at the glacier termini are likely to play a key role in accelerating the glacier flow at the front, with variations in basal friction only being of modest importance. The expansion of current glacial lakes and the formation of new meltwater bodies will influence the dynamics of an increasing number of Himalayan glaciers in the future, and these factors should be carefully considered in regional projections.

TI  - The association of sex with pain scores and perioperative opioid administration following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aim: We investigated whether sex is associated with pain scores and opioid administration after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Materials & methods: We performed a single-center, retrospective analysis of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients from December 2016-July 2018. Multivariable linear regressions were performed to investigate the association of sex with pain scores and opioid administration. Results: Baseline pain scores were similar between women and men (n = 266; 78% women). Men reported lower pain scores in all phases of care and received more opioids during their hospitalization (B = 25.48; 95% CI: 5.77-45.20; p = 0.01), compared with women. Conclusion: Our data suggest that women self-report greater postoperative pain scores, while men received more opioids during their hospitalization. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons for such differences in postoperative pain management.Lay abstract: Men are at higher risk for long-term opioid use compared with women, but it remains unclear whether perioperative management is a sentinel event for such outcomes. Since patients who receive higher amounts of postoperative opioids are more likely to remain on long term narcotics, we investigated whether sex is associated with pain scores and opioid administration after bariatric surgery. We demonstrate that men self-report lower pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit, surgical floor and at discharge, compared with women. We also show that while men and women received comparable doses of opioids in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit, men received more opioids on the surgical floor. Our findings suggest that strategies to reduce opioid administration after bariatric surgery should largely focus on care after the immediate postoperative period.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of forest cover change and associated environmental challenges: a case study in the Central Highlands of Vietnam
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal regression combining Theil-Sen median trend and Man-Kendall tests was applied to MODIS time-series data to quantify the trend and rate of change to forest cover in the Central Highlands, Vietnam from 2001 to 2019. Several MODIS data products, including Percent Tree Cover (PTC), Evapotranspiration (ET), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) were selected as indicators for forest cover and climate and carbon cycle patterns. Emerging hot spot analysis was applied to identify patterns of long-term deforestation. Spatial regression analysis using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was performed to understand variations in the relationship between vegetation changes and trends in LST, ET, and GPP. Our analysis reveals that deforestation occurred significantly in the study area with a total decrease of 14.5% in PTC and a total of 7314 deforestation hot spots were identified. Results indicate that forest cover loss explains 72.9%, 67.7%, and 89.4% of the changes in ET, GPP, and LST, respectively, and the levels of influence are heterogenous across space and dependent on the types of deforestation hot spots. The approach introduced in our study can be performed worldwide to address complex research questions about environmental challenges that emerge from deforestation.

TI  - Digital mapping of potentially toxic elements enrichment in soils of Urmia Lake due to water level decline
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities, in addition to climate change caused the drying of Urmia Lake in Iran, since 2005. Dust storms blown from the dried lakebed have created serious environmental hazards in adjacent areas. These crises would jeopardise achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and emphasise the need for evaluating the spatial distribution of soil enrichment of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn). Conventional assessment would require a costly sampling method to map potentially polluted areas. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has proved to be a cost-efficient method for soil mapping, however its application in mapping enrichment of PTEs in soil is still lacking. This study aims to map and project the potential pollution of PTEs in the Urmia Lake area using digital mapping techniques and Landsat-8 OLI satellite images. A total of 129 surficial soil samples were collected as ground control. Enrichment factors (EFs) of PTEs and the Modified Pollution Index (MPI) were spatially predicted using two machine learning models. Covariates were derived from a suite of Landsat-8 spectral indices. The bootstrapping method was used to analyse the uncertainties. The results showed that Random Forests performed well in estimating EFs of several PTEs. Spectral indices using NIR and SWIR bands were key to predict these PTEs and MPI. The digital maps demonstrated that the study area was enriched with As, Cu and Pb at moderate to significant levels. Regions under the lower ecological level (elevation <-1274 m) had significantly larger enrichment than those of higher elevation. Based on MPI, 43% of the area was categorised as moderately polluted, and 31% of the area was moderately-heavily polluted. Possible sources of PTEs were discharges from farmlands, landfills, and industries. Our results revealed that the Urmia Lake desiccating has caused severe environmental challenges and needs immediate restoration.

TI  - Oral health surveillance in Australia: the need for ongoing data to inform public health decision-making
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance of people's health takes on an important meaning in the practice of public health because it allows monitoring of diseases and prompt response to change in proportions and rates at which diseases occur in populations. Improving health of populations requires establishment of an effective public health system. Population level data and analysis is critically important in government policy and program development and monitoring. Lack of or inadequate information about the health of populations leads to ineffective policies that may often attenuate health problems instead of solving them. Australia's current oral health surveillance is mostly through ad hoc sentinel surveys, which lack recency in time. This position paper is to present the need for real-time oral health surveillance in Australia, which can be used to inform health decision-making in a timely manner.

TI  - Large diatom bloom off the Antarctic Peninsula during cool conditions associated with the 2015/2016 El Nino
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Low meltwater input, cold temperatures, and high salinity accompanied a large diatom bloom off the Northern Antarctic Peninsula in 2015/2016 and suggests such blooms may be restricted under warmer conditions, according to direct measurements and remote sensing data.Diatoms play crucial functions in trophic structure and biogeochemical cycles. Due to poleward warming, there has been a substantial decrease in diatom biomass, especially in Antarctic regions that experience strong physical changes. Here we analyze the phytoplankton contents of water samples collected in the spring/summer of 2015/2016 off the North Antarctic Peninsula during the extreme El Nino event and compare them with corresponding satellite chlorophyll-a data. The results suggest a close link between large diatom blooms, upper ocean physical structures and sea ice cover, as a consequence of the El Nino effects. We observed massive concentrations (up to 40 mg m(-3) of in situ chlorophyll-a) of diatoms coupled with substantially colder atmospheric and oceanic temperatures and high mean salinity values associated with a lower input of meltwater. We hypothesize that increased meltwater concentration due to continued atmospheric and oceanic warming trends will lead to diatom blooms becoming more episodic and spatially/temporally restricted.

TI  - An episode of transboundary air pollution in the central Himalayas during agricultural residue burning season in North India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indo-Gangetic Plain experiences extremely hazardous air pollution levels during the months of October and November due to post-harvest agricultural residue burning (ARB), mainly in the northwest Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. The impact of the resultant pollutant transport on the air quality of the central Nepali Himalayas has received little study thus far. We used multiple datasets including in-situ measurements, satellite observations, reanalysis data and back-trajectory analysis to investigate a recent episode of elevated air pollution in Kathmandu, Nepal, during November 4-7, 2020, in which the level of particulate matter (PM2.5) doubled in a few days. We found the transboundary transport of aerosols from ARB in northwest India was responsible for the spike in PM2.5. We also found that although ARB fires occur throughout the post-monsoon season, the transport of pollutants beyond the Mahabharat range in Nepal is episodic and is controlled by synoptic and mesoscale dynamics in the region. Under specific wind conditions, pollutants concentrated in the southern Mahabharat range can be transported to Kathmandu and higher elevations, mainly through the river valleys. When combined with remote sensing data and back-trajectory models, even coarse resolution reanalysis data can provide valuable insights to understand the distribution and transport mechanism of air pollution in the Nepali Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, where direct measurements are sparse. Since pollution from ARB impacts people in several countries in this region, insights provided by analyses such as ours may provide a starting point for multilateral dialogue and cooperation to devise and implement policies to mitigate the impact of transboundary air pollution on human health.

TI  - Stochastic bias correction for RADARSAT-2 soil moisture retrieved over vegetated areas
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR data provide the high-resolution images useful for monitoring environment, and natural resources. Nevertheless, it has been a great challenge to retrieve soil moisture over vegetated sites from SAR backscatter coefficients, as it is almost impossible to parameterize spatially heterogeneous and time-varying roughness, the effect of rainfall or canopy volume scattering with implicit equations. We suggest a Monte Carlo Method (MCM) as a strategy to mitigate non-linear errors in retrievals arising from rainfall, and vegetation growth. The Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is repeatedly run in a forward mode for establishing the Gaussian-distributed soil roughness and backscatter coefficients. The mean value of soil moisture ensembles inverted from those was taken as an optimal estimate. Local validations show that Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) were 0.05 similar to 0.07 m(3)/m(3) at the stations in Saskatchewan, Canada. Biases were 0.01 m(3)/m(3). Spatial distribution illustrates that the retrieval biases were mitigated, resolving AIEM inversion errors.

AB  - Lay abstract To study the clinical significance of nonvisualized sentinel lymph nodes (non-vSLNs) in axillary surgery for breast cancer, 30,508 consecutive SLN procedures performed at a single institution from 2000 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed with the aim to analyze the incidence of non-vSLNs on lymphoscintigraphy, the identification rate during surgery, factors associated with non-vSLNs and related axillary management. Associations between clinicopathological factors and the identification of SLNs during surgery were assessed. Non-vSLN occurred in 525 of the procedures (1.7%). In 73.3%, at least one SLN was identified intraoperatively. Nodal involvement was only significantly associated with SLN nonidentification (p < 0.001). Patients with non-vSLN had an increased risk for SLN metastasis. The detection rate during surgery was consistent, reducing the amount of unnecessary axillary dissection.Aims: The clinical significance of nonvisualized sentinel lymph nodes (non-vSLNs) is unknown.

AB  - Wet path delay (WPD) is an important source of satellite altimeters' transmission error, which must be fully corrected to ensure data quality. After decades of study, WPD can now be accurately negated by measuring the brightness temperature with a microwave radiometer (MWR). However, due to hardware and financial limitations, many satellites are not equipped with MWRs, and WPD can only be corrected by mathematical models. Currently available empirical models, which are mostly established by traditional fitting methods, are unable to reach the accuracy required by altimeters, so it is necessary to further improve the correction accuracy of the models. Based on three machine learning algorithms, we established three high-precision wet tropospheric correction (WTC) models suitable for satellite altimeters. We analyzed the global navigation satellite system dataset and three MWR datasets, i.e., Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, and Sentinel-3B, for data quality and consistency and combined these datasets for modeling. In addition, several input features were extracted from existing knowledge on tropospheric delay. Through a comparative analysis of different feature combinations, temperature (T), water vapor pressure (e), and total content of water vapor were selected as the input features. Then we established three WTC models based on multilayer perceptron, random forest, and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), respectively. With a dataset from Jason-2 that was not used during modeling as the verification set, we verified the generalizability of these WTC models from the global, latitudinal, and seasonal perspectives. Moreover, three traditional WTC models were compared with the ones developed here. The results show that the WTC models established based on machine learning algorithms outperform traditional WTC models. The WTC model based on ANFIS boasts the best calculation accuracy in all aspects, over 50% higher than that of traditional WTC models.

TI  - Using topic modelling for unsupervised annotation of electronic health records to identify an outbreak of disease in UK dogs
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A key goal of disease surveillance is to identify outbreaks of known or novel diseases in a timely manner. Such an outbreak occurred in the UK associated with acute vomiting in dogs between December 2019 and March 2020. We tracked this outbreak using the clinical free text component of anonymised electronic health records (EHRs) collected from a sentinel network of participating veterinary practices. We sourced the free text (narrative) component of each EHR supplemented with one of 10 practitioner-derived main presenting complaints (MPCs), with the 'gastroenteric' MPC identifying cases involved in the disease outbreak. Such clinician-derived annotation systems can suffer from poor compliance requiring retrospective, often manual, coding, thereby limiting real-time usability, especially where an outbreak of a novel disease might not present clinically as a currently recognised syndrome or MPC. Here, we investigate the use of an unsupervised method of EHR annotation using latent Dirichlet allocation topic-modelling to identify topics inherent within the clinical narrative component of EHRs. The model comprised 30 topics which were used to annotate EHRs spanning the natural disease outbreak and investigate whether any given topic might mirror the outbreak time-course. Narratives were annotated using the Gensim Library LdaModel module for the topic best representing the text within them. Counts for narratives labelled with one of the topics significantly matched the disease outbreak based on the practitioner-derived 'gastroenteric' MPC (Spearman correlation 0.978); no other topics showed a similar time course. Using artificially injected outbreaks, it was possible to see other topics that would match other MPCs including respiratory disease. The underlying topics were readily evaluated using simple word-cloud representations and using a freely available package (LDAVis) providing rapid insight into the clinical basis of each topic. This work clearly shows that unsupervised record annotation using topic modelling linked to simple text visualisations can provide an easily interrogable method to identify and characterise outbreaks and other anomalies of known and previously un-characterised diseases based on changes in clinical narratives.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant women, healthcare workers and adults &gt;=60 years of age in Lao People's Democratic Republic
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pregnant women, healthcare workers (HW), and adults >= 60 years have shown an increased vulnerability to seasonal influenza virus infections and/or complications. In 2012, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) initiated a national influenza vaccination program for these target groups. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of this program was undertaken to inform program sustainability. Methods: We designed a decision-analytical model and collected influenza-related medical resource utilization and cost data, including indirect costs. Model inputs were obtained from medical record abstraction, interviews of patients and staff at hospitals in the national influenza sentinel surveillance system and/or from literature reviews. We compared the annual disease and economic impact of influenza illnesses in each of the target groups in Lao PDR under scenarios of no vaccination and vaccination, and then estimated the cost-effectiveness of the vaccination program. We performed sensitivity analyses to identify influential variables. Results: Overall, the vaccination of pregnant women, HWs, and adults >= 60 years could annually save 11,474 doctor visits, 1,961 days of hospitalizations, 43,027 days of work, and 1,416 life-years due to laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. After comparing the total vaccination program costs of 23.4 billion Kip, to the 18.4 billion Kip saved through vaccination, we estimated the vaccination program to incur a net cost of five billion Kip (599,391 USD) annually. The incremental cost per life-year saved (ICER) was 44 million Kip (5,295 USD) and 6.9 million Kip (825 USD) for pregnant women and adults >= 60 years, respectively. However, vaccinating HWs provided societal cost-savings, returning 2.88 Kip for every single Kip invested. Influenza vaccine effectiveness, attack rate and illness duration were the most influential variables to the model. Conclusion: Providing influenza vaccination to HWs in Lao PDR is cost-saving while vaccinating pregnant women and adults >= 60 is cost-effective and highly cost-effective, respectively, per WHO standards.

TI  - Fluorescent Guided Lymph Node Harvest in Laparoscopic Wilms Nephroureterectomy
T2  - UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node harvest is an integral part of Wilms tumor surgery with both SLOP and COG protocols asking for more than 6 lymph nodes to best evaluate for nodal spread and a subsequent need for intensification of treatment. The majority of studies show that in both open and minimally invasive resections the median number of nodes removed is 4.Indocyanine green and near infrared fluorescence may be the key to solving this problem. In adult gynaecology, colorectal and breast cancers, ICG is used to identify sentinel nodes and facilitate nodal retrieval.

TI  - Developing Appreciative Attitudes Toward Jews: A Multi-Campus Investigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to examine the institutional conditions and educational practices associated with the development of first-term students' appreciative attitudes toward Jews. Using a longitudinal design, we administered a theoretically derived and empirically validated measure of interfaith experiences to 7,194 first-term students enrolled in one of 122 institutions. Analytically, we weighted data to reflect national figures regarding first-year students and used hierarchical linear modeling to account for students nested within institutions. Results indicated that development during the first term in college was related to having space for support and spiritual expression, attending two or more interfaith activities, and productively engaging in provocative experiences that spurred dissonance and subsequent meaning making about worldview diversity. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

TI  - A lake ice phenology dataset for the Northern Hemisphere based on passive microwave remote sensing
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice phenology (LIP) is an essential indicator of climate change and helps with understanding of the regional characteristics of climate change impacts. Ground observation records and remote sensing retrieval products of lake ice phenology are abundant for Europe, North America, and the Tibetan Plateau, but there is a lack of data for inner Eurasia. In this work, enhanced-resolution passive microwave satellite data (PMW) were used to investigate the Northern Hemisphere Lake Ice Phenology (PMW LIP). The Freeze Onset (FO), Complete Ice Cover (CIC), Melt Onset (MO), and Complete Ice Free (CIF) dates were derived for 753 lakes, including 409 lakes for which ice phenology retrievals were available for the period 1978 to 2020 and 344 lakes for which these were available for 2002 to 2020. Verification of the PMW LIP using ground records gave correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.84 for CIC and CIF, respectively, and the corresponding values of the RMSE were 11.84 and 10.07 days. The lake ice phenology in this dataset was significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with that obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data - the average correlation coefficient was 0.90 and the average RMSE was 7.87 days. The minimum RMSE was 4.39 days for CIF. The PMW is not affected by the weather or the amount of sunlight and thus provides more reliable data about the freezing and thawing process information than MODIS observations. The PMW LIP dataset provides the basic freeze-thaw data that is required for research into lake ice and the impact of climate change in the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The dataset is available at http://www.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.j00076.00081.

TI  - Improved cloud detection for the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS): training an artificial neural network on colocated MLS and Aqua MODIS data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved cloud detection algorithm for the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) is presented. This new algorithm is based on a feedforward artificial neural network and uses as input, for each MLS limb scan, a vector consisting of 1710 brightness temperatures provided by MLS observations from 15 different tangent altitudes and up to 13 spectral channels in each of 10 different MLS bands. The model has been trained on global cloud properties reported by Aqua's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In total, the colocated MLS-MODIS data set consists of 162 117 combined scenes sampled on 208 d over 2005-2020. A comparison to the current MLS cloudiness flag used in "Level 2" processing reveals a huge improvement in classification performance. For previously unseen data, the algorithm successfully detects > 93 % of profiles affected by clouds, up from similar to 16 % for the Level 2 flagging. At the same time, false positives reported for actually clear profiles are comparable to the Level 2 results. The classification performance is not dependent on geolocation but slightly decreases over low-cloud-cover regions. The new cloudiness flag is applied to determine average global cloud cover maps over 2015-2019, successfully reproducing the spatial patterns of mid-level to high clouds seen in MODIS data. It is also applied to four example cloud fields to illustrate its reliable performance for different cloud structures with varying degrees of complexity. Training a similar model on MODIS-retrieved cloud top pressure (p(CT)) yields reliable predictions with correlation coefficients > 0.82. It is shown that the model can correctly identify > 85 % of profiles with p(CT) < 400 hPa Similar to the cloud classification model, global maps and example cloud fields are provided, which reveal good agreement with MODIS results. The combination of the cloudiness flag and predicted cloud top pressure provides the means to identify MLS profiles in the presence of high-reaching convection.

TI  - Delineation of cultivated land parcels based on deep convolutional networks and geographical thematic scene division of remotely sensed images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of cultivated land information from high spatial resolution remote sensing images is increasingly becoming an important approach to digitization and informatization in modern agriculture. The continuous development of deep learning technology has made it possible to extract information of cultivated land parcels by an intelligent way. Aiming at fine extraction of cultivated land parcels within large areas, this article builds a framework of geographical thematic scene division according to the rule of territorial differentiation in geography. A deep learning semantic segmentation network, improved U-net with depthwise separable convolution (DSCUnet), is proposed to achieve the division of the whole image. Then, an extended multichannel richer convolutional features (RCF) network is involved to delineate the boundaries of cultivated land parcels from agricultural functional scenes obtained by the former step. In order to testify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods, this article implemented experiments using Gaofen-2 images with different spatial resolution. The results show an outstanding performance using methods proposed in this article in both dividing agricultural functional scenes and delineating cultivated land parcels compared with other commonly used methods. Meanwhile, the extraction results have the highest accuracy in both the traditional evaluation indices (like Precision, Recall, F-1, and IoU) and geometric boundary precision of cultivated land parcels. The methods in this article can provide a feasible solution to the problem of finely extracting cultivated land parcels information within large areas and complex landscape conditions in practical applications.

TI  - Therapeutic de-escalation in breast cancer surgery
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The surgical management of breast cancer has been marked by a therapeutic de-escalation from radical surgery to breast conservation and from axillary curage to sentinel lymph node sampling. With regard to breast surgery, the de-escalation of treatment has been largely due to organized screening, which hos made it possible to diagnose tumors of smaller volume or at an earlier stage. The indications for conservative surgery hove been broadened by the addition of radiotherapy on one hand, and the introduction of adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatments on the other hand. In on effort to de-escalate surgery, totally non-invasive techniques such as radio frequency, HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) or cryotheropy hove been tested. Currently, three trials ore underway to evaluate active surveillance, without surgery, in the management of certain low-risk ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). Regarding axillary procedures, the sentinel node technique has allowed oxillary staging in patients with early breast cancer without clinical or radiological lymph node involvement. Currently, international recommendations (ASCO, NCCN) and the consensus of experts in St Gallen do not recommend additional curage in cases of macro or micrometastatic invasion of the sentinel lymph nodes if the criteria of ACOSOG Z0011 are met. The question now arises as to the relevance of a biopsy of suspected axillary nodes during the initial workup and the usefulness of the sentinel node technique in the case of o negative initial workup.

TI  - Assessment of metocean forecasts for Hurricane Lorenzo in the Azores Archipelago
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes the performance of multiple wind and wave operational forecasts of Hurricane Lorenzo, the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record. Deterministic and ensemble forecast products from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, Environment Canada's Meteorological Center, US Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, and Deutscher Wetterdienst have been selected for the assessment, which is based on in situ observations collected in the Azores Archipelago and satellite data (altimeters and scatterometers). Forecast ranges up to one week are analyzed and the error metrics are calculated as a function of the forecast lead times. The results show that the ensemble forecasts presented better performance than the deterministic forecasts, maintaining high correlation coefficients and low scatter indexes at longer ranges. However, the ensemble averages are associated with negative bias and increasing underestimation of the peak of the storm when the ensemble spread is large.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Positivity in Patients With Acral Lentiginous and Other Subtypes of Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a rare subtype of malignant melanoma typically occurring on the palmar and plantar surfaces. Although it has distinctive genetic, prognostic, and behavioral characteristics relative to cutaneous melanomas overall, owing to its rarity, treatment is largely guided by data extrapolated from more common subtypes. Although sentinel lymph node (SLN) status has been shown to be a significant prognostic factor for ALM, the independent effect of ALM-subtype disease on the likelihood of SLN positivity and the stage-specific positivity rates for ALM are not well characterized.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of ALM with SLN status as well as to characterize the clinical stage-specific rates of SLN positivity for ALM based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition (AJCC-8).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The National Cancer Database (NCDB) includes all reportable cases from Commission on Cancer accredited facilities and represents approximately 50% of all newly diagnosed melanoma cases in the US. This retrospective cohort study included cases of AJCC-8 clinical stage I to II melanomas from the NCDB diagnosed from 2012 to 2015. The analysis took place between April 2021 and September 2021.EXPOSURES Melanoma histopathologic subtype. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sentinel lymph node status.RESULTS We identified 60 148 patients with malignant melanomas, 959 of whom had ALM-subtype disease. Among patients in the cohort, 25 550 (42.5%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 64 (16) years. Multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographic and histopathologic characteristics revealed that ALM was independently associated with the highest risk for SLN positivity among included subtypes (vs superficial spreading melanoma: odds ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.59-2.28). Subgroup analysis by AJCC clinical stage demonstrated that ALM was independently associated with the highest risk for SLN positivity for both stage IB and II disease. The rate of SLN positivity for patients with stage IB and II ALM was 18.39%(95% CI, 13.82%-24.03%) and 39.53%(34.98%-44.26%), respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study ALM was independently associated with SLN positivity and had relatively high positivity rates at clinical stage IB and II. This suggests that SLNB should be encouraged for all patients with clinical stage IB and II ALM, and such patients should receive appropriate counseling about the higher regional metastatic risk of their cancers. Future work with a larger cohort is required to elucidate the risk of SLN positivity for stage IA ALM.

TI  - Mapping and identification of ice-sheet and glacier features using optical and SAR data in parts of central Dronning Maud Land (cDML), East Antarctica
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite data is used to extract ice-sheet features in Princess-Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, in Droning Maud Land between 70 degrees and 72 degrees S and 5 degrees-20 degrees E, East Antarctica. Their mapping and monitoring is cumbersome and time-consuming using traditional survey methods. Therefore, to achieve desirable results, RS based methods were employed. The main ice-sheet and glacial features mapped are Bluelce-Area (BIA), melt water channels, glacier radar zones, crevasse, nunataks, moraine, supraglacial lakes, and wind scoop. Support-vector-machine (SVM) and supervised classification algorithm were applied over Landsat-8, RISAT-1 and Sentinel-1 data to classify these features. Surface patterns of snow and clouds were found in the continental icesheet, which becomes an obstacle to clearly extract sub-surface icesheet features in optical data. Therefore, to improve mapping of snow and ice features, high-resolution microwave data was also used. By comparing optical and microwave data, it was found that more sub-surface features could be mapped using microwave data. Further, RS was used to map the temporal change in the glacial features using two-year images for the austral summer of 2016 and 2017. It was found that diurnal as-well-as seasonal changes in surface ice features occur due to changes in local weather and can be mapped using temporal RS data.

TI  - Combining Swarm Langmuir probe observations, LEO-POD-based and ground-based GNSS receivers and ionosondes for prompt detection of ionospheric earthquake and tsunami signatures: case study of 2015 Chile-Illapel event
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates ionospheric electric field responses to the earthquake (EQ) of magnitude 8.3, and the related seismic activity and tsunami triggered by the mainshock in Chile-Illapel region, at 22:54 UTC, in the evening of September 16, 2015. The work is a wider review of available ground and satellite data and techniques available to detect seismically induced traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID) and irregularities of smaller scale. The data used in the experiment includes several types of ground and satellite observations from low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The number of techniques applied here is also extended and includes spectral analysis of LEO along-track data and composed analysis of ground GNSS data. The timeframe of the analyses is focused on September 16 and 17, 2015 but also extended to several adjacent days, where an enhanced seismic activity has been recorded. Several examples of seismically triggered TIDs are shown, as detected by combined observations from more than one source and applying different methods, including spectral analysis. These disturbances occur before the mainshock, just after, or in time following this large EQ, and can be found in close neighborhood of Chile-Illapel or far away from the epicenter. The objective of the work was to demonstrate an increasing number of available data and techniques, which can be limited when applied alone, but their combination can provide many advantages in the analysis of seismically disturbed ionosphere. The combination of LEO satellite data reaching all regions of the globe with local but dense ground-based GNSS data and ionospheric HF sounders looks promising, especially in view of the nearby availability of CubeSat constellations equipped with instruments for ionosphere sounding. An important conclusion coming from the study is a need for spectral analysis techniques in the processing of LEO along-track data and the requirement of the validation of LEO observations with separate LEO data or ground-based data. A general but key finding refers to the complementarities of different observations of the ionospheric electric field, which is critically important in the case of analyzing ionospheric irregularities in the extended and composed ionosphere, especially if not every sounding direction can successfully find it.

TI  - Pan-Arctic ocean wind and wave data by spaceborne SAR
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is one of the most significant changing areas on the Earth under the climate change scenario. More regions in the Arctic are becoming ice-free oceans in the melting season or through the whole year. Therefore, ocean wind and wave, as the two most important parameters in the air-sea interface, are drawing significant attention to the Arctic Ocean. Scatterometer and radar altimeter are the two traditional remote sensing instruments for ocean wind and wave observations, while the former is limited by coarse spatial resolution and the latter has small spatial coverage. Wind and wave data in high spatial resolution and wide coverage by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are currently lacking in the Arctic Ocean. We developed an ocean wind and wave dataset by Sentinel-1 SAR in the pan-Arctic Ocean (above 60 degrees N), covering January 2017 to May 2021. By comparing with sea surface wind speed data of scatterometer, the SAR-retrieved wind data achieve an accuracy of 1.23 m/s, in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Compared with significant wave height data of radar altimeter, the SAR retrievals have an RMSE of 0.66 m. The data records are in the standard NetCDF-4 format. The dataset is publicly available at: http://www.dx.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00834.

TI  - Retrieving the Soil Moisture in Bare Farmland Areas Using a Modified Dubois Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter for global soil moisture transport, environmental evaluation, and precision agricultural research. The accurate retrieval of soil moisture in farmland areas using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) depends on the accurate description of surface and SAR parameters. In these parameters, surface roughness and incidence angle are the key factors that affect the accuracy of the soil moisture retrieval model. This article proposes a modified Dubois model to retrieve soil moisture suitable for the bare surface of farmland area. The model eliminates the incidence angle parameters and uses polarization parameters to depict the surface roughness parameters in the Dubois model. To eliminate the incidence angle, the backscattering coefficients gamma0, which eliminates the effect of the incidence angles, are used to replace the sigma0. Under rain and no rain condition, the trend of backscattering coefficients (VH and VV) and cross-polarization ratio (VH-VV) of different soil texture with the soil moisture are compared. Then, the polarization parameter based on VH backscattering coefficients is used to describe surface roughness. The model is evaluated with time-series soil moisture observation data in situ of the study area. The results indicate that the modified model can retrieve soil moisture with high accuracy, and the total RMSE can reach 0.064 cm(3)cm(-3) while the Dubois model is 0.124 cm(3)cm(-3). Under rain and no rain condition, the retrieval accuracy of the modified model is 0.066 cm(3)cm(-3) and 0.063 cm(3)cm(-3). The retrieval accuracy is 0.060 cm(3)cm(-3) and 0.067 cm(3)cm(-3) under high and low incidence angles conditions, respectively. These results indicate that the modified Dubois model can retrieve soil moisture with high accuracy under different conditions.

TI  - Investigating optimum ship route in the Antarctic in presence of sea ice and wind resistances - A case study between Bharati and Maitri
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a technique of ship route optimization in the Antarctic sea ice region using Dijkstra's algorithm. It studies some of the major parameters that cause resistance to the ship movement through sea ice. It aims to optimize a safe ship route in the Antarctic sea ice between Bharati and Maitri (Indian Research Stations in Antarctica) coasts. The study region is divided into grids that results into unique nodes, which are studied for sea ice parameters and wind velocity. Resistances caused due to ice and wind are considered to calculate expected ship velocity between nodes. The calculated ship velocities are then used to estimate durations to cover distances from a node to all the neighboring nodes. It forms a mathematical route from source to destination through various nodes with time as weight that is then optimized through Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain optimal route. Satellite remote sensing data derived sea ice parameters (Scatsat-1 derived sea ice extent and NSIDC sea ice concentration) and modeled wind velocity (from ECMWF) have been used as inputs in this model. Ship parameters of Kapitan Khlebnikov (Russian icebreaker) are used to test and compare the proposed model. Results of model are validated with the actual ship route navigated by the 33rd Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (33ISEA) ship. The proposed algorithm, which provides an optimal route when ship parameters are known in advance, can be useful to support future ship navigation in the Antarctic sea ice including Indian Scientific Expeditions to Antarctica.

TI  - Extended and cumulative effects of experimentally induced intergroup conflict in a cooperatively breeding mammal
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Conflict between rival groups is rife in nature. While recent work has begun exploring the behavioural consequences of this intergroup conflict, studies have primarily considered just the 1-2 h immediately after single interactions with rivals or their cues. Using a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula), we conducted week-long manipulations to investigate longer-term impacts of intergroup conflict. Compared to a single presentation of control herbivore faeces, one rival-group faecal presentation (simulating a territorial intrusion) resulted in more within-group grooming the following day, beyond the likely period of conflict-induced stress. Repeated presentations of outsider cues led to further changes in baseline behaviour by the end of the week: compared to control weeks, mongooses spent less time foraging and foraged closer to their groupmates, even when there had been no recent simulated intrusion. Moreover, there was more baseline territorial scent-marking and a higher likelihood of group fissioning in intrusion weeks. Consequently, individuals gained less body mass at the end of weeks with repeated simulated intrusions. Our experimental findings provide evidence for longer-term, extended and cumulative, effects of an elevated intergroup threat, which may lead to fitness consequences and underpin this powerful selective pressure.

TI  - Lower lymph node yield in axillary lymph node dissection specimens in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Quality concern or treatment effect?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) specimens should have at least ten-lymph nodes for examination according to established guidelines. Nonetheless, recent evidence suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) results in fewer nodes in the specimen. We sought to examine if NAC patients have lower lymph node yield from ALND specimens and whether the number of lymph nodes in the specimen is correlated with pathologic complete response (pCR). Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a study cohort of female patients with node-positive, non-metastatic invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 2012 to 2015 was identified. The axillary lymph node retrieval count was compared in NAC and non-NAC patients and then correlated with pCR. A multivariable analysis was performed to identify factors that were associated with less than ten-lymph nodes in the ALND pathologic specimen. Of 56,976 patients identified, 27,197 (48%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 29,779 (52%) did not. NAC patients failed to meet the ten-lymph node minimum in the ALND specimen more often than non-NAC patients (35% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). NAC patients with fewer than ten-lymph nodes were more likely to have a pCR than those with ten or more (22% vs. 16%, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, pCR of the primary tumor and receptor status were found to be independent predictors of having fewer than ten-lymph nodes in the ALND specimen. Node-positive breast cancer patients that underwent NAC were more likely to not meet the ten-lymph node standard. However, NAC patients who did not meet the minimum were also more likely to have a pCR compared to NAC patients who did. This suggests lower lymph node yield may not truly be a marker of lower quality surgery but rather a potential marker of NAC treatment effect.

TI  - Mixotrophic plankton and <i>Synechococcus</i> distribution in waters around Svalbard, Norway during June 2019
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the influence of summer conditions (extended daylight, warmer temperature, increased meltwater, increased suspended load and nutrient chemistry) on the distribution of phytoplankton (diatoms & flagellates) and picoplankton community in the surface waters off Svalbard, samples were collected from 6 locations around Svalbard onboard National Geographic Explorer vessel. Additionally, satellite data was obtained for surface temperature, chlorophyll a (chl a) and total suspended mass (TSM). Stations GnModden (S1), Bellsund (S4), Open Ocean (S5), and Magdalenefjorden (S6) were along the western coast while stations Storfjorden (S2) and Western Storfjorden (S3) were on the eastern side of Svalbard and open to Barents Sea.Phytoplankton abundance ranged from 4 to 49 x 10(3) cells L-1 and were dominated by dinoflagellates such as Perdinium, Protoperidinium, Dynophysis, Gyrodinium, Gymnodinium and Torodinium species while diatoms (Navicula) were found only in colder polar waters (S5 and 6). Flowcytometry data showed the predominance of Synechococcus sp. and its abundance varied from 0.8 x 10(5) cells L-1 (S5) to 4.3 x 10(5) cells L-1 (S4). The distribution of Synechococcus was positively correlated to nitrate (r = 0.838) and chl a (r = 0.915) while phytoplankton abundance had no correlation with chl a or nitrate. A weak positive linear relation between Synechococcus and TSM suggests that melting of glaciers and influx of land run-off may be playing some role in increasing the picoplankton load in these waters. The predominance of mixotrophic dinoflagellates alongwith ciliates like Strombidium in these waters suggests that grazing of picoplankton as well as bacteria might fuel their carbon demand. Our data reflected post-spring bloom conditions wherein Synechococcus were the dominant primary producers and microbial loop might play an important role in sustaining the mixotroph population.

TI  - A Ceph-based storage strategy for big gridded remote sensing data
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - When using distributed storage systems to store gridded remote sensing data in large, distributed clusters, most solutions utilize big table index storage strategies. However, in practice, the performance of big table index storage strategies degrades as scenarios become more complex, and the reasons for this phenomenon are analyzed in this paper. To improve the read and write performance of distributed gridded data storage, this paper proposes a storage strategy based on Ceph software. The strategy encapsulates remote sensing images in the form of objects through a metadata management strategy to achieve the spatiotemporal retrieval of gridded data, finding the cluster location of gridded data through hash-like calculations. The method can effectively achieve spatial operation support in the clustered database and at the same time enable fast random read and write of the gridded data. Random write and spatial query experiments proved the feasibility, effectiveness, and stability of this strategy. The experiments prove that the method has higher stability than, and that the average query time is 38% lower than that for, the large table index storage strategy, which greatly improves the storage and query efficiency of gridded images.

TI  - Satellite and ground based estimates for ice surface velocities in the part of central Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica: Implications for ice flux calculations
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice sheet and glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland represent the largest sources of freshwater on planet Earth. The understanding and quantification of their dynamic properties such as albedo, precipitation, ice mass movement, and ice elevation changes are critical for the improved climate and mass balance models. The present study utilizes space-borne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to measure the ice surface velocity at high spatial resolution for a part of the central Dronning Maud Land (cDML), East Antarctica. The datasets from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite are used for ice stream velocity estimation using feature-offset tracking and differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) methods. The derived velocity products are validated with ground based stakes network at annual time scale. The fundamental ice flow laws are used to estimate the ice outflux or discharge for selected ice stream drainage basins of cDML at fluxgate locations. The ice stream basin has been delineated using combination of elevation, slope and continental scale velocity maps. The ice influx for study area is estimated using ECMWF fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5) and Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) v2.3 model outputs. The estimated influx and outflux are in the ranges of 0.18-4.167 Gt/y and 0.201 to 1.278 Gt/y respectively, indicating net positive mass balance for the selected area.

TI  - Intercomparison of CO measurements from TROPOMI, ACE-FTS, and a high-Arctic ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) provides a daily, spatially resolved (initially 7 x 7 km(2), upgraded to 7 x 5.6 km(2) in August 2019) global dataset of CO columns; however, due to the relative sparseness of reliable ground-based data sources, it can be challenging to characterize the validity and accuracy of satellite data products in remote regions such as the high Arctic. In these regions, satellite intercomparisons can supplement model- and ground-based validation efforts and serve to verify previously observed differences. In this paper, we compare the CO products from TROPOMI, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), and a high-Arctic ground-based FTS located at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) in Eureka, Nunavut (80.05 degrees N, 86.42 degrees W).A global comparison of TROPOMI reference profiles scaled by the retrieved total column with ACE-FTS CO partial columns for the period from 28 November 2017 to 31 May 2020 displays excellent agreement between the two datasets (R = 0.93) and a small relative bias of -0.83 +/- 0.26 % (bias +/- standard error of the mean). Additional comparisons were performed within five latitude bands: the north polar region (60 to 90 degrees N), northern mid-latitudes (20 to 60 degrees N), the equatorial region (20 degrees S to 20 degrees N), southern midlatitudes (60 to 20 degrees S), and the south polar region (90 to 60 degrees S). Latitudinal comparisons of the TROPOMI and ACEFTS CO datasets show strong correlations ranging from R = 0.93 (southern mid-latitudes) to R = 0.86 (equatorial region) between the CO products but display a dependence of the mean differences on latitude. Positive mean biases of 7.93 +/- 0.61 % and 7.21 +/- 0.52 % were found in the northern and southern polar regions, respectively, while a negative bias of -9.41 +/- 0.55 % was observed in the equatorial region. To investigate whether these differences are introduced by cloud contamination, which is reflected in the TROPOMI averaging kernel shape, the latitudinal comparisons were repeated for cloud-covered pixels and clear-sky pixels only, as well as for the unsmoothed and smoothed cases. Clearsky pixels were found to be biased higher with poorer correlations on average than clear+cloudy scenes and cloud-covered scenes only. Furthermore, the latitudinal dependence on the biases was observed in both the smoothed and unsmoothed cases.To provide additional context to the global comparisons of TROPOMI with ACE-FTS in the Arctic, both satellite datasets were compared against measurements from the ground-based PEARL-FTS. Comparisons of TROPOMI with smoothed PEARL-FTS total columns in the period of 3 March 2018 to 27 March 2020 display a strong correlation (R = 0.88); however, a positive mean bias of 14.7 +/- 0.16 % was also found. A partial column comparison of ACE-FTS with the PEARL-FTS in the period from 25 February 2007 to 18 March 2020 shows good agreement (R = 0.79) and a mean positive bias of 7.89 +/- 0.21 % in the ACE-FTS product relative to the ground-based FTS. The magnitude and sign of the mean relative differences are consistent across all intercomparisons in this work, as well as with recent ground-based validation efforts, suggesting that the current TROPOMI CO product exhibits a positive bias in the high-Arctic region. However, the observed bias is within the TROPOMI mission accuracy requirement of +/- 15 %, providing further confirmation that the data quality in these remote high-latitude regions meets this specification.

TI  - Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID): 30 m resolution maps of irrigation distribution, frequency, and change for the US, 1997-2017
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on irrigation patterns and trends at field-level detail across broad extents are vital for assessing and managing limited water resources. Until recently, there has been a scarcity of comprehensive, consistent, and frequent irrigation maps for the US. Here we present the new Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID), which is comprised of 30 m resolution annual irrigation maps covering the conterminous US (CONUS) for the period of 1997-2017. The main dataset identifies the annual extent of irrigated croplands, pastureland, and hay for each year in the study period. Derivative maps include layers on maximum irrigated extent, irrigation frequency and trends, and identification of formerly irrigated areas and intermittently irrigated lands. Temporal analysis reveals that 38.5 x 10(6) ha of croplands and pasture-hay has been irrigated, among which the yearly active area ranged from similar to 22.6 to 24.7 x 10(6) ha. The LANID products provide several improvements over other irrigation data including field-level details on irrigation change and frequency, an annual time step, and a collection of similar to 10000 visually interpreted ground reference locations for the eastern US where such data have been lacking. Our maps demonstrated overall accuracy above 90 % across all years and regions, including in the more humid and challenging-to-map eastern US, marking a significant advancement over other products, whose accuracies ranged from 50 % to 80 %. In terms of change detection, our maps yield per-pixel transition accuracy of 81 % and show good agreement with US Department of Agriculture reports at both county and state levels. The described annual maps, derivative layers, and ground reference data provide users with unique opportunities to study local to nationwide trends, driving forces, and consequences of irrigation and encourage the further development and assessment of new approaches for improved mapping of irrigation, especially in challenging areas like the eastern US. The annual LANID maps, derivative products, and ground reference data are available through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5548555 (Xie and Lark, 2021a).

TI  - Surgical de-escalation in gynecologic oncology
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of knowledge in gynecologic oncology is leading to surgical de-escalation in several areas, particularly in lymph node staging. Sentinel lymph node biopsy that was initially used in low and intermediate risk endometrial cancer, hos now been extended to high-intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy plays also an important role in the nodal staging of early-stage cervical cancer. The radicality of hysterectomies in patients with early cervical cancer is under debate. Similarly, surgical staging with para-aortic lymphadenectomy in locally advanced cervical cancer should be performed only for few cases. Systematic pelvic and paro-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with advanced ovarian cancers is not recommended anymore.

TI  - Impact of meteorological parameters on mosquito population abundance and distribution in a former malaria endemic area, central Iran
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological parameters, have been identified as an important factor involved in the transmission of vectorborne diseases. Mosquitoes are extremely sensitive to weather conditions. The aim of this study was investigate the correlation between meteorological parameters and the abundance of mosquitoes in Kashan County. Mosquitoes were collected using four different traps, including hand catch, animal baited bed net trap (usually a cow), human baited bed net trap and BG-Sentinel trap with CO2 from May to December 2019. A total number of mosquitoes collected were 1756 out of which 1621 (92.31%) were Culex, 22 (1.25%) Culiseta and 113 (6.44%) Anopheles in nine species. Most mosquitoes were collected by BG-Sentinel trap with CO2 (63.78%). Monthly distribution of the mosquitoes indicated different monthly peaks. Their high density were recorded in September and were low in December. The spearman's correlation of the mosquito abundance and the meteorological parameters shows that correlation of the number of total collected mosquitoes with relative humidity and precipitation (Rainfall) was weak negative, and there was week correlation with wind speed, and positive strong correlation with temperature. Data collected with various trap types and mosquito correlation with meteorological parameters in this study can be used for mosquito surveillance and control programs. However, meteorological parameters affect the abundance of mosquitoes, but their impact is complex and most of these variables are species specific.

TI  - It takes two to tango - Phylogeography, taxonomy and hybridization in grass snakes and dice snakes (Serpentes: Natricidae: Natrix natrix, N. tessellata)
T2  - VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using two mitochondrial DNA fragments and 13 microsatellite loci, we examined the phylogeographic structure and taxonomy of two codistributed snake species (Natrix natrix, N. tessellata) in their eastern distribution area, with a focus on Turkey. We found evidence for frequent interspecific hybridization, previously thought to be extremely rare, and for backcrosses. This underscores that closely related sympatric species should be studied together because otherwise the signal of hybridization will be missed. Furthermore, the phylogeographic patterns of the two species show many parallels, suggestive of a shared biogeographic history. In general, the phylogeographies follow the paradigm of southern richness to northern purity, but the dice snake has some additional lineages in the south and east in regions where grass snakes do not occur. For both species, the Balkan Peninsula and the Caucasus region served as glacial refugia, with several mitochondrial lineages occurring in close proximity. Our results show that the mitochondrial divergences in both species match nuclear genomic differentiation. Yet, in the former glacial refugia of grass snakes there are fewer nuclear clusters than mitochondrial lineages, suggesting that Holocene range expansions transformed the glacial hotspots in melting pots where only the mitochondrial lineages persisted, bearing witness of former diversity. On the other hand, the deep mitochondrial divergences in N. tessellata across its entire range indicate that more than one species could be involved, even though lacking micro satellite data outside of Turkey prevent firm conclusions. On the contrary, our microsatellite and mitochondrial data corroborate that N. megalocephala is invalid and not differentiated from sympatric populations of N. natrix. For Cypriot grass snakes, our analyses yielded conflicting results. A critical assessment of the available evidence suggests that N. natrix is a genetically impoverished recent invader on Cyprus and taxonomically not distinct from a subspecies also occurring in western Anatolia and the southern Balkans. Based on combined mitochondrial and nuclear genomic evidence we propose that for grass snakes the following subspecies should be recognized in our study region: (1) Natrix natrix vulgaris Laurenti, 1768, southeastern Central Europe and northern Balkans; (2) Natrix natrix moreoticus (Bedriaga, 1882), southern Balkans, western Anatolia, and Cyprus; and (3) Natrix natrix scutata (Pallas, 1771), eastern Anatolia, Caucasus region, Iran, northeastern distribution range (from eastern Poland and Finland to Kazakhstan and the Lake Baikal region). Thus, Natrix natrix cypriaca (Hecht, 1930) becomes a junior synonym ofN. n. moreoticus and Natrix natrix persa (Pallas, 1814) becomes a junior synonym ofN. n. scutata. Due to insufficient material, we could not resolve the status of Natrix natrix syriaca (Hecht, 1930) from the Gulf of Iskenderun, southeastern Turkey.

TI  - Meta-Regression of Herpes Zoster Incidence Worldwide
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Many studies have been conducted worldwide to estimate herpes zoster (HZ) incidence rates. We synthesized studies of HZ incidence rates in the general population using meta-analysis models.Methods: A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate HZ incidence from a published worldwide systematic literature review (SLR) including only individuals aged 50 years and older. Meta-regression was used to explore whether variability in incidence rates could be explained by a combination of study-specific characteristics including age, gender, continent and year of study data. The impact of adding additional covariates-case detection method (general practitioner surveillance, healthcare database, sentinel network, etc.), case definition (medical record-based, self-reported), study design (retrospective passive surveillance, retrospective active surveillance, etc.), incidence type (cumulative incidence/1000 persons or incidence rate/1000 person-years), patient type (outpatients or in- and outpatients) and latitude to the base model-was also assessed.Results: Sixty-one records from 59 studies were included in the analysis: 25, 20, 11 and 5 from Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania, respectively. There was variation in study methodology and outcomes. Heterogeneity of incidence rates was greatest among studies conducted in Asia. Meta-analysis showed that incidence increased with age, was lower in males compared to females, tended to be lower in Europe and North America compared to Asia and Oceania and increased with year of study data. The data-driven meta-regression model included continent, year of study data, gender, age and an age x gender interaction term. The difference in incidence between males and females was greater in younger ages (e.g., 50-59) compared to older age groups (e.g., 80+). None of the additional covariates contributed significantly to the model.Conclusion: Incidence rates were shown to vary by age, gender, continent and year of study data.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Beyond the Tree-Line: The C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> "Grass-Line" Can Track Global Change in the World's Grassy Mountain Systems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - von Humboldt's tree-line concept has dominated mountain ecology for almost two hundred years, and is considered a key indicator for monitoring change in biome boundaries and biodiversity shifts under climate change. Even though the concept of life zones and elevation gradients are a globally observed phenomenon, they have not been thoroughly explored for many contexts. One such example is the tree-line ecotone, a widely used conceptual tool to track climate change in many regions, which has limited application in the widespread tree-sparse, grassy systems that comprise a third of the world's mountain systems. Among grasses (Poaceae), temperature is linked to variation in photosynthetic performance and community dominance for C-3 and C-4 metabolic groups, due to its role in limiting photorespiration in the C-3 photosynthesis process. Here, we investigate this community shift in grassland-dominated mountains to demonstrate the role of climate in driving this transition and discuss the potential applications of this tool to mountain ecosystem conservation worldwide. For identifying grass-dominated mountains worldwide, we measured the grass-cover using satellite data. We then compiled Poaceae distribution data for ten grass-dominated mountains spanning from 42 degrees S to 41 degrees N and determined the temperature intervals and elevation ranges at which each genus was found, testing for effects of temperature, precipitation, and latitudinal gradients on the dominance of C-3-C-4 grasses. Temperature was the main driver of C-3 dominance, with the richness of C-3 genera tending to surpass the taxonomic dominance of C-4 plants along mountain temperature gradients where the annual mean temperature was colder than ca. 14.6 degrees C. Similar patterns were observed in eight out of ten mountains, suggesting that this may constitute an isotherm-driven ecotone. Consequently, this C-3-C-4 transition offers a promising tool for monitoring climate change impacts in grassy mountains. C-3-C-4 grass community shifts in response to environmental change will likely have major implications for fire frequency and severity, rangeland productivity and livelihoods, food security, and water budgets in mountain systems. Given the severity of the implications of global change on these social-ecological systems, we propose that a "grass-line" monitoring protocol be developed for global application.

TI  - Examining the efficacy of revegetation practices in ecosystem restoration programs: insights from a hotspot of sandstorm in northern China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrospectively evaluating the efficacy of revegetation practices is helpful in planning and implementing future ecosystem restoration programs (ERP). Having a good understanding of how human activities can affect vegetation cover, both before and after ERP, is particularly important in sandstorm hotspot areas. The Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Region (BTSSR) is one such area. We conducted an investigation into vegetation dynamics within the BTSSR. This was done using remote sensing data in conjunction with climate data sets and land use data spanning the 1982-2014 period. The relationships between climatic factors (such as precipitation and temperature), and vegetative change were modeled using a neural network method. By a process of residual analysis, the proportions of human-induced vegetative change both before and after the ERP were established. Our results show that: 1) before the ERP (1982-2000), 40.96% of the study area exhibited significantly progressive vegetation changes (p < 0.05). This proportion decreased to encompass only 20.23% of the study area in the period following the ERP (2001-2014). 2) 89.55% of the study area showed signs of human-induced vegetation degradation before the ERP. Between 2001 and 2014 however, following ERP, this figure fell to only 27.78%. 3) ERP implementation led to visible improvements in vegetative conditions within the BTSSR, especially in areas where ecological restoration measures were directly and anthropogenically applied. These results highlight the benefits that positive human action (i.e., revegetation initiatives implemented under the framework of an ERP) have brought to the BTSSR.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of stand age and aboveground biomass from Landsat time series analyses of forest cover loss in tropical dry forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information on the timing of forest cover loss is important to identify and map stand age, which is a key factor driving the recovery of carbon pools and can also be used to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) based on its relationship with stand age. Here, we estimated the spatial distribution of stand age and AGB of young forest (<20 years) in three types of tropical dry forest in the Yucatan peninsula using Landsat NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time series from 2000 to 2020. We estimated AGB based on chronosequence data and compared these results to reference field data and estimations obtained from remote-sensing studies. The overall and user accuracy of the age map was high (95.7-99.9% and 87.35-98.5% respectively). However, lower producer accuracy values (from 31.2 to 67.2%) suggest an underestimation of the extension of young forests. We found a greater extent of young forests in the semi-deciduous and deciduous forests compared to the semi-evergreen ones. Mean AGB estimated from stand age (53.1 Mg ha(-1)) was lower than that estimated from remote-sensing studies (67.5 to 95.2 Mg ha(-1)). These results indicate that spatial information of forest age can be accurately assessed from Landsat time series, and that the combination of stand age with chronosequence data can reduce the overestimation of AGB of recovering forests commonly found in remotely sensed data.

TI  - Application of Different Modelling Methods to Arbitrate Various Hydrological Attributes Using CMORPH and TRMM Satellite Data in Upper Omo-Gibe Basin of Ethiopia
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall is a basic input parameter for hydrological modelling that exerts a great influence on the dependability of hydrological simulations. Limited availability of accurate and reliable precipitation data in Abelti watershed of Omo Gibe basin of Ethiopia coerces to use satellite rainfall data to design watershed management practices. The primary objective of this research is to find a better output by comparing and evaluating Climate Prediction Centre Morphing techniques (CMORPH) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Satellite precipitation products (SPPs) and inputs were incorporated to simulate stream flow. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, calibration, and validation of the model were conducted using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Calibration and Uncertainty Program 2012 (SWAT-CUP-2012), particularly the Sequential/Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) algorithm for all rainfall inputs independently. The calibration and validation period was taken as 2003-2010 and 2011-2018, respectively. On the basis of the modelling results of SWAT and uncertainty analysis, TRRM relatively performed well than that of CMORPH. The result illustrated that the SWAT model thoroughly predicted the catchment runoff simulation for all SPPs. However, TRMM-based simulations capture the shape of the observed stream flow hydrograph, and there was slight under and overestimation of the stream flow volume simulated SPPs followed by the reduction of model performance statistics. Bias-corrected satellite rainfall-based simulations significantly improved the model performance as well as the volume of stream flow simulated. The detail study exhibited that the in situ-based simulation outperformed satellite products in terms of the objective functions in the study area.

TI  - How can Sentinel-2 contribute to seagrass mapping in shallow, turbid Baltic Sea waters?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are one of the most important benthic habitats in the Baltic Sea. Nevertheless, spatially continuous mapping data of Zostera marina, the predominant seagrass species in the Baltic Sea, are lacking in the shallow coastal waters. Sentinel-2 turned out to be valuable for mapping coastal benthic habitats in clear waters, whereas knowledge in turbid waters is rare. Here, we transfer a clear water mapping approach to turbid waters to assess how Sentinel-2 can contribute to seagrass mapping in the Western Baltic Sea. Sentinel-2 data were atmospherically corrected using ACOLITE and subsequently corrected for water column effects. To generate a data basis for training and validating random forest classification models, we developed an upscaling approach using video transect data and aerial imagery. We were able to map five coastal benthic habitats: bare sand (25 km(2)), sand dominated (16 km(2)), seagrass dominated (7 km(2)), dense seagrass (25 km(2)) and mixed substrates with red/brown algae (3.5 km(2)) in a study area along the northern German coastline. Validation with independent data pointed out that water column correction does not significantly improve classification results compared to solely atmospherically corrected data (balanced overall accuracies similar to 0.92). Within optically shallow waters (0-4 m), per class and overall balanced accuracies (>0.82) differed marginally depending on the water depth. Overall balanced accuracy became worse (<0.8) approaching the border to optically deep water (similar to 5 m). The spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10-20 m) allowed delineating detailed spatial patterns of seagrass habitats, which may serve as a basis to retrieve spatially continuous data for ecologically relevant metrics such as patchiness. Thus, Sentinel-2 can contribute unprecedented information for seagrass mapping between 0 and around 5 m water depths in the Western Baltic Sea.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a concentrations inversion based on the modified Quasi-Analytical Algorithm and Sentinel-3 OLCI in Daihai Lake, China
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) is effective in retrieving water inherent optical properties (IOPs) from remote sensing spectral reflectance and has wider applications in studies of the open ocean and coastal waters than of inland waters. This research aimed to modify the QAA model based on measured field spectral reflectance and absorption coefficients to render it applicable to studies of Daihai Lake, China. The improvements mainly included the reference wavelength selection, the power index of the particle backscattering coefficient and the exponential slope of the absorption coefficient of the colored detrital matter estimation. The average relative error between the inversed and measured absorption coefficients was less than 20%. A linear model was established between the phytoplankton absorption coefficient at a wavelength of 674 nm (a(ph)(674)) and the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, with a determination coefficient of 0.88. Additionally, the modified Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (MQAA) model was applied to the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data aboard the Sentinel-3 satellite. Finally, a spatial distribution map for the Chl-a concentrations in Daihai Lake on August 10, 2017 was drawn and the mid-eutrophication area was found to occur in the north and border.

TI  - On the interchangeability of Landsat and MODIS data in the CMRSET actual evapotranspiration model - Comment on "Monitoring irrigation using Landsat observations and climate data over regional scales in the Murray-Darling Basin" by David Bretreger, In-Young Yeo, Greg Hancock and Garry Willgoose
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a recent paper published in this journal, Bretreger et al. (2020) estimate irrigation water use from satellite remotely sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration in five irrigated districts of the Murray-Darling Basin (southeast Australia). They used three models that scale crop reference evapotranspiration with vegetation indices acquired by recent Landsat satellites: (i) IrriSAT, (ii) Kamble and (iii) CMRSET. In their paper, irrigation water use computed with CMRSET generally overestimated observed irrigation water use, sometimes fivefold. Based on these results, Bretreger et al. (2020) discouraged the use of CMRSET for irrigation monitoring. In this comment, we reproduce the experiments in Bretreger et al. (2020), and demonstrate that their overestimation was because they used an incorrect Landsat band in their implementation of CMRSET. CMRSET was originally calibrated using both MODIS-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI). To calculate GVMI, a shortwave infrared (SWIR) band with a wavelength of -1.6 mu m was used, which for MODIS is named SWIR2, and for Landsat is named SWIR1 (i.e., different sensors have different bands and a different number of bands and SWIR1 in MODIS has a wavelength of -1.2 mu m). In their Landsat CMRSET implementation, Bretreger et al. (2020) computed GVMI using the Landsat SWIR2 band, which has a wavelength of -2.1 mu m (see their Table 3). We show that CMRSET implemented with the Landsat SWIR1 band (i.e., with a wavelength of -1.6 mu m, so being the correct Landsat band to calculate GVMI) yields similar results (both for temporal patterns and magnitude) when compared to the other two remote sensing actual evapotranspiration models in Bretreger et al. (2020). For the irrigation districts, these similar results meant that the mean water year (i.e., July to next June from 2010 to 2017) actual evapotranspiration mean absolute relative difference was 15.3% (with a 5.4%-26.5% range) and the water year irrigation water use mean absolute relative difference was 4.1% (with a 9.8%-18.9% range). Conversely, we show that a Landsat CMRSET implementation using the incorrect Landsat band for the calculation of GVMI (i.e., with a wavelength of -2.1 mu m) led to a large overestimation agreeing with the CMRSET results reported by Bretreger et al. (2020), both for water year actual evapotranspiration (mean absolute relative difference of 64.6%, with a 51.1%-83.6% range) and irrigation water use (mean absolute relative difference of 44.1%, with a 31.4%-65.1% range). The use of the incorrect Landsat band means that the Bretreger et al. (2020) recommendation specific to their Landsat CMRSET implementation is invalid. A demonstration of Bretreger et al.'s (2020) incorrect Landsat CMRSET implementation and the correct one can be accessed at: https://jorgepena.users.earthengine.app/view/comment-on-bretreger-2020-joh-paper. Despite Bretreger et al.'s (2020) shortcomings in their implementation of the Landsat CMRSET actual evapotranspiration model, timely monitoring of irrigation water use via satellite remote sensing is required at Landsat resolutions (i.e., 30 m) or higher due to the heterogeneous nature of irrigation in most agricultural landscapes, and we applaud them for pursuing this line of research.

TI  - Retrieval algorithm for OClO from TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) by differential optical absorption spectroscopy
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we present a new retrieval algorithm of the slant column densities (SCDs) of chlorine dioxide (OClO) by differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) from measurements performed by TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of Sentinel-5P satellite. To achieve a substantially improved accuracy, which is especially important for OClO observations, accounting for absorber and pseudo absorber structures in optical depth even of the order of 10(-4) is important. Therefore, in comparison to existing retrievals, we include several additional fit parameters by accounting for spectral effects like the temperature dependency of the Ring effect and Ring absorption effects, a higher-order term for the OClO SCD dependency on wavelength and accounting for the BrO absorption.We investigate the performance of different retrieval settings by an error analysis with respect to random variations, large-scale systematic variations as a function of solar zenith angle and also more localized systematic variations by a novel application of an autocorrelation analysis.The retrieved TROPOMI OClO SCDs show a very good agreement with ground-based zenith sky measurements and are correlated well with preliminary data of the operational TROPOMI OClO retrieval algorithm currently being developed as part of ESA's Sentinel-5P+ Innovation project.

While dermally invasive MCC is known to have a five-year survival of only 30-40%, the prognosis and management of MCC in situ (MCCis) is not widely reported.Objective: We present a systematic review to elucidate the prognosis and management of MCCis.Methods: We performed a systematic review, searching three databases to 01 June 2021. Case reports, cohort studies, clinical trials and literature reviews were considered for inclusion.Results: We identified 26 cases of MCCis published in the literature with a median age of 74 years and involving 19 males and 7 females. Most cases were on the face and neck (n = 17), followed by upper limb (n = 8) and lower limb (n = 1). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in three patients, and all were negative. One subject underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. No MCCis-associated deaths were reported.Conclusion: This review suggests that MCCis has an excellent prognosis with minimal, if any, risk of mortality and a very low risk of dermal invasion and recurrence when treated with wide local excision alone. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is unlikely to be useful for MCCis.

TI  - Satellite altimetry for Indian reservoirs
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimetry has immense potential for monitoring fresh surface water resources and predicting the intra-seasonal, seasonal, and inter-annual variability of inundated surface water over large river basins. As part of the Preparation for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission scheduled for launch in mid-2022, the present study aimed to evaluate the performance of radar altimetry over the inland water bodies of India. The Joint Altimetry Satellite Oceanography Network (Jason) and Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL/AltiKa) data were used to derive the water levels of 18 major reservoirs in India by incorporating the geophysical and propagation corrections into the radar range. In situ gauge data were used to evaluate the performance of the altimetry-derived water level time series from 2008 to 2019. The results showed a strong correlation between Jason-2 and in situ data with the determination coefficient (R-2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 and from 0.28 m to 1.62 m, respectively. The Jason-3 data had the highest correlation with the in situ observation (R-2 = 0.99) and the lowest correlation (R-2 = 0.82), with RMSE values ranging from 0.11 m to 1.18 m. With an R-2 range of 0.93-0.99 and an RMSE range of 0.20-1.05 m, the SARAL/AltiKa mission presented greater accuracy than the Jason altimetry mission. The estimated water levels can be utilized in remote, inaccessible, or ungauged areas and in international transboundary rivers for water storage and river discharge estimations. However, the accuracy of remotely sensed data depends on such factors as along-track distance, water body area, and geographical and terrain conditions near water bodies. (C) 2021 Hohai University.

TI  - River ice phenology and thickness from satellite altimetry: potential for ice bridge road operation and climate studies
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice is a key component of the cryosphere. Satellite monitoring of river ice is a rapidly developing area of scientific enquiry, which has wide-ranging implications for climate, environmental and socioeconomic applications. Spaceborne radar altimetry is widely used for monitoring river water regimes; however, its potential for the observation of river ice processes and properties has not been demonstrated yet. Using Ku-band backscatter measurements from the Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions (2008-2019), we demonstrate the potential of radar altimetry for the retrieval of river ice phenology dates and ice thickness for the first time. The altimetric measurements were determined to be sensitive enough to detect the first appearance of ice and the beginning of thermal breakup on the lower Ob River (Western Siberia). The uncertainties in the retrieval of ice event timing were within the 10 d repeat cycle of Jason-2 and Jason-3 in 88 %-90 % of the cases analysed. The uncertainties in the river ice thickness retrievals made via empirical relations between the satellite backscatter measurements and in situ observations, expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE), were of 0.07-0.18 m. A novel application of radar altimetry is the prediction of ice bridge road operations, which is demonstrated herein. We established that the dates of ferry closing and ice road opening and closing in the city of Salekhard can be predicted with an accuracy (expressed as RMSE) of 3-5 d.

TI  - Assessment of Vegetation Phenological Extractions Derived From Three Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indices Based on Different Extraction Algorithms Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing phenology retrieval can remedy the deficiencies in field investigations and has the advantage of catching the continuous characteristics of phenology on a large scale. However, there are some discrepancies in the results of remote sensing phenological metrics derived from different vegetation indices based on different extraction algorithms, and there are few studies that evaluate the impact of different vegetation indices on phenological metrics extraction. In this study, three satellite-derived vegetation indices (enhanced vegetation index, EVI; normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; and normalized difference phenology index, NDPI; calculated using surface reflectance data from MOD09A1) and two algorithms were used to detect the start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Then, the retrieved SOS and EOS were evaluated from different aspects. Results showed that the missing rates of both SOS and EOS based on the Seasonal Trend Decomposition by LOESS (STL) trendline crossing method were higher than those based on the seasonal amplitude method (SA), and the missing rate varied using different vegetation indices among different vegetation types. Also, the temporal and spatial stabilities of phenological metrics based on SA using EVI or NDPI were more stable than those from others. The accuracy assessment based on ground observations showed that phenological metrics based on SA had better agreements with ground observations than those based on STL, and EVI or NDVI may be more appropriate for monitoring SOS than NDPI in the TP, while EOS from NDPI had better agreements with ground-observed EOS. Besides, the phenological metrics over the complex terrain also presented worse performances than those over the flat terrain. Our findings suggest that previous results of inter-annual variability of phenology from a single data or method should be treated with caution.

TI  - Highly diluted bioactive compounds in marine aquaculture: A potential alternative for sustainable production
T2  - REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Highly diluted bioactive compounds (HDBC) and highly diluted immunomodulatory compounds (HDIC) are treatments that cover a wide variety of concentrations, starting from molar to yoctomolar concentrations or even lower where the presence of nanoparticles has been detected. The prophylactic use of these compounds has improved nutrition, growth, overall condition, defence mechanisms regulation and increased marine organism survival during challenge against pathogens. The HDBC used in marine organisms are formulated from Vibrio spp. lysates, sodium metasilicates, phosphoric acid and highly diluted drugs for humans as Silicea terra(R), Phosphoricum acidum(R), Passival(R) and VidatoX(R), as well as homotoxic Heel(R) complexes. Because HDBC are innocuous, inexpensive and easy to use by immersion or ingestion, they have been proposed as a potential sustainable alternative to improve marine organism production under hatchery conditions and reduce the use of chemotherapy, including antibiotics and disinfectants. Nonetheless, articles documenting their mode of action (biological process and metabolic pathways activated) are scarce. Some studies have proposed that certain HDBC activate the sentinel system of marine organisms, such as non-self-recognition and endocytosis mechanisms without completely activating the immune defence mechanisms. This contribution brings a new insight on increasing productivity and cost effectiveness during hatchery operations and at the same time strengthening the immune system response and survival of marine organisms against infections. Therefore, this review discusses and analyses published results of HDBC in species of commercial importance worldwide and also emerging species of interest for aquaculture reared in Mexico.

TI  - Time series analysis and spatial distribution map of aggregate risk index due to tropospheric NO<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>3</sub> based on satellite observation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A high increase in human activities has led to more emission of air pollutants in metropolises and industrial areas. Recently, remotely sensed data of tropospheric pollutants is used for environmental management and decision-making on large scale. The purpose of this study was a time series analysis of nitrogen dioxide Vertical Column Density (NO2 VCD) and Ozone (O3) using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) from 2005 to 2016 by Mann-Kendall test. Also, the aggregate risk index (ARI) was calculated to estimate the overall impact of exposure to tropospheric NO2 and O3 concentrations at the national scale in 2016. To estimate the surface NO2 related drivers, The Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network modeling was performed for different months of 2016. Results of Mann-Kendall test showed that tropospheric ozone concentration had an increasing trend in all parts of Iran and this increasing trend was significantly higher in the southern region of Iran and lower in the northern parts of Iran. NO2 VCD in most parts of Iran had a significant increasing trend. The result of sensitivity analysis showed that NO2 VCD (1.25), the distance to the industrial area, (1.20) and wind speed (1.07) were the most important variables for the estimation of surface NO2 concentration. Spatial ARI with the highest risks is mainly located in the Northern half of Iran, especially in Tehran, Alborz, and Khorasan-e- Razavi provinces, where NO2 and O3 concentrations are very severe. In northern Iran and central cities, the ARI values are calculated from 1.5 to 2.08, indicating the highest human health risks in these regions. The human health risks based on OMI observation were obtained higher in comparison to AQM data because the satellite data coverage is larger than AQM station and monitors transmitted air pollution by the wind in addition to local pollution. Based on this research, using satellite observation for air quality monitoring is a suitable tool for environmental management on a national scale.

TI  - Biophysical constraints on evapotranspiration partitioning for a conductance-based two source energy balance model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an indispensable role in water-carbon-energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere. Biophysical constraints like the canopy conductance lie the key to accurate prediction of plant transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (E) in ET models. Given the lack of comprehensive evaluation for resistances network in conductance-based two source energy balance model (TSEB), three scenarios (Gc-TSEBO, GcTSEBOSM, and Gc-TSEBSWC) were assessed on the frame of Gc-TSEB: one relying on Jarvis canopy conductance, other on optimal stomatal behavior, and other on soil moisture content, with forcing data from MODIS datasets and in-situ FLUXNET sites over six biome types. The ET simulated by the model combined with the optimal stomatal behavior and the complementary concept had higher values of R2 and Taylor skill scores, lower values of RMSE and BIAS, than the other two scenarios, particularly over cropland sites and arid/semi-arid sites where the other two failed. The sensitivity analysis for Gc-TSEB resistances elucidated that the effect of canopy conductance is more noticeable on ET simulation than the other resistances. When effective biophysical constraints on the canopy are lacking, a large deviation exists in ET partitioning mainly due to the systematic error of soil evaporation through the partitioning algorithm for soil and plant fluxes. We assessed the performance of calibration from MODIS land surface temperature (LST) instead of flux data. The LST-calibrated model performed better in croplands and grasslands compared to forest sites, which opens a good perspective to advance the model for operational applications in agriculture and herbaceous vegetation.

TI  - A dynamic connectivity metric for complex river wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water connectivity between rivers and floodplain lakes is essential to maintain biodiversity and ecological functioning in floodplain wetlands. This study proposes a method to analyze the spatial and temporal connectivity using hydraulic modeling and freely available remote sensing data. A novel dynamic connectivity metric introduced here accounts for the entire flow path, which can be a substitute for flow connectivity indicators and statistical connectivity indicators. The metric allows comparing the hydrological connectivity between different phases of a flood event, between different flood events, and potentially between different catchments. The method was applied to the Northern Lakes of the Narran River catchment in New South Wales, Australia. The results indicate that there is no clear transition in the connectivity between different stages of a flood event in the flat Narran River wetland compared with other wetlands connecting to deeper river channels. Thus, the proposed metric brings a more comprehensive observation on hydrological connectivity in floodplain wetlands than previously developed metrics, which is expected to further support ecological and water management studies in river catchments.

TI  - Estimation of evapotranspiration of "soil-vegetation" system with a scheme combining a dual-source model and satellite data assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable linking the energy and water exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere. The strong energy exchanges between the soil and vegetation in the "soil-vegetation" system and the lack of reliable soil moisture products at fine spatial scales, especially for root zone soil moisture, to directly model the effects of water stress on ET estimates, make it difficult to estimate actual ET and its components (soil evaporation Es, vegetation transpiration Tc and rainfall interception Ei). In this paper, we presented a "SoilVegetation" EvapoTranspiration framework (SVET) by combining the dual-source Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) physical model and satellite soil moisture data assimilation procedure. In the SVET model, net radiation for the soil-vegetation system was first partitioned among soil evaporation, vegetation transpiration and rainfall interception; then, soil moisture was simulated for different soil layers based on the water balance, providing a first guess estimate of soil moisture; after that, simulated soil moisture was improved by assimilating remotely sensed surface soil moisture to reduce the uncertainty of the simulated soil moisture; finally, Es, Tc and Ei estimates were obtained. The ET estimates by the SVET were evaluated against in situ measurements at three stations in the Heihe River Basin with different vegetation cover types (crop, grassland and forest). The overall correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias were 0.931, 0.67 mm d-1 and 0. 07 mm d-1, respectively. For the ET components, the bias of the estimated ratio of Tc/(Es + Tc) is -11.4%. In addition, the SVET model showed outstanding performance, especially over irrigated areas, compared with the results from the original SW model without a soil moisture data assimilation scheme. The SVET model is very promising for applications of water use monitoring of ecosystem, especially for irrigated areas.

TI  - Tracking aerosols and SO<sub>2</sub> clouds from the Raikoke eruption: 3D view from satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The 21 June 2019 eruption of the Raikoke volcano (Kuril Islands, Russia; 48 degrees N, 153 degrees E) produced significant amounts of volcanic aerosols (sulfate and ash) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas that penetrated into the lower stratosphere. The dispersed SO2 and sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere were still detectable by multiple satellite sensors for many months after the eruption. For this study of SO2 and aerosol clouds we use data obtained from two of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite sensors on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite: total column SO2 from the Nadir Mapper and aerosol extinction profiles from the Limb Profiler as well as other satellite data sets. We evaluated the limb viewing geometry effect (the "arch effect") in the retrieval of the LP standard aerosol extinction product at 674 nm. It was shown that the amount of SO2 decreases with a characteristic period of 8-18 d and the peak of stratospheric aerosol optical depth recorded at a wavelength of 674 nm lags the initial peak of SO2 mass by 1.5 months. Using satellite observations and a trajectory model, we examined the dynamics of an unusual atmospheric feature that was observed, a stratospheric coherent circular cloud of SO2 and aerosol from 18 July to 22 September 2019.

TI  - A comparative study of atmospheric and water column correction using various algorithms on Landsat imagery to identify Coral Reefs
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral Reefs are vital ecosystems as they support a vast population of aquatic life and help in maintaining biodiversity. Currently, these ecosystems are under severe threat due to rising ocean temperatures and contaminated surroundings. Hence, Coral Reefs need to be monitored regularly to study their health and protect them in a better way. Remote detection and assessment of Coral Reefs using satellite data would significantly enhance the reach and ensure continuous Coral Reef monitoring. The spectral signature of the Coral Reefs captured by the satellite sensor could be a great asset in this process. Still, these signatures are heavily dopped with several unwanted noise signals coming from various surface and atmospheric features. It is essential to remove these noise signals from the satellite data. This paper studied the effectiveness of different available atmospheric correction methods such as QUAC, 6S, and FLAASH Atmospheric correction tools (ACT) in removing atmospheric noise and studied the impact of sun glint and water column correction on improving remote detection of Coral Reefs. As a case study, these processes were applied on Landsat ETM+ to study the abundant Coral habitat near the North Reef Island at the Andaman Islands. The results indicated that FLAASH is the best atmospheric correction tool among the selected algorithms as FLAASH corrected image facilitated better identification of Coral Reefs. Hence this image was further enhanced using the Hedley sun glint and Lyzenga water column correction methods which improved Coral Reef detectability significantly. The detection of Corals from the image was done using ISO-DATA unsupervised classification to evaluate the role of each process in enhancing the Coral detection. Visual inspection was used to assess the classifier accuracy towards Coral reef detection. The results showed that a combination of FLAASH, sun glint removal, and water column correction significantly improved Coral Reef identification from the remote sensing data. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A method to extract cyanobacteria blooms from satellite imagery with no requirements for any prior atmospheric correction or cloud-masking
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Chaohu has been suffering from harmful cyanobacteria blooms, while the clouds pixels in satellite images are usually mistaken as cyanobacteria blooms by some traditional indicators, leading to the need for cloud masking in advance. In addition, atmospheric correction is another challenge due to lack of a general atmospheric correction method and the difficulties in evaluating its accuracy without in situ investigations. Fortunately, tasseled cap transformation (TCT) allows to extract vegetation properties directly from satellite imagery digital numbers (DN), which provides a perspective for extracting cyanobacteria blooms independent from atmospheric correction. This study focuses on how to use TCT to establish an indicator, which allows to extract cyanobacteria blooms directly from image DN values without conducting any atmospheric correction or cloud-masking. Training and test sets containing over 200,000 pixels are constructed from 18 Sentinel-2A/B MSI images acquired in different seasons in recent three years. Four components are derived from TCT and they could form up to 81 linear combinations. Experimental results performed on the training set show that the candidate, which combines the last three components with the coefficients of 1,-1 and 0, assigns cyanobacteria blooms pixels in a completely separated value range from water, cloud, cloud shadow and cloud edge pixels. The candidate is defined as ICW3C index. Its threshold value range of (175 330) is given and the pixels with ICW3C values greater than its threshold could be classified as cyanobacteria blooms. Comparisons between ICW3C and the floating algae index (FAI) on the test set show that ICW3C misclassifies 0.02% of cloud pixels and 1.55% of yellow cloud edge pixels as cyanobacteria blooms, however, 19.18% clouds, 13.74% yellow cloud edges and 19.34% blue-green cloud edges are incorrectly identified as cyanobacteria blooms by FAI. Comparisons between ICW3C and FAI performed on image regions over time show that, in clear-sky regions with cyanobacteria blooms, FAI extracts 5.81% more pixels, which mainly lay in the edge of cyanobacteria blooms. In cloud-covered image regions without cyanobacteria blooms, FAI misclassifies over 608 times as many cloud and cloud edge pixels as ICW3C. Sensitivity test results suggest that the change of ICW3C threshold within its value range (175 330) will not lead to serious increase in misclassification, and ICW3C performs stable to variations of viewing geometry. Extension tests indicate that ICW3C is applicable for several other sensors. Further researches are still needed to test whether ICW3C is suitable for other inland lakes or seas.

TI  - Study of Ground Movement in a Mining Area with Geological Faults Using FDM Analysis and a Stacking InSAR Method
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal mining activities and ground movement are directly correlated, and coal mining-induced ground movement can cause damage to property and resources, thus its monitoring is essential for the safety and economics of a city. Fangezhuang coal mine is one of the largest coalfields in operation in Tangshan, China. The enormous amount of coal extraction has resulted in significant ground movement over the years. These phenomena have produced severe damages to the local infrastructure. This paper uses the finite difference method (FDM) 3D model and the stacking interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method to monitor the ground movement in Fangezhuang coalfield during 2016. The FDM 3D model used calibrated Fangezhuang geological parameters and the satellite InSAR analysis involved the use of ascending C-band Sentinel-1A interferometric wide (IW) data for 2016. The results show that the most prominent subsidence signal occurs in mining panel 2553N and the area between panel 2553N and fault F0 with subsidence up to 57 cm. The subsidence observed for the FDM 3D model and stacking InSAR to monitor land deformation under the influence of fault are in close agreement and were verified using a two-sample t-test. It was observed that the maximum subsidence point shifted towards the fault location from the centre of the mining panel. The tectonic fault F0 was found to be reactivated by the coal mining and controls the spatial extent of the observed ground movement. The impact of dominant geological faults on local subsidence boundaries is investigated in details. It is concluded that ground movement in the study area was mainly induced by mining activities, with its spatial pattern being controlled by geological faults. These results highlight that the two methods are capable of measuring mining induced ground movement in fault dominated areas. The study will improve the understanding of subsidence control, and aid in developing preventive measures in Fangezhuang coalfield with fault reactivation.

TI  - Developments in bioprocess for bacterial cellulose production
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) represents a novel bio-origin nonomaterial with its unique properties having diverse applications. Increased market demand and low yield are the major reason for its higher cost. Bacteria belonging to Komagataeibacter sp are the most exploited ones for BC production. Development of a cost-effective bioprocess for higher BC production is desirable. Though static fermentation modes have been majorly employed for BC production using tray fermenters, agitated mode has also been employed successfully with air-lift fermenters as well as stirred tank reactors. Bioprocess advances in recent years has led BC production to an upper level; however, challenges of aeration requirement and labor cost towards the higher end is associated with static cultivation at large scale. We have discussed the bioprocess development for BC production in recent years along with the challenges associated and the path forward.

TI  - Evaluating the Street Greening with the Multiview Data Fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Street greening, an indispensable element of urban green spaces, has played an important role in beautifying the environment, alleviating the urban heat island effect, and improving residents' comfort. Vegetation coverage is a common index used for measuring street greening. However, there are some shortcomings in the traditional evaluation methods of vegetation coverage. Part of the vegetation coverage cannot be determined from a two-dimensional perspective, such as shrubs and green walls. In this paper, the Sentinel-2 image was used to extract the street fractional vegetation cover (SFVC) and the Baidu street view panoramas were used to extract the green view index (GVI). To overcome the lack of a single perspective from the street vegetation coverage evaluation, the above two indices were merged to construct a comprehensive street greening evaluation index (CSGEI). The research area is the Longhua District of Shenzhen city in Southern China. All three indices were divided into five classes using natural breakpoint methods based on previous research experience. The results showed that Baidu street view panoramas could effectively identify shrubs and green walls that were deficient in the Sentinel-2 image. The GVI is a supplement to the street vegetation coverage. The SFVC and GVI were divided into five classes, from L1 to L5 implying a gradual increase in the percentage of the vegetated area. The result has shown that the SFVC was in the L1, accounting for 53.68%. After index merging, the process of accounting for the L1 decreased to 31.29%. The multiperspective integrated CSGEI could comprehensively measure the distribution information of street greening and guide the planning and management of urban green landscapes.

M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve the elimination of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), sustained and sufficient levels of HCV testing is critical. The purpose of this study was to assess trends in testing and evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to diagnose people living with HCV. Data were from 12 primary care clinics in Victoria, Australia, that provide targeted services to people who inject drugs (PWID), alongside general health care. This ecological study spanned 2009-2019 and included analyses of trends in annual numbers of HCV antibody tests among individuals with no previous positive HCV antibody test recorded and annual test yield (positive HCV antibody tests/all HCV antibody tests). Generalised linear models estimated the association between count outcomes (HCV antibody tests and positive HCV antibody tests) and time, and chi(2) test assessed the trend in test yield. A total of 44 889 HCV antibody tests were conducted 2009-2019; test numbers increased 6% annually on average [95% confidence interval (CI) 4-9]. Test yield declined from 2009 (21%) to 2019 (9%) (chi P-2 = <0.01). In more recent years (2013-2019) annual test yield remained relatively stable. Modest increases in HCV antibody testing and stable but high test yield within clinics delivering services to PWID highlights testing strategies are resulting in people are being diagnosed however further increases in the testing of people at risk of HCV or living with HCV may be needed to reach Australia's HCV elimination goals.

TI  - New method improves extraction accuracy of lake water bodies in Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems and have a significant impact on human production and life. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor changes in lakes. Several studies have been conducted pertaining to extraction of lake bodies using optical remote sensing images; however, owing to the influence of ice and snow in the lake and other parameters such as noise, the accuracy and stability of lake extraction still need to be improved. This study designed a new method by combing K-means clustering and the flood fill method (KCFFM) to improve the accuracy and stability of extraction results from complex backgrounds. Using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for five lakes in Central Asia, the accuracy and stability of KCFFM in summer and winter were evaluated and compared with those of five other methods. KCFFM showed the highest accuracy and stability among all the methods, especially during the lake ice period. For KCFFM, the Kappa coefficient was greater than 0.97 and 0.92 and the overall accuracy was greater than 99% and 98% in summer and winter, respectively. The area error rate of KCFFM was less than 3%, except for Lake Alakol (less than 10%). In addition, KCFFM significantly decreased the area error rate compared to other methods (1% to 15% in summer and 10% to 50% in winter). The proposed method optimized the time continuity, accuracy, and stability of lake body extraction. Thus, KCFFM can provide valuable basic data for monitoring lake water bodies.

AB  - Since decades ago, the Lower Cheliff plain is under the continuous influence of soil salinization induced by mismanagement of the groundwater resources. The main purpose of this study was to estimate and map soil salinity using both Salinity Index (SI) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In doing so, a total of 796 soil samples of Electrical Conductivity (EC, dS.m(-1)) measured in laboratory combined to spectral parameters data of Landsat-8 OLI, by applying a Salinity Index (SI) and used also to training the ANN model (80% of total data), the rest of the dataset (20%) was retained for validation with both methods. The results of applying an ANN estimator based on the reflectance values of three bands: green (B3), red (B4) and near-infrared (B5) as learning input neurons, proved their interest in the estimation of EC given a high determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.80) between the values of simulated truth and ground, compared to the results obtained using only the SI method giving a moderate precision (R-2 = 0.42). Regarding the soil salinity mapping, the two methods generated contrasting results, the SI estimates that 68.5% of the total area is affected by salinity (underestimation) meanwhile the ANN gave an estimation of 78.8%. In a conclusion, the estimation and mapping of soil salinity using the SI method has been upgraded significantly when ANN was involved.

AB  - Evidence on a comprehensive greenspace exposure assessment on primary school children is scarce yet. Therefore, we aimed to assess a comprehensive greenspace exposure on primary school children and their behavioral function. We assessed different aspects of exposure to greenspace as well as behavioral function in 704 primary school children in Sabzevar, Iran, during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., 22 September 2020 to 10 March 2021). The greenspace indicators were including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in 100, 300 and 500m buffers around children's homes based on Landsat 8 images with 30 x 30 m resolution, residential proximity to green space based on the Euclidean distance of the geocoded residential address to (i) the nearest green space of any area and (ii) the nearest green space with an area of at least 5000m(2) (i.e., major green space) based on land use map of the study area, time spent in public and private green spaces, number of plant pots at home and visual access to greenspace based on a prepared questionnaire. The behavioral development of primary school children was assessed using a Persian online validated version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) filled by parents.

T2  - LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fortification of yogurt with natural herbs to improve its nutritional and health benefit are an emerging trend. Hot infusions of Nyctanthes abo-tristis flowers are a traditionally used herb against diabetes. This study was designed to develop a novel yogurt fortified (FY) with 3, 3.5, and 6% N.arbor-tristis flower extract (NFE) to determine its suitability as a fortifier en route to innovative functional products. Upon fermentation, the highest sensory scores were obtained for the 3.5% NFE-FY with 11-, 6-, 3-fold higher antiglycation (NFE-IC50: 28.04 +/- 1.13 mu g/mL and 3.5% NFE-FY IC50: 46.80 +/- 0.92 mu g/mL) activity, free radical scavenging potentials, and total phenolic content, respectively. An improvement of texture profile values was observed in 3.5% NFE-FY compared to the control with 3.00 +/- 0.1% fat, 3.88 +/- 0.23% crude protein, 77.94 +/- 0.09 moisture, 14.97 +/- 0.27 total soluble solids, and 0.7637 +/- 0.03 ash. The 3.5%NEF-FY also exhibited a longer shelf life and less microbial growth than the control. The GC-MS analysis of the NFE indicated the presence of phytochemicals essential for the observed bioactivity. The results confirmed that the N.arbor-tristis flower extract increased the overall quality of the yogurt and tested bioactivity. NFE-FY could be used in yogurt production to optimize the health benefits with improved functional characteristics to prevent diet-driven glycation activity.

TI  - Non-Operative Shoulder Dysfunction in the United States Military
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction Recent epidemiological evidence shows that shoulder and upper-arm complaints impose a substantial burden on the armed forces of the United States and create significant challenges for all components of the physical fitness domain of total force fitness. Clinicians, epidemiologists, and health-services researchers interested in shoulder and upper-arm injuries and their functional limitations rarely have objective, validated criteria for rigorously evaluating diagnostic practices, prescribed treatments, or the outcomes of alternative approaches. We sought to establish and quantify patient volume, types of care, and costs within the Military Health System (MHS) in assessing and managing active duty members with nonoperative shoulder and upper-arm dysfunction. Materials and Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the MHS Data Repository and MHS MART (M2) from fiscal year 2014 to identify active duty individuals with a diagnosis of shoulder and upper-arm injury or impairment defined by one of the International Classification of Disease Ninth Edition diagnosis codes that were selected to reflect nonoperative conditions such as fractures or infections. Statistical analyses include descriptive statistics on patient demographics and clinical visits, such as the range and frequency of diagnoses, number and types of appointments, and clinical procedure information following the diagnosis. We also examined treatment costs related to shoulder dysfunction and calculated the total cost to include medications, radiological, procedural, and laboratory test costs for all shoulder dysfunction visits in 2014 and the average cost for each visit. We further examined the category of each medication prescribed. Results A total of 55,643 individuals met study criteria and accrued 193,455 shoulder-dysfunction-related clinical visits in fiscal year 2014. This cohort represents approximately 4.8% of the 1,155,183 active duty service members assigned to the United States and its territories during FY 2014. Most patients were male (85.32%), younger (85.25% were under 40 years old), and Caucasian/White (71.12%). The most common diagnosis code was 719.41 (pain in joint, shoulder region; 42.48%). The majority of the patients 42,750 (76.8%) had four or fewer medical visits during the study period and 12,893 (23.2%) had more than four visits. A total of 4,733 patients (8.5%) underwent arthrocentesis aspiration or injection. The total cost for all visits was $65,066,767.89. The average and median cost for each visit were $336.34 (standard deviation was $1,493.87) and $163.11 (range was from 0 to $84,183.88), respectively. Three out of four patients (75.3%) underwent radiological examinations, and 74.2% of these individuals had more than one radiological examination. Medications were prescribed to 50,610 (91.0%) patients with the three most common being IBUPROFEN (12.21%), NAPROXEN (8.51%), and OXYCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN (5.04%), respectively. Conclusions Nearly 1 in 20 active duty military service members presented for nonoperative care of shoulder and/or upper-arm dysfunction during FY2014. Further examinations of the etiology and potential impact of shoulder/upper-arm dysfunction on force readiness are clearly warranted, as are additional studies directed at identifying best practices for preventing injury-related dysfunction and determining best practices for the treatment of shoulder dysfunction to optimize service member fitness and force readiness.

TI  - Land cover change detection in the Aralkum with multi-source satellite datasets
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest freshwater lake on Earth, has lost circa 90% of its original water surface in 1960. Maps of different land cover categories provide a suitable baseline to plan and implement effective measures to combat ongoing desertification, such as reforestation of dried out Aral Sea soils. In this study, we used satellite-based remote sensing data and applied a machine learning method (Random Forest) to map land cover in the Aralkum in 2020. We tested different satellite data from optical (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2) and Radar instruments (Sentinel-1) and trained a random forest model for classifying different combinations of these data sets into ten distinct land cover classes. We further calculated per-pixel uncertainty based on posterior classification probability scores. An accuracy assessment, based on in-situ data, revealed that the average overall accuracy of land cover maps was 86.8%. Fusing optical and radar instruments achieved the highest overall accuracy (88.8%, with lower/higher 95% confidence interval values of 87.6%/89.9%, and a Kappa value of 0.865. Classification uncertainty was lower in more homogeneous landscapes (i.e. large expanses of a single land cover class like water or shrubland). Only around 9% of the study area was still water in 2020, while 32% was covered by saline soils with high erosion risk. Several potential applications of this land cover map in the Aralkum exist - spanning many areas of environmental impact assessment, policy, and planning and management or afforestation. This methodological framework can similarly provide a useful template for more broadly assessing large-scale, land dynamics at high-resolution in the entire Aralkum and surrounding areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mid-western China is one of the most sensitive and fragile areas on the Earth. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key part of hydrological cycle in these areas and is affected by both global climate change and human activities. The dynamic changes in ET and potential evapotranspiration (PET), which can reflect water consumption and demand, are still unclear, and there is a lack of predictive capacity on drought severity. In this study, we used global MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) terrestrial ET (MOD16) products, Morlet wavelet analysis, and simple linear regression to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of ET, PET, reference ET (ET0), and aridity index (AI) in mid-western pastoral regions of China (including Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that the overall ET gradually increased from east to southwest in the study area. Actual ET showed an increasing trend, whereas PET tended to decrease from 2001 to 2016. The change in ET was affected by vegetation types. During the study period, the average annual ET0 and AI tended to decrease. At the monthly scale within a year, AI value decreased from January to July and then increased. The interannual variations of ET0 and AI showed periodicity with a main period of 14 a, and two other periodicities of 11 and 5 a. This study showed that in recent years, drought in these pastoral regions of mid-western China has been alleviated. Therefore, it is foreseeable that the demand for irrigation water for agricultural production in these regions will decrease.

TI  - Uplift of the surface of the earth above abandoned coal mines. Part A: Analysis of satellite data related to the movement of the surface
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - After the closure of several coal fields in Europe at the end of the 20th century, a new phenomenon in the field of strata or ground control was observed above abandoned coal mines, i.e., the upward movement or uplift of the surface. This also was observed above the Eisden mine in the eastern part of the Belgian Campine coal basin. The uplift was measured above the area mined by the longwall method and its surroundings, and it is linked to the flooding of the underground infrastructure and the surrounding rock mass. A detailed analysis of Interferometry with Synthetic Aperture Radar data showed the complexity of this phenomenon. There was a large spatial variation of uplift values, but there also was a variation as a function of time. At the start of the observation (about four years after the mine was closed), the average uplift rates were characterized by a wide spread of values, e.g., in a sub-area of 1 km(2). Afterwards, the range of the values narrowed somewhat, and the rate of uplift decreased during the 20-year period of the study. For the central area, the uplift averaged about 22 mm/year during the first half of the observation time, and it averaged about 10 mm/year for the second half. Along a north-south transect, the shape of the curve of the uplift values could be best approximated by an inverse trough. However, the curve was not fully symmetrical. The extent of the zone of influence was several times larger than the depth of the longwall panels.

TI  - Axillary Recurrence in Breast Cancer Patients After Negative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Retrospective Cohort Study From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is among the most prevalent cancers globally. For minimally invasive axillary staging in early breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is commonly regarded as the gold standard. Historically, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was used as a staging procedure, but the less morbid SLNB has now replaced it. This retrospective cohort study, undertaken with patients at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, evaluates mid-term follow-up data on axillary recurrences and outcomes for breast cancer patients with negative SLNB. The results indicate that the five-year risk of developing regional recurrence following negative SLNB is 0% in breast cancer patients. The low relapse rate further contributes to the evidence base suggesting the efficacy of SLNB and the higher morbidity associated with ALND. Future researchers should conduct a nationwide and long-term follow-up study to offer additional insights into the efficacy of SLNB.

TI  - Validating a New GNSS-Based Sea Level Instrument (CalNaGeo) at Senetosa Cape
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The geodetic Corsica site was set up in 1998 in order to perform altimeter calibration of the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) mission and subsequently, Jason-1, OSTM/Jason-2, Jason-3 and more recently Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (launched on November, 21 2020). The aim of the present study held in June 2015 is to validate a recently developed GNSS-based sea level instrument (called CalNaGeo) that is designed with the intention to map Sea Surface Heights (SSH) over large areas. This has been undertaken using the well-defined geodetic infrastructure deployed at Senetosa Cape, and involved the estimation of the stability of the waterline (and thus the instantaneous separation of a GNSS antenna from water level) as a function of the velocity at which the instrument is towed. The results show a largely linear relationship which is approximately 1 mm/(m/s) up to a maximum practical towing speed of similar to 10 knots (similar to 5 m/s). By comparing to the existing "geoid" map, it is also demonstrated that CalNaGeo can measure a sea surface slope with a precision better than 1 mm/km (similar to 2.5% of the physical slope). Different processing techniques are used and compared including GNSS Precise Point Positioning (PPP, where the goal is to extend SSH mapping far from coastal GNSS reference stations) showing an agreement at the 1-2 cm level.

TI  - Assessment of the impact of dust aerosols on crop and water loss in the Great Salt Desert in Iran
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial distribution of dust aerosols and their effects on crops is important for policy formulation and food security. This study aims to investigate the impact of dust source susceptibility areas (DSSA) on the loss of agricultural crop and corresponding water consumption in terms of Water Footprint in the Great Salt Desert, Iran. To this goal, MODIS satellite images during the 2005-2020 period were used to identify dust sources and 135 dust source zones were identified. Machine learning algorithm viz. Random Forest (RF), generalized linear model (GLM), and Artificial neural network (ANN) were tested to reproduce DSSA. The best method was RF and applied to calculate and classify DSSA in five risk levels from very low to very high. The amount of wheat production under high risk of DSSA was estimated using the average crop yield from recent years using agriculture statistics. We calculated the loss of crops and corresponding water consumption for three scenarios, assuming a typical loss of 20, 40, and 60% of the wheat production for better crop loss estimation. Finally, the spatial relationships between wheat farmland and high-risk DSSA were assessed using ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) at sub-watershed scale. The area of wheat cultivation in high and very high risk of DSSA is 10188.04 km(2), which is 36% of all agricultural land for wheat in the region. Loss of wheat crop to DSSA meant that 1270.58 to 3811 million m(3) water used for the production of wheat were lost, corresponding to 2%, to 7% of lost water compared to the total water consumption for wheat production in the study area.

TI  - Surface Temperature trends in the Mediterranean Sea from MODIS data during years 2003-2019
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea Surface Temperature is a variable recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS), due to its determinant influence on climate dynamics, from micro scale to global levels The aim of this paper is to estimate Sea Surface Temperature trends in the Mediterranean Sea during years 2003-2019 by using the MODIS Level 3 SST Thermal IR 8 Day 4km V2019.0. Results show an SST increase of 0.040 +/- 0.001 degrees C/yr. The seasonal maximum trend is associated to summer 0.070 +/- 0.001 degrees C/yr, followed by winter, (0.040 +/- 0.001) degrees C/yr, autumn 0.030 +/- 0.001 degrees C/yr and spring, 0.020 +/- 0.001 degrees C/yr. The total period analyzed has been divided into ten-year time spans, showing a stable increase of 0.055 degrees C/yr in average, from period 2005-2014 onwards. In absolute SST values terms, the parameter range is of 0.85 degrees C from year 2005 to 2019. We have also analyzed the spatial variability of the parameter by dividing the Mediterranean Sea into nine sub-basins: Alboran Sea, Balearic Sea (Iberian Sea), Mediterranean Western Basin, Mediterranean Eastern Basin, Ligurian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea and Aegean Sea. The results show warming trends from 0.02 degrees C/yr for the Alboran Sea to 0.07 degrees C/yr for the Adriatic Sea. Results have been validated by using data from a local observational buoy system, obtaining a coefficient of determination of 0.97. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Intercomparison of middle atmospheric meteorological analyses for the Northern Hemisphere winter 2009-2010
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed meteorological analyses based on observations extending through the middle atmosphere (similar to 15 to 100 km altitude) can provide key information to whole atmosphere modeling systems regarding the physical mechanisms linking day-to-day changes in ionospheric electron density to meteorological variability near the Earth's surface. However, the extent to which independent middle atmosphere analyses differ in their representation of wave-induced coupling to the ionosphere is unclear. To begin to address this issue, we present the first intercomparison among four such analyses, JAGUAR-DAS, MERRA-2, NAVGEM-HA, and WACCMX+DART, focusing on the Northern Hemisphere (NH) 2009-2010 winter, which includes a major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). This intercomparison examines the altitude, latitude, and time dependences of zonal mean zonal winds and temperatures among these four analyses over the 1 December 2009 to 31 March 2010 period, as well as latitude and altitude dependences of monthly mean amplitudes of the diurnal and semidiurnal migrating solar tides, the eastward-propagating diurnal zonal wave number 3 nonmigrating tide, and traveling planetary waves associated with the quasi-5 d and quasi-2 d Rossby modes. Our results show generally good agreement among the four analyses up to the stratopause (similar to 50 km altitude). Large discrepancies begin to emerge in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere owing to (1) differences in the types of satellite data assimilated by each system and (2) differences in the details of the global atmospheric models used by each analysis system. The results of this intercomparison provide initial estimates of uncertainty in analyses commonly used to constrain middle atmospheric meteorological variability in whole atmosphere model simulations.

TI  - Developing and Validating Novel Nomograms for Predicting the Overall Survival and Cancer-Specific Survival of Patients With Primary Vulvar Squamous Cell Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To develop and validate novel nomograms for better predicting the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with vulvar squamous cell cancer (VSCC).Methods: A retrospective analysis using a population-based database between 2004 and 2016 was carried. A 10-fold cross-validation with 200 repetitions was used to choose the best fit multivariate Cox model based on the net-benefit of decision curve analysis. Net-benefit, Harrell's C concordance statistic (C-statistic) of calibration plot, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the model prediction accuracy. Nomograms of the OS and CSS were generated based on the best fit model.Results: Of the 6,792 patients with VSCC, 5,094 (75%) and 1,698 (25%) were allocated to the training and validation cohort, respectively. All the variables were balanced between the training and validation cohorts. Age, insurance, tumor size, pathological grade, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, invasion depth, lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph nodes biopsy, surgery, N stage, and M stage were in the best fit model for generating nomograms. The decision curve analysis, calibration plot, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve show the better prediction performance of the model compared to previous studies. The C-statistics of our model for OS prediction are 0.80, 0.83, and 0.81 in the training, validation, and overall cohorts, respectively, while for CSS prediction are 0.83, 0.85, and 0.84. The AUCs for 3- and 5-year OS are the same and are 0.81, 0.83, and 0.81 in the training, validation, and overall cohorts, respectively. The AUCs for 3- and 5-year CSS are 0.78 and 0.80, 0.79 and 0.80, and 0.79 and 0.80 in those three cohorts.Conclusions: Our model shows the best prediction accuracy of the OS and CSS for patients with vulvar cancer (VC), which is of significant clinical practice value.

TI  - Combined Use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A Imagery for Improved Sugarcane Yield Estimation in Wonji-Shoa, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a support vector regression (SVR) approach based on a radial basis function was used for estimating sugarcane yield in the Wonji-Shoa sugarcane plantation (Ethiopia) combining Landsat 8 (L8) and sentinel 2A (S2A) data. Vegetation Indices(VIs) involving visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands were calculated from the L8 and S2A sensor observations, and seasonal cumulative values were computed for the period June to October in the 9th month and June to November in the 10th month of the year for 2016/17 to 2018/19 cropping seasons. Sugarcane yield was predicted using the SVR, Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and Multiple linear regression (MLR) methods. Then, a tenfold cross-validation approach was implemented for the performance evaluation. The results showed significant correlations between sugarcane yield and cumulative values of VIs computed during the 10th month in the growing season. The results also revealed that the estimation accuracy of sugarcane was better using the combined L8 and S2A (RMSE = 12.95 t/ha, and MAE = 10.14 t/ha) than using the S2A data alone (RMSE = 14.71 t/ha, and MAE = 12.18 t/ha). Comparing SVR results with MLPNN and MLR disclosed that SVR outperforms the other two models in terms of prediction accuracy. Overall, this study demonstrated the successful application of the SVR in developing a model for Sugarcane yield estimation and it may provide a guideline for improving the estimations of sugarcane in the study area.

TI  - Impact of higher-resolved satellite-based land cover classificatio on near surface wind speed forecasts
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the project "LandCover4Wind", we investigate the potential for improving 24 h mesoscale wind speed forecasts at altitudes of interest for wind energy applications by using different high-resolution satellitebased land cover maps such as the Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC) from the US Geological The Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.9 was run at three different grid resolutions covering a wide range of weather conditions during July and November 2015. We evaluate results by tower measurements at 10, 40 and 98 m altitude for the rural station Falkenberg in the eastern part of Germany characterized by f at and open terrain. We test different conf gurations for model domain horizontal resolution, land cover classif cation (LCC) data, and land surface and boundary layer physics. We discuss the need of transforming native LCC spatial resolution to lower WRF domain grid resolutions and transforming different thematic resolutions in LCC datasets into the less-resolving WRF classes. In general, comparisons show better forecast performance for the stormy November period compared to hot-summer July conditions. Especially, correlations are signif cantly higher in November. All experiments show a positive wind speed bias which changes with altitude, time of day and model conf guration. With respect to LCC, CLC shows the smallest wind speed errors while GLCC performs worst. Two different land surface models NOAH LSM and 5-layer thermal diffusion scheme (5LD) are tested in combination with Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) and Yonsei University (YSU) boundary layer modules. In general NOAH-MYJ performs best with CLC for November conditions, while it gives worst results with MODIS LCC for July conditions. For any given LCC, results depend signif cantly on the WRF land surface and boundary layer physics conf guration and the performance on a daily base varies considerably depending on the test metric and model conf guration. Results show only a weak dependency on domain resolution with increasing biases with increasing resolution. In summary, using a high resolution LCC dataset as the CLC proves to be valuable for wind speed forecasts.

TI  - Untangling the effect of urban vegetation type and structure on spectrally unmixed greenness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of vegetation greenness, such as those derived from spectral unmixing of satellite imagery using a greenness-darkness-brightness model, are crucial for improved mapping and analysis of urban greenspaces and their socio-ecological benefits. Differences in vegetation types and structures can, however, influence how spectral wavelengths are reflected and thus represented through unmixed greenness and darkness fractions. This study untangles the relationship and distribution of sub-pixel greenness and darkness across key structural metrics for coniferous, deciduous, and low vegetation in select Vancouver, Canada greenspaces. We utilized airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to describe structural components of canopy cover, canopy height, rumple index, and vertical variability, which were then analysed with spectrally unmixed greenness and darkness fractions from Landsat satellite imagery and available land cover data. Greenness was linked to vegetation type, whereas darkness was also influenced by structure, especially for conifers. Specifically, tall conifers observed twice as much darkness as greenness, and darkness increased by similar to 30% to match moderate greenness levels of high-coverage deciduous stands. Results correspond to previous work on biophysical differences and shadowing effects from tree crowns. Future greenspace research utilizing spectrally unmixed greenness fractions should be mindful of potential shadowing impacts caused by tall and/or dense vegetation.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy at robotic-assisted hysterectomy for atypical hyperplasia and endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node (LN) evaluation in endometrial cancer is controversial. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) allows for an accurate nodal assessment while minimising the risks of a full pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). The aims of this study are to examine the characteristics and peri-operative outcomes of women with atypical hyperplasia (AH) or endometrial cancer undergoing robotic-assisted hysterectomy (RAH) +/- SLNB or PLND; to examine the utilisation, feasibility and role of SLNB and compare their peri-operative outcomes. Retrospective cohort study from December 2018 to February 2021 of women who underwent RAH +/- LN assessment for endometrial cancer or AH. 115 women underwent RAH. 59% had SLNB, 29% had no LN assessment, and 12% had PLND. The final diagnosis was mostly early stage low-grade disease; Stage 1A-50%, Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC)-56%. The detection rate was 90%. There was a statistically significant trend towards performing SLNB over time (P value 0.004). There was a statistically shorter length of stay, less estimated blood loss, and shorter surgical duration in the SLNB cohort, compared to the no LN assessment cohort (P values 0.02, 0.01, and 0.03, respectively). There was statistically significant less estimated blood loss and surgical duration in the SLNB compared to the PLND cohort (P values 0.03 and 0.001, respectively). SLNB at RAH was utilised and feasible. It was safe with a low complication rate and had advantages compared to PLND cohort. SLNB should be considered in suitable selected women undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer or AH.

TI  - A field sentinel study investigating withering syndrome transmission dynamics in California abalones
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the risk of withering syndrome (WS) rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO) infection in sentinel red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) deployed in modules at two Southern California field sites, one adjacent to an abalone farm and one adjacent to wild abalones. WS-RLO DNA was detected in seawater near modules at the wild abalone site but not near the farm (WS-RLO DNA was detected in the farm effluent). More WS-RLO DNA was detected in tissue from abalone near the farm relative to those near wild abalones (p < 0.05). However, infection prevalence and intensity based on histology were low and similar between sites (p > 0.05) and were independent of WS-RLO DNA loads in abalone tissue and seawater. More stippled (ST)-RLO than WS-RLO were observed with more STRLO infections near wild abalone than near the abalone farm (p < 0.05). We demonstrate the utility of caged sentinel abalone to better understand pathogen transmission patterns in the field.

TI  - Relapse of tagraxofusp treated blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm with loss of CD123 expression
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tagraxofusp, a CD123-based-targeted immunotherapy, was recently approved to treat blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) with excellent response. Also, a subset of BPDCN shows resistance to tagraxofusp. These resistant cases continue to express CD123, which forms the basis of the continued utility of tagraxofusp in newer combination chemotherapies to overcome resistance in BPDCN. Herein, we report a case of an elderly male with BPDCN that achieved complete remission on initial primary treatment with tagraxofusp. However, BPDCN relapsed after 1.5 years while on treatment, with loss of CD123 expression. At relapse, the neoplasm was comprehensively immunophenotyped by flow cytometry (performed on both peripheral blood and bone marrow specimen) and by immunohistochemical evaluation of the bone marrow clot section. The neoplasm at relapse was diagnostic of BPDCN with a lack of CD123 expression. This case highlights a potential limitation of current and upcoming tagraxofusp-based multidrug therapies, at least in a subset of refractory BPDCN. We believe our report will serve as a sentinel to incite future investigations involving alternate resistance mechanisms in BDPCN.

TI  - Exploring the potential of SCAT-SAR SWI for soil moisture retrievals at selected COSMOS-UK sites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for information on soil moisture at large scale to facilitate a sustainable intensification of agricultural land and to ensure food security due to increasing populations cannot be overstated. Remote sensing provides a platform for potential national coverage of soil moisture monitoring. This study explores the potential for using a Synthetic-Aperture-Radar Soil Water Index (SCAT-SAR SWI) product as a method of accurately monitoring soil moisture across the UK by comparing its output with the COSMOS-UK cosmic-ray soil moisture observation network. Using the daily data from these stations, SWI data from SCAT-SAR were compared during 2015 for the UK. Five COSMOS-UK network sites were selected across the UK for assessment, and the respected SCAT-SAR SWI pixels were extracted for their soil moisture values. Statistical test that were computed allowed quantifying the correlation between the truth data of the TDT soil moisture sensors and the COSMOS and SCAT-SAR soil moisture product. It was found that the SCAT-SAR product consistently underestimated the soil moisture with elevation affecting the level of agreement. The COSMOS network slightly overestimated soil moisture but was found, at least in this study, noticeably more accurate than the SCAT-SAR. The RMSD of the SCAT-SAR product was noticeably higher at sites with the highest elevation.

TI  - Oil leaking and seeping site in the Persian Gulf detected and studied by satellite observations
T2  - MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During remote monitoring of the Persian Gulf to detect oil spills, conducted from 2017 to 2019, leaking oil on the sea surface was observed at an offshore site. The site was located 26km west of the Sir Abu Nuyar Island in the waters of the United Arab Emirates. A more detailed analysis was conducted using remote sensing data, particularly synthetic aperture radar and optical images from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Geographic information systems and additional cartographic, geological, and industrial data collected from several sources allowed us to conclude that, in the subject area, there was one abandoned leaking oil well, and two natural oil seeps. Using generally accepted methods, estimates of oil discharges at the site were estimated at 5-21 tons per day. Our evidence showed that the leaking and seeping oil sources in this area were both active and repeating, even prolific. The site was considered one of the largest active cases among such sites in the Persian Gulf. It is concluded modern remote sensing methods are the most effective means of observing such phenomena formed on the sea surface.

TI  - BS-Net: Using Joint-Learning Boundary and Segmentation Network for Coastline Extraction from Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline extraction from remote-sensing images is of great significance to the dynamic monitoring of the coastal zone. The types of coastlines are complex and diverse, and they show different spectrum, texture, and shape features, so accurately extracting coastlines is still a challenging task. The semantic segmentation model based on deep learning has good generalization ability. However, the down sampling operation will lose the location of boundary information, resulting in the location offset between the extracted coastlines and the actual coastlines. A multi-task network, called the joint learning network of boundary and segmentation (BS-Net), was proposed in this letter. BS-Net adds a coastline positioning stream to supervise the location of the coastlines. Moreover, this letter designed a boundary-segmentation interaction (BSI) module for the mutual guidance of information between the coastline positioning stream and the sea-land segmentation stream to correct the coastline features and enhance the segmentation boundary. The experimental results on a set of Gaofen-1 remote sensing images showed that, for various natural coastlines and artificial coastlines, coastlines extracted based on BS-Net were more accurate than those extracted by other methods.

TI  - Expression of Circulating Rennin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-Related microRNAs in Patients with Thyrotoxic Heart Disease
T2  - BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thyrotoxic heart disease (THD) is a common and severe complication of hyperthyroidism and the etiology of this complication remains poorly understood. Activation of the rennin-angiotensin- aldosterone system by excess thyroxin is one of the major factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of THD. Several microRNAs such as miR-21, miR-155, miR-208a, and miR-499 are closely related to the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and therefore should be involved in this process. Our study intends to explore whether these miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of THD, and if these miRNAs could be secreted into the circulation and serve as sentinel indicators for THD. Though there is a trend of elevation of miR- 155 in THD than in simple hyperthyroidism patients, we did not find statistically significant differences in the expression of these miRNAs in the blood of THD patients, but we found that miR-155 was significantly up-regulated in patients with Graves' disease with or without THD in comparison with healthy controls. Thus, miR-155 can serve as a novel biomarker for Graves' disease and can play important roles in pathogenesis of Graves' disease.

TI  - Detection of weather events in optical satellite data using deep convolutional neural networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection and forecast of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones and wildfires are becoming increasingly crucial for mitigating their catastrophic damages. Remotely-sensed satellite data enable us to detect and assimilate these events into weather models to improve their global-scale forecasts. Despite the significant advances in satellite imagery and image processing techniques, weather data assimilation methods currently employ conventional approaches that can be slow and inaccurate. This letter aims to bridge this gap by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately and rapidly detect weather patterns in satellite images. InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19, as four state-of-the-art CNN models, are used to classify 9081 optical satellite images into five different weather events of convective cell clouds, tropical cyclones, convective roll clouds, wildfires, and dust storms. All these models obtained a satisfactory average accuracy of more than 80%. Among the CNNs, VGG-Nets were found to have difficulties in distinguishing roll convection from cell convection patterns. Overall, InceptionV3 was the best model by achieving an average accuracy of 92% in detecting such weather systems. The letter demonstrates the strength of these CNN techniques for weather pattern recognition that can be instrumental for atmospheric science research and weather/climate models.

TI  - Identification of forest disturbance and estimation of forest age in subtropical mountainous areas based on Landsat time series data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest age is significantly correlated with the net primary productivity, biomass, carbon flux, and the community structure of forest ecosystems. A Landsat time series was constructed using archived Landsat data and topographical maps to achieve large-scale spatial data on forest age. An algorithm used to identify forest disturbance based on a Mann-Kendall trend test, Mann-Kendall abrupt change test, and a difference rate index (DRI) was proposed. A forest age estimation scheme was established based on the classification of forest disturbance-recovery scenarios to obtain the spatial distribution data of forest age in the study region. The results show that: (1) through de-clouding and spectral fitting, imagery acquired by the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager sensors could be used to construct a Landsat time series over the period of 1987-2018 in subtropical areas with complex topography; (2) a DRI was extracted from the time series as a disturbance indicator, which was subjected to a Mann-Kendall trend test, leading to the identification of five forest disturbance-recovery scenarios: recovery (or no recovery) after complete disturbance, recovery after partial disturbance, sustained recovery after positive disturbance, and non-disturbance; (3) based on identification of disturbance-recovery scenarios, a forest age estimation scheme was further developed by using the mean fractional vegetation cover before disturbance, fractional vegetation cover at the end of disturbance, and the vegetation recovery rate after disturbance in conjunction with Landsat Multispectral Scanner data from 1974 and topographical maps from the 1960 s, which achieved overall accuracy metrics of R-2=0.72 and RMSE=7.8 years for forest age estimates. Specifically, the accuracy of forest age estimates was high in middle-aged and near-mature forests but low in young and mature forests, regardless of the forest vegetation type. The proposed algorithm for identifying areas of forest disturbance and forest age estimation can allow for forest change monitoring and forest age estimation at a regional scale of subtropical mountainous areas, providing a reference for the remote sensing estimation of forest ecological parameters in those areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background One of the eight clinical pathways of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Masters Program is bariatric surgery which includes three anchoring procedures. For each anchoring procedure sentinel articles have been identified to enhance participant surgeon lifelong learning. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the 3 anchoring procedures for the Bariatric Pathway. In this article we present the top 10 seminal articles regarding the RYGB which surgeons should be familiar with. Methods The literature was systematically searched to identify the most cited papers on RYGB. The SAGES Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery committee reviewed the most cited article list and using expert consensus selected the seminal articles that every bariatric surgeon should read. These articles were reviewed in detail by committee members and are presented here. Results The top 10 most cited sentinel papers on RYGB focus on operative safety, outcomes, surgical technique, and physiologic changes after the procedure. A summary of each paper is presented here, including expert appraisal and commentary. Conclusion The seminal articles presented here have supported the widespread acceptance and use of the RYGB by bolstering the understanding of its mechanism of action and by demonstrating its safety and excellent patient outcomes. All bariatric surgeons should be familiar with these 10 landmark articles.

TI  - Impacts of Warming on Reciprocal Subsidies Between Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-ecosystem subsidies are important as their recipients often rely on them to supplement in situ resource availability. Global warming has the potential to alter the quality and quantity of these subsidies, but our knowledge of these effects is currently limited. Here, we quantified the biomass and diversity of the invertebrates exchanged between freshwater streams and terrestrial grasslands in a natural warming experiment in Iceland. We sampled invertebrates emerging from the streams, those landing on the water surface, ground-dwelling invertebrates falling into the streams, and those drifting through the streams. Emerging invertebrate biomass or diversity did not change with increasing temperature, suggesting no effect of warming on aquatic subsidies to the terrestrial environment over the 1-month duration of the study. The biomass and diversity of aerial invertebrates of terrestrial origin landing on the streams increased with temperature, underpinned by increasing abundance and species richness, indicating that the greater productivity of the warmer streams may attract more foraging insects. The biomass of ground-dwelling invertebrates falling into the streams also increased with temperature, underpinned by increasing body mass and species evenness, suggesting that soil warming leads to terrestrial communities dominated by larger, more mobile organisms, and thus more in-fall to the streams. The biomass and diversity of terrestrial invertebrates in the drift decreased with temperature, however, underpinned by decreasing abundance and species richness, reflecting upstream consumption due to the higher energetic demands of aquatic consumers in warmer environments. These results highlight the potential for asynchronous responses to warming for reciprocal subsidies between aquatic and terrestrial environments and the importance of further research on warming impacts at the interface of these interdependent ecosystems.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Surface Energy Balance-Based Evaporative Fraction for Water Management in Canal Irrigation Command
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the actual evapotranspiration was estimated using the remote sensing-based spatiotemporal approach of evaporative fraction for canal irrigation command (Ozat-II) in Junagadh, Gujarat state, India. The evaporative fraction (EF) in the spatial and temporal data is useful for the estimation of regional and temporal evapotranspiration (ET) for irrigation scheduling in irrigation command. The remote sensing-based surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) use the images from the satellite to estimates ET using EF. The land surface temperature (LST) and its relation with EF can be used to estimate ET using SEBAL approach. The Landsat-7, 8 images of summer season were used to derive the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST, whose values ranged from 0.31 to 0.90 and 304.76 K to 311.00 K, respectively, in the agricultural land with crop in the command area. The SEBAL-based EF values were ranged from 0.11 to 1.00 over the canal irrigation command area. The temporal data of evaporative fraction indicate that the lower values of EF were observed during initial and end crop growth stages, i.e. March, first fortnight of April and late May which revealed the low vegetation cover. The values of EF increased in the agricultural crop land as the higher value of EF was observed as 0.84 during 116 (April 26, 2014) due to the application of irrigation from canal network and the lower value of EF was observed as 0.62 during 140 (May 20, 2014) during dry period of the season. As the NDVI increases, the evaporative fraction was also increased and the seasonal variation of NDVI was similar to the seasonal variation of EF. The relation between the EF and surface temperature, T-S, was developed and gives the negative correlation with R-2 of 0.626 for agricultural land; this can be helpful to estimate spatiotemporal ET value. The remote sensing-based daily actual evapotranspiration (AET) values were ranged from 3.75 to 7.37 mm/day and FAO-56-based daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) values were ranged from 4.62 to 8.97 mm/d for groundnut crop. The water use efficiency (WUE, kg/ha.mm) for summer groundnut was estimated as 4.03 kg/ha.mm per the SEBAL-based actual evapotranspiration (AET) and as 4.38 kg/ha.mm as per FAO-56-based crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The SEBAL-based AET can be used for the irrigation scheduling in the canal irrigation command for efficient water use.

TI  - Mapping SAR geometric distortions and their stability along time: a new tool in Google Earth Engine based on Sentinel-1 image time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational services based on SAR data from satellite missions are showing to have the potentialities of becoming a real scenario; nevertheless, the complexity of data pre-processing remains one of the main reasons for its slow uptake by a wider user community. Google Earth Engine (GEE) web-based platform allows an immediate access to SAR imagery (namely, Sentinel-1 - S1) making users able to directly focus on the expected application. SAR side-looking acquisition mode generates many geometric distortions within recorded images, especially in mountain areas, determining a different degree of reliability of deductions. Consequently, a mapping of these areas is desirable for a correct interpretation of derived information. In this work a trigonometry-based method for mapping was implemented in GEE. With reference to a time series made of 60 S1 images covering the whole Piemonte Region (NW Italy) in 2020, some maps of distortions were generated using the 30 m gridded SRTM DTM as topographic surface descriptor. S1 images, belonging to the analyzed time series, were acquired from both ascending and descending orbits. In particular, active/passive shadows, active/passive layover and foreshortening masks were computed and mapped. Distortion maps were finally intersected with land cover classes to test the correspondent degree of analysability by SAR data. The results show that such methodology can be proficiently used to mask unreliable observations, making possible to a priori be informed about the areas of a given territory that can be reasonably and reliably monitored by SAR data.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association and Mendelian Randomization Analysis Reveal the Causal Relationship Between White Blood Cell Subtypes and Asthma in Africans
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: White blood cell (WBC) traits and their subtypes such as basophil count (Bas), eosinophil count (Eos), lymphocyte count (Lym), monocyte count (Mon), and neutrophil counts (Neu) are known to be associated with diseases such as stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and coronary heart disease.Methods: We meta-analyze summary statistics from genome-wide association studies in 17,802 participants from the African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research (APCDR) and African ancestry individuals from the Blood Cell Consortium (BCX2) using GWAMA. We further carried out a Bayesian fine mapping to identify causal variants driving the association with WBC subtypes. To access the causal relationship between WBC subtypes and asthma, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary statistics of the Consortium on Asthma among African Ancestry Populations (CAAPA: n(cases) = 7,009, n(control) = 7,645) as our outcome phenotype.Results: Our metanalysis identified 269 loci at a genome-wide significant value of (p = 5 x 10(-9)) in a composite of the WBC subtypes while the Bayesian fine-mapping analysis identified genetic variants that are more causal than the sentinel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We found for the first time five novel genes (LOC126987/MTCO3P14, LINC01525, GAPDHP32/HSD3BP3, FLG-AS1/HMGN3P1, and TRK-CTT13-1/MGST3) not previously reported to be associated with any WBC subtype. Our MR analysis showed that Mon (IVW estimate = 0.38, CI: 0.221, 0.539, p < 0.001), Neu (IVW estimate = 0.189, CI: 0.133, 0.245, p < 0.001), and WBCc (IVW estimate = 0.185, CI: 0.108, 0.262, p < 0.001) are associated with increased risk of asthma. However, there was no evidence of causal relationship between Lym and asthma risk.Conclusion: This study provides insight into the relationship between some WBC subtypes and asthma and potential route in the treatment of asthma and may further inform a new therapeutic approach.

TI  - El Nino Southern Oscillation and enhanced arid land vegetation productivity in NW South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic disruption of coupled oceanic-atmospheric conditions in the tropical Pacific, which changes global precipitation regimes. One area strongly affected by positive (el Nin tilde o) phases is the Pacific Coast of South America. The specific effects of ENSO on Andean ecological communities have received little attention, however. We examine vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) on Peru's north coast arid-lands during a recent (2016-2017) el Nin tilde o, using a time series of Sentinel 2 imagery. By comparing GPP time-series in three agricultural subregions and three endemic desert vegetation communities, we demonstrate that levels of primary productivity in desert regions during ENSO-positive phases meet or exceed thresholds of adjacent agricultural lands. These results, the first that quantify and spatialize changing GPP between ENSO-neutral and ENSO-positive phases for South American arid-land biomes, both outline the scale and distribution of the el Nin tilde o effects on terrestrial ecosystems and highlight the resulting opportunities for human inhabitants. The dramatic changes to endemic vegetation on the normally hyperarid coastal desert of Peru revealed by reconstructed GPP suggest that periodic el Nin tilde o precipitation plays a critical role in arid land ecodynamics by enhancing establishment, green growth, and seedbank development. These findings improve our understanding of ENSO's net effects and highlight the roles of abrupt climate events in the arid land ecology of NW South America.

TI  - Unsupervised monitoring of vegetation in a surface coal mining region based on NDVI time series
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface coal mining causes vegetation disturbance while providing an energy source. Thus, much attention is given to monitoring the vegetation of surface coal mining regions. Multitemporal satellite imagery, such as Landsat time-series imagery, is an operational environment monitoring service widely used to access vegetation traits and ensure vegetation surveillance across large areas. However, most of the previous studies have been conducted with change detection models or threshold-based methods that require multiple parameter settings or sample training. In this paper, we tried to analyze the change traits of vegetation in surface coal mining regions using shape-based clustering based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series without multiple parameter settings and sample training. The shape-based clustering used in this paper applied shape-based distance (SBD) to obtain the distance between time series and used Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA) to generate cluster centroids. We applied the method to a stack of 19 NDVI images from 2000 to 2018 for a surface coal mining region located in North China. The results showed that the shape-based clustering used in this paper was appropriate for monitoring vegetation change in the region and achieved 79.0% overall accuracy in detecting disturbance-recovery trajectory types.

TI  - TTP-mediated regulation of mRNA stability in immune cells contributes to adaptive immunity, immune tolerance and clinical applications
T2  - RNA BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) form a sentinel network to induce protective immunity against pathogens or self-tolerance. mRNA stability is an important part of the post-transcriptional regulation (PTR) that controls the maturation and function of DCs. In this review, we summarize the effects of TTP-mediated regulation of mRNA stability in DCs, focusing on DC maturation and antigen presentation, T cell activation and differentiation, immune tolerance and inflammation. We also discuss the potential DC-based immune treatment for HIV+ patients through regulation of mRNA stability. This review proposes the regulation of mRNA stability as a novel immune therapy for various inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and dermatitis.

TI  - Arctic Tundra Land Cover Classification on the Beaufort Coast Using the Kennaugh Element Framework on Dual-Polarimetric TerraSAR-X Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic tundra landscapes are highly complex and are rapidly changing due to the warming climate. Datasets that document the spatial and temporal variability of the landscape are needed to monitor the rapid changes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is specifically suitable for monitoring the Arctic, as SAR, unlike optical remote sensing, can provide time series regardless of weather and illumination conditions. This study examines the potential of seasonal backscatter mechanisms in Arctic tundra environments for improving land cover classification purposes by using a time series of HH/HV TerraSAR-X (TSX) imagery. A Random Forest (RF) classification was applied on multi-temporal Sigma Nought intensity and multi-temporal Kennaugh matrix element data. The backscatter analysis revealed clear differences in the polarimetric response of water, soil, and vegetation, while backscatter signal variations within different vegetation classes were more nuanced. The RF models showed that land cover classes could be distinguished with 92.4% accuracy for the Kennaugh element data, compared to 57.7% accuracy for the Sigma Nought intensity data. Texture predictors, while improving the classification accuracy on the one hand, degraded the spatial resolution of the land cover product. The Kennaugh elements derived from TSX winter acquisitions were most important for the RF model, followed by the Kennaugh elements derived from summer and autumn acquisitions. The results of this study demonstrate that multi-temporal Kennaugh elements derived from dual-polarized X-band imagery are a powerful tool for Arctic tundra land cover mapping.

TI  - Estimating Actual Evapotranspiration over Croplands Using Vegetation Index Methods and Dynamic Harvested Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in estimating actual evapotranspiration (ETa) with remote sensing (RS) have contributed to improving hydrological, agricultural, and climatological studies. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of Vegetation-Index (VI) -based ETa (ET-VI) for mapping and monitoring drought in arid agricultural systems in a region where a lack of ground data hampers ETa work. To map ETa (2000-2019), ET-VIs were translated and localized using Landsat-derived 3- and 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Indices (EVI and EVI2) over croplands in the Zayandehrud River Basin (ZRB) in Iran. Since EVI and EVI2 were optimized for the MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), using these VIs with Landsat sensors required a cross-sensor transformation to allow for their use in the ET-VI algorithm. The before- and after- impact of applying these empirical translation methods on the ETa estimations was examined. We also compared the effect of cropping patterns' interannual change on the annual ETa rate using the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. The performance of the different ET-VIs products was then evaluated. Our results show that ETa estimates agreed well with each other and are all suitable to monitor ETa in the ZRB. Compared to ETc values, ETa estimations from MODIS-based continuity corrected Landsat-EVI (EVI2) (EVIMccL and EVI2(MccL)) performed slightly better across croplands than those of Landsat-EVI (EVI2) without transformation. The analysis of harvested areas and ET-VIs anomalies revealed a decline in the extent of cultivated areas and a loss of corresponding water resources downstream. The findings show the importance of continuity correction across sensors when using empirical algorithms designed and optimized for specific sensors. Our comprehensive ETa estimation of agricultural water use at 30 m spatial resolution provides an inexpensive monitoring tool for cropping areas and their water consumption.

TI  - A GIS-Based Approach for the Quantitative Assessment of Soil Quality and Sustainable Agriculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing soil quality is considered one the most important indicators to ensure planned and sustainable use of agricultural lands according to their potential. The current study was carried out to develop a spatial model for the assessment of soil quality, based on four main quality indices, Fertility Index (FI), Physical Index (PI), Chemical Index (CI), and Geomorphologic Index (GI), as well as the Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data (RS). In addition to the GI, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) parameter were added to assess soil quality in the study area (western part of Matrouh Governorate, Egypt) as accurately as possible. The study area suffers from a lack of awareness of agriculture practices, and it depends on seasonal rain for cultivation. Thus, it is very important to assess soil quality to deliver valuable data to decision makers and regional governments to find the best ways to improve soil quality and overcome the food security problem. We integrated a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with Sentinel-2 satellite images to extract landform units of the study area. Forty-eight soil profiles were created to represent identified geomorphic units of the investigated area. We used the model builder function and a geostatistical approach based on ordinary kriging interpolation to map the soil quality index of the study area and categorize it into different classes. The soil quality (SQ) of the study area, classified into four classes (i.e., high quality (SQ2), moderate quality (SQ3), low quality (SQ4), and very low quality (SQ5)), occupied 0.90%, 21.87%, 22.22%, and 49.23% of the total study area, respectively. In addition, 5.74% of the study area was classified as uncultivated area as a reference. The developed soil quality model (DSQM) shows substantial agreement (0.67) with the weighted additive model, according to kappa coefficient statics, and significantly correlated with land capability R-2 (0.71). Hence, the model provides a full overview of SQ in the study area and can easily be implemented in similar environments to identify soil quality challenges and fight the negative factors that influence SQ, in addition to achieving environmental sustainability.

TI  - Investigating the Correlation between Multisource Remote Sensing Data for Predicting Potential Spread of <i>Ips typographus</i> L. Spots in Healthy Trees
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, thousands of hectares of forests have been lost in the Czech Republic, primarily related to European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.), while more than 50% of the remaining Czech forests are in great danger, thus posing severe threats to the resilience, stability, and functionality of those forests. The role of remote sensing in monitoring dynamic structural changes caused by pests is essential to understand and sustainably manage these forests. This study hypothesized a possible correlation between tree health status and multisource time series remote sensing data using different processed layers to predict the potential spread of attack by European spruce bark beetle in healthy trees. For this purpose, we used WorldView-2, Pleiades 1B, and SPOT-6 images for the period of April to September from 2018 to 2020; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery data were also collected for use as a reference data source. Our results revealed that spectral resolution is crucial for the early detection of infestation. We observed a significant difference in the reflectance of different health statuses, which can lead to the early detection of infestation as much as two years in advance. More specifically, several bands from two different satellites in 2018 perfectly predicted the health status classes from 2020. This method could be used to evaluate health status classes in the early stage of infestation over large forested areas, which would provide a better understanding of the current situation and information for decision making and planning for the future.

TI  - Detection of the filling phases of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam using sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is regarded as one of the most critical water issues in downstream countries. While the GERD offers hopeful development chances for Ethiopia, the reduced flow of the Nile would exacerbate Egypt's current water shortage. Many stress factors are of particular interest for Egypt include population growth, global warming, economic expansion, and groundwater depletion. These factors represent significant challenges in the use and management of the primary water resource of the Nile Basin. The purpose of this study was to monitor the two phases of filling the GERD reservoir using VV polarized SAR data and ALOS global DEM. To achieve this aim, 14 scenes of Sentinel-1A imagery were processed using SNAP Toolbox. To automatically extract water bodies, a histogram of backscatter values (dB) in the VV band was developed to determine the optimal threshold value that separates water from non-water features. From our analysis, we observed that the pixels of backscatter values (dB) in the VV band lower than-18 dB were classified as water pixels. Also, the results showed that the volume of water at the GERD reservoir increased by approximately 4.12 billion m(3) during the period from August 2, 2020, to July 28, 2021. Our findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy for Sentinel-1 SAR data was 97% and the kappa coefficient was 0.94. This study confirmed the efficiency of using SAR data to monitor the changes in the water volume during the filling process of the GERD reservoir and its impacts on downstream countries.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Reflection of Mantle-Plume Magmatism Processes in Lithospheric Magnetic Anomalies according to CHAMP Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of the satellite lithospheric magnetic field is analyzed as a parameter associated with plume magmatism processes occurring in the territory of large igneous magmatic provinces. We showed that magnetic anomalies can be considered as images of mantle plumes of various geneses, along with tomographic images of seismic velocities. According to the methods developed by the authors, the parameters of the anomalous magnetic lithospheric field were extracted from the total geomagnetic field data with the CHAMP satellite. Maps of the modulus of total vector T-a and vertical component Z(a) of anomalies of various scales and observation heights were constructed when its altitude was the lowest. The magnetic images of plumes are illustrated by the example of three plumes of different ages in order of decreasing age: Tarim (similar to 280 Ma), Ethiopian (similar to 60-30 Ma), and Iceland (similar to 0-5 Ma). The relationship between magnetic-field anomalies and plume magmatism processes occurring in their territories is analyzed. We found that an ancient mantle plum is reflected in the lithospheric magnetic field as conformal positive anomaly of significant amplitudes. The lithospheric magnetic field of the comparatively "young" Ethiopian and still active Icelandic plumes is greatly reduced. We concluded that satellite observations of the lithospheric magnetic field, in combination with other geological and geophysical data of a regional scale, add valuable information to the overall picture of tectonic processes, allowing one to analyze their degree of magnetization and the temperature state of the lithosphere.

TI  - Evaluation of spatiotemporal dynamics of land cover and land surface temperature using spectral indices and supervised classification: A case study of Jobai Beel Area, Bangladesh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal change of land cover (LC) and surface temperature of the Jobai Beel area, an exclusive agriculture zone, situated in the far-flung area of northwest Bangladesh using satellite data. Multi-temporal Landsat series of data from 1989 to 2020 and geospatial techniques have been employed to evaluate the LC change and land surface temperature (LST) variation. Different spectral indices such as NDVI, MNDWI, NDBal have been used to retrieve individual LC. Corresponding LST has also been extracted using the thermal bands. Supervised Classification and the post-classification change detection technique were employed to determine the temporal changes and validate the individual LC. The results were employed to assess the LST variation associated with LC changes. The results reveal that the area had undergone a drastic and inconsistent heterogeneous LC transformation during the study period. Water and vegetation areas have expanded at a rate of 0.24km(2)/year and 0.45km(2)/year respectively, while bare lands have shrunk at a rate of 0.70km(2)/year. In general, Bare land exhibits a significant positive correlation, when Vegetation areas show a significant negative correlation with LST. However, the correlation between water areas and LST was found statistically insignificant. Agriculture in the form of vegetation has been found the most dominating land cover character throughout the study period, which has been regulating the LST variation across the area.

TI  - Effects of Meteorological Parameters on Surface Water Loss in Burdur Lake, Turkey over 34 Years Landsat Google Earth Engine Time-Series
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The current work aims to examine the effect of meteorological parameters as well as the temporal variation on the Burdur Lake surface water body areas in Turkey. The data for the surface area of Burdur Lake was collected over 34 years between 1984 and 2019 by Google Earth Engine. The seasonal variation in the water bodies area was collected using our proposed extraction method and 570 Landsat images. The reduction in the total area of the lake was observed between 206.6 km(2) in 1984 to 125.5 km(2) in 2019. The vegetation cover and meteorological parameters collected that affect the observed variation of surface water bodies for the same area include precipitation, evapotranspiration, albedo, radiation, and temperature. The selected meteorological variables influence the reduction in lake area directly during various seasons. Correlations showed a strong positive or negative significant relationship between the reduction and the selected meteorological variables. A factor analysis provided three components that explain 82.15% of the total variation in the data. The data provide valuable references for decision makers to develop sustainable agriculture and industrial water use policies to preserve water resources as well as cope with potential climate changes.

TI  - An assessment of flood event along Lower Niger using Sentinel-1 imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood incidence, especially in global south countries, is one of the most challenging natural disasters in the light of changing climates, especially in Africa. This is because African countries have a large sub-section of vulnerable people who either live within flood-prone areas or depend on flood-prone areas for their means of livelihood such as we have in Nigeria. Recent flood disasters in Nigeria have been of major concern to people, communities, and institutions. Several studies have been conducted on flood events and their impacts in Nigeria. However, most of these studies are on public perception, flood modeling (rainfall-runoff), and the provision of binary maps with few studies engaging in the use of satellite observations, especially the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR, to enhance flood early warning designs, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study is aimed at assessing the 2018 flood event in Lokoja, Kogi State, Nigeria, using the Sentinel-1 imagery. The study confirmed that a total of 69 buildings out of 611 buildings were affected by the flood disaster with about 24,902 people displaced by this singular flood event. The study shows that backscattering from microwave sensors provides very useful information for highlighting inundated areas that could prove useful in forecasting, monitoring, and precision-based flood early warning designs before, during, and after flood events.

TI  - Spatial prediction and mapping of water quality of Owabi reservoir from satellite imageries and machine learning models
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation and mapping of surface water quality are vital for the planning and sustainable management of inland reservoirs. The study aimed at retrieving and mapping water quality parameters (WQPs) of Owabi Dam reservoir from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data, using random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. Water samples from 45 systematic plots were analysed for pH, turbidity, alkalinity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen. The performances of all three models were compared in terms of adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2.adj), and the root mean square error (RMSE) using repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure. To determine the status of water quality, pixel-level predictions were used to compute model-assisted estimates of WQPs and compared with reference values from the World Health Organization. Generally, all three models produced more accurate results for S2 compared to L8. On average, the inter-sensor relative efficiency showed that S2 outperformed L8 by 67% in retrieving WQPs of the Owabi Dam reservoir. S2 gave the highest accuracy for RF (R-2.adj = 95-99%, RMSE = 0.02-3.03) and least for MLR (R-2.adj = 55-9 1%, RMSE = 0.03-3.14). Compared to RF, SVM showed similar results for S2 but with slightly higher RMSEs (0.03-3.99). The estimated pH (7.06), total dissolved solids (39.19 mg/L) and alkalinity (179.60 mg/L) were within acceptable limits, except for turbidity (33.49 mg/L) which exceeded the reference thresholds. The S2 and RF models are recommended for the monitoring of surface water quality of the Owabi Dam reservoir. (c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a World Health Organization high-priority antibiotic-resistant pathogen. However, little is known about Klebsiella lineages circulating in Nigeria.Methods. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 141 Klebsiella isolated between 2016 and 2018 from clinical specimens at 3 antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) sentinel surveillance tertiary hospitals in southwestern Nigeria. We conducted in silico multilocus sequence typing; AMR gene, virulence gene, plasmid, and K and O loci profiling; as well as phylogenetic analyses, using publicly available tools and Nextflow pipelines.Results. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of the 134 K. pneumoniae and 5 K. quasipneumoniae isolates from Nigeria characterized are closely related to globally disseminated multidrug-resistant clones. Of the 39 K. pneumoniae sequence types (STs) identified, the most common were ST307 (15%), ST5241 (12%), ST15 (similar to 9%), and ST25 (similar to 6%). ST5241, 1 of 10 novel STs detected, is a single locus variant of ST636 carrying dfrA14, tea qnrS, and oqxAB resistance genes. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene bla(CTX_M-15) was seen in 72% of K. pneumoniae genomes, while 8% encoded a carbapenemase. No isolate carried a combination of carbapenemase-producing genes. Four likely outbreak clusters from 1 facility, within STs 17, 25, 307, and 5241, were ESB1, but not carbapenemase-bearing clones.Conclusions. This study uncovered known and novel K. pneumoniae lineages circulating in 3 hospitals in Southwest Nigeria that include multidrug-resistant FSBL producers. Carbapenemase-producing isolates remain uncommon. WGS retrospectively identified outbreak clusters, pointing to the value of genomic approaches in AMR surveillance for improving infection prevention and control in Nigerian hospitals.

TI  - Comparative Study of Groundwater-Induced Subsidence for London and Delhi Using PSInSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater variation can cause land-surface movement, which in turn can cause significant and recurrent harm to infrastructure and the water storage capacity of aquifers. The capital cities in the England (London) and India (Delhi) are witnessing an ever-increasing population that has resulted in excess pressure on groundwater resources. Thus, monitoring groundwater-induced land movement in both these cities is very important in terms of understanding the risk posed to assets. Here, Sentinel-1 C-band radar images and the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) methodology are used to study land movement for London and National Capital Territory (NCT)-Delhi from October 2016 to December 2020. The land movement velocities were found to vary between -24 and +24 mm/year for London and between -18 and +30 mm/year for NCT-Delhi. This land movement was compared with observed groundwater levels, and spatio-temporal variation of groundwater and land movement was studied in conjunction. It was broadly observed that the extraction of a large quantity of groundwater leads to land subsidence, whereas groundwater recharge leads to uplift. A mathematical model was used to quantify land subsidence/uplift which occurred due to groundwater depletion/rebound. This is the first study that compares C-band PSInSAR-derived land subsidence response to observed groundwater change for London and NCT-Delhi during this time-period. The results of this study could be helpful to examine the potential implications of ground-level movement on the resource management, safety, and economics of both these cities.

AB  - The rising need for water coupled with an increasing scarcity in many parts across the world especially in the middle east and north african countries (MENA) requires more sustainable solutions for effective water conservation. In Morocco, water ressource is characterized by significant spatio-temporal variability. So, to ensure the availability of water for domestic and agro-industrial uses, it is advised to develop some alternatives that improve the local water resources management throughout the country. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) has been proven to be a very promising alternative to water shortage problem. However, identifying appropriate sites for RWH remains a complex task in the management of rainwater. The present study aims to identify optimal sites for RWH using GIS based Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method in the Kenitra province, NW Morocco. For preparing thematic layers, several data sources were used including remote sensing data (RS), digital elevation model (DEM), the soil and precipitation data were used to create the necessary database using ArcGIS software. Next, the model of the soil conservation service-curve number (SCS-CN) was adopted to generate the map of the annual potential runoff. Then, five thematic layers including runoff, slope, soil texture, land use/land cover (LULC) and drainage density were assigned apropriate weights for generating the RWH suitability map. The resultant map of runoff depth revealed that it ranges from 137 to 738 mm. Moreover, the RWH suitability map showed that Kenitra province can be classed into five RWH candidate areas: (i) unsuitable (12.7%), (ii) less suitable (10.9%), (iii) suitable (20.3%), (iv) very suitable (36%) and (v) extremely suitable (19.9%). The extremely suitable areas for RWH are distributed in the central and northeastern parts. Based on the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating caracteristics (ROC), the success rate for predicting suitable RWH sites was 51%.

TI  - Detecting Arsenic Contamination Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arsenic, a potent carcinogen and neurotoxin, affects over 200 million people globally. Current detection methods are laborious, expensive, and unscalable, being difficult to implement in developing regions and during crises such as COVID-19. This study attempts to determine if a relationship exists between soil's hyperspectral data and arsenic concentration using NASA's Hyperion satellite. It is the first arsenic study to use satellite-based hyperspectral data and apply a classification approach. Four regression machine learning models are tested to determine this correlation in soil with bare land cover. Raw data are converted to reflectance, problematic atmospheric influences are removed, characteristic wavelengths are selected, and four noise reduction algorithms are tested. The combination of data augmentation, Genetic Algorithm, Second Derivative Transformation, and Random Forest regression (R-2=0.840 and normalized root mean squared error (re-scaled to [0,1]) = 0.122) shows strong correlation, performing better than past models despite using noisier satellite data (versus lab-processed samples). Three binary classification machine learning models are then applied to identify high-risk shrub-covered regions in ten U.S. states, achieving strong accuracy (=0.693) and F1-score (=0.728). Overall, these results suggest that such a methodology is practical and can provide a sustainable alternative to arsenic contamination detection.

T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognizing land use changes (LUC) and evaluating their relationship with producing dust sources are considered effective to manage the environment. Taking Kermanshah Province, Iran as study area, dusty days from 2008 to 2015 were selected and dust sources were identified applying thermal-infrared dust index (TDI), hybrid single-particle lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT), false color composite (FCC) and true color composite (TCC) of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Afterwards, the land use change map was produced using Landsat images in 2000 and 2015. Then, the distribution and frequency of the sources in each land-use change class and important dust production areas were specified. Eventually, two non-parametric tests including Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis were applied to examine the relationship between LUC and dust sources. Results indicated that the distribution of dust sources was not identical in the study area, and the sources were mainly generated in the areas where land-use change had occurred. In fact, different classes of LUC have different contributions to dust production, and the highest contribution refers to the deflation in gentle slope areas and lowlands where the rangeland has been converted into agriculture land. The findings from this study are useful to manage and control dust in the identified sources.

TI  - A GIS model for exploring the water pumped storage locations using remote sensing data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the energy sector in Egypt faces various challenges due to the continuous increase in energy demand. Fossil fuels may be running out, so there is an urgent need to find a sustainable energy source. Renewable energy is one of pure energy, but it needs to be stored using economical and environment-friendly means. Pumping hydroelectric storage (PHES) plants are currently one of the most economical and unique storage technologies available. In addition, PHES plants are working on creating a balance between the supply and demand of energy during the day. A GIS model based on remote sensing data was used to discover suitable sites for PHES plants and establish a (PHES) map for Egypt. The new PHES locations were filtered using a model based on GIS multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The GIS model criteria were developed by using the weighted linear combination (WLC) technique. The global digital elevation model SRTM 1 arcsec was used for depicting elevation head, head ratio, and terrain slope criteria. The National Grid, road networks, land use, and airport-restricted areas as constraints data sets were analysed using Arc GIS spatial analysis math algebra tool. The results discovered many suitable PHES sites covering a total area of 10428 km(2) and, maps of PHES have become available for Egypt.

TI  - Application of Atmospheric Correction to KOMPSAT for Agriculture Monitoring
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data using earth observation satellites in agricultural environment monitoring has many advantages over other methods in terms of time, space, and efficiency. Since the sensor mounted on the satellite measures the energy that sunlight is reflected back to the ground, noise is generated in the process of being scattered, absorbed, and reflected by the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, in order to accurately measure the energy reflected on the ground (radiance), atmospheric correction, which must remove noise caused by the effect of the atmosphere, should be preceded. In this study, atmospheric correction sensitivity analysis, inter-satellite cross-analysis, and comparative analysis with ground observation data were performed to evaluate the application of KOMPSAT-3 satellite's atmospheric correction for agricultural application. As a result, in all cases, the surface reflectance after atmospheric correction showed a higher mutual agreement than the TOA reflectance before atmospheric correction, and it is possible to produce the time series vegetation index of the same standard. However, additional research is needed for quantitative analysis of the sensitivity of atmospheric input parameters and the tilt angle.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Theobald first described Culex nigripalpus in 1901 from St. Lucia Island of the Lesser Antilles. It is a Neotropical mosquito species that is documented throughout Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the southeastern USA. Reports within the last 3 decades show the species has expanded its range farther into North America and is not only being discovered sporadically but appears to be establishing itself in several states, of which data are underreported and difficult to find. Five female specimens were collected-4 on October 13 and 1 on December 6, 2017-at 3 separate sites in the city of Suffolk, VA-2 in a BG-Sentinel 2 (R) trap, 3 in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps-during routine mosquito surveillance; subsequent collections were made in 2019 and 2020. These findings represent the 1st record of Cx. nigripalpus in the state of Virginia and the most northeastern records in the USA. An updated mosquito species checklist for the state of Virginia is provided. Additionally, this report serves to update the records of North Carolina to 28 total counties reporting Cx. nigripalpus. These new records, along with other reports and published studies, show this species now documented in 201 jurisdictions in 16 states of the USA. As recent literature on this species is scarce, we provide a review of the bionomics, defining morphological characters, and an updated US distribution map.

TI  - Coupling Remote Sensing and Hydrological Model for Evaluating the Impacts of Climate Change on Streamflow in Data-Scarce Environment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kabul River Basin (KRB) in Afghanistan is densely inhabited and heterogenic. The basin's water resources are limited, and climate change is anticipated to worsen this problem. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of data to measure the impacts of climate change on the KRB's current water resources. The objective of the current study is to introduce a methodology that couples remote sensing and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for simulating the impact of climate change on the existing water resources of the KRB. Most of the biophysical parameters required for the SWAT model were derived from remote sensing-based algorithms. The SUFI-2 technique was used for calibrating and validating the SWAT model with streamflow data. The stream-gauge stations for monitoring the streamflow are not only sparse, but the streamflow data are also scarce and limited. Therefore, we selected only the stations that are properly being monitored. During the calibration period, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) were 0.75-0.86 and 0.62-0.81, respectively. During the validation period (2011-2013), the NSE and R-2 values were 0.52-0.73 and 0.65-0.86, respectively. The validated SWAT model was then used to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow. Regional Climate Model (RegCM4-4) was used to extract the data for the climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) from the CORDEX domain. The results show that streamflow in most tributaries of the KRB would decrease by a maximum of 5% and 8.5% under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. However, streamflow for the Nawabad tributary would increase by 2.4% and 3.3% under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. To mitigate the impact of climate change on reduced/increased surface water availability, the SWAT model, when combined with remote sensing data, can be an effective tool to support the sustainable management and strategic planning of water resources. Furthermore, the methodological approach used in this study can be applied in any of the data-scarce regions around the world.

TI  - Forest cover change in Onigambari reserve, Ibadan, Nigeria: Application of vegetation index and Markov chain techniques
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change (FCC) varies globally and is thus considered as one of the drivers of climate change. The present study identified the pattern of the FCC for the years 2010 and 2020 using vegetation index and Markov chain techniques. The Markov chain (MC) was utilized to predict the forest cover map for the year 2030. The vegetation index of Landsat 7 Enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational land images (OLI) were employed to assess the forest cover loss for the years 2010 and 2020. The validation result shows that the accuracy of the predicted forest cover map is more than 75 percent (%). The prediction result shows that if the current human activities continue such as deforestation, the forest cover will continue to be endangered and thus leading to a decrease in dense forest, plantation, and sparse vegetation by 20.9%, 16.1%, and 20% respectively. Hence, there is an urgent need to integrate bottom-up and participatory approaches between agriculture activities and forestry for socioeconomic development. This study will ensure sustainable forest management by assisting society, government and stakeholders.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Towards the Assessment of Soil-Erosion-Related C-Factor on European Scale Using Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a constant environmental threat for the entirety of Europe. Numerous studies have been published during the last years concerning assessing soil erosion utilising Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Such studies commonly employ empirical erosion models to estimate soil loss on various spatial scales. In this context, empirical models have been highlighted as major approaches to estimate soil loss on various spatial scales. Most of these models analyse environmental factors representing soil-erosion-influencing conditions such as the climate, topography, soil regime, and surface vegetation coverage. In this study, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data have been combined to assess the vegetation-coverage-related factor known as cover management factor (C-factor) at a high spatial resolution (10 m) considering a total of 38 European countries. Based on the employment of the RS derivative of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for January and December 2019, a C-factor map was generated due to mean annual estimation. National values were then calculated in terms of different types of agricultural land cover classes. Furthermore, the European C-factor (C-EUROPE) values concerning the island of Crete (Greece) were compared with relevant values estimated for the island (C-CRETE) based on Sentinel-2 images being individually selected at a monthly time-step of 2019 to generate a series of 12 maps for the C-factor in Crete. Our results yielded identical C-factor values for the different approaches. The outcomes denote GEE's high analytic and processing abilities to analyse massive quantities of data that can provide efficient digital products for soil-erosion-related studies.

TI  - Satellite-Based Water and Energy Balance Model for the Arid Region to Determine Evapotranspiration: Development and Application
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) plays an important role in irrigation planning and supervision. Traditionally, the estimation of ETa was approximated using different in situ techniques, having high initial and maintenance costs with low spatial resolution. In this context, satellite imagery models play an effective role in water management practices by estimating ETa in small and large-scale areas. All existing models have been widely used for the estimation of ETa around the globe, but there is no definite conclusion on which approach is best for the hot and hyper-arid region of Oman. Our study introduces an innovative approach that uses in situ, meteorological, and satellite imagery (Landsat-OLI/TIRS) datasets to estimate ETa. The satellite-based water and energy balance model for the arid region to determine evapotranspiration (SMARET) was developed under the hot and hyper-arid region conditions of Oman by incorporating soil temperature in the sensible heat flux. The performance of SMARET ran through accuracy assessment against in situ measurements via sap flow sensors and lysimeters. The SMARET was also evaluated against three existing models, including the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), mapping evapotranspiration at high-resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC), and the Penman-Monteith (PM) model. The study resulted in a significant correlation between SMARET (R-2 = 0.73), as well as the PM model (R-2 = 0.72), and the ETa values calculated from Lysimeter. The SMARET model also showed a significant correlation (R-2 = 0.66) with the ETa values recorded using the sap flow meter. The strong relationship between SMARET, sap flow measurement, and lysimeter observation suggests that SMARET has application capability in hot and hyper-arid regions.

The vegetation indices are used in remote sensing for long time to monitor changes in vegetation. Remotely sensed data is considered as an important source of information. For particular area, the vegetation can be considered as a source to collect information about soil, or water table, and to delineate potential zone of ground water. Landsat 7 image is used to identify the land cover and to monitor the vegetation indices in the area under investigation. There are many indices in remote sensing. In this paper I used NDVI and SAVI for the study region and I produce Maps for these two indices using ArcGIS 10.2.2 software.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of new lymphatic tracers and the advancement of hybrid tracers, such as indocyanine green (ICG)-Nanocoll (GE Healthcare), represent an exciting step in the future of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). These tracers aim to improve our ability to detect sentinel lymph nodes by enhancing their localisation. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel dual tracer, double injection technique of ICG-`cold'-Nanocoll and radiolabelled Nanocoll, in SLNB for early-stage oral cancer. A double injection technique was performed first using 99mTc-Nancoll prior to sentinel node imaging followed by ICG-`cold'-Nanocoll injection in theatre. Analysis involved examination of the number, labelling, and location of the nodes harvested, sentinel node status, survival analysis, false negative rate, and complications associated with use of the technique. ICG 'cold' Nanocoll results showed concordance of fluorescence and radioactivity detection in 74 nodes in 24 patients. Most importantly, all nodes found positive for metastasis (6 nodes) were discovered to be both `hot' and fluorescent; 74 nodes removed were both 'hot' and fluorescent, eight fluorescent only and six 'hot' only. Our results indicate that two sets of tracer injections given at two different time points will flow to the same sentinel nodes. This double labelling increased our confidence that the retrieved node was a sentinel node. (c) 2021 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Clinical Significance of Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) in Melanoma: A Narrative Review from Adjuvant Clinical Trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is the most dangerous skin cancer, with high death rates in advanced stages. To assess the impact of each treatment on patient outcomes, most studies use relapse-free survival (RFS) as a primary endpoint and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as a secondary endpoint. The aim of this narrative review of the main adjuvant studies for resected stage III/IV melanoma, with a specific focus on DMFS, is to evaluate DMFS trends and their potential association with RFS, identify which treatments are possibly associated with better outcomes in terms of DMFS and their potential predictive factors, and discuss DMFS trends in terms of patient management in daily practice. We outline the impact of each available treatment option on DMFS and RFS according to the years of follow-up and compare data from different studies. Overall, the trends of DMFS closely follow those of RFS, with most patients relapsing at visceral rather than regional sites. As it captures the burden of patients who develop distant relapse, DMFS could be considered a primary endpoint, in addition to RFS, in adjuvant trials, identifying patients whose relapse is associated with a worse prognosis and who may need further systemic treatment.

TI  - Analysis on the Spatio-Temporal Changes of LST and Its Influencing Factors Based on VIC Model in the Arid Region from 1960 to 2017: An Example of the Ebinur Lake Watershed, Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - LST (Land surface temperature) is an important indicator for monitoring dynamic changes in the earth's resources and environment. However, the complexity of obtaining long-term, continuous LST data hinders the development of research on LST responses to meteorological factors or LUCC in areas where data is lacking. The objective of this research was to use the VIC-3L (Variable Infiltration Capacity) based on multi-source remote sensing data to simulate and explore spatio-temporal changes in the LST, to analyze the relationship between the LST and meteorological elements by using cross-wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC), the relationship between the LST and LUCC by using three-phase remote sensing images of LUCC. The following results were obtained. The annual average LST of the study area is increasing at a rate of 0.027 degrees C per year. The annual average LST level is relatively high in the central and eastern regions. The average temperature has an important influence on LST, which is mainly reflected in the period scale of 1~4a in 1963-1972, 1980-1996, and 2004-2010. The sharp decline in open shrubs may have exacerbated the increase in LST in the study area. This study provides a scientific reference for studying LST in arid areas.

TI  - Responses of subalpine meadow to climatic factors and the time lag effects in Wuyi Mountains from 2000 to 2019.
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Subalpine meadow is extremely sensitive to climate change. Few studies, however, focused on the responses of subalpine meadow to climatic factors in subtropical regions. It is still a challenge to extract the biophysical parameters from optical remote sensing imagery during the growing season. Based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series dataset from the MOD13Q1 vegetation index products and meteorological data, we analyzed the changes of vegetation growth of subalpine meadow at Huanggang Mountain in the top of Wuyishan National Park from 2000 to 2019, its responses to climate factors and the time lag effects. The results showed that NDVI in summer increased insignificantly during 2000-2019, and that NDVI in the growing season, spring, and autumn increased significantly. The enhancement of NDVI was mainly contributed by the increasing temperature (0.026 degrees C center dot a(-1)) from 2000 to 2019. The increasing temperature in spring and autumn influenced meadow growth more than that in summer and growing season. NDVI of the growing season in subalpine meadow was sensitive to precipitation, indicating that the growth of subalpine meadow was strongly affected by precipitation even in the subtropical region with sufficient precipitation. Temperature and precipitation in different growth periods had different time lag effects on the NDVI of subalpine meadowo. The time lag effects of temperature on subalpine meadow were 0-1 month, and that of precipitation were 2-3 month.

TI  - MARXISM AND MMT How Modern Monetary Theory Can Enrich the Debate among Marxists
T2  - WORLD REVIEW OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - As of now, there has been a relatively insufficient amount of scholarship tying Marxist theory to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). This article argues that Marxists should take a closer look at the economic theory. MMT is a normative theory and could be used to promote any worldview or theory. Marxists should use it to argue for and, if implemented, manage non-reformist reforms such as a Job Guarantee and publicly funded elections. These reforms could raise the material and working conditions of the working class, strengthen class consciousness, and condition society for a post-capitalist economic system.

TI  - Quantifying circulating antibody activities against the emerging environmental pathogen, <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, in wild captured bull sharks, spotted eagle rays, bottlenose dolphins, and loggerhead turtles
T2  - FISH AND SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Streptococcus agalactiae and related pathogen infections are increasing, and place both wildlife species and humans at risk. Notably, Streptococcus agalactiae is now considered to be an emerging and zoonotic pathogen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated against bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas, and spotted eagle ray, Aetobatus narinari, IgM, and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, IgG. Along with a previously generated mAb against loggerhead, Caretta caretta, IgY, these biological reagents were used to compare the sensitivity of relative antibody titers at sample dilutions of 1:200 in buffer to calculated antibody activities against whole cell Streptococcus agalactiae in wild captured individuals. Robust antibody responses were observed in each species, though some individuals differed significantly depending on whether viewed as relative antibody titers at sample dilutions of 1:200 or as antibody activities. The data from this study indicate that calculated antibody activities are more informative than relative antibody titers in determining antibody responses despite being more labor-intensive, expensive, and time consuming. This study provides several novel antibody reagents to the greater community of comparative immunologists, with a particular application to monitoring sentinel species for exposure to new emerging and zoonotic pathogens.

TI  - Changes in Temperature, Sea Level, and Geostrophic Currents in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean and Southwestern Bering Sea under the Influence of the Nodal Tide
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of satellite data and Argo float data has shown the variability in the sea surface temperature (SST), sea level, and geostrophic currents in the northwestern Pacific Ocean and southwestern Bering Sea caused by the nodal tide with a period of 18.6 years. It is found that an increase in the nodal tide amplitude leads to a sea-level decrease and the formation of cyclonic water circulation in the Blizhniy Strait area. In the Bering Sea, there is no water flow directed northward from the Blizhniy Strait to the mainland coast. In the northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean, the westward flow of waters of the Alaskan Stream weakens and a cyclonic eddy is formed. The sea-level decrease is caused by an increase in salinity/density of water in the 50-400 m layer due to increased tidal mixing in the Aleutian Straits and the Blizhniy Strait. Tidal amplification (attenuation) was accompanied by a decrease (increase) in SST in the northwestern Pacific Ocean and southwestern Bering Sea.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Analytical hierarchical process (AHP) is nowadays a very popular tool in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the groundwater suitability zone assessment. The present study involves the selection of six major influencing criteria, i.e., land use and land cover, drainage density, normalized difference vegetation index, lineament density, groundwater fluctuation, and the slope. Using remotely sensed data in a GIS environment, various thematic layers are generated. Suitable weights are assigned to these criteria using Saaty's scale as well as reclassification and ranking scores are also done to sub-criteria. Accordingly, consistency checks are also done to the weights applied to all the criteria. The weighted overlay technique is adopted under ArcGIS environment. Generated groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) map, illustrates five classified zones (1-5) of groundwater potentials, where 1 is representative of very poor prospects zone (10.9%), and 5 is indicative of excellent storage zones (37.8%).

TI  - Kepler-411 Star Activity: Connection between Starspots and Superflares
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stellar magnetic activity, just like that of the Sun, manifests itself in the form of flares and spots on the surface of the star. In the solar case, the largest flares originate from large active regions. In this work, we present a study of the activity of the star Kepler-411, including spot modeling from planetary transits. Our goal was to search for a connection between the area of starspots with the energy of superflares produced by this star. Kepler-411 is a K2V-type star with an average rotation period of 10.52 days, radius of 0.79 R (circle dot), and a mass of 0.83 M (circle dot), which was observed by the Kepler satellite for about 600 days. Transit mapping allowed for the characterization of 198 starspots with estimates of their radius and temperature. Kepler-411 starspots had an average radius of (17 +/- 7) x 10(3) km and a mean temperature of 3800 +/- 700 K. Visual inspection of the light curves of Kepler-411 yields the identification of 65 superflares. The detected superflares lasted from 8 to 260 minutes and their energy varied from 10(33)-10(35) ergs. The power-law index of the flare frequency distribution as a function of energy is (-2.04 +/- 0.13) for the flare on Kepler-411. A positive correlation between the area of starspots and the energy of superflares was found when considering the averages taken every 16-35 days, with the highest correlation occurring for averages every 21 days. This timing is probably related to the lifetime of the Kepler-411 spots.

TI  - Role of a Mine in Changing Its Surroundings-Land Use and Land Cover and Impact on the Natural Environment in Barapukuria, Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is considered among the most discussed issues associated with development nowadays. It is necessary to provide factual and up-to-date information to policymakers to fulfil the increasing population's food, work, and habitation needs while ensuring environmental sustainability. Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote sensing can perform such work adequately. This study aims to assess land use and land cover changes concerning the Barapukuria coal mine and its adjacent areas in Bangladesh by applying remote sensing and GIS (geographical information system) techniques. This research work used time-series satellite images from the Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite between 1999 and 2009 and the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite for 2019. Supervised classification maximum likelihood classifier matrix was implemented using ERDAS Imagine 2018. The images were categorised into four definite classes: settlement, agricultural land, forest land, and waterbody. Analytical results clearly indicated that settlements and agricultural land had increasing and decreasing trends over the past 20 years, respectively. Settlements increased from 22% to 34% between 1999 and 2019. However, agricultural land reduced from 69% to 59% in the same period. Settlements grew by more than 50% during this period. The research had an overall accuracy of 70%, while the kappa coefficient was more than 0.60. There were land subsidence issues because of mining activities, leading to 1.003 km(2) area being depressed and 1500 houses cracked. This research depicts the present LULC scenario and the impact of the coalfield area. It is expected to reduce the burden on policymakers to prepare a proper and effective mines development policy in Bangladesh and meet sustainable development goal (SDG) 15 (Life on land).

TI  - Impact of corporate tax aggressiveness on firm value: evidence from India
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose There is mixed evidence in the extant literature on the firm value implications of corporate tax aggressiveness in the developed economies. There are, however, limited studies that discuss this relationship in the case of emerging economies. The present study aims to bridge this research gap by exploring the relationship between corporate tax aggressiveness and firm value in context of the Indian economy. Design/methodology/approach The sample comprises 547 S&P BSE 500 (Standard and Poor's Bombay Stock Exchange 500) Index companies for Financial Year (FY) 2009-10 through FY 2018-19. A fixed-effects panel model has been used to discern the impact of corporate tax aggressiveness on firm value with and without the moderating effect of a proxy for corporate governance strength. Findings The results highlight a significant negative relationship between corporate tax aggressiveness and firm value in India, whilst the analysis on the moderating effect of corporate governance strength on this relationship revealed a mix of significant and insignificant results. These results were robust to an alternate specification of the corporate governance strength proxy, the system GMM estimation employed to deal with endogeneity and a change in the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) regulation brought into effect by the Companies Act, 2013. Originality/value The study reveals a firm value discount associated with corporate tax aggressiveness in India which is likely due to its ability to increase opportunities for wealth expropriation by managers. This can further be attributed to the ineffective corporate governance mechanisms that make agency problems more severe in the case of emerging economies like India.

TI  - Analysis of various surface energy balance models for evapotranspiration estimation using satellite data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and reliable estimation of irrigation water requirements is essential for efficient water resource management. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant factor in irrigation water consumption. It is the combination of evaporation from the soil and transpiration from the leaf surface. Proper estimation of ET is required to understand water resource management, crop water requirement analysis, drought monitoring, etc. ET depends on several factors such as weather conditions, land type, soil type, crops, etc., and its accurate estimation on a large spatial scale is a challenge. Many methods have been developed to estimate ET over the past few decades, and satellite-based ET estimation is one among them. This article reviews remote sensing-based ET estimations such as SEBI, SEBS, SSEB-op, TSM, SEBAL, METRIC, and Modified Priestley-Taylor. Their merits, demerits, and suggestions are also discussed. This study gives more insight into the importance of remote sensing-based ET estimation.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) can be important sentinel species for the presence of zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, we collected blood samples from wild rabbits harvested by hunters during the hunting season 2019-2020 on the island of Lemnos, to determine exposure of wild rabbits to the zoonotic pathogens Leishmania infantum, Toxoplasma gondii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia caballi, as well as aqueous humor to assess its diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios. Antibodies against these pathogens were detected by Indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody (IFA) assay. Out of the 72 wild rabbits included in the study, 4.2%, 5.5%, 18% and 9.7% were seropositive to L. infantum, T. gondii, A. phagocytophilum and B. caballi, respectively. Although less frequently, antibodies were also detected in aqueous humor of wild rabbits. The antibody detection in aqueous humor presented 100% specificity but decreased sensitivity compared to serum suggesting that aqueous humor could be successfully used in epidemiological studies to confirm exposure at the population level but has little diagnostic value at the individual level. This is the first report on the seropositivity of wild rabbits to A. phagocytophilum and B. caballi and the detection of antibodies against A. phagocytopylum, L. infantum, T. gondii and B. caballi in the aqueous humor.

TI  - The Effects of Thermal-Spatial Behaviours of Land Covers on Urban Heat Islands in Semi-Arid Climates
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, unsustainable urban development stemming from uncontrolled changes in land cover and the accumulation of population and activities have given rise to adverse environmental consequences, such as the formation of urban heat islands (UHIs) and changes in urban microclimates. The formation and intensity of UHIs can be influenced not only by the type of land cover, but also by other factors, such as the spatial patterns of thermal clusters (e.g., dimensions, contiguity, and integration). By emphasising the differences between semi-arid and cold-and-humid climates in terms of the thermal-spatial behaviours of various types of land cover in these climates, this paper aims to assess the behavioural patterns of thermal clusters in Tehran, Iran. To this end, the relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and the types of land cover is first demonstrated using combined multispectral satellite images taken by Operational Land Imager (OLI), Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) of the Landsat8 and MODIS, and Sentinel satellites to determine LST and land cover. The effects of different behavioural patterns of thermal clusters on the formation of daytime urban heat islands are then analysed through spatial cross-correlation analysis. Lastly, the thermal behaviours of each cluster are separately examined to reveal how their spatial patterns, such as contiguity, affect the intensity and formation of UHI, with the assumption that each point in a contiguous surface may exhibit different thermal behaviours, depending on its distance from the edge or centre. The results of this study show that the daytime UHIs do not occur in the central parts of Tehran, and instead they are created in the surrounding layer, which mostly consists of barren cover. This finding contrasts with previous research conducted regarding cities located in cold-and-humid climates. Our research also finds that the more compact the hot and cool clusters are, the more contiguous they become, which leads to an increase in UHIs. The results suggest that for every 100 pix/km(2) increase, the cluster temperature increases by approximately 0.7-1 degrees C. Additionally, placing cool clusters near or in combination with hot clusters interrupts the effect of the hot clusters, leading to a significant temperature reduction. The paper concludes with recommendations for potential sustainable and context-based solutions to UHI problems in semi-arid climates that relate to the determination of the optimal contiguity distance and land use integration patterns for thermal clusters.

TI  - USING A SPLIT-WINDOW ALGORITHM FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF THE LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE VIA LANDSAT-8 OLI/TIRS
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has worsened and has widespread impact. This is partly due to the release of greenhouse gases from human activities, which cause the greenhouse effect. This leads to the global temperature rising to an unusual level, otherwise known as global warming. This study aimed to use a split-window algorithm to retrieve the land surface temperature via Landsat-8 OLI/ TIRS data in the Roi Et province area. The research methodology included 1) separating the Landsat-8 OLI data into four types of land use, i.e. the agricultural, forest, urban and water areas and 2) the data for Landsat-8 OLI bands 4 and 5 and Landsat-8 TIRS (bands 10, 11) being analysed to retrieve the land surface temperature using a split-window algorithm. The results from the land-use separation showed that the total area of Roi Et was 8,299.46 km(2) divided into a 4,787 km (2)agricultural area, which accounted for 60.81%; a 1,555 km(2) forest area, accounting for 19.75%; a 1,212 km(2) urban area, accounting for 15.39% and a 317.44 km(2) water area, accounting for 4.03%. The land surface temperature analysis result using a split-window algorithm indicated that the average temperature of Roi Et was 34.74 degrees C. Moreover, it was found that the land surface temperature of the urban area had the highest mean land surface temperature, followed by the forest area, the agricultural area and the water source area, respectively.

TI  - Synthesizing Disparate LiDAR and Satellite Datasets through Deep Learning to Generate Wall-to-Wall Regional Inventories for the Complex, Mixed-Species Forests of the Eastern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become a commonly-used tool for generating remotely-sensed forest inventories. However, LiDAR-derived forest inventories have remained uncommon at a regional scale due to varying parameters among LiDAR data acquisitions and the availability of sufficient calibration data. Here, we present a model using a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN), a form of deep learning capable of scanning a LiDAR point cloud, combined with coincident satellite data (spectral, phenology, and disturbance history). We compared this approach to traditional modeling used for making forest predictions from LiDAR data (height metrics and random forest) and found that the CNN had consistently lower uncertainty. We then applied the CNN to public data over six New England states in the USA, generating maps of 14 forest attributes at a 10 m resolution over 85% of the region. Aboveground biomass estimates produced a root mean square error of 36 Mg ha(-1) (44%) and were within the 97.5% confidence of independent county-level estimates for 33 of 38 or 86.8% of the counties examined. CNN predictions for stem density and percentage of conifer attributes were moderately successful, while predictions for detailed species groupings were less successful. The approach shows promise for improving the prediction of forest attributes from regional LiDAR data and for combining disparate LiDAR datasets into a common framework for large-scale estimation.

TI  - The Cultural Landscape of Siberia in the Spiritual Literature of the Second Half of the 19th Century: Imaginary and Social Geography
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the problem of the article is connected not only with the interest of modem literary studies in its historical-literary, socio-literary, imagological aspects. It is also actualized by the global "friend-or-foe" conflict that has escalated in the 21st century. Of particular interest in this regard is the Siberian socio-cultural space, which has been formed and continues to be formed as a transboundary area as a result of constant migrations and interactions of different cultures, and Siberian literature, which reflects this complex reality in texts of different genres, types, and genera, and simultaneously forming it. A special place in the verbal culture of the region belongs to spiritual literature, initially the most important factor in the formation of the cultural landscape of Siberia, which authoritative philological works prove. However, the consideration of the heritage of the Siberian Orthodox clergy, taking into account the reflection in it of the transboundary nature of the cultural landscape of Siberia and its influence on the formation of the latter, has never become an object of scientific consideration. Defining Siberian spiritual literature as the object of research, the author means works in line with the Christian worldview created by the Siberian Orthodox clergy: representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church, most often transferred to Siberia from the central regions of Russia, as well as Orthodox missionaries traveling to Siberia and living there with the aim of spreading Christianity. The corpus of Siberian spiritual literature of the second half of the 19th century, which certainly expands our ideas about the composition and boundaries of Siberian literature of the pre-revolutionary period, reflects the construction of the Siberian socio-cultural space in a very peculiar way - within the framework of imaginary and social geography. In these texts, Siberia appears as a space personally perceived by the author, as a landscape generated by the perception of the text, and as an institutionally structured space in which literature is considered as one of the interacting socio-cultural fields, and therefore as an instrument for the formation of the cultural landscape of the territory (including its literary process), regional identity, and as an organizer of social interactions. According to the results of the analysis, the author argues that the presented model of reflection of the cultural landscape of Siberia in the spiritual Siberian literature allows expanding the concept "transboundary area". The concept helps describe the most important characteristics of the landscape - multilayeredness and discreteness, as well as options for interactions within it, which are the most important factor in building this landscape, achieving its stability, preserving identity in conditions of constant transformations. It is also important to emphasize the material on which the proposed model was built - spiritual Siberian literature, which opens new pages in the history of the Siberian transboundary area.

TI  - Soil erosion assessment in arid region: A case study in Wadi Naghamish, Northwest Coast, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wadi Naghamish is located at a distance of 20 km east of Matrouh City. It occupies an area of about 9000 ha. Wadi Naghamish suffers from seasonal floods that can remove the surface layers, cut off the natural cover, destroy the infrastructures, and cause many natural disasters as well as cause a great economic loss. The study aimed at evaluating soil erosion in Wadi Naghamish, Northwest Coast of Egypt using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) based integration soil chemical, physical properties, and topographic factors. Geomorphological units of Wadi Naghamish were identified based on the integration of sentinel 2 image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The Geomorphological units were classified into: Tableland 77%, Escarpment 1.3%, Basin 2.1%, Alluvial terraces 5.6%, Wadi 8.98%. Sandy beach 0.03% of the total area. The results indicated that soil erosion values were associated with the geomorphic feature of the study area where, the highest values were observed in Tableland unit, where it has average soil erosion ranging between 0.42 +/- 0.21 to 55 +/- 39 t h(-1) y(-1). Meanwhile the lowest values were observed in Wadi, alluvial terraces and Basin where, the overall average of soil erosion were 0.41 +/- 0.23, 0.26 +/- 0.09 and 0.19 +/- 0.13 t h(-1) y(-1) sequentially. The highest values were found in the sloping areas where slope length value reaches 2.8 and the erodibility values ringing between 0.3 and 0.5 Mg h MJ(-1) mm(-1). Therefore, the study emphasized the importance of relying on scientific study in preparing an appropriate management plan including a suitable potential crop system, increasing the organic matter, and implementing a no-till or direct sowing system to preserve the soil from erosion.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Understanding the Requirements for Surveys to Support Satellite-Based Crop Type Mapping: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides recommendations on how large-scale household surveys should be conducted to generate the data needed to train models for satellite-based crop type mapping in smallholder farming systems. The analysis focuses on maize cultivation in Malawi and Ethiopia, and leverages rich, georeferenced plot-level data from national household surveys that were conducted in 2018-20 and integrated with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and complementary geospatial data. To identify the approach to survey data collection that yields optimal data for training remote sensing models, 26,250 in silico experiments are simulated within a machine learning framework. The best model is then applied to map seasonal maize cultivation from 2016 to 2019 at 10-m resolution in both countries. The analysis reveals that smallholder plots with maize cultivation can be identified with up to 75% accuracy. Collecting full plot boundaries or complete plot corner points provides the best quality of information for model training. Classification performance peaks with slightly less than 60% of the training data. Seemingly little erosion in accuracy under less preferable approaches to georeferencing plots results in the total area under maize cultivation being overestimated by 0.16-0.47 million hectares (8-24%) in Malawi.

TI  - Merkel Cell Carcinoma: From Pathobiology to Clinical Management
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon type of skin cancer that carries a poor prognosis. It is seen predominantly in old age in sun-exposed body parts. Racial and geographical differences are seen in its occurrence. Viral infection and radiation exposure are the two leading factors implicated in its causation. Small, firm to hard nodule (usually in sun-exposed areas), red with a history of a rapid increase in size is a common personation of the disease. Other body parts such as upper limbs, trunk, and even lower limbs may be also involved. The disease is diagnosed by taking a tissue sample (biopsy) for examination, and other radiological investigations are needed to reach a proper diagnosis with the staging of the disease. There are various treatment options including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is the primary treatment option though some patients may not be the candidates for operation where other treatment options come into play. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an infrequent, rapidly growing skin neoplasm that carries a greater probability of regional lymph node involvement, and a grim prognosis in advanced cases. While it is seen predominantly in old age in sun-exposed body parts, the prevalence varies among different races and geographical regions. Merkel cell polyomavirus and UV radiation-induced mutations contribute to its etiopathogenesis. The clinical presentation of MCC lacks pathognomonic features and is rarely considered highly at the time of presentation. Histopathological examination frequently reveals hyperchromatic nuclei with high mitotic activity, but immunohistochemistry is required to confirm the diagnosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and imaging are advised for effective staging of the disease. Multimodal management including surgery, radiation therapy, and/or immunotherapy are deployed. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies may result in an initial response, but do not result in a significant survival benefit. Checkpoint inhibitors have dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with metastatic MCC, and are recommended first-line in advanced cases. There is a need for well-tolerated agents with good safety profiles in patients who have failed immunotherapies.

TI  - Mapping Grasslands in Mixed Grassland Ecoregion of Saskatchewan Using Big Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial distribution information of native, mixed, and tame grasslands is essential for maintaining ecosystem health in the Prairie. This research aimed to use the latest monitoring technology to assess the remaining grasslands in Saskatchewan's mixed grassland ecoregion (MGE). The classification approach was based on 78 raster-based variables derived from big remote sensing data of multispectral optical space-borne sensors such as MODIS and Sentinel-2, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) space-borne sensors such as Sentinel-1. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a data dimensionality reduction technique to mitigate big data load and improve processing time. Random Forest (RF) was used in the classification process and incorporated the selected variables from 78 satellite-based layers and 2385 reference training points. Within the MGE, the overall accuracy of the classification was 90.2%. Native grassland had 98.20% of user's accuracy and 88.40% producer's accuracy, tame grassland had 81.4% user's accuracy and 93.8% producer's accuracy, whereas mixed grassland class had very low user's accuracy (45.8%) and producer's accuracy 82.83%. Approximately 3.46 million hectares (40.2%) of the MGE area are grasslands (33.9% native, 4% mixed, and 2.3% tame). This study establishes a novel analytical framework for reliable grassland mapping using big data, identifies future challenges, and provides valuable information for Saskatchewan and North America decision-makers.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Topography and Morphological Evolution around Authie Macrotidal Estuary (France)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide spatial and temporal coverage of remotely sensing images is an essential asset to analyze the morphological behaviour of fast-changing coastal environments such as estuarine systems. This paper investigates the reliability of intertidal topography mapping around the Authie Bay, a macrotidal estuarine system located on the northern coast of France. A Satellite-Derived Topography technique is developed by relating the green band reflectance of Sentinel-2 images to rapid variations in topography. This method is well suited to small sedimentary structures of the coastal zone with a 0.30 to 0.35 m height accuracy of the constructed Digital Elevation Model (DEM). For the more complex estuarine configuration, the waterline method was applied and resulted in the construction of DEMs with a height accuracy of 0.35 to 0.38 m. Video animations and records of Authie meander positions along transects are created from Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite archives (1984-2020). These materials allow to highlight a sedimentation phase at the east side of the spit since 2015. It constrains the main channel towards the eastern bank, thus promoting coastal erosion. The monitoring of a severe erosion phase throughout 2019 shows a 130 m retreat of the coastline. Topographic map differentiation led to the detection of a sedimentation anomaly upstream of the bay, probably linked to this erosion event.

TI  - Tracking 21st century climate dynamics of the Third Pole: An analysis of topo-climate impacts on snow cover in the central Himalaya using Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the Himalayan cryosphere has increasingly focused on climate change, considering aspects such as snow cover dynamics, precipitation and temperature trends. The Uttarakhand Himalaya is hydrologically very significant and a more comprehensive understanding of its response to climate change is needed. This paper analyses of elevation-dependent distribution and trends in snow-covered area (SCA), precipitation and temperature for the period 2000-2020 employing MODIS-Terra data, together with reanalysis (CHIRPS) and Landsat-8 data products within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The study reveals a significant increasing trend in annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation (except November) at different elevations, while SCA and temperatures exhibited more variable trends during the period. Digital elevation and spectral reflectance models reveal the effects of topography and surface attributes on snow cover. Statistical analyses reveal a significant relationship between precipitation and SCA (R2 = 0.78), while seasonal changes in temperature are apparent in an emerging pattern of warmer winters and a cooler pre-monsoon. SCA trends vary markedly between elevation zones in response to precipitation and temperature fluctuations. At higher altitudes, SCA decreased from 2000 to 2020 since, although precipitation increased slightly, marginally higher temperatures led to more snowmelt. Reduced snow cover and increased temperature are also associated with a decline in downstream fluvial during the period for which such data are available (2000 to 2005). The analysis of snow cover dynamics across different elevations improves our understanding of the overall hydrological conditions in the region and enable more reliable flood forecasting and management of water resources.

TI  - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy for Typing <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> ET12 Isolates
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The IR Biotyper and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using ClinProTools software (MALDI-TOF MS-ClinProTools) are two novel typing methods that rely on the analysis of carbohydrate and peptide residues in intact bacterial cells. These two methods have shown promising results in the rapid and accurate typing of bacteria. In this study, we evaluated these novel typing methods in comparison with genotypic typing for cluster analysis of Burkholderia cenocepacia epidemic strain ET12, isolated from adult cystic fibrosis patients. Sixty-six isolates of B. cenocepacia were used in this study, 35 of which were identified as the ET12 strain and 31 as non-ET12 strains by repetitive-element PCR (rep-PCR). Twelve isolates were used for the creation of typing models using IR Biotyper and MALDI-TOF MS-ClinProTools, and 54 isolates were used for external validation of the typing models. The IR Biotyper linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model had a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.6% for typing the epidemic strain, ET12. At a cutoff of 70%, MALDI-TOF MS-ClinProTools had 87.5% diagnostic sensitivity in detecting the ET12 strain (P = 1.00). Both methods had a diagnostic specificity of >= 80% for detecting the ET12 strain. In conclusion, IR Biotyper and MALDI-TOF MS-ClinProTools offer rapid typing using proteomics and analysis of small cellular molecules with a low running cost. Our pilot study showed suboptimal accuracy of both methods for typing outbreak strains of B. cenocepacia. Extending the spectral region analyzed by the IR Biotyper can improve the accuracy and has the potential of improving the generalizability of this technique for typing other organisms.IMPORTANCE Respiratory infections due to Burkholderia cenocepacia, particularly the ET12 epidemic strain, are considered sentinel events for persons with cystic fibrosis, as they are often associated with person-to-person transmission and accelerated decline in lung function and early mortality. Current typing methods are generally only available at reference centers, with long turn-around-times, which can affect the identification of outbreaks and critical patient triage. This pilot study aims to add to the growing literature illustrating the potential utility of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), a novel rapid method, for the successful typing of clinically significant bacteria. In this study, we evaluated its utility to discriminate between the ET12 clone and non-ET12 isolates of B. cenocepacia and compared it to proteomics cluster analysis using MALDI-TOF MS and ClinProTools software. Both methods had encouraging but suboptimal accuracy (>= 85% sensitivity and >= 83% specificity), which will likely be improved by extending the spectral region analyzed by the IR Biotyper with updated software.

TI  - Stress-Related Growth in Elite Sport Performers: Qualitative Differentiators in Psychosocial Mechanisms
T2  - SPORT PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore growth following the experience of stressors and compare the experiences of elite athletes who exhibit higher and lower levels of growth. Six elite athletes (five female and one male) participated in a semi structured interview. Three athletes reported experiencing higher levels, and three athletes reported experiencing lower levels of growth. Interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed that understanding of self, development in athletic identity, and social support are key psychological mechanisms, which differentiate elite athletes who reported experiencing higher and lower levels of growth. Athletes higher in reported growth showed greater association with meaningful behavioral actions, ultimately reflecting the modification of previously held beliefs into a new worldview. Athletes lower in reported growth reflected an attempt to maintain beliefs into an already existing worldview, thus hindering growth. The findings show psychological mechanisms that accumulatively promote growth and provide a foundation for subsequent intervention studies.

TI  - Assessment of Forest-Stand Destruction by Fires Based on Remote-Sensing Data on the Seasonal Distribution of Burned Areas
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of a lethality assessment of forest fires (the proportion of the dead forest areas in comparison to the total area affected by fire) in Russian forests for the period of 2006-2019 according to remote-sensing data. The determined dependence of the probability of pyrogenic forest destruction on the time of the fire onset and its overall impact during the season indicate that the seasonal distribution of the fire area is an informative predictor of lethality. The Seasonal Fire Lethality Index (SFLI) proposed in the article makes it possible to estimate the scale of pyrogenic destruction of Russian forests based on information obtained from satellite monitoring of the area covered by fire distribution during the fire-hazard season. The results demonstrate the presence of a linear correlation between the value of the proposed index and the values of the forest-fire lethality index. At the same time, the determination coefficient of the correlation between the two aforementioned characteristics reaches the maximum (R-2 = 0.80) on July 19; thus, this date was chosen as the climactic day of the forest-fire lethality. The linear regression equation between the characteristics of the fire lethality for Russian forests corresponding to this date allows annual remote assessment with a mean square error of +/- 10.5%. Assessment of the lethality of forest fires based on the proposed method has minimal requirements for input data, which include only information on the distribution of the forest area covered by fire during the fire-hazard season. This makes it possible to use the method on a national scale. The results can be of direct practical importance for the optimization of fire-protection regimes of Russian forests, with an accounting of the potential fire lethality.

TI  - Characteristics That Distinguish Abusive From Nonabusive Causes of Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fatal child abuse can be mistaken for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) in the emergency department setting. It is unknown if there are characteristics that distinguish abusive from nonabusive causes of SUIDs in the emergency department. Methods Using a matched case-control design, we reviewed the medical examiner records of deaths of infants younger than 12 months who were found unresponsive at a residence, required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and had a complete forensic autopsy between 2009 and 2015. Infants with a manner of death as homicide were cases; controls were those with the manner of death as accident, natural, or undetermined. Each case was matched with 5 controls based on age (months). Differences between cases and controls were evaluated with respect to demographic, parental, and household characteristics and clinical outcomes. Results We identified 12 cases (homicides) and 169 controls (nonhomicides), of which 60 were selected for the matched analysis. We found no significant differences between cases and controls with respect to age, race, sex, maternal substance use, Child Protective Services involvement prior to death, presence of male head of household, surviving siblings, or emergency medical services transport. Cases were more likely to have Child Protective Services involvement at the time of death (83% vs 38%; P = 0.01), sentinel injuries (odds ratio, 9.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-122.43), and return of spontaneous circulation (odds ratio, 29.99; 95% confidence interval, 3.70-241.30). Conclusions Child Protective Services agency involvement at time of death, sentinel injury, and return of spontaneous circulation were more often associated with abusive causes of SUID. Further study is needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Seasonal Phenological Patterns and Flavivirus Vectorial Capacity of Medically Important Mosquito Species in a Wetland and an Urban Area of Attica, Greece
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal patterns of mosquito population density and their vectorial capacity constitute major elements to understand the epidemiology of mosquito-borne diseases. Using adult mosquito traps, we compared the population dynamics of major mosquito species (Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles spp.) in an urban and a wetland rural area of Attica Greece. Pools of the captured Cx. pipiens were analyzed to determine infection rates of the West Nile virus (WNV) and the Usutu virus (USUV). The data provided were collected under the frame of the surveillance program carried out in two regional units (RUs) of the Attica region (East Attica and South Sector of Attica), during the period 2017-2018. The entomological surveillance of adult mosquitoes was performed on a weekly basis using a network of BG-sentinel traps (BGs), baited with CO2 and BG-Lure, in selected, fixed sampling sites. A total of 46,726 adult mosquitoes were collected, with larger variety and number of species in East Attica (n = 37,810), followed by the South Sector of Attica (n = 8916). The collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified to species level and evaluated for their public health importance. Collected Cx. pipiens adults were pooled and tested for West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) presence by implementation of a targeted molecular methodology (real-time PCR). A total of 366 mosquito pools were analyzed for WNV and USUV, respectively, and 38 (10.4%) positive samples were recorded for WNV, while no positive pool was detected for USUV. The majority of positive samples for WNV were detected in the East Attica region, followed by the South Sector of Attica, respectively. The findings of the current study highlight the WNV circulation in the region of Attica and the concomitant risk for the country, rendering mosquito surveillance actions and integrated mosquito management programs as imperative public health interventions.

TI  - Similarities and Contrasts in Time-Mean Striated Surface Tracers in Pacific Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems: The Role of Ocean Currents in Their Generation
T2  - FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern boundary upwelling systems feature strong zonal gradients of physical and biological properties between cool, productive coastal oceans and warm, oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Zonal currents and jets (striations) are therefore likely to contribute to the transport of water properties between coastal and open oceanic regions. For the first time, multi-sensor satellite data are used to characterize the time-mean signatures of striations in sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in subtropical eastern North/South Pacific (ENP/ESP) upwelling systems. In the ENP, tracers exhibit striated patterns extending up to ~2500 km offshore. Striated signals in SST and SSS are highly correlated with quasi-zonal jets, suggesting that these jets contribute to SST/SSS mesoscale patterns via zonal advection. Striated Chl-a anomalies are collocated with sea surface height (SSH) bands, a possible result of mesoscale eddy trains trapping nutrients and forming striated signals. In the ESP, the signature of striations is only found in SST and coincides with the SSH bands, consistently with quasi-zonal jets located outside major zonal tracer gradients. An interplay between large-scale SST/SSS advection by the quasi-zonal jets, mesoscale SST/SSS advection by the large-scale meridional flow, and eddy advection may explain the persistent ENP hydrographic signature of striations. These results underline the importance of quasi-zonal jets for surface tracer structuring at the mesoscale.

TI  - Descriptive Capability of Datasets as Proxy of Sea Water Temperature in Coastal Systems: An Evaluation from the Aegean Sea
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific and technological progresses have introduced diverse data sources for seawater temperature over broad temporal and spatial ranges. Here, we investigated the performance of satellite and model-based seawater temperature data for different temporal composites and depths. We applied an in-situ temperature time-series obtained in a coastal bottom in the Aegean Sea over three years, as the reference. Both datasets showed largely significant relationships based on cross-correlation analyses and presented descriptive properties of the in-situ conditions at corresponding depths. Based on the results of analyses, the modeling datasets presented more reliable results and representations of in-situ conditions than the datasets obtained from satellite for the coastal region. However, the datasets obtained from the satellite also provided reliable data for all time frames investigated, particularly in the mixed surface layer. Monthly datasets were more effective in providing descriptive values in long term studies. This is the first detailed study to explore the descriptive capacities of modeling for water temperature in coastal environments. According to the results, the selection of a dataset as a proxy for seawater temperature requires careful consideration. The present study provides an extensive baseline for evaluating the suitability of the application of specific datasets as proxies in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Structural characteristics of the Qena Bend of the Egyptian Nile River, using remote-sensing and geophysics
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qena Bend of the Nile River, named after Qena town in Upper Egypt, is considered a remarkable geomorphological feature in southern Egypt. It is unique and its geodynamic formation is still not fully understood. This study addresses the relationship between the bend geometry and the structural setting of the underlying basement complex using remotely sensed and aeromagnetic data. The hillshade and drainage extraction algorithms were applied to the digital elevation model (DEM) of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) to define the lineaments dissecting the limestone plateaus and control the Nile Valley cliffs. Moreover, the Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence image was derived from two Sentinel-1 images to delineate and/or confirm the structures, which underlie and control the sand dunes movement. In addition, various edge-detection derivatives were applied on the reduced-to-pole (RTP) aeromagnetic anomaly to define the basement structures. The results showed the derived surface and subsurface structures are controlled by the NW-SE and NE-SW trends of the Suez-Red Sea, Aqaba-Dead Sea, and Qena-Safaga Shear Zone. The RTP anomaly reveals a strong NE- SW positive anomaly zone coinciding with the bend. The magnetic 2D forward modelling and 3D depth inversion suggest the basement consists of granitic rocks (0.02 - 0.033 cgs) and the positive anomaly below the bend probably attributes to a major uplift at a depth of 750 m. This uplift broke the plateau forming NE-SW-oriented weak structural zones along which the bend was developed. (c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Conspiracy Theories and Religion: Reframing Conspiracy Theories as <i>Bliks</i>
T2  - EPISTEME-A JOURNAL OF INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conspiracy theories have largely been framed by the academy as a stigmatised form of knowledge. Yet recent scholarship has included calls to take conspiracy theories more seriously as an area of study with a desire to judge them on their own merits rather than an a priori dismissal of them as a class of explanation. This paper argues that the debates within the philosophy of religion, long overlooked by scholars of conspiracy theories, can help sow the seeds for re-examining our understanding of conspiracy theories in a more balanced and nuanced way. The nature of religious belief is elemental to understanding the epistemological foundations of the conspiracy theorising worldview amidst what we may call 'conspiratorial ambiguity'. Specifically, R.M. Hare's concept of bilks, which are unfalsifiable but meaningful worldviews, offers a way forward to reframe our approach towards the theory of conspiracy theories.

TI  - Analysis of the groundwater scenario with respect to the crop water productivity for the Betwa-Dhasan river basin, Bundelkhand using remote sensing techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive water use in the agricultural sector in the Betwa-Dhasan basin of the Bundelkhand region is becoming the cause of irrepressible drawdown in the groundwater level. These changing dynamics are becoming the cause of water scarcity in the basin and increasing difficulty in fulfilling the water demand of the area. For incorporating the water-saving agricultural practices in the region, it is essential to have a precise estimation of the crop water productivity (CWP) and evapotranspiration (ET) at the basin scale. In this analysis, the Kharif and Rabi seasons of 2004-2005, 2009-2010, and 2013-2014 have been included. The ET and CWP have been calculated for all the seasons. The MODIS satellite imageries have been used for calculating the ET using the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) algorithm. The highest CWP has been recorded as 2.56 kg/m(3) for the Rabi season 2014. With the increase in the demand for water for irrigation and agricultural purposes, the groundwater gets depleted. The decadal groundwater fluctuation map of the Rabi season (2005-2014) shows that groundwater gets depleted by more than 30 m within this period in some of the river basin regions situated in the Jhansi and Tikamgarh districts.

TI  - LITIGATION ISSUES IN THE TREATMENT OF CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS-AN ONGOING CHALLENGE
T2  - ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rupture of a brain aneurysm triggers a serious form of hemorrhagic stroke, the aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This serious affliction that often presents as a sentinel headache is often mistaken for a migraine and quickly dismissed, with devastating consequences. Once an accurate diagnosis is made, supporting therapeutical measures are in place until the aneurysm is secured but sealing the aneurysm off is the only permanent treatment that eliminates the risk of a rebleeding, which is fatal in 90% of cases. The main clinical struggles that can be used as ground for litigation in aSAH are the misdiagnosis at presentation and failure to complete the aneurysm occlusion in a time-efficient manner. This article is based on the following hypotheses: 1. What represents a serious ground for litigation in case of a patient with aSAH? and 2. What constitutes a litigation issue for the physician in case of a ruptured aneurysm that hasn???t been secured (either by surgical clipping or endovascular coiling)?

TI  - Multi-Temporal Evaluation of Quantitative and Phenological Vegetation Dynamics Using Sentinel-2 Images in North Horr (Kenya)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Horn of Africa is getting drier. This research aims at assessing browning and/or greening dynamics and the suitability of Sentinel-2 satellite images to map changes in land cover in a semiarid area. Vegetation dynamics are assessed through a remote sensing approach based on densely vegetated areas in a pilot area of North Horr Sub-County, in northern Kenya, between 2016-2020. Four spectral vegetation indices are calculated from Sentinel-2 images to create annual multi-temporal images. Two different supervised classification methods-Minimum Distance and Spectral Angle Mapper-are then applied in order to identify dense vegetated areas. A general greening is found to have occurred in this period with the exception of the year 2020, with an average annual percentage increase of 19%. Results also highlight a latency between climatic conditions and vegetation growth. This approach is for the first time applied in North Horr Sub-County and supports local decision-making processes for sustainable land management strategies.

TI  - The Impossibility of Automating Ambiguity
T2  - ARTIFICIAL LIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - On the one hand, complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches emphasize that people, as complex adaptive systems, are ambiguous, indeterminable, and inherently unpredictable. On the other, Machine Learning (ML) systems that claim to predict human behaviour are becoming ubiquitous in all spheres of social life. I contend that ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML systems are close descendants of the Cartesian and Newtonian worldview in so far as they are tools that fundamentally sort, categorize, and classify the world, and forecast the future. Through the practice of clustering, sorting, and predicting human behaviour and action, these systems impose order, equilibrium, and stability to the active, fluid, messy, and unpredictable nature of human behaviour and the social world at large. Grounded in complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches, this article emphasizes why people, embedded in social systems, are indeterminable and unpredictable. When ML systems "pick up" patterns and clusters, this often amounts to identifying historically and socially held norms, conventions, and stereotypes. Machine prediction of social behaviour, I argue, is not only erroneous but also presents real harm to those at the margins of society.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is one of the most commonly occurring natural disasters affecting lives and properties. One of the major causes of flood in low-lying areas or coastal areas is cyclones. The paper aims to assess the effect of cyclone Bulbul that occurred on 9th November 2019 and water inundation caused in South 24 Parganas, East Medinipur, and North 24 Parganas districts of West Bengal. Sentinel 1 data of 10 m spatial resolution for pre and post-event was used for the study. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) tools were utilized to process and analyse the SAR data. The output of the study was prepared in the form of an illustrative water inundation map. The analysis result showed that out of the three districts, South 24 Parganas showed the maximum changes in the water inundation after the event. The changes in the water inundated area from pre-event to post-event were 99.922 km(2) to 149.22 km(2); 196.36 km(2) to 195.93 km(2) and 497.27 km(2) to 505.14 km(2) for South 24 Pargana, East Medinipur, and North 24 Pargana districts, respectively. From the study, it was concluded that RS and GIS applications are convenient, effective, and fast techniques for the assessment of water inundation caused due to natural disasters.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Despite relatively simple prevention and treatment, syphilis remains a major social and public health concern worldwide, particularly in developing nations. Objective To estimate the prevalence and to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with syphilis infection among antenatal-care (ANC) attendees in Meghalaya, India. Materials and Method A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing National HIV Sentinel Surveillance of Meghalaya, January-March 2017. Pregnant women aged 15-49 years (n = 3015) were recruited consecutively, interviewed, and tested for syphilis by Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test in eight selected ANC sites representing all districts of Meghalaya. Results Prevalence of syphilis was found to be 1.03 % (95% CI = 0.67-1.39) (31/3015). Prevalence was maximum among illiterates with gradual lowering of adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with improvement of education. Women whose husbands had no income were associated with higher risk (AOR = 4.97, 95% CI = 1.11-22.20) of syphilis. Significant risk (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.02-5.74) was also observed with Jaintia Hills residents as compared to Garo Hills. Conclusions As high prevalence of gestational syphilis was identified in Meghalaya along with important sociodemographic predictors, evidence to policy translation is required at state and national level to scale up prevention, screening, and management of syphilis

TI  - Analyzing Causes for the Environmental Disaster in Kamchatka in Autumn 2020 Due to a Red Tide Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of integrated space studies of the environmental emergency near the Kamchatka Peninsula which caused the mass death of hydrobionts in autumn 2020. This research is based on the processing and analysis of long-term series of optical multispectral and radar satellite images of the sea surface (similar to 22 000 scenes), including data on the sea surface temperature (from 1981 to 2020) and the concentration of chlorophyll a (from 2000 to 2020). It is revealed that there were strong positive temperature anomalies in the study area in July-September 2020 (the deviations from the climatic norm reached 6 degrees C), which led to a significant change in the biogenic regime and an abnormal increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a (by almost 3.5 times) in late September-early October 2020. This was the main natural factor that led to the development of harmful algal blooms (red tide), which caused the death of hydrobionts both in the Avacha Gulf and in the coastal waters of the entire Kamchatka Peninsula. Based on the results of an analysis of satellite data, it is shown that the possible anthropogenic contribution and contribution of other natural factors to the environmental disaster is insignificant.

AB  - Thermal-field anomalies recorded during the preparation and occurrence of strong earthquakes on March 8, 2010 (M = 6.1), and January 24, 2020 (M = 6.7), in Turkey, are studied using satellite data. Temperatures of the surface and atmospheric near-surface layer, as well as outgoing longwave radiation registered by the AIRS sensor of the Aqua satellite, are used for the analysis. The processing results have allowed us to establish that positive variations in surface and atmosphere temperatures appeared 7-12 days before the studied seismic events with M = 6.1 and M = 6.7, and these variations marked the onset of formation of the outgoing longwave radiation anomalies registered over the North and East Anatolian tectonic faults. The thermal-field anomalies detected during the preparation of the earthquakes in Turkey confirm the presence of heat generation effects between the surface and the upper cloud edge. These effects can be used as short-term remotely registered precursors of strong seismic events.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the study of the condition of the territory and waste deposits of the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill using radar and optical satellite data are presented. The Earth's surface deformations in the area of waste deposits are analyzed using the method of differential radar interferometry applied to the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band radar satellite data. By processing the C-band radar data from the Sentinel-1B satellite using the method of multitemporal SBAS interferometric measurements, two blocks are found in the study area, one of which is rising and the other one of which is subsiding. The difference between deformations over the period from 2017 to 2020 reached 17-19 mm. A significant correlation in determining waste water content between radar-backscatter intensity measurements (Sentinel-1B satellite) and optical data (Sentinel-2A/B satellites) using the NDWI water index is revealed.

TI  - Fusion of SAR Interferometry and Polarimetry Methods for Landslide Reactivation Study, the Bureya River (Russia) Event Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the estimation capabilities of landslide reactivation based on various SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) methods: Cloude-Pottier decomposition of Sentinel-1 dual polarimetry data, MT-InSAR (Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) techniques, and cloud computing of backscattering time series. The object of the study is the landslide in the east of Russia that took place on 11 December 2018 on the Bureya River. H-alpha-A polarimetric decomposition of C-band radar images not detected significant transformations of scattering mechanisms for the surface of the rupture, whereas L-band radar data show changes in scattering mechanisms before and after the main landslide. The assessment of ground displacements along the surface of the rupture in the 2019-2021 snowless periods was carried out using MT-InSAR methods. These displacements were 40 mm/year along the line of sight. The SBAS-InSAR results have allowed us to reveal displacements of great area in 2020 and 2021 snowless periods that were 30-40 mm/year along the line-of-sight. In general, the results obtained by MT-InSAR methods showed, on the one hand, the continuation of displacements along the surface of the rupture and on the other hand, some stabilization of the rate of landslide processes.

TI  - Temporal connections between long-term Landsat time-series and tree-rings in an urban-rural temperate forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series of satellite-derived vegetation proxies and tree-rings widths (TRW) are similar, providing temporal records of forest productivity change from different perspectives and processes. Previous research on this relationship has focused on temperature or moisture limited coniferous forests, using lower spatial resolution (e.g., 8000 m) satellites and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to test relationships over 15-30 years. There is an opportunity to leverage recent advances in building Landsat (30 m) time-series to expand comparisons into new forest types (e.g., coniferous vs. deciduous), areas (e.g., fragmented forests) and over longer periods (e.g., nearly 50 years). However, a better understanding of factors that influence relationship strength is required. We compared tree-ring measurements, converted to a ring width index (RWI), and Landsat tasseled cap angle (TCA) derived canopy cover (CC) from 1972 to 2018 across 16 deciduous, mixed, and coniferous stands in southern Ontario, Canada. For all chronologies, overall relationship strength was assessed with correlation approaches (RWI-CC, both vs. climate), and shorter-term increase-decline trends were compared with segmented regression. There were significant forest type differences, with coniferous chronologies correlating stronger with CC than deciduous. Deciduous chronologies and CC had opposite connections with summer temperature, with climate warming increasing CC and coniferous RWI but not deciduous RWI from 1980 to 2010. More recent decline at most sites appears related to a major ice storm, but multiple factors may be coexisting. We tested the utility of tree-rings for validating nearly 50 years of Landsat-observed change in urban-rural temperate forests, identifying useful connections at coniferous sites. However, there are limitations to comparing long-term Landsat time-series (based on yearly summer data) with annual tree-ring growth.

TI  - Satellite Multi/Hyper Spectral HR Sensors for Mapping the <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> in South Mediterranean Islands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean basin is a hot spot of climate change where the Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (PO) and other seagrasses are under stress due to its effect on marine coastal habitats and the rising influence of anthropogenic activities (i.e., tourism, fishery). The PO and seabed ecosystems, in the coastal environments of Pantelleria and Lampedusa, suffer additional growing impacts from tourism in synergy with specific stress factors due to increasing vessel traffic for supplying potable water and fossil fuels for electrical power generation. Earth Observation (EO) data, provided by high resolution (HR) multi/hyperspectral operative satellite sensors of the last generation (i.e., Sentinel 2 MSI and PRISMA) have been successfully tested, using innovative calibration and sea truth collecting methods, for monitoring and mapping of PO meadows under stress, in the coastal waters of these islands, located in the Sicily Channel, to better support the sustainable management of these vulnerable ecosystems. The area of interest in Pantelleria was where the first prototype of the Italian Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter (ISWEC) for renewable energy production was installed in 2015, and sea truth campaigns on the PO meadows were conducted. The PO of Lampedusa coastal areas, impacted by ship traffic linked to the previous factors and tropicalization effects of Italy's southernmost climate change transitional zone, was mapped through a multi/hyper spectral EO-based approach, using training/testing data provided by side scan sonar data, previously acquired. Some advanced machine learning algorithms (MLA) were successfully evaluated with different supervised regression/classification models to map seabed and PO meadow classes and related Leaf Area Index (LAI) distributions in the areas of interest, using multi/hyperspectral data atmospherically corrected via different advanced approaches.

TI  - Assessing the Utility of Sentinel-1 Coherence Time Series for Temperate and Tropical Forest Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study tested the ability of Sentinel-1 C-band to separate forest from other common land use classes (i.e., urban, low vegetation and water) at two different sites. The first site is characterized by temperate forests and rough terrain while the second by tropical forest and near-flat terrain. We trained a support vector machine classifier using increasing feature sets starting from annual backscatter statistics (average, standard deviation) and adding long-term coherence (i.e., coherence estimate for two acquisitions with a large time difference), as well as short-term (six to twelve days) coherence statistics from annual time series. Classification accuracies using all feature sets was high (>92% overall accuracy). For temperate forests the overall accuracy improved by up to 5% when coherence features were added: long-term coherence reduced misclassification of forest as urban, whereas short-term coherence statistics reduced the misclassification of low vegetation as forest. Classification accuracy for tropical forests showed little differences across feature sets, as the annual backscatter statistics sufficed to separate forest from low vegetation, the other dominant land cover. Our results show the importance of coherence for forest classification over rough terrain, where forest omission error was reduced up to 11%.

TI  - Contribution of phytoecological data to spatialize soil erosion: Application of the RUSLE model in the Algerian atlas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the models used to assess water erosion, the RUSLE model is commonly used. Policy makers can act on cover (C-factor) and conservation practice (P-factor) to reduce erosion, with less costly action on soil surface characteristics. However, the widespread use of vegetation indices such as NDVI does not allow for a proper assessment of the C-factor in drylands where stones, crusted surfaces and litter strongly influence soil protection. Two sub-factors of C, canopy cover (CC) and soil cover (SC), can be assessed from phytoecological measurements that include gravel-pebbles cover, physical mulch, annual and perennial vegetation. This paper introduces a method to calculate the C-factor from phytoecological data and, in combination with remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS), to map it over large areas. A supervised classification, based on field phytoecological data, is applied to radiometric data from Landsat-8/OLI satellite images. Then, a C-factor value, whose SC and CC subfactors are directly derived from the phytoecological measurements, is assigned to each land cover unit. This method and RUSLE are implemented on a pilot region of 3828 km(2) of the Saharan Atlas, composed of rangelands and steppe formations, and intended to become an observatory. The protective effect against erosion by gravel-pebbles (50%) is more than twice that of vegetation (23%). The C-factor derived from NDVI (0.67) is higher and more evenly distributed than that combining these two contributions (0.37 on average). Finally, priorities are proposed to decision-makers by crossing the synthetic map of erosion sensitivity and a decision matrix of management priorities.

TI  - Techniques for sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - MINERVA SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is the standard of care in women with breast cancer (BC) and clinically nonsuspicious axillary lymph nodes (LNs), due to its high negative predictive value (NPV) in the assessment of nodal status. SNB has significantly reduced complications related to the axillary lymph node dissection, such as lymphedema and upper limb dysfunction. The gold standard technique for SNB is the blue dye (BD) and technetium labelled nanocolloid (Tc-99m) double technique. However, nuclear medicine is not available in all Institutions and several new tracers and devices have been proposed, such as indocyanine green (ICG) and superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIO). All these techniques show an accuracy and detection rate not inferior to that of the standard technique, with different specific pros and cons. The choice of how to perform a SNB primarily depends on the surgeon's confidence with the procedure, the availability of nuclear medicine and the economic resources of the Institutions. In this setting, new tracers, hybrid tracers and imaging techniques are being evaluated in order to improve the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) and minimize the number of unnecessary axillary surgeries through an accurate preoperative assessment of nodal status and to guide new minimally invasive diagnostic procedures of SNs. In particular, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an active field of research but cannot be recommended for clinical use at this time. The ICG fluorescence technique was superior in terms of DR, as well as having the lowest FNR. The DR descending order was SPIO, Tc, dual modality (Tc/BD), CEUS and BD. This paper is a narrative review of the most common SNB techniques in BC with a focus on recent innovations.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the south-east of England
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and highly aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy of the skin. Its incidence is increasing with half of cases involving the head and neck. To the best of our knowledge, few large studies have been published in the UK, and to date this is the largest reported series of head and neck MCC. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of patients with MCC in three hospitals in the south-east of England over a 12 -year period (2008-2019). Diagnosis was based on histological data following biopsy. Overall survival and disease-specific survival were calculated using Kaplan Meier and log -rank tests. Fifty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria (24 stage I, 22 stage II, 9 stage III, and 3 unclassified). Median disease -free survival was 36 months (95% CI 0 to 77.2) and median overall survival 50 months (95% CI 29.9 to 70). Overall five-year survival was 34.4% (95% CI 17% to 52%) with two-year survival at 62% (95% CI 48% to 76%). Five-year disease-free survival was 26.7% (95% CI 17 to 52%) with two-year disease-free survival at 54% (95% CI 40% to 68%). To date, this is the largest UK based study reporting overall and disease -free survival associated with MCC of the head and neck. Half the patients presented late, and surgery was the mainstay of treatment, augmented by adjuvant radiotherapy. There is a need to better stratify patients at risk of developing metastatic disease, with the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy and positron-emission tomography -computed tomography (PET-CT), as immunotherapy and targeted agents are now available to treat advanced disease.

TI  - AVAILABILITY AND COMPARISON OF DATA FROM SENTINEL-1 SATELLITES IN AREAS OF INTEREST IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND SUDAN
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-STAVEBNI OBZOR
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is focused on the methodology of processing interferometric images and associated challenges with the processing. The article also contains useful links with explanations that can be used for processing data from the Sentinel-1 satellite. To emphasize the data limits of Sentinel-1, several areas of interest were chosen for comparison - in the home environment of the Czech Republic, the Bilina quarry area, and the Zatec area were selected. For subsequent comparison, arid areas with a rich history located in Sudan were selected. The colleagues of the author from the Faculty of The Environment of Jan Evangelista Purkyne University participate in expeditions there. Each of these locations is limited by different parameters - the areas in the Czech Republic are mainly limited by location because of occurring vegetation. Sudan's regions, on the other hand, are arid but are limited by insufficient coverage by capturing the Sentinel-1 satellite. To create digital height models from Sentinel-1 satellite data, it is necessary to search for data with sufficient coherence of images, and parameters of the amount of vegetation with a period between individual images play an important role. The areas were compared with each other and with the commonly available SRTM elevation model, both from a visual point of view - where digital height models and shaded surface models were created, as well as statistically using RMSE.

TI  - Vicarious Calibration of eMAS, AirMSPI, and AVIRIS Sensors During FIREX-AQ
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing instruments, both aircraft and on-orbit platforms, undergo extensive laboratory calibrations to determine their geometric, spectral, and radiometric responses. Additional in-flight radiometric calibrations can be performed using well-characterized earth targets. The Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign provided such an opportunity when the ER-2 aircraft overflew Railroad Valley on August 13 and 15, 2019. Surface reflectances were available from the August 4, 2019 field team and from the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) portal, and spectral aerosol optical depths from an on-site AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sunphotometer. The Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS), the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), and the "Classic" Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) sensors individually performed a vicarious calibration using their respective methodologies and selection of input parameters. A comparison of the at-sensor radiances predicted from these independent analyses highlights some of the uncertainties in the inputs, including choice of solar irradiance model. Although good agreement, within 5%, is found at visible wavelengths, difference can be as large as 15% in the shortwave infrared (SWIR). This highlights the need for the remote sensing community to agree upon a standard solar model, to remove sensor-to-sensor biases derived from in-flight calibrations.

TI  - Conserving Working Rangelands: A Social-Ecological Case Study from Northeastern Colorado
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land changes in rangeland systems cascade through interconnected social and ecological spheres, affecting both humans and the environment. This study applied a multi-method approach to examine the causes and consequences of change in two rangeland communities in northeastern (NE) Colorado. First, this study used a Random Forest supervised classifier to analyze 36 years of land-cover data and create a land-cover/use change classification model. Second, the research team analyzed transcripts of interviews with 32 ranchers, examining how ranchers' adaptive strategies influence land-cover change trends. Lastly, the analysis integrated the quantitative and qualitative data, constructing a social-ecological rangeland change conceptual model. This study found that the cultivated area decreased in both study sites from 1984-2019, with 16.0% and 18.7% of each site transitioning out of the cultivated area. Moreover, 10.3% and 18.4% of each site, respectively, transitioned to herbaceous/grassland cover from 1984-2019. The qualitative analysis identified the role of conservation policies, such as open space programs, on land change. Also, despite the relatively small area that transitioned to developed cover-1.83% and 0.183% of each site-participants emphasized that the associated demographic and cultural shifts drive land-use change. This study highlights that while rangelands are undergoing social-ecological change, land-use decisions and land conservation programs can help mitigate the global trend of declining rangeland and grassland cover.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover (LULC) change is a major concern in Africa's river basins and policy makers, environmentalists and other stakeholders tackling biodiversity and sustainable development issues in these watersheds require accurate information on past, present and future LULC projections to develop management strategies for the concerned watersheds. This study assessed the historical, current and future LULC changes in Mpologoma catchment. Remote sensing and supervised classification were used to analyze 33-year multitemporal LULC changes in Mpologoma catchment while future patterns for the next two decades were predicted using the Cellular Automata-Markov modelling technique in TerrSet's Land Change Modeler. Initially, in 1986, the catchment was dominated by grassland (32.08%). However, most grassland (92.77%) was gradually converted to subsistence farming (75%) and built-up (15.7%). Grassland, woodland and wetland annually declined at a rate of 5.52%, 2.47% and 0.63% respectively while farmland and built-up expanded at 9.32% and 6.22% respectively and by 2019 subsistence farming was the dominant class (53.16%). Prediction results showed that by 2039, woodland, grassland, wetland and open water will decrease while there will be major increases in built-up and commercial farming from 11.61% to 27.91% and 0.18% to 0.34% respectively. Subsistence farming will continue to be the dominant land use by 2039 attributed to gains from woodland (4.7%), grassland (3.7%) and wetland (4.9%). These LULC changes indicate an intensifying land use pressure in Mpologoma catchment and provide useful information for land use planners, environmentalists and policymakers in this catchment to consider when planning for sustainable management of the watershed.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - The European Forest Condition Monitor: Using Remotely Sensed Forest Greenness to Identify Hot Spots of Forest Decline
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest decline, in course of climate change, has become a frequently observed phenomenon. Much of the observed decline has been associated with an increasing frequency of climate change induced hotter droughts while decline induced by flooding, late-frost, and storms also play an important role. As a consequence, tree mortality rates have increased across the globe. Despite numerous studies that have assessed forest decline and predisposing factors for tree mortality, we still lack an in-depth understanding of (I) underlying eco-physiological mechanisms, (II) the influence of varying environmental conditions related to soil, competition, and micro-climate, and (III) species-specific strategies to cope with prolonged environmental stress. To deepen our knowledge within this context, studying tree performance within larger networks seems a promising research avenue. Ideally such networks are already established during the actual period of environmental stress. One approach for identifying stressed forests suitable for such monitoring networks is to assess measures related to tree vitality in near real-time across large regions by means of satellite-borne remote sensing. Within this context, we introduce the European Forest Condition monitor (EFCM)-a remote-sensing based, freely available, interactive web information tool. The EFCM depicts forest greenness (as approximated using NDVI from MODIS at a spatial resolution of roughly 5.3 hectares) for the pixel-specific growing season across Europe and consequently allows for guiding research within the context of concurrent forest performance. To allow for inter-temporal comparability and account for pixel-specific features, all observations are set in relation to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) records over the monitoring period beginning in 2001. The EFCM provides both a quantile-based and a proportion-based product, thereby allowing for both relative and absolute comparison of forest greenness over the observational record. Based on six specific examples related to spring phenology, drought, late-frost, tree die-back on water-logged soils, an ice storm, and windthrow we exemplify how the EFCM may help identifying hotspots of extraordinary forest greenness. We discuss advantages and limitations when monitoring forest condition at large scales on the basis of moderate resolution remote sensing products to guide users toward an appropriate interpretation.

TI  - Groundwater recharge rate estimation using remotely sensed and ground-based data: A method application in the mesoscale Thur catchment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The mesoscale Thur catchment located in the north-eastern part of Switzerland is a study site in which a range of hydrological research has been conducted.Study focus: Groundwater recharge is challenging to quantify due to the complexity of hydrogeological processes and limited observations. Because of its spatiotemporal availability, remotely sensed data present an attractive water management tool. Its application in mesoscale catchments (10 - 10(4) km(2)) however, remains limited. This study investigated the use of satellite products used in conjunction with ground-based data to determine spatiotemporal variations in water available for groundwater recharge. Gridded components from readily available precipitation, evapotranspiration, and hydrological discharge data were used to generate spatiotemporal maps over a 20-year period.New hydrological insights for the region: Closure of the water balance found that monthly data displayed a moderate correlation, with improved correlations of obtained seasonal and annual intervals, suggesting that over the long-term the Thur catchment is in a steady state. Maps were generated and trends for the 20-year period assessed. Examination of the gridded water balance components for different hydrological years emphasized the limiting effect of precipitation on recharge. This study highlights the value of remotely sensed data in groundwater recharge estimates, but emphasises the importance of continued ground-based monitoring; the lack of which is a limiting factor in water management where mesoscale catchments are concerned.

TI  - Variant-to-gene mapping in human microglial cell models with CRISPR validation implicates RTFDC1 at the Alzheimer's disease 'CASS4' locus.
T2  - Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has principally focused on neurons due to their role in neurodegeneration. In contrast, recent studies suggest that genetic mechanisms drive microglia to prolonged inflammation in AD brains, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Indeed, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD have identified multiple loci near genes related to microglial function, such as TREM2 and CR1. However, GWAS does not have the sensitivity to identify causal variants or effector genes. We used a combination of ATAC-seq and high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C in two human microglial cell models to map interactions between GWAS-implicated variants and their putative effector genes. We then validated an observed interaction at the 'CASS4' locus using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.METHOD: Improving on the relatively low resolution of available Hi-C data, we employed high resolution Capture-C to characterize the physical genome-wide interactions of all human promoters. We performed this in the human microglial cell line HMC3 and human iPSC-derived microglia (iMg). We confirmed the enhancer activity of a SNP we elected to pursue and its associated regulatory element using dual-luciferase assays. To confirm the regulatory interaction with the Capture-C implicated effector gene, we used lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 to delete an approximately 300bp region containing the SNP in HMC3 cells. We then confirmed changes in RNA and protein expression using RNA-seq and Western blotting, respectively.RESULT: Variant-to-gene mapping in both microglial cell models identified 67 putative effector genes (51 coding) across both cell types, with 14 observed in both models. We identified a novel proxy SNP, rs6024870 (r2 = 0.93 to sentinel SNP rs6014724), at the 'CASS4' locus, which coincided with open chromatin and directly contacted the promoter of RTFDC1, a gene not previously implicated in AD. Deletion of the putative enhancer region harboring rs6024870 by CRISPR-Cas9 in HMC3 reduced the expression of RTFDC1 at both the mRNA and protein level. We also note that CASS4 levels were modestly influenced by this CRISPR-mediated perturbation.CONCLUSION: We implicate RTFDC1 as a novel effector gene at the AD 'CASS4' GWAS locus. Further efforts will characterize the phenotypic effect of this variant in microglial cell models, including on inflammation and phagocytic activity.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection means determining the presence or absence of clouds in a pixel in a satellite image, and acts as an important factor affecting the utility and accuracy of the satellite image. In this study, among the satellites of various advanced organizations that provide cloud detection data, we intend to perform quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis on the difference between the cloud detection data of GK-2A/AMI, Terra/MODIS, and Suomi-NPP/VIIRS. As a result of quantitative comparison, the Proportion Correct (PC) index values in January were 74.16% for GK-2A & MODIS, 75.39% for GK-2A & VIIRS, and 87.35% for GK-2A & MODIS in April, and GK- 2A & VIIRS showed that 87.71% of clouds were detected in April compared to January without much difference by satellite. As for the qualitative comparison results, when compared with RGB images, it was confirmed that the results corresponding to April rather than January detected clouds better than the previous quantitative results. However, if thin clouds or snow cover exist, each satellite were some differences in the cloud detection results.

TI  - A Supplementary Module to Improve Accuracy of the Quality Assessment Band in Landsat Cloud Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud contamination is a serious obstacle for the application of Landsat data. To popularize the applications of Landsat data, each Landsat image includes the corresponding Quality Assessment (QA) band, in which cloud and cloud shadow pixels have been flagged. However, previous studies suggested that Landsat QA band still needs to be modified to fulfill the requirement of Landsat data applications. In this study, we developed a Supplementary Module to improve the original QA band (called QA_SM). On one hand, QA_SM extracts spectral and geometrical features in the target Landsat cloud image from the original QA band. On the other, QA_SM incorporates the temporal change characteristics of clouds and cloud shadows between the target and reference images. We tested the new method at four local sites with different land covers and the Landsat-8 cloud cover validation dataset ("L8_Biome"). The experimental results show that QA_SM performs better than the original QA band and the multi-temporal method ATSA (Automatic Time-Series Analyses). QA_SM decreases omission errors of clouds and shadows in the original QA band effectively but meanwhile does not increase commission errors. Besides, the better performance of QA_SM is less affected by the selections of reference images because QA_SM considers the temporal change of land surface reflectance that is not caused by cloud contamination. By further designing a quantitative assessment experiment, we found that the QA band generated by QA_SM improves cloud-removal performance on Landsat cloud images, suggesting the benefits of the new method to advance the applications of Landsat data.

TI  - Genome Sequencing Identifies Previously Unrecognized <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> Outbreaks in Neonatal Intensive Care Units in the Philippines
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a critically important pathogen in the Philippines. Isolates are commonly resistant to at least 2 classes of antibiotics, yet mechanisms and spread of its resistance are not well studied.Methods. A retrospective sequencing survey was performed on carbapenem-, extended spectrum beta-lactam-, and cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated at 20 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance sentinel sites from 2015 through 2017. We characterized 259 isolates using biochemical methods, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Known AMR mechanisms were identified. Potential outbreaks were investigated by detecting clusters from epidemiologic, phenotypic, and genome-derived data.Results. Prevalent AMR mechanisms detected include bla(CTX-M-15) (76.8%) and bla(NDM-1) (37.5%). An epidemic IncFII(Yp) plasmid carrying bla(NDM-1) was also detected in 46 isolates from 6 sentinel sites and 14 different sequence types (STs). This plasmid was also identified as the main vehicle of carbapenem resistance in 2 previously unrecognized local outbreaks of ST348 and ST283 at 2 different sentinel sites. A third local outbreak of ST397 was also identified but without the IncFII(Yp) plasmid. Isolates in each outbreak site showed identical STs and K- and O-loci, and similar resistance profiles and AMR genes. All outbreak isolates were collected from blood of children aged < 1 year.Conclusion. WGS provided a better understanding of the epidemiology of multidrug resistant Klebsiella in the Philippines, which was not possible with only phenotypic and epidemiologic data. The identification of 3 previously unrecognized Klebsiella outbreaks highlights the utility of WGS in outbreak detection, as well as its importance in public health and in implementing infection control programs.

AB  - Many examples of Irish folklore reflect and instill enduring conceptions about the workings, vulnerability, and viability of community, which is understood to be a doing, a project in need of continual maintenance. Arguably, there has been no more devastating blow to the vernacular understanding of community as social contract for mutual support than the mid-nineteenth-century Famine in Ireland. If folklore provides models for contemplating and reproducing ideas about how community may be enacted, it also bears witness to the haunting consequences of abandoning community.

TI  - Deep Learning Application to Surface Properties Retrieval Using TIR Measurements: A Fast Forward/Reverse Scheme to Deal with Big Data Analysis from New Satellite Generations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, technology advancement has led to an enormous increase in the amount of satellite data. The availability of huge datasets of remote sensing measurements to be processed, and the increasing need for near-real-time data analysis for operational uses, has fostered the development of fast, efficient-retrieval algorithms. Deep learning techniques were recently applied to satellite data for retrievals of target quantities. Forward models (FM) are a fundamental part of retrieval code development and mission design, as well. Despite this, the application of deep learning techniques to radiative transfer simulations is still underexplored. The DeepLIM project, described in this work, aimed at testing the feasibility of the application of deep learning techniques at the design of the retrieval chain of an upcoming satellite mission. The Land Surface Temperature Mission (LSTM) is a candidate for Sentinel 9 and has, as the main target, the need, for the agricultural community, to improve sustainable productivity. To do this, the mission will carry a thermal infrared sensor to retrieve land-surface temperature and evapotranspiration rate. The LSTM land-surface temperature retrieval chain is used as a benchmark to test the deep learning performances when applied to Earth observation studies. Starting from aircraft campaign data and state-of-the-art FM simulations with the DART model, deep learning techniques are used to generate new spectral features. Their statistical behavior is compared to the original technique to test the generation performances. Then, the high spectral resolution simulations are convolved with LSTM spectral response functions to obtain the radiance in the LSTM spectral channels. Simulated observations are analyzed using two state-of-the-art retrieval codes and deep learning-based algorithms. The performances of deep learning algorithms show promising results for both the production of simulated spectra and target parameters retrievals, one of the main advances being the reduction in computational costs.

TI  - Clarifying the Smokescreen of Russian Protected Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although in strictly protected areas no forest management and logging activities should be evident, a preliminary study detected that, even in the 200 areas with the highest protection of Russia, more than 2 Mha of trees have been lost between 2001 and 2018. Nonetheless, a relevant percentage of the actual drivers of tree loss in Russian strictly protected areas was surrounded by uncertainties due to several factors. Here, in an attempt to "clarify the smokescreen of Russian protected areas", by validating previous remotely sensed data with new high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial images of land-use change, we shed more light on what has happened during the last 20 years. We used the same layer of tree loss from 2001 to 2020 but, instead of intersecting it with the MODIS data that could have been a source of underestimation of burned surfaces, we overlapped it to the layer of tree cover loss by dominant driver. We analysed the main drivers of tree loss in almost 200 strictly protected areas of Russia. We found that although fire is responsible for 75% of the loss in all strictly protected areas, forestry activities still account for 16%, and 9% is due to undefined causes. Therefore, uncontrolled wildfires (including those started before or after logging) and forestry activities are the main causes of 91% of the total tree loss. The combination of wildfires (often started intentionally) and forestry activities (illegally or barely legally put in place) caused a loss of an astonishing 3 million hectares. The fact that approximate to 10% of Russian tree cover was lost in two decades since 2001 only in strictly protected areas requires high attention by policymakers and important conservation actions to avoid losing other fundamental habitats and species during the next years when climate change and population growth can represent an additional trigger of an already dramatic situation. We call for an urgent response by national and local authorities that should start actively fighting wildfires, arsonists, and loggers even in inhabited remote areas and particularly in those included in strictly protected areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - Vocabulary studies are of significant importance for linguistic and cultural research because the worldview of a society is hidden in the verbal repertoire of its language. In studies on medical texts of the Old Anatolian Turkish period, it has been determined that there are errors and inconsistencies in the Latin equivalents of the plant names. The aim of this article is to reveal the true Latin equivalents of the plant names whose Latin equivalents are given incorrectly. To achieve this aim, we determined the sample selected by evaluating the forms in the indexes and dictionaries of fourteen Old Anatolian Turkish medical manuscript studies. Through this sample, we have attempted both to examine the reasons for the related discrepancies, as well as put forth solutions on how to eliminate them were evaluated. Such inconsistencies not only mislead scholars but also present them numerous challenges when it comes to further research. One of the aims of the study is to draw attention to such difficulties and discuss the measures that can be taken on the relevant issue.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of the potential non-human animal reservoirs and arthropod vectors of the Mayaro virus
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Improving our understanding of Mayaro virus (MAYV) ecology is critical to guide surveillance and risk assessment. We conducted a PRISMA-adherent systematic review of the published and grey literature to identify potential arthropod vectors and non-human animal reservoirs of MAYV. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, SciELO and grey-literature sources including PAHO databases and dissertation repositories. Studies were included if they assessed MAYV virological/immunological measured occurrence in field-caught, domestic, or sentinel animals or in field-caught arthropods. We conducted an animal seroprevalence meta-analysis using a random effects model. We compiled granular georeferenced maps of non-human MAYV occurrence and graded the quality of the studies using a customized framework. Overall, 57 studies were eligible out of 1523 screened, published between the years 1961 and 2020. Seventeen studies reported MAYV positivity in wild mammals, birds, or reptiles and five studies reported MAYV positivity in domestic animals. MAYV positivity was reported in 12 orders of wild-caught vertebrates, most frequently in the orders Charadriiformes and Primate. Sixteen studies detected MAYV in wild-caught mosquito genera including Haemagogus, Aedes, Culex, Psorophora, Coquillettidia, and Sabethes. Vertebrate animals or arthropods with MAYV were detected in Brazil, Panama, Peru, French Guiana, Colombia, Trinidad, Venezuela, Argentina, and Paraguay. Among non-human vertebrates, the Primate order had the highest pooled seroprevalence at 13.1% (95% CI: 4.3-25.1%). From the three most studied primate genera we found the highest seroprevalence was in Alouatta (32.2%, 95% CI: 0.0-79.2%), followed by Callithrix (17.8%, 95% CI: 8.6-28.5%), and Cebus/Sapajus (3.7%, 95% CI: 0.0-11.1%). We further found that MAYV occurs in a wide range of vectors beyond Haemagogus spp. The quality of evidence behind these findings was variable and prompts calls for standardization of reporting of arbovirus occurrence. These findings support further risk emergence prediction, guide field surveillance efforts, and prompt further in-vivo studies to better define the ecological drivers of MAYV maintenance and potential for emergence.

TI  - Improvement of the Soil Moisture Retrieval Procedure Based on the Integration of UAV Photogrammetry and Satellite Remote Sensing Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In countries characterized by arid and semi-arid climates, a precise determination of soil moisture conditions on the field scale is critically important, especially in the first crop growth stages, to schedule irrigation and to avoid wasting water. The objective of this study was to apply the operative methodology that allowed surface soil moisture (SSM) content in a semi-arid environment to be estimated. SSM retrieval was carried out by combining two scattering models (IEM and WCM), supplied by backscattering coefficients at the VV polarization obtained from the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), a vegetation descriptor NDVI obtained from the optical sensor, among other essential parameters. The inversion of these models was performed by Neural Networks (NN). The combined models were calibrated by the Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data collected on bare soil, and in cereal, pea and onion crop fields. To retrieve SSM, these scattering models need accurate measurements of the roughness surface parameters, standard deviation of the surface height (hrms) and correlation length (L). This work used a photogrammetric acquisition system carried on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to reconstruct digital surface models (DSM), which allowed these soil roughness parameters to be acquired in a large portion of the studied fields. The obtained results showed that the applied improved methodology effectively estimated SSM on bare and cultivated soils in the principal early growth stages. The bare soil experimentation yielded an R-2 = 0.74 between the estimated and observed SSMs. For the cereal field, the relation between the estimated and measured SSMs yielded R-2 = 0.71. In the experimental pea fields, the relation between the estimated and measured SSMs revealed R-2 = 0.72 and 0.78, respectively, for peas 1 and peas 2. For the onion experimentation, the highest R-2 equaled 0.5 in the principal growth stage (leaf development), but the crop R-2 drastically decreased to 0.08 in the completed growth phase. The acquired results showed that the applied improved methodology proves to be an effective tool for estimating the SSM on bare and cultivated soils in the principal early growth stages.

TI  - The Patterns of Seasonality of the Suspended Sediment Load along the Braided Channel of the Lena River
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The features of the suspended sediment load along the 200-km braided channel of the Lena River from the city of Pokrovsk to the Aldan River mouth (upstream of the Aldan braiding) are described in detail (30-m resolution) based on water-sediment concentration modeling, using the collection of Landsat images for the period of 1992-2018. It is shown that large anabranching river reaches correspond to changes of the system of sediment transport and accumulation, manifesting themselves as the predominance of the occurrences of positive (increase) or negative (decrease) Delta S-0 values (where Delta S-0 stands for suspended sediment-concentration budget). The conditions of a longitudinal decrease in suspended-sediment concentration along the braided reach of the Lena River are characterized by high water discharges (>20 000 m(3)/s) and are associated with sediment accumulation in riffles and floodplain areas. It has been revealed that a significant role in the longitudinal decrease in water-sediment concentration is played by lateral floodplain branches, which accumulate a part of the incoming suspended sediments and exert a dilution effect on the sediment flow downstream of the confluence with the main channel. Cases of a longitudinal increase in the water-suspended sediment concentration are typical for lower water flow rates (<20 000 m(3)/s) and are related to increased bank thermal erosion in summer and erosion of riffles during a low-water period. A combination of the grid of suspended-sediment concentration, velocities, and channel depths with a 30 x 30-m resolution (more than 20 000 cells) for low-water conditions revealed a dependence of the local suspended-sediment concentration on the transporting capacity of the flow, which was determined for particular verticals. A correspondence between the regime of certain reaches in different phases of water regime is observed. It indicates the mutual influence of the directedness of mass exchange and channel morphology. The transformation of distribution systems of suspended sediments may be interpreted as one of the self-regulation mechanisms in the channel system. Complex systems of sediment flow distribution along the channel of a large river reflect the opposite directions of erosion-accumulation processes caused by bends in the longitudinal profile.

TI  - Assessment of Suspended Sediment Budget of the Lena River Delta Based on the Remote Sensing Dataset
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates long-term and seasonal changes of sediment budget in Lena delta based on remote sensing dataset. Since 2000 Landsat images have been applying during ice-free period, from June to September. The sediment concentration at the delta topset was compared with sediment concentrations data at the outlets of: the Main, the Olenekskaya, the Tumatskyaya, the Trofimovskaya and the Bykovskaya channels to calculate suspended sediment budget in delta. The sediment concentration was calculated based on the archive Landsat images (more than 30 images). We have estimated influence of air temperature on thermal coastal erosion and the accumulation of sediments in the river Lena's delta. The increase of the daily average air temperature from 5 degrees C to 14 degrees C plays critical role in the degradation of permafrost and the activation of the processes of thermal erosion and thermal denudation of the right channels coasts and this fact means that these results can help to estimate special aspects of biochemical budget of the delta.

TI  - Imaging Protocol and Criteria for Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Nodes in the NAUTILUS Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary ultrasonography (US) is the most commonly used imaging modality for nodal evaluation in patients with breast cancer. No Axillary Surgical Treatment in Clinically Lymph Node-Negative Patients after Ultrasonography (NAUTILUS) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial investigating whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be safely omitted in patients with clinically and sonographically node-negative T1-2 breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. In this trial, a standardized imaging protocol and criteria were established for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes. Women lacking palpable lymph nodes underwent axillary US to dismiss suspicious nodal involvement. Patients with a round hypoechoic node with effaced hilum or indistinct margins were excluded. Patients with T1 tumors and a single node with a cortical thickness >= 3 mm underwent US-guided biopsy. Finally, patients with negative axillary US findings were included. The NAUTILUS axillary US nodal assessment criteria facilitate the proper selection of candidates who can omit SLNB.

TI  - Assessment of Improved RossLi BRDF Models Emphasizing Albedo Estimates at Large Solar Angles Using POLDER Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is closely related to the Earth's energy budget and is usually estimated by integrating remotely sensed bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data based on the widely used Ross-Li kernel-driven models. However, for large solar zenith angles (i.e., SZAs > 70 degrees), albedo estimation using the operational algorithm of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), i.e., RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR), is not recommended because it is reported to somewhat underestimate the black-sky albedo (BSA) at large SZAs based on ground albedo measurements. Recently, various combinations of the Ross-Li BRDF models with improved capabilities have been developed, and the assessments of these models based on worldwide satellite BRDF data with good spatial sampling, particularly at the large view and solar angles, will be important to improve an understanding of their performance in estimating intrinsic albedos. Following previous studies, the objective of this study is to further assess a series of hotspot-corrected Ross-Li models by demonstrating their ability to fit the POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) data sets and estimate albedo, especially at large SZAs, based on selected concurrent POLDER and MODIS data. The hotspot-corrected RTLSR model obtained by combining the RossThickChen and LiSparseReciprocalChen kernels (RTLSR_C) shows the best fitting ability, with a high cumulative frequency of small root-mean-square errors (RMSEs), thus confirming previous conclusions. Model differences mainly appear in albedo estimates, especially BSA estimates at large SZAs. The BSAs estimated by other models are significantly different from the RTLSR_C estimates in the near-infrared (NIR) and red bands as the SZA increases to approximately 60 degrees and 70 degrees, respectively. In this case, RossThinChen-LiSparseReciprocalChen (RTNLSR_C) yields higher BSA estimates than those of RTLSR_C. Comparisons of the MODIS and POLDER albedos estimated with Ross-Li models show that models with the RossThinChen kernel yield higher BSA estimates than those of the RTLSR_C model as the SZA increases. The results indicate that the retrieved albedo is likely to be more accurate with appropriately selected kernels for BRDF models at large SZAs, providing guidance for selecting suitable combinations of multiple kernels.

TI  - Machine learning-based inversion of water quality parameters in typical reach of the urban river by UAV multispectral data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban rivers play an essential role in the human environment and urban development; because of their narrow and long characteristics, challenging for general remote sensing data sources to meet the monitoring requirements. In order to solve the problem of insufficient application of remote sensing water quality monitoring in urban rivers. In this paper, based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) images and measured water quality data, the genetic algorithm_extreme gradient boosting (GA_XGBoost) algorithm is used to model water quality parameters in the study area, combined with its characteristics of supporting urban river polymorphism learning and semantic feature analysis. The results show that the coefficient of determination (R2) of GA_XGBoost algorithm for chlorophyll a (Chla), total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) and turbidity (TUB) is 0.855, 0.699, 0.787, 0.694, and 0.597, respectively, indicating a high precision and the predicted results are consistent with the measured data. Meanwhile, this paper compares the GA_XGBoost model with other algorithms: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest, genetic algorithm_RandomForest (GA_RandomForest), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and genetic algorithm_adaptive boosting (GA_AdaBoost), and the performance of the GA_XGBoost model is better. At the same time, data from different periods have been added to verify the model's applicability. Moreover, based on the inversion results, analyze from the point of view of point source pollution, non-point source pollution, etc., to further investigate the influencing factors that cause urban river pollution. The current method has important practical significance for promoting the intelligent and automatic level of water environment monitoring technology in ecological environmental protection and urban water resources protection.

TI  - Application of Infrared Remote Sensing and Magnetotelluric Technology in Geothermal Resource Exploration: A Case Study of the Wuerhe Area, Xinjiang
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a new green energy source, geothermal resource's exploration, development, and utilization are an important direction in geophysical exploration at present. In this study, the actual land surface temperature was inferred based on the thermal infrared band of Landsat8 remote-sensing images, and the information about the surface anomalies and their spatial distribution was obtained through a multifactor analysis. In addition, three magnetotelluric sounding profiles were deployed in the study area, and the geo-electric sections in the study area were obtained through inversion of the measured data. Then, based on the inverse geo-electric information and the land surface temperature anomaly information, we analyzed and verified the geothermal resource genesis of the thermal anomaly area and inferred the favorable geothermal resource area in the study area. The results show that these two methods can be used to compare and analyze the possible distribution of the geothermal resources in the study area in two dimensions: the spatial distribution on the surface and the vertical distribution in the subsurface. Moreover, the results of the geothermal anomalies inferred from the thermal infrared remote sensing and the geo-electric results inferred from the magnetotelluric data are in good agreement. This study demonstrates that the integrated application of thermal infrared remote sensing and magnetotelluric technology is a promising tool for geothermal exploration.

TI  - Landscape Evolution and It's Impact of Ecosystem Service Value of the Wuhan City, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and industrialization and enhanced ecological protection measures have greatly influenced landscape change, which has exacerbated regional landscape competition and conflicts and indirectly affected the supply of ecosystem services. Clarifying the relationship between ecosystem service change and landscape change is useful for understanding the impact of ecosystem conversion on socio-economic development and providing a knowledge base for relevant policy decisions. In this study, we used remote sensing technology to process Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imageries, combined with transformation analysis and kernel density analysis to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of land use change in Wuhan City from 1980 to 2020. We also estimated the ESV in the region using the improved unit area value equivalent method to reveal the trends of ESV changes in Wuhan. The results showed that land use changes in Wuhan during 1980-2020 occurred mainly in terms of decreases in farmland, forestland, and bare land, as well as increases in built-up land and water bodies. The built-up land was mainly concentrated in the main urban areas, but its area in each suburban area has increased in recent years. In contrast, farmland was mainly distributed in suburban areas, and its area has been decreasing in recent years due to the impact of urban expansion. However, the reduction is compensated for by the reclamation of ecological land such as grassland and forestland, which has aggravated the loss of ecosystem service values in the study area. In addition, human activities such as urban expansion have increased the demand for water resources, while also leading to ecological problems such as water scarcity and water quality degradation, which have caused serious losses to key ecosystem services in Wuhan city. Therefore, in order to alleviate the competition and conflicts in the landscape and mitigate the loss of ecosystem service values in this area, we have proposed some constructive suggestions for future urban planning and water quality improvements in Wuhan. The focus of these suggestions is on controlling the expansion of built-up land, as well as the conservation of ecological land and resource protection. Meanwhile, our findings can also provide reference information for land resource planning and ecological monitoring, and help researchers to understand the contribution of ecosystem service functions in relation to socio-economic development.

TI  - An Adaptive Thresholding Approach toward Rapid Flood Coverage Extraction from Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood disasters have a huge effect on human life, the economy, and the ecosystem. Quickly extracting the spatial extent of flooding is necessary for disaster analysis and rescue planning. Thus, extensive studies have utilized optical or radar data for the extraction of water distribution and monitoring of flood events. As the quality of detected flood inundation coverage by optical images is degraded by cloud cover, the current data products derived from optical sensors cannot meet the needs of rapid flood-range monitoring. The presented study proposes an adaptive thresholding method for extracting water coverage (AT-EWC) regarding rapid flooding from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with the assistance of prior information from Landsat data. Our method follows three major steps. First, applying the dynamic surface water extent (DSWE) algorithm to Landsat data acquired from the year 2000 to 2016, the distribution probability of water and non-water is calculated through the Google Earth Engine platform. Then, current water coverage is extracted from Sentinel-1 data. Specifically, the persistent water and non-water datasets are used to automatically determine the type of image histogram. Finally, the inundated areas are calculated by combining the persistent water and non-water datasets and the current water coverage as derived from the above two steps. This approach is fast and fully automated for flood detection. In the classification results from the WeiFang and Ji'An sites, the overall classification accuracy of water and land detection reached 95-97%. Our approach is fully automatic. In particular, the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional method over small water bodies (inland watersheds with few lakes) and makes up for the low temporal resolution of existing water products.

TI  - Mapping Large-Scale Forest Disturbance Types with Multi-Temporal CNN Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a vital role in combating gradual developmental deficiencies and balancing regional ecosystems, yet they are constantly disturbed by man-made or natural events. Therefore, developing a timely and accurate forest disturbance detection strategy is urgently needed. The accuracy of traditional detection algorithms depends on the selection of thresholds or the formulation of complete rules, which inevitably reduces the accuracy and automation level of detection. In this paper, we propose a new multitemporal convolutional network framework (MT-CNN). It is an integrated method that can realize long-term, large-scale forest interference detection and distinguish the types (forest fire and harvest/deforestation) of disturbances without human intervention. Firstly, it uses the sliding window technique to calculate an adaptive threshold to identify potential interference points, and then a multitemporal CNN network is designed to render the disturbance types with various disturbance duration periods. To illustrate the detection accuracy of MT-CNN, we conducted experiments in a large-scale forest area (about 990 km2) on the west coast of the United States (including northwest California and west Oregon) with long time-series Landsat data from 1986 to 2020. Based on the manually annotated labels, the evaluation results show that the overall accuracies of disturbance point detection and disturbance type recognition reach 90%. Also, this method is able to detect multiple disturbances that continuously occurred in the same pixel. Moreover, we found that forest disturbances that caused forest fire repeatedly appear without a significant coupling effect with annual temporal and precipitation variations. Potentially, our method is able to provide large-scale forest disturbance mapping with detailed disturbance information to support forest inventory management and sustainable development.

TI  - Evaluation of NOAA/AVHRR Sea Surface Temperature at Full HRPT Resolution in the Northwest Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) data in the Northwest Pacific Ocean has been acquired through the SeaSpace ground station located at the Ocean University of China since October 2000, and these data have been processed by the TeraScan system. The sea surface temperature (SST) products in the Northwest Pacific Ocean derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are evaluated. We compared the SST products with the buoy SSTs during the stable operational period of each satellite. There are a total of 33715 and 71819 matchups acquired for daytime and nighttime, respectively, between the NOAA/AVHRR SSTs and buoy SSTs. For each satellite, the biases and standard deviations at daytime are smaller than those at nighttime. The monthly biases at daytime generally oscillate around 0 degrees C, except for NOAA-15. By contrast, the monthly biases at nighttime mostly oscillate around -0.5 degrees C. Both daytime and nighttime biases exhibit seasonal oscillations for all satellites. The seasonal biases of the SST difference at daytime between each satellite and buoy are mostly within +/- 0.25 degrees C, except for the negative bias of -0.58 degrees C in May for NOAA-18. The seasonal biases of the SST difference at nighttime are mostly around -0.5 degrees C, and NOAA-16 has a lower bias, i.e., -0.86 degrees C, in April. These results indicate that the accuracy of the SST products is inconsistent for each satellite during different periods. It is suggested that the NOAA/AVHRR data should be reprocessed to provide highly accurate SST products.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Urban Land Cover Classification by Prior-Level Fusion of LiDAR Point Cloud and Optical Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The heterogeneity of urban landscape in the vertical direction should not be neglected in urban ecology research, which requires urban land cover product transformation from two-dimensions to three-dimensions using light detection and ranging system (LiDAR) point clouds. Previous studies have demonstrated that the performance of two-dimensional land cover classification can be improved by fusing optical imagery and LiDAR data using several strategies. However, few studies have focused on the fusion of LiDAR point clouds and optical imagery for three-dimensional land cover classification, especially using a deep learning framework. In this study, we proposed a novel prior-level fusion strategy and compared it with the no-fusion strategy (baseline) and three other commonly used fusion strategies (point-level, feature-level, and decision-level). The proposed prior-level fusion strategy uses two-dimensional land cover derived from optical imagery as the prior knowledge for three-dimensional classification. Then, a LiDAR point cloud is linked to the prior information using the nearest neighbor method and classified by a deep neural network. Our proposed prior-fusion strategy has higher overall accuracy (82.47%) on data from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, compared with the baseline (74.62%), point-level (79.86%), feature-level (76.22%), and decision-level (81.12%). The improved accuracy reflects two features: (1) fusing optical imagery to LiDAR point clouds improves the performance of three-dimensional urban land cover classification, and (2) the proposed prior-level strategy directly uses semantic information provided by the two-dimensional land cover classification rather than the original spectral information of optical imagery. Furthermore, the proposed prior-level fusion strategy provides a series that fills the gap between two- and three-dimensional land cover classification.

TI  - Exploring a uniform procedure to map <i>Eucalyptus</i> plantations based on fused medium-high spatial resolution satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date mapping of Eucalyptus plantations is essential for assessing their effects on soil, hydrology, and biodiversity. However, no proper approaches are available for extracting such data on Eucalyptus. This study proposes a uniform procedure for mapping Eucalyptus plantations based on fused medium-high spatial resolution satellite datasets. To develop this procedure, a total of 810 variables were extracted from the fused images of an experimental site, the Gaofeng Forest Farm in Guangxi, China. Six key variables were determined by using the Z-statistic and random forest methods. A total of 123 scenarios were then designed based on the key variables and three decision tree classifiers. Potential robust variables were determined through a comparative analysis of accuracy assessments from all scenarios. All the designed procedures were tested at a second site, Xingye County, Guangxi, using the same data processing methodology. The uniform procedure was finally determined through a comparative analysis of accuracy assessments from all the scenarios at both sites. The proposed procedure was then applied to a third study site, Yunxiao County, Fujian, China, to examine its transferability. Results from the Gaofeng site showed that the first short-wave infrared band (SWIR1) and the normalized difference index with near-infrared and green bands (NDNG) were two independent spectral-based variables for Eucalyptus delineation. Scenarios comprising mean texture with a window size of 15 (MEAN(15)), homogeneity with a window size of 5 (HOM5), or ratio of number of pixels where homogeneity based on window size 5 is greater than threshold T to the total number of pixels in the target segment polygon (HOM5RT) performed significantly greater than scenarios without these variables (alpha = 0.05). Scenarios with HOM5RT performed significantly greater than those with HOM5 (alpha = 0.05), and scenarios with random forest (RF) classifier performed greater than those with the other two classifiers. The results from the Xingye site were highly consistent with those from the Gaofeng site. Thus, the final uniform procedure containing these four optimal variables (SWIR1, NDNG, MEAN(15), and HOM5RT) and RF classifier was determined. An additional independent test at the Yunxiao site showed an overall accuracy of 96.01% and a high spatial agreement between the delineated Eucalyptus and observed distributions, indicating that the proposed procedure has good transferability. This research implies that the proposed procedure is robust and can be used in other subtropical regions to map Eucalyptus distributions.

TI  - Improving the Spatial Resolution of GRACE-Derived Terrestrial Water Storage Changes in Small Areas Using the Machine Learning Spatial Downscaling Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites can effectively monitor terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes in large-scale areas. However, due to the coarse resolution of GRACE products, there is still a large number of deficiencies that need to be considered when investigating TWS changes in small-scale areas. Hence, it is necessary to downscale the GRACE products with a coarse resolution. First, in order to solve this problem, the present study employs modeling windows of different sizes (Window Size, WS) combined with multiple machine learning algorithms to develop a new machine learning spatial downscaling method (MLSDM) in the spatial dimension. Second, The MLSDM is used to improve the spatial resolution of GRACE observations from 0.5 degrees to 0.25 degrees, which is applied to Guantao County. The present study has verified the downscaling accuracy of the model developed through the combination of WS3, WS5, WS7, and WS9 and jointed with Random Forest (RF), Extra Tree Regressor (ETR), Adaptive Boosting Regressor (ABR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) algorithms. The analysis shows that the accuracy of each combined model is improved after adding the residuals to the high-resolution downscaled results. In each modeling window, the accuracy of RF is better than that of ETR, ABR, and GBR. Additionally, compared to the changes in the TWS time series that are derived by the model before and after downscaling, the results indicate that the downscaling accuracy of WS5 is slightly more superior compared to that of WS3, WS7, and WS9. Third, the spatial resolution of the GRACE data was increased from 0.5 degrees to 0.05 degrees by integrating the WS5 and RF algorithm. The results are as follows: (1) The TWS (GWS) changes before and after downscaling are consistent, decreasing at -20.86 mm/yr and -21.79 mm/yr (-14.53 mm/yr and -15.46 mm/yr), respectively, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and correlation coefficient (CC) values of both are above 0.99 (0.98). (2) The CC between the 80% deep groundwater well data and the downscaled GWS changes are above 0.70. Overall, the MLSDM can not only effectively improve the spatial resolution of GRACE products but also can preserve the spatial distribution of the original signal, which can provide a reference scheme for research focusing on the downscaling of GRACE products.

TI  - Green's Function for Static Klein-Gordon Equation Stated on a Rectangular Region and Its Application in Meteorology Data Assimilation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The meteorology data assimilation applications often encounter variational problems with unknown weights, where the corresponding Euler equation is an elliptic partial differential equation. This research focused on retrieving the weights in remote sensing data assimilation by means of the computer-friendly form of the Green's function obtained by eigenfunction expansion for the boundary value problem of the static Klein-Gordon equation on a rectangular region. With the help of the proposed retrieving method, the assimilation problem of estimating regional precipitation with weather radar and rain-gauge is solved in the Green's function method. Results show that high accuracy of the proposed method makes it a good candidate for data assimilation problems in operational use.

TI  - Generating the 30-m land surface temperature product over continental China and USA from landsat 5/7/8 data
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating a long-time-series, high-spatial-resolution land surface temperature (LST) product has considerable applications in monitoring water stress, surface energy and water balance at the field scale. This paper proposes an operational method to generate 30-m LSTs from thermal infrared (TIR) observations of Landsat series. Two key issues were addressed in the proposed method: one involved determining the land surface emissivity (LSE) by developing different LSE retrieval methods for specific land cover types; the other involved choosing an optimal reanalysis atmospheric profile for implementing the atmospheric correction of TIR data. After LSE determination and atmospheric correction, LST was resolved by inverting the radiative transfer equation. In situ measured LST and LSE data were used to validate the proposed method. The validation results based on the measurements from 24 sites showed that the absolute average bias of the LSE data estimated from Landsat 5/7/8 was generally within 0.01, and the standard deviations were all less than 0.002. The average biases of the retrieved LST at SURFRAD sites were 1.11/1.54/1.63 K, whereas the RMSEs were 2.72/3.21/3.02 K for Landsat 5/7/8, respectively. The average biases (RMSEs) of the retrieved LST at the BSRN and Huailai sites were 0.08 K (3.69 K) and 0.90 K (3.42 K) for Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, respectively. Furthermore, the validation results at the SURFRAD sites show that the precision and uncertainty of the retrieved Landsat 5/7/8 LSTs were all better than those of the USGS LSTs. Finally, we produced monthly composited LST maps for the Chinese landmass and continental United States using the retrieved Landsat 5/7/8 LSTs. This study provides guidance on how to estimate large-scale LSTs from satellite sensors with only one TIR channel. We will massively produce global LSTs from Landsat series TIR data and release them to the public in the next stage.

TI  - Evaluations of Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) Level 1 Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Environmental trace gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) is the first high spectral resolution imaging spectrometer in China designed to monitor trace gas in tropospheric and stratospheric. To fully understand the instrument's characteristics and make better use of the level 1 (L1 ) data, comprehensive evaluations of irradiance and radiance data measured by the EMI instrument were carried out in this study. For both ultraviolet-2 and visible-1 bands, the slit function change drastically as a function of detectors in the across-track direction of charge-coupled device (CCD) , which is more than 6 times larger than that of TROP(OMI). The use of different slit functions according to the row can improve the calibration accuracy. Small wavelength shifts were found in both irradiance and radiance data with an average value of 0. 015 and 0. 03 nm, respectively. Although they meet the requirement of the design specification (0. 05 nm) , wavelength calibration is still needed during the trace gas retrieval. EMI irradiance data agree highly (r>0. 95) with OMI and TROPOMI and the reference solar spectrum. EMI radiance data also shows a better agreement (r>0. 93) with OMI and TROPOMI by averaging the cloud-free pixels over the clean Pacific region. This study demonstrates the good quality of current EMI L1 data for trace gas retrieval, and it provides a reference for the design and data quality evaluation scheme of subsequent instruments.

TI  - A Semantic-Preserving Deep Hashing Model for Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) systems perform single-label retrieval with a single label to represent the most dominant semantic content for an image. Improved spatial resolution dramatically boosts the remote sensing image scene complexity, as a remote sensing image always contains multiple categories of surface features. In this case, a single label cannot comprehensively describe the semantic content of a complex remote sensing image scene and therefore results in poor retrieval performance in practical applications. As a result, researchers have begun to pay attention to multi-label image retrieval. However, in the era of massive remote sensing data, how to increase retrieval efficiency and reduce feature storage while preserving semantic information remains unsolved. Considering the powerful capability of hashing learning in overcoming the curse of dimensionality caused by high-dimensional image representation in Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search problems, we propose a new semantic-preserving deep hashing model for multi-label remote sensing image retrieval. Our model consists of three main components: (1) a convolutional neural network to extract image features; (2) a hash layer to generate binary codes; (3) a new loss function to better maintain the multi-label semantic information of hash learning contained in context remote sensing image scene. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to apply deep hashing into the multi-label remote sensing image retrieval. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness and promising of the introduction of hashing methods in the multi-label remote sensing image retrieval.

TI  - Local Recurrence after Treatment of Ductal Carcinoma <i>In Situ</i>: A Comprehensive Overview
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Patients with DCIS have an excellent long-term prognosis with a 10-year breast cancer-specific survival around 98%. Treatment has the goal to prevent the development of an invasive breast cancer and to minimize the risk for a second breast cancer event, and published studies have shown a substantial decrease in invasive local recurrence rates over time. Approximately 50% of the local recurrences after BCS for a primary DCIS are invasive and 8.5% of them node-positive. Experiencing an ipsilateral invasive recurrence after a primary DCIS does significantly increase the risk of breast cancer death, while this is not seen after a DCIS recurrence. Radical surgery remains crucial to minimize the risk of local recurrence, and adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by at least 50%. At recurrence, a repeat-BCS should be considered as it offers a good local control in properly selected patients and an overall and breast cancer-specific survival comparable to that seen after mastectomy.

TI  - Glacial Lake Evolution (1962-2018) and Outburst Susceptibility of Gurudongmar Lake Complex in the Tista Basin, Sikkim Himalaya (India)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sikkim Himalayan glaciers and glacial lakes are affected by climate change like other parts of the Himalayas. As a result of this climate variability in the Sikkim Himalaya, a detailed study of the Gurudongmar lake complex (GLC) evolution and outburst susceptibility assessment is required. Glacial lake volume estimation and lake outburst susceptibility assessment were carried out to reveal different characteristics for all four lakes (GL-1, GL-2, GL-3, and GL-4) from the lake complex. Each of these lakes has a moderate to very high potential to outburst. As the dam of GL-1 provides no retention capacity, there is a very high potential of a combined effect with the sudden failure of the moraine-dams of GL-2 or GL-3 located upstream. Temporal analysis of GLC using optical remote sensing data and in-field investigations revealed a rapidly increasing total lake area by ~74 +/- 3%, with an expansion rate of +0.03 +/- 0.002 km(2) a(-1) between 1962 and 2018 due to climate change and ongoing glacier retreat. The overall lake area expansion rates are dependent on climate-driven factors, and constantly increasing average air temperature is responsible for the enlargement of the lake areas. Simultaneously, changes in GLC expansion velocity are driven by changes in the total amount of precipitation. The deficit in precipitation probably triggered the initial higher rate from 1962 to 1988 during the winter and spring seasons. The post-1990s positive anomaly in precipitation might have reduced the rate of the glacial lake area expansion considerably.

TI  - Enhancing environmental enforcement with near real-time monitoring: Likelihood-based detection of structural expansion of intensive livestock farms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Much environmental enforcement in the United States has historically relied on either self-reported data or physical, resource-intensive, infrequent inspections. Advances in remote sensing and computer vision, however, have the potential to augment compliance monitoring by detecting early warning signs of noncompliance. We demonstrate a process for rapid identification of significant structural expansion using Planet's 3 m/pixel satellite imagery products and focusing on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in the US as a test case. Unpermitted building expansion has been a particular challenge with CAFOs, which pose significant health and environmental risks. Using new hand-labeled dataset of 145,053 images of 1,513 CAFOs, we combine state-of-the-art building segmentation with a likelihood-based change-point detection model to provide a robust signal of building expansion (AUC = 0.86). A major advantage of this approach is that it can work with higher cadence (daily to weekly), but lower resolution (3 m/pixel), satellite imagery than previously used in similar environmental settings. It is also highly generalizable and thus provides a near real-time monitoring tool to prioritize enforcement resources in other settings where unpermitted construction poses environmental risk, e.g. zoning, habitat modification, or wetland protection.

TI  - The Polish-Lithuanian Power and Orthodox Rus as Portrayed in the Works of Polemicists at the end of the 16th - first third of the 17th centuries
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper concerns the construction of the image of Polish-Lithuanian power in the context of religious polemics at the turn of the 16th - 17th centuries. Debates between Orthodox and Uniate Christians in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth generated polemical texts which were created in the context of Orthodoxy's struggle for rights and freedoms. In the 19th and 20th centuries, polemical literature as an historical source was viewed through the prism of a national project or through a preexisting national narrative. When researching the relationship between Ukraine and Russia, historians found evidence in the polemical writing of the 17th century to justify oppression, explain distinctive culture, and account for national struggle. Contemporary historiography, however, offers new angles through which to view these texts, through the lens of intellectual history and memory studies. In this vein the historical worldview of a 17th century person becomes especially interesting.At the center of our study are the views of Orthodox polemicists, who represent the "Ruthenian" populace in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, concerning the history of the rule of Lithuanian princes and Polish kings. The acceptance of the Union of Brest caused greater interest and reflection in this population to "one's own" past, legal situation, loyalty to the king; as a result, the image of Polish and Lithuanian rulers became more complicated. Aiming to legalize Orthodoxy, church leaders actualized historical images of princes and kings, presenting them as givers and guarantors of the rights and freedoms of Rus. Fighters for Orthodoxy were not repulsed by the fact that the king was Catholic; rather, they agitated for equality between the Greek and Roman faiths. We find justification for this equality given through an appeal to a glorious past, to the history of the annexation of Rus' lands to Lithuania, the Union of Lublin, and the granting of privileges by the Polish king.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical and radar satellite data based Global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) serve as a main data source in hydrological studies today. Open access Remote Sensing (RS) products have increasing accuracy and improved spatial resolution. The main research purposes are to study the use of AW3D30, ASTER GDEM V003 and SRTMGL1 DEMs in modeling mountainous lake basin and comparative analysis of their spatial accuracy. Topographic maps and very high resolution satellite imagery of the study area have been applied for the spatial accuracy verification and surface referencing. The relative accuracies of three different DEMs were analyzed using 1284 elevation points on the terrain surfaces. Comparison of these DEMs with 30 square m spatial resolution confirms that an AW3D30 DEM has a higher vertical accuracy compared to other models and can be used for modeling river and lake basins over high mountainous terrain. The detected unreliable sections of the modeled lake basin boundary were analyzed and corrected based on the basin delineation by different DEMs. Analysis of spatial accuracy of the delineated Issyk-Kul Lake basin provide further incentive for DEM modification based on higher resolution remote sensing data, considering the applied geoid height differences as well by using satellite positioning data.

TI  - Accuracy of Sentinel-1 PSI and SBAS InSAR Displacement Velocities against GNSS and Geodetic Leveling Monitoring Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Correct use of multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) datasets to complement geodetic surveying for geo-hazard applications requires rigorous assessment of their precision and accuracy. Published inter-comparisons are mostly limited to ground displacement estimates obtained from different algorithms belonging to the same family of InSAR approaches, either Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) or Small BAseline Subset (SBAS); and accuracy assessments are mainly focused on vertical displacements or based on few Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or geodetic leveling points. To fill this demonstration gap, two years of Sentinel-1 SAR ascending and descending mode data are processed with both PSI and SBAS consolidated algorithms to extract vertical and horizontal displacement velocity datasets, whose accuracy is then assessed against a wealth of contextual geodetic data. These include permanent GNSS records, static GNSS benchmark repositioning, and geodetic leveling monitoring data that the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics (INEGI) of Mexico collected in 2014-2016 in the Aguascalientes Valley, where structurally-controlled land subsidence exhibits fast vertical rates (up to -150 mm/year) and a non-negligible east-west component (up to +/- 30 mm/year). Despite the temporal constraint of the data selected, the PSI-SBAS inter-comparison reveals standard deviation of 6 mm/year and 4 mm/year for the vertical and east-west rate differences, respectively, thus reassuring about the similarity between the two types of InSAR outputs. Accuracy assessment shows that the standard deviations in vertical velocity differences are 9-10 mm/year against GNSS benchmarks, and 8 mm/year against leveling data. Relative errors are below 20% for any locations subsiding faster than -15 mm/year. Differences in east-west velocity estimates against GNSS are on average -0.1 mm/year for PSI and +0.2 mm/year for SBAS, with standard deviations of 8 mm/year. When discrepancies are found between InSAR and geodetic data, these mostly occur at benchmarks located in proximity to the main normal faults, thus falling within the same SBAS ground pixel or closer to the same PSI target, regardless of whether they are in the footwall or hanging wall of the fault. Establishing new benchmarks at higher distances from the fault traces or exploiting higher resolution SAR scenes and/or InSAR datasets may improve the detection of the benchmarks and thus consolidate the statistics of the InSAR accuracy assessments.

TI  - Managing Flood Hazard in a Complex Cross-Border Region Using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 Optical Data: A Case Study from Prut River Basin (NE Romania)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an alternative solution for flood risk management in complex cross-border regions is presented. In these cases, due to different flood risk management legislative approaches, there is a lack of joint cooperation between the involved countries. As a main consequence, LiDAR-derived digital elevation models and accurate flood hazard maps obtained by means of hydrological and hydraulic modeling are missing or are incomplete. This is also the case for the Prut River, which acts as a natural boundary between European Union (EU) member Romania and non-EU countries Ukraine and Republic of Moldova. Here, flood hazard maps were developed under the European Floods Directive (2007/60/EC) only for the Romanian territory and only for the 1% exceeding probability (respectively floods that can occur once every 100 years). For this reason, in order to improve the flood hazard management in the area and consider all cross-border territories, a fully remote sensing approach was considered. Using open-source SAR Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data characterized by an improved temporal resolution, we managed to capture the maximum spatial extent of a flood event that took place in the aforementioned river sector (middle Prut River course) during the 24 and 27 June 2020. Moreover, by means of flood frequency analysis, the development of a transboundary flood hazard map with an assigned probability, specific to the maximum flow rate recorded during the event, was realized.

TI  - Analysis of the Different Lymphatic Drainage Patterns during Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Skin Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last two decades, studies of lymphoscintigraphy imaging in lymphatic mapping reported an extreme heterogeneity of skin lymphatic drainage of some skin area, in contrast with the previous scientific literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of any correlations between the topographical location of cutaneous melanoma and the topographical location of sentinel lymph nodes. Data from 165 patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy between January 2013 and May 2021 were analyzed, demonstrating that melanomas in the Lumbar region presented a significant more heterogeneous drainage by site than those in the Scapular region (p < 0.01) and that melanomas in the Subscapular region were significantly more heterogeneous by laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral) than those in the Scapular region (p < 0.05). Results of this study supported the evidence of multiple lymphatic drainage as regards the sentinel node biopsy performed in skin melanoma located on the dorsal subscapular region and lumbar region. For this reason, the association of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with another imaging evaluation is needed in these critical cutaneous areas. Recent technical developments enabling fluorescence lymphography together with indocyanine green have significantly improved the visualization of lymphatic drainage patterns at a microscopic level. In the preoperative phase, any doubt can be resolved by associating the SPET-CT scan to lymphoscintigraphy, while during the intraoperative phase, an additional evaluation with indocyanine green can be performed in doubtful cases. The aim of the duplex lymphatic mapping (pre and/or intraoperative) is an accurate search of sentinel nodes, in order to reduce the rate of false negatives.

TI  - LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS OF THE LONTRA RIVER BASIN, NORTH OF TOCANTINS
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - For the use of the natural resources of the territory, previous knowledge is necessary, that is, the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of these resources. In this perspective, the objective of this research was to analyze the landscape dynamics of the Lontra River Basin, North of Tocantins, with a view to environmental conservation. Landsat 5 and 8 satellites, Themathic Mapper-TM sensor and Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery were used for the elaboration of the thematic maps, 2008 and 2018. The images were obtained free of charge from the website of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). Image processing was performed on the Spring Geographic Information System, version 5.4.3 and later completed in ArcGis software version 10.6.1. It was observed in the classes of vegetation cover reductions, with the exception of the Savanna Arborizada that increased between 1998 and 2018, however, we observe that the Savanna Arborizada and the other phytophysiognomies have been suffering from deforestation, livestock and irregular occupation of the soil in recent years. The category of land use increased in all classes, with the exception of water, in which the highlight was the cattle raising that expanded to 65.29% of the area in 2018, reflecting the growth of the cattle production chain in the region. Finally, it is concluded that the situation in the study area is worrying, since the reduction of natural resources can compromise the balance of the basin.

TI  - Reconstruction of the lower lip after broad oncologic resection by Colmenero flap: a reliable option
T2  - ACTA OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGICA ITALICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Reconstruction of the lower lip is complex. The Colmenero flap is an effective albeit rarely described method for the repair of medium- to large-sized defects of the lower lip.Methods. A retrospective review was carried out using data gathered from patients who had undergone Colmenero flap reconstruction of the lower lip at our centre between 2015 and 2020. We analysed demographic, histologic and anatomic variables as well as surgical results. This review assessed flap functionality based on proper mouth closure, absence of microstomia and oral competence.Results. Thirteen Colmenero flaps were performed in 9 patients, with the flap being used bilaterally in four cases. All patients had squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip. The mean length of the reconstructed defect was 4.1 cm (ranging between 3-7.5 cm). None of the flaps exhibited signs of necrosis. Five patients required minor surgical touch up during the second procedure: two for dehiscence, two for oral leakage and one for esthetic improvement. All patients had excellent functional and aesthetic final outcomes.Conclusions. The Colmenero flap is a good resource for medium- and large-sized lower lip reconstructions due to its reliability, limited complications, and good aesthetic and functional results.

TI  - Giant meandering channel evolution, Campos deep-water salt basin, Brazil
T2  - GEOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Submarine channels are conduits for sediment delivery to continental margins, and channel deposits can be sandy components of the fill in tectonically active salt basins. Examples of salt-withdrawal basin fill commonly show successions of sandy channelized or sheet-like systems alternating with more mud-rich mass-transport complexes and hemipelagites. This alternation of depositional styles is controlled by subsidence and sediment-supply histories. Salt-basin fill comprising successions of largely uninterrupted meandering-channel deposition are less commonly recognized. This begs the questions: can sediment supply be large enough to overwhelm basin subsidence and result in a thick succession of channel deposits, and, if so, how would such a channel system evolve? Here, we use three-dimensional seismic-reflection data from a >1500 km(2) region with salt-influenced topography in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, to evaluate the influence of salt diapirs on an Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene giant meandering submarine-channel system (channel elements >1 km wide; meander wavelengths several kilometers to >10 km). The large scale of the channels in the Campos Basin suggests that sediment discharge was large enough to sustain the meandering channel system in spite of large variability in subsidence across the region. We interpreted 22 channel centerlines to reconstruct the detailed kinematic evolution of this depositional system; this level of detail is akin to that of recent studies of meandering fluvial channels in time-lapse Landsat satellite images. The oldest channel elements are farther from salt diapirs than many of the younger ones; the centerlines of the older channel elements exhibit a correlation between curvature and migration rate, and a spatial delay between locations of peak curvature and maximum migration distance, similar to that observed in rivers. As many of the younger channel centerlines expanded toward nearby salt diapirs, their migration pattern switched to downstream translation as a result of partial confinement. Channel segments that docked against salt diapirs became less mobile, and, as a result, they do not show a correlation between curvature and migration rate. The channel migration pattern in the Campos Basin is different compared to that of a tectonically quiescent continental rise where meander evolution is unobstructed. This style of channelized basin filling is different from that of many existing examples of salt-withdrawal minibasins that are dominated by overall less-channelized deposits. This difference might be a result of the delivery of voluminous coarse sediment and high discharge of channel-forming turbidity currents to the Campos Basin from rivers draining actively uplifting coastal mountains of southeastern Brazil. Detailed kinematic analysis of such well-preserved channels can be used to reconstruct the impact of structural deformation on basin fill.

TI  - MORPHOMETRIC ASPECTS OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN OF THE PATU RIVER-CECE
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A hydrographic basin can be considered an open system, with input and output of matter and energy, as well being a process -response system. In this way, the objective of this work is to perform the morphometric characterization from some physical parameters of the Patu-Ceara river basin, using geoprocessing techniques to support a better management of the area. Among the calculated physical parameters are compactness coefficient, shape factor, circularity index, slope, altitude, order and drainage density. Was used a geographic information system: the ArcMap 10.3 software and the ALOS PALSAR radar image. As a result a drainage area of 998.99 km(2) and a perimeter of 202.09 km were obtained. The hydrographic basin has an elongated shape, represented by the coefficients of compactness (1.79), shape factor (0.16) and circularity index (0.31). The drainage area is of seventh order and has a drainage density of 1.78 km/km2. It was concluded that the water catchment area of the Patu River is not susceptible to flooding, with quite branched drainage. Thus, the use of morphometric data together with the information generated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) were presented as important instruments for the management of the natural resources of the Patu river basin.

TI  - Spatially Coherent Postprocessing of Cloud Cover Ensemble Forecasts
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical postprocessing is commonly applied to reduce location and dispersion errors of probabilistic forecasts provided by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. If postprocessed forecast scenarios are required, the combination of ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) for univariate postprocessing with ensemble copula coupling (ECC) or the Schaake shuffle (ScS) to retain the dependence structure of the raw ensemble is a state-of-the-art approach. However, modern machine learning methods may lead to both a better univariate skill and more realistic forecast scenarios. In this study, we postprocess multimodel ensemble forecasts of cloud cover over Switzerland provided by COSMO-E and ECMWF-IFS using (i) EMOS + ECC, (ii) EMOS + ScS, (iii) dense neural networks (dense NN) + ECC, (iv) dense NN + ScS, and (v) conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). The different methods are verified using EUMETSAT satellite data. Dense NN shows the best univariate skill, but cGAN performed only slightly worse. Furthermore, cGAN generates realistic forecast scenario maps, while not relying on a dependence template like ECCor ScS, which is particularly favorable in the case of complex topography.

TI  - The relationship between groundwater and natural vegetation in Qaidam Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately evaluate ecological risks trigged by groundwater exploitation, it must be clarified the relationship between vegetation and groundwater. Based on remote sensing data sets MOD13Q1, groundwater table depth (WTD) and total dissolved solids (TDS), the relationship between groundwater and natural vegetation was analyzed statistically in the main plain areas of Qaidam Basin. The results indicate that natural vegetation is groundwater-dependent in areas where WTD is less than 5.5 m and TDS is less than 7.5 g/L. Aquatic vegetation, hygrophytic vegetation and hygrophytic saline-alkali tolerant vegetation are mainly distributed in areas with WTD <1.1 m. Salt-tolerant and mesophytic vegetation mainly occur in areas with WTD of 1.4-3.5 m, while the xerophytic vegetation isprimarily present in areas where WTD ranges from 1.4 m to 5.5 m. Natural vegetation does not necessarily depend on groundwater in areas with WTD >5.5 m. For natural vegetation, the most suitable water TDS is less than 1.5 g/L, the moderately suitable TDS is 1.5-5.0 g/L, the basically suitable TDS is 5.0-7.5 g/L, and the unsuitable TDS is more than 7.5 g/L.

TI  - Establishing a sentinel surveillance system for the novel COVID-19 in a resource-limited country: methods, system attributes and early findings
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To establish a hospital-based platform to explore the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients screened for COVID-19. Design Hospital-based surveillance. Setting This study was conducted in four selected hospitals in Bangladesh during 10 June-31 August 2020. Participants In total, 2345 patients of all age (68% male) attending the outpatient and inpatient departments of surveillance hospitals with any one or more of the following symptoms within last 7 days: fever, cough, sore throat and respiratory distress. Outcome measures The outcome measures were COVID-19 positivity and mortality rate among enrolled patients. Pearson's chi(2) test was used to compare the categorical variables (sign/symptoms, comorbidities, admission status and COVID-19 test results). Regression analysis was performed to determine the association between potential risk factors and death. Results COVID-19 was detected among 922 (39%) enrolled patients. It was more common in outpatients with a peak positivity in second week of July (112, 54%). The median age of the confirmed COVID-19 cases was 38 years (IQR: 30-50), 654 (71%) were male and 83 (9%) were healthcare workers. Cough (615, 67%) was the most common symptom, followed by fever (493, 53%). Patients with diabetes were more likely to get COVID-19 than patients without diabetes (48% vs 38%; OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2 to 1.9). The death rate among COVID-19 positive was 2.3%, n=21. Death was associated with age >= 60 years (adjusted OR (AOR): 13.9; 95% CI: 5.5 to 34), shortness of breath (AOR: 9.7; 95% CI: 3.0 to 30), comorbidity (AOR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.1 to 21.7), smoking history (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 0.7 to 7.1), attending the hospital in <2 days of symptom onset due to critical illness (AOR: 4.7; 95% CI: 1.2 to 17.8) and hospital admission (AOR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.2 to 9.8). Conclusions COVID-19 positivity was observed in more than one-third of patients with suspected COVID-19 attending selected hospitals. While managing such patients, the risk factors identified for higher death rates should be considered.

TI  - Shoreline change behavior study of Jambudwip island of Indian Sundarban using DSAS model
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - A quantitative analysis of the shoreline migration pattern at various timescales is important to under -stand the coastal ecosystem and interaction behaviour between sea and land. The sea-level rise due to polar ice and glacier melting has directly affected the coastal environment. The present study attempts to analyze the potential migration characteristics of Jambudwip Island of the Sundarban biosphere in the Bay of Bengal. GIS, Remote Sensing and Statistical analyses have been utilized for this observation. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to assess the shoreline change over time span. Moreover, Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and End Point Rate (EPR) were used for statistical analysis to measure the rate of change of shoreline during 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. NDVI and single-band thresh-old method (IR band) has been applied on the Landsat-7 and OLI data to identify the shoreline position. The result showed that the Western part of the island was the most erosive zone and Eastern part is the most accretive zone. Overall, the maximum rate of erosion was 49.08 m/yr and accretion 122.4 m/yr. In consequence, shoreline length has also been changed between 2011and 2017, from approximately 11879.91m to 10374.42 m.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - A New Application of the Disturbance Index for Fire Severity in Coastal Dunes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are a disturbance that can lead to short term dune destabilisation and have been suggested to be an initiation mechanism of a transgressive dune phase when paired with changing climatic conditions. Fire severity is one potential factor that could explain subsequent coastal dune destabilisations, but contemporary evidence of destabilisation following fire is lacking. In addition, the suitability of conventional satellite Earth Observation methods to detect the impacts of fire and the relative fire severity in coastal dune environments is in question. Widely applied satellite-derived burn indices (Normalised Burn Index and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) have been suggested to underestimate the effects of fire in heterogenous landscapes or areas with sparse vegetation cover. This work assesses burn severity from high resolution aerial and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery following the 2019/2020 Black Summer fires on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, to assess the efficacy of commonly used satellite indices, and validate a new method for assessing fire severity in coastal dune systems. The results presented here show that the widely applied burn indices derived from NBR differentially assess vegetation loss and fire severity when compared in discrete soil groups across a landscape that experienced a very high severity fire. A new application of the Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) and Disturbance Index (DI) is presented. The differenced Disturbance Index (dDI) improves the estimation of burn severity, relative vegetation loss, and minimises the effects of differing soil conditions in the highly heterogenous landscape of Kangaroo Island. Results suggest that this new application of TCT is better suited to diverse environments like Mediterranean and semi-arid coastal regions than existing indices and can be used to better assess the effects of fire and potential remobilisation of coastal dune systems.

AB  - Mongolia has experienced several extreme climate events during the past decades, including severe extreme droughts. The issue of drought is of paramount significance in our country of nomadic culture and nomadic pastoralism. The eighteen years (20012018) MODIS satellite indices, Normalized Diff erence Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Diff erence Water Index (NDWI) data were analyzed for Khar Yamaat Nature Reserve. The Normalized Diff erence Drought Index (NDDI), combines information from both the NDVI and NDWI. During the summer, the average values of NDVI and NDWI were consistently lower under drought conditions (NDVI <0.2 and NDWI -0.2) than under non-drought conditions (NDVI 0.6 and NDWI>0.4). NDVI values exhibited a quicker response to drought conditions than NDWI. Davaagerel, M., Munkhchuluun, B. & Bayarsaikhan, U. 2022.

TI  - Neoantigen-Reactive T Cells: The Driving Force behind Successful Melanoma Immunotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Cancer immunotherapy is a revolutionary type of cancer therapy. It uses the patient's own immune system to fight and potentially cure cancer. The first major breakthrough of immunotherapy came from successful clinical trials for melanoma treatments. Since then, researchers have focused on understanding the science behind immunotherapy, so that patients with other types of cancer may also benefit. One of the major findings is that the T cells in melanoma patients may recognize a specific type of tumor antigen, called neoantigens, and then kill tumor cells that present these neoantigens. The neoantigens mainly arise from the DNA mutations found in tumor cells. These mutations are translated into mutated proteins that are then distinguished by T cells. In this article, we discuss the critical role of T cells in immunotherapy, as well as the clinical trials that shaped the treatments for melanoma. Patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma have experienced significant clinical responses after checkpoint blockade immunotherapy or adoptive cell therapy. Neoantigens are mutated proteins that arise from tumor-specific mutations. It is hypothesized that the neoantigen recognition by T cells is the critical step for T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses and subsequent tumor regressions. In addition to describing neoantigens, we review the sentinel and ongoing clinical trials that are helping to shape the current treatments for patients with cutaneous melanoma. We also present the existing evidence that establishes the correlations between neoantigen-reactive T cells and clinical responses in melanoma immunotherapy.

TI  - Instance Segmentation for Governmental Inspection of Small Touristic Infrastructure in Beach Zones Using Multispectral High-Resolution WorldView-3 Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Misappropriation of public lands is an ongoing government concern. In Brazil, the beach zone is public property, but many private establishments use it for economic purposes, requiring constant inspection. Among the undue targets, the individual mapping of straw beach umbrellas (SBUs) attached to the sand is a great challenge due to their small size, high presence, and agglutinated appearance. This study aims to automatically detect and count SBUs on public beaches using high-resolution images and instance segmentation, obtaining pixel-wise semantic information and individual object detection. This study is the first instance segmentation application on coastal areas and the first using WorldView-3 (WV-3) images. We used the Mask-RCNN with some modifications: (a) multispectral input for the WorldView3 imagery (eight channels), (b) improved the sliding window algorithm for large image classification, and (c) comparison of different image resizing ratios to improve small object detection since the SBUs are small objects (<32(2) pixels) even using high-resolution images (31 cm). The accuracy analysis used standard COCO metrics considering the original image and three scale ratios (2x, 4x, and 8x resolution increase). The average precision (AP) results increased proportionally to the image resolution: 30.49% (original image), 48.24% (2x), 53.45% (4x), and 58.11% (8x). The 8x model presented 94% AP50, classifying nearly all SBUs correctly. Moreover, the improved sliding window approach enables the classification of large areas providing automatic counting and estimating the size of the objects, proving to be effective for inspecting large coastal areas and providing insightful information for public managers. This remote sensing application impacts the inspection cost, tribute, and environmental conditions.

TI  - Human factors affecting intraoperative patient safety
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review This review addresses the importance of some of the human factors for intraoperative patient safety with particular focus on the active failures. These are the mishaps or sentinel events related to decisons taken and actions performed by the individual at the delivery end of a system. Such sentinel events may greatly affect intraoperative patient safety. Recent findings Intimidating, aggressive and disruptive communication is a cause of adverse staff interaction, which may then represent an important patient safety threat. Also, anaesthesiologist's physical and mental state and limitations may interfere with patient safety. The concept of physician well being is multidimensional and includes factors related to each physician as an individual as well as to the working environment. Creating optimal safe conditions for patients, therefore, requires actions at both the personal level and the working conditions. Also, initiatives to ban rude and dismissive communication should be implemented in order to further improve intraoperative patient safety.

TI  - Supporting Pro-Poor Reforms of Agricultural Systems in Eastern DRC (Africa) with Remotely Sensed Data: A Possible Contribution of Spatial Entropy to Interpret Land Management Practices
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, agriculture represents the most important economic sector, and land control can be considered a perpetual source of conflict. Knowledge of the existing production system distribution is fundamental for both informing national land tenure reforms and guiding more effective agricultural development interventions. The present paper focuses on existing agricultural production systems in Katoyi collectivity, Masisi territory, where returning Internally and Externally Displaced People are resettling. We aim to define a repeatable methodology for building evidence-based and updated knowledge concerning the spatial distribution of the two existing production systems: subsistence-oriented agriculture (SOA) and business-oriented agriculture (BOA). To this aim, we used a supervised object-based classification approach on remotely sensed Sentinel-2 imagery to classify land cover. To classify production systems further within the "agriculture" and "pasture" land use classes, binary classification based on an entropy value threshold was performed. An iterative approach was adopted to define the final H-NDVI threshold that minimised commission and omission errors and maximised overall accuracy and class separability. The methodology achieved acceptable observed accuracy (OA equal to 80-90% respectively for agricultural and pasture areas) in the assessment. SOA and BOA respectively covered 24.4 and 75.6% of the collectivity area (34,606 ha). The results conclude that land use and entropy analysis can draw an updated picture of existing land distribution among different production systems, supporting better-adapted intervention strategies in development cooperation and pro-poor agrarian land tenure reforms in conflict-ridden landscapes.

TI  - FPGA Design for On-Board Measurement of Intermittency From In-Situ Satellite Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intermittency is a fundamental property of space plasma dynamics, characterizing turbulent dynamical variables as well as passive scalars. Its qualitative and quantitative description from in-situ data requires an accurate estimation of the probability density functions (PDFs) of fluctuations and their moments, particularly the flatness, a normalized fourth order moment of the PDF. Such a statistical description needs a sufficiently large number of samples for the computation to be meaningful. Due to inherent technological limitations (e.g., limited telemetry bandwidth) not all samples collected on-board can be sent to the ground for further analysis. Therefore, a technology designed to process on-board the data and to compute the flatness is useful to fully exploit the capabilities of scientific instruments installed on robotic platforms, including nanosatellites. We designed, built, and tested in laboratory such a technology based on Field Programable Gate Arrays (FPGA). The building principle is the classical estimation of PDFs and their moments, based on normalized histograms of a measure. The technical design uses the FloPoCo (Floating-Point Cores) framework with customized arithmetic operators; the computation block is a pipelined architecture, which computes a new value of the flatness in each clock cycle. The design and implementation achieve optimization directives of the FPGA resources relevant for operation in space, like area, energy efficiency, and precision. The technology was tested in laboratory using Xilinx SRL16 or SRLC32 macros and provides correct results validated with test time series provided by magnetic field data collected in the solar wind by ULYSSES spacecraft. The characteristics and performance of the laboratory prototype pave the way for a space qualified version of the laboratory design.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE NEW MODULAR BIOGENTS BG-PRO MOSQUITO TRAP IN COMPARISON TO CDC, EVS, BG-SENTINEL, AND BG-MOSQUITAIRE TRAPS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito surveillance is an essential component of mosquito control and mosquito traps are a universally employed tool to monitor adult populations. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the new modular Biogents BG-Pro mosquito trap (BGP) and compare its performance to 4 widely used traps for adult mosquitoes: the BG-Sentinel (BGS), the BG Mosquitaire (BGM), the CDC miniature light trap (CDC), and the encephalitis vector survey trap (EVS). One semi-field and 9 field Latin square trials were performed in 7 countries. Results showed that the collection performance of the BGP was equivalent to or exceeded that of the BGS, BGM, CDC, and EVS traps in head-to-head comparisons. The BGP uses 35% less power than the CDC and 75% less than the BGS and BGM. This lower power consumption allows it to run at 5 V for 2 days using a small lightweight 10,000-mAh rechargeable power bank. The BG-Pro is an excellent alternative for the surveillance of mosquito species that are usually monitored with BG-Sentinel, CDC, or EVS traps.

TI  - Morphometric analysis of Moridhal watershed in Dhemaji District of Assam, India using remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation was carried out to study the morphometric properties of the Moridhal watershed in the Dhemaji district of Assam, India to understand its nature for proper utilization of natural resources of the watershed. The Moridhal watershed, encompassing a 30,730 ha geographical area, is situated between 94 degrees 52 E to 94 degrees 69 E longitude and 27 degrees 38 N to 27 degrees 64 N latitude. Based on total variation in satellite data (Resourcesat-2, LISS-4), four distinct physiographic units of the watershed were delineated which included: upper piedmont plain (1,844 ha), lower piedmont plain (2,391 ha), alluvial plain (9,888 ha), and flood plain (16,607 ha). The stream order map of the Moridhal River Basin was prepared by on-screen digitization using QGIS 3.12.0 software. Twenty-nine numbers of morphometric parameters were evaluated through the measurement of linear, areal, and relief aspects of the river basin. The drainage streams were delineated up to fourth order with stream numbers of 36, 14, 5, and 1, for I, II, III, and IV order, respectively. The computed value of aerial aspects like elongation ratio, circulatory ratio, and form factor revealed the elongated shape of the watershed area. The studied relief aspects included parameters like basin relief, relief ratio, ruggedness number, and relative relief. The morphometric properties of the Moridhal watershed depicted the permeable nature of the soil which indicated that the precipitation would mostly penetrate the soil and, thereby, a lesser amount would contribute to the runoff. The present study also revealed that Geographic Information System software has immense utility in the analysis of the linear and aerial morphometric aspects of the drainage basins.

TI  - Satellite-derived shallow wetland bathymetry using different classification algorithms and datasets
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) effectively identifies, analyzes, and monitors wetlands. In addition to these two-dimensional studies, RS is used with several techniques in determining shallow water depths. The primary purpose of this study is to obtain shallow wetland bathymetry utilizing spectral reflections obtained at different water depths by field study and satellite images. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are widely used in remote sensing, are used in this study. Four algorithms were selected as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Since machine learning algorithms use training samples/datasets, the classification accuracy is directly related to selecting these data. The effect of pixel counts on classification was investigated by using two different training data set also. Duden (Kulu) Lake, which is a shallow wetland, was chosen as the study area. The Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) classification algorithm divided into as many clusters as possible was applied on Sentinel-2 multispectral images. All classes were redefined using measured spectral signatures and were created a bathymetric map. This map was used as reference data in creating training sets and the accuracy assessment of ML algorithms. When the water surface areas obtained from algorithms were compared with the bathymetric map and Normalized Difference Water Index, the best result was obtained with RF. According to the accuracy assessment results, it was seen that the number of training data affects the accuracy, and the best results were obtained with SVM and RF algorithms with training data containing more pixels (overall accuracy 93.87% and 92.64, kappa 0.89 and 0.87, respectively).

TI  - Revisited Estimation of Moderate Resolution <i>Sargassum</i> Fractional Coverage Using Decametric Satellite Data (S2-MSI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2011, massive stranding of the brown algae Sargassum has regularly affected the coastal waters of the West Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa, leading to significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The AFAI algal index (Alternative Floating Algae Index) is often used with remote sensing data in order to estimate the Sargassum coverage, and more precisely the AFAI deviation, which consists of the difference between AFAI and AFAI of the Sargassum-free background. In this study, the AFAI deviation is computed using NASA's 1 km Terra/MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and ESA/Copernicus's 20 m Sentinel-2/MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) for the same sites and at the same time. Both MODIS and MSI AFAI deviations are compared to confirm the relevance of AFAI deviation technique for two very different spatial resolutions. A high coefficient of determination was found, thus confirming a satisfactory downsampling from 20 m (MSI) to 1 km (MODIS). Then, AFAI deviations are used to estimate the fractional coverage of Sargassum (noted FC). A new linear relationship between the MODIS AFAI deviation and FC is established using the dense Sargassum aggregations observed by MSI data. The AFAI deviation is proportional to FC with a factor of proportionality close to 0.08. Finally, it is shown that the factor is dependent on the Sargassum spectral reflectance, submersion or physiological state.

TI  - ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF SHALLOW WATER DEPTH ESTIMATION BY USING MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate bathymetry information is needed to support an effective policy on utilization and management of coastal natural resources. Satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) has been widely considered as an advanced and low-cost method for shallow water depth estimation. This is due to the availability of multi-temporal and multi-resolution satellite data. This study focuses on evaluating the accuracy of satellite derived bathymetry derived from multispectral images recorded by various sensors with various spatial resolution. The study area is located in a small island nearby Morotai Island, Indonesia. Four SDB models were compared. The implementation of the SDB model was carried out by combining echo-sounding measurements and the reflectance of blue, green, red, and near infrared bands of three satellite images (World View 2, Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8). Our findings reveal that all three satellite images performed well in assessing SDB at various spatial and spectral resolution, however, the use of high-resolution imagery did not always improve accuracy, for example when using SVM (Support Vector Machine). When using RF (Random Forest), Sentinel 2A produced the best accuracy and when using GAM (Generalized Additive Model), the most feasible result was generated only by using WorldView 2 image. In all cases, RF performed well and provided the most accurate SDB prediction.

TI  - Combining GEDI and Sentinel-2 for wall-to-wall mapping of tall and short crops
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution crop type maps are an important tool for improving food security, and remote sensing is increasingly used to create such maps in regions that possess ground truth labels for model training. However, these labels are absent in many regions, and models trained on optical satellite features often exhibit low performance when transferred across geographies. Here we explore the use of NASA's global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar instrument, combined with Sentinel-2 optical data, for crop type mapping. Using data from three major cropped regions (in China, France, and the United States) we first demonstrate that GEDI energy profiles can reliably distinguish maize, a crop typically above 2 m in height, from crops like rice and soybean that are shorter. We further show that these GEDI profiles provide much more invariant features across geographies compared to spectral and phenological features detected by passive optical sensors. GEDI is able to distinguish maize from other crops within each region with accuracies higher than 84%, and able to transfer across regions with accuracies higher than 82%, compared to 64% for transfer of optical features. Finally, we show that GEDI profiles can be used to generate training labels for models based on optical imagery from Sentinel-2, thereby enabling the creation of 10 m wall-to-wall maps of tall versus short crops in label-scarce regions. As maize is the second most widely-grown crop in the world and often the only tall crop grown within a landscape, we conclude that GEDI offers great promise for improving global crop type maps.

TI  - Evolution of the Pyrethroids Target-Site Resistance Mechanisms in Senegal: Early Stage of the <i>Vgsc-1014F</i> and <i>Vgsc-1014S</i> Allelic Frequencies Shift
T2  - GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution and spread of insecticide resistance mechanisms amongst malaria vectors across the sub-Saharan Africa threaten the effectiveness and sustainability of current insecticide-based vector control interventions. However, a successful insecticide resistance management plan relies strongly on evidence of historical and contemporary mechanisms circulating. This study aims to retrospectively determine the evolution and spread of pyrethroid resistance mechanisms among natural Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations in Senegal. Samples were randomly drawn from an existing mosquito sample, collected in 2013, 2017, and 2018 from 10 sentinel sites monitored by the Senegalese National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP). Molecular species of An. gambiae s.l. and the resistance mutations at the Voltage-gated Sodium Channel 1014 (Vgsc-1014) locus were characterised using PCR-based assays. The genetic diversity of the Vgsc gene was further analyzed by sequencing. The overall species composition revealed the predominance of Anopheles arabiensis (73.08%) followed by An. gambiae s.s. (14.48%), Anopheles coluzzii (10.94%) and Anopheles gambiae-coluzii hybrids (1.48%). Both Vgsc-1014F and Vgsc-1014S mutations were found in all studied populations with a spatial variation of allele frequencies from 3% to 90%; and 7% to 41%, respectively. The two mutations have been detected since 2013 across all the selected health districts, with Vgsc-L1014S frequency increasing over the years while Vgsc-1014F decreasing. At species level, the Vgsc-1014F and Vgsc-1014S alleles were more frequent amongst An. gambiae s.s. (70%) and An. arabiensis (20%). The Vgsc gene was found to be highly diversified with eight different haplotypes shared between Vgsc-1014F and Vgsc-1014S. The observed co-occurrence of Vgsc-1014F and Vgsc-1014S mutations suggest that pyrethroid resistance is becoming a widespread phenomenon amongst malaria vector populations, and the NMCP needs to address this issue to sustain the gain made in controlling malaria.

TI  - Reported Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Are Decreasing Among Young Black Women: Good News or Bad News? A Narrative Review
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Since 2010, reported chlamydia and gonorrhea rates decreased among Black women aged 15 to 19 years and were stable for Black women aged 20 to 24 years in the United States. Rates increased for older Black women aged 25 to 39 years and all White women. The Black/White rate ratio decreased across age groups. We examined whether trends in reported rates reflected changing prevalence or changing screening. We analyzed trends in reported chlamydia and gonorrhea rates from 2010 to 2018 among women in the United States aged 15 to 39 years by age and race/ethnicity subgroup, state, and reporting source. Most jurisdictions reported decreased chlamydia and gonorrhea rates among Black teens and increased rates among White teens and older women. Between 2010 and 2018, public clinics reported fewer cases, especially among young Black women, that were not restored by increases elsewhere. We reviewed literature on trends in screening, prevalence, and sequelae. Family planning clinics annual reports showed chlamydia tests among women younger than 25 years decreased by 541,573 tests (-38%) in 2018 compared with 2010 and the number of women visiting sexually transmitted disease clinics had decreased 50% by 2016 compared with 2010. Prevalence of chlamydia in a sentinel population (Job Corps) was unchanged for Black women younger than 25 years and increased for Whites aged 20 to 24 years. Sequelae trends using data from a large all-payer emergency department database were mixed: pelvic inflammatory disease decreased, whereas ectopic pregnancy increased. Decreases in testing at public clinics likely missed diagnoses among young Black women, a group traditionally at highest risk and in need of more testing. Innovative approaches to screening are needed.

TI  - A Fusion of Feature-Oriented Principal Components of Multispectral Data to Map Granite Exposures of Pakistan
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite low spatial resolutions, thermal infrared bands (TIRs) are generally more suitable for mineral mapping due to fundamental tones and high penetration in vegetated areas compared to shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. However, the weak overtone combinations of SWIR bands for minerals can be compensated by fusing SWIR-bearing data (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) with other multispectral data containing fundamental tones from TIR bands. In this paper, marble in a granitic complex in Mardan District (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) in Pakistan is discriminated by fusing feature-oriented principal component selection (FPCS) obtained from the ASTER, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Sentinel-2 MSI data. Cloud computing from Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to apply FPCS before and after the decorrelation stretching of Landsat-8, ASTER, and Sentinel-2 MSI data containing five (5) bands in the Landsat-8 OLI and TIRS and six (6) bands each in the ASTER and Sentinel-2 MSI datasets, resulting in 34 components (i.e., 2 x 17 components). A weighted linear combination of selected three components was used to map granite and marble. The samples collected during field visits and petrographic analysis confirmed the remote sensing results by revealing the region's precise contact and extent of marble and granite rock types. The experimental results reflected the theoretical advantages of the proposed approach compared with the conventional stacking of band data for PCA-based fusion. The proposed methodology was also applied to delineate granite deposits in Karoonjhar Mountains, Nagarparker (Sindh province) and the Kotah Dome, Malakand (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province) in Pakistan. The paper presents a cost-effective methodology by the fusion of FPCS components for granite/marble mapping during mineral resource estimation. The importance of SWIR-bearing components in fusion represents minor minerals present in granite that could be used to model the engineering properties of the rock mass.

TI  - Quantitative Retrieval of Soil Salinity Using Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is the main reason for declining soil quality and a reduction in agricultural productivity. We derive the spatial distribution of soil moisture from the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) of Landsat TM-8 OLI images to analyze the effect of spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture on the retrieval accuracy of soil salinity. We establish five soil salinity inversion models for different soil moisture levels (drought levels) based on the canopy response salinity index (CRSI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and automatic water extraction index (AWEI) derived from Landsat TM-8 OLI images. The inversion accuracy of soil salinity is assessed using 42 field samples. The results show that the average accuracies of the five inversion models are higher than that of the traditional soil salinity inversion model of the entire study area. The proposed model underestimates soil salinity in high-moisture areas and overestimates it in drought areas. Therefore, inversion models of soil salinization should consider spatial differences in soil moisture to improve the inversion accuracy.

TI  - Time series remote sensing image classification framework using combination of deep learning and multiple classifiers system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, time series image (TSI) has been reported to be an effective resource to mapping fine land use/land cover (LULC), and deep learning, in particular, has been gaining growing attention in this field. However, deep learning methods using single classifier need further improvement for accurate TSI classification owing to the 1D temporal properties and insufficient dense time series of the remote sensing images. To overcome such disadvantages, we proposed an innovative approach involving construction of TSI and combination of deep learning and multiple classifiers system (MCS). Firstly, we used a normalised difference index (NDI) to establish an NDIsbased TSI and then designed a framework consisting of a deep learning-based feature extractor and multiple classifiers system (MCS) based classification model to classify the TSI. With the new approach, our experiments were conducted on Landsat images located in two counties, Sutter and Kings in California, United States. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method achieves great progress on accuracy improvement and LULC mapping, outperforming classifications using comparative deep learning and non-deep learning methods.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Fengyun-3D Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (FY-3D MERSI-II) Data with the Improved Two-Factor Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential parameter widely used in environmental studies. The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-II) boarded on the second generation Chinese polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, Fengyun-3D (FY-3D), provides a new opportunity for LST retrieval at a spatial resolution of 250 m that is higher than that of the already widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) LST data of 1000 m. However, there is no operational LST product from FY-3D MERSI-II data available for free access. Therefore, in this study, we developed an improved two-factor split-window algorithm (TFSWA) of LST retrieval from this data source as it has two thermal-infrared (TIR) bands. The essential coefficients of the TFSWA algorithm have been carefully and precisely estimated for the FY-3D MERSI-II TIR thermal bands. A new approach for estimating land surface emissivity has been developed using the ASTER Global Emissivity Database (ASTER GED) and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) data. A model to estimate the atmospheric water vapor content (AWVC) from the three atmospheric water vapor absorption bands (bands 16, 17, and 18) has been developed as AWVC has been recognized as the most important factor determining the variation of AT. Using MODTRAN 5.2, the equations for the AT estimate from the retrieved AWVC were established. In addition, the AT of the pixels at the far edge of FY-3D MERSI-II data may be strongly affected by the increase of the optical path. Viewing zenith angle (VZA) correction equations were proposed in the study to correct this effect on AT estimation. Field data from four stations were applied to validate the improved TFSWA in the study. Cross-validation with MODIS LST (MYD11) was also conducted to evaluate the improved TFSWA. The cross-validation result indicates that the FY-3D MERSI-II LST from the improved TFSWA are comparable with MODIS LST while the correlation coefficients between FY-3D MERSI-II LST and MODIS LST over the Mid-East China region are in the range of 0.84~0.98 for different seasons and land cover types. Validation with 318 field LST samples indicates that the average MAE and R-2 of the scenes at the four stations are about 1.97 K and 0.98, respectively. Thus, it could be concluded that the improved TFSWA developed in the study can be a good algorithm for LST retrieval from FY-3D MERSI-II data with acceptable accuracy.

TI  - Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification With Graph Fusion Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land cover classification has been an important task in remote sensing. With the development of various sensors technologies, carrying out classification work with multisource remote sensing (MSRS) data has shown an advantage over using a single type of data. Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are able to represent the spectral properties of land cover, which is quite common for land cover understanding. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images contain altitude information of the ground, which is greatly helpful with urban scene analysis. Current HSI and LiDAR fusion methods perform feature extraction and feature fusion separately, which cannot well exploit the correlation of data sources. In order to make full use of the correlation of multisource data, an unsupervised feature extraction-fusion network for HSI and LiDAR, which utilizes feature fusion to guide the feature extraction procedure, is proposed in this article. More specifically, the network takes multisource data as input and directly output the unified fused feature. A multimodal graph is constructed for feature fusion, and graph-based loss functions including Laplacian loss and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) loss are utilized to constrain the feature extraction network. Experimental results on several data sets demonstrate the proposed network can achieve more excellent classification performance than some state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Achieving Breakthroughs in Global Hydrologic Science by Unlocking the Power of Multisensor, Multidisciplinary Earth Observations
T2  - AGU ADVANCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Over the last half century, remote sensing has transformed hydrologic science. Whereas early efforts were devoted to observation of discrete variables, we now consider spaceborne missions dedicated to interlinked global hydrologic processes. Furthermore, cloud computing and computational techniques are accelerating analyses of these data. How will the hydrologic community use these new resources to better understand the world's water and related challenges facing society? In this commentary, we suggest that optimizing the benefits of remote sensing for advancing hydrologic research will happen by integrating multidisciplinary and multisensor data, leveraging commercial satellite measurements, and employing data assimilation, cloud computing, and machine learning. We provide several recommendations to these ends.Plain Language Summary Observations from satellites have transformed hydrologic science. Early efforts, five decades ago, mapped attributes like snow cover, rainfall, topography, and vegetation, but now we consider new missions specifically designed to study global hydrologic processes. We also take advantage of new technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. We describe strategies for maximizing the benefits of remote sensing for hydrology, encouraging research across disciplines using multiple sensors, using new commercially available satellites, and combining remote sensing measurements with hydrologic models.

T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The subcutaneous (SC) route has evolved significantly. More than two dozen chemotherapy and supportive therapies have been approved for use in the oncology setting. Several IV therapies have been approved for the SC route and require a significantly higher volume than historical maximum limits. Differences exist in how these drugs are administered as compared to older chemotherapy agents.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to provide a brief history of the SC route and describe its role in cancer treatment. The use of recombinant hyaluronidase is reviewed within the context of SC monoclonal antibodies. Proper administration techniques and interventions for reducing patient discomfort are discussed.METHODS: Sentinel medical texts, pharmacokinetic studies, manufacturer's recommendations, and peer-reviewed articles were examined.FINDINGS: The SC route offers several advantages over the oral and IV routes. A clear understanding of anatomical site selection and injection techniques is beneficial for providing requisite patient education.

TI  - Identifying Predictors of Physical Abuse Evaluation of Injured Infants Opportunities to Improve Recognition
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To identify predictors of physical abuse evaluation in infants younger than 6 months with visible injury and to determine the prevalence of occult fracture and intracranial hemorrhage in those evaluated. Methods Infants 6.0 months or younger who presented with visible injury to a pediatric hospital-affiliated emergency department or urgent care between July 2013 and January 2017 were included. Potential predictors included sociodemographics, treatment site, provider, injury characteristics, and history. Outcome variables included completion of a radiographic skeletal survey and identification of fracture (suspected or occult) and intracranial hemorrhage. Results Visible injury was identified in 378 infants, 47% of whom did not receive a skeletal survey. Of those with bruising, burns, or intraoral injuries, skeletal survey was less likely in patients 3 months or older, of black race, presenting to an urgent care or satellite location, evaluated by a non-pediatric emergency medicine-trained physician or nurse practitioner, or with a burn. Of these, 25% had an occult fracture, and 24% had intracranial hemorrhage. Occult fractures were also found in infants with apparently isolated abrasion/laceration (14%), subconjunctival hemorrhage (33%), and scalp hematoma/swelling (13%). Conclusions About half of preambulatory infants with visible injury were not evaluated for physical abuse. Targeted education is recommended as provider experience and training influenced the likelihood of physical abuse evaluation. Occult fractures and intracranial hemorrhage were often found in infants presenting with seemingly isolated "minor" injuries. Physical abuse should be considered when any injury is identified in an infant younger than 6 months.

TI  - Spatial analysis of the regeneration after fire in forest of Lardjem (Wilaya of Tissemsilt, Algeria)
T2  - Biodiversity Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to characterize the changes that have occurred in the Lardjem forest (Wilaya of Tissemsilt, Algeria) after four years of disastrous fire passage in 2012. The methodological approach adopted is essentially based on the analysis and interpretation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The approach is based on the analysis of satellite data into classes taken before and after the fire (1987-2016) associated with field checks. The results, validated against ground-truth data, show a considerable reduction in the forest class with 81.72% and the maquis class with 48.48%. On the contrary, it has been shown that the area of clear maquis and empty area increased with a rate of 117.11% and 39% respectively. The different mutations between the occupancy classes before and after the fire show that the forest stratum of wild Thuja Tetraclinis articulata (Vahl) Mast has recovered its appearance with a very low percentage. This recovery is more significant as soon as the conditions are favorable (northern slope, weak slopes and humidity).The parts covered by the tree stratum are transformed into clear maquis, matorrals and empty soils, these classes can reach a more advanced stage if the zone is moved away to repetitive fires in the coming years. Finally, a repopulation of the empty parts associated with a management and protection plan is necessary to safeguard the perinity of this forest.

TI  - Spike in Asthma Healthcare Presentations in Eastern England during June 2021: A Retrospective Observational Study Using Syndromic Surveillance Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Thunderstorm asthma is often characterised by a sudden surge in patients presenting with exacerbated symptoms of asthma linked to thunderstorm activity. Here, we describe a large spike in asthma and difficulty breathing symptoms observed across parts of England on 17 June 2021. The number of healthcare presentations during the asthma event was compared to expected levels for the overall population and across specific regions. Across affected geographical areas, emergency department attendances for asthma increased by 560% on 17 June compared to the average number of weekday daily attendances during the previous 4 weeks. General practitioner out of hours contacts increased by 349%, National Health Service (NHS) 111 calls 193%, NHS 111 online assessments 581% and ambulance call outs 54%. Increases were particularly noted in patient age groups 5-14 and 15-44 years. In non-affected regions, increases were small (<10%) or decreased, except for NHS 111 online assessments where there was an increase of 39%. A review of the meteorological conditions showed several localised, weak, or moderate thunderstorms specifically across parts of Southeast England on the night of June 16. In this unprecedented episode of asthma, the links to meteorologically defined thunderstorm activity were not as clear as previous episodes, with less evidence of 'severe' thunderstorm activity in those areas affected, prompting further discussion about the causes of these events and implications for public health management of the risk.

TI  - Evaluating remote sensing approaches for mapping the bathymetry of Lake Manzala, Egypt
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Manzala is considered the largest lagoon in Egypt. The lake has significant economic and environmental impacts that should be managed based on management models. The bathymetry of this lake, which is time consuming and laborious to obtain in the field, is one of the key input files for developing hydrological models of the lake. Remote sensing technology is used to determine satellite bathymetric maps with reasonable accuracy. The objective of the present work was to utilize Landsat 8 satellite imagery to determine the bathymetry of Lake Manzala. Generalized linear model (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, bagging (BAG, an ensemble regression algorithm), least-squares boosting fitting ensemble (LSB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were used in this study to process the images and manage the database of each image. The Landsat images were corrected for atmospheric conditions and the sunglint effect. Then values from the logarithms of corrected reflectance bands (coastal, blue, green, and red) and their ratio logarithms at locations corresponding to GPS surveys were extracted. Two assessing metrics, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation (R), were used to calibrate the derived logarithm values for the model using observed data for the lake. The results show that the BAG and decision tree approaches perform well for Lake Manzala. Such methodologies should be applied for bathymetry determination, especially for shallow lakes, to save monitoring effort and costs. This approach facilitates the development of management models for lakes.

TI  - Subpixel Analysis of Primary and Secondary Infrared Emitters with Nighttime VIIRS Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is a coupled exothermic/endothermic system that transfers carbon in several forms to the atmosphere, ultimately leaving mineral ash. The exothermic phases include flaming and smoldering, which produce the heat that drives the endothermic processes. The endothermic components include pre-heating and pyrolysis, which produce the fuel consumed by flaming and smoldering. These components can be broadly distinguished from each other based on temperature. For several years, we have researched the subpixel analysis of two temperature phases present in fire pixels detected in nighttime VIIRS data. Here, we present the flaming subtractive method, with which we have successfully derived temperatures and source areas for two infrared (IR) emitters and a cooler background. This is developed as an add-on to the existing VIIRS nightfire algorithm version 3 (VNF v.3) which uses Planck curve fitting to calculate temperatures and source areas for a single IR emitter and background. The flaming subtractive method works with data collected in four spectral ranges: near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR). With sunlight eliminated, the NIR and SWIR radiances can be fully attributed to the primary IR emitter. The analysis begins with Planck curve modeling for the primary emitter based on the NIR and SWIR radiances, yielding temperature, source area and primary emitter radiances in all spectral bands. The primary emitter radiances are subtracted from each spectral band and then the residual radiance is analyzed for a secondary IR emitter and the background. Spurious results are obtained in pixels lacking a discernable secondary emitter. These misfit pixels revert back to the single IR emitter analysis of VNF v.3. In tests run for two California megafires, we found that the primary emitters straddle the temperature ranges for flaming and smoldering, the exothermic portions of biomass burning, which are apparently commingled on the ground. The secondary emitter temperatures span 350-750 K, corresponding to pre-heating and slow pyrolysis. The natural gas flare test case had few numbers of successful secondary emitter retrievals and a wide range of secondary emitter temperatures. The flaming subtractive analysis is the key addition to VNF version 4, which will commence production later in 2021. In 2022, we will seek validation of the VNF v.4 from nighttime Landsat and other data sources.

TI  - Farm-Scale Crop Yield Prediction from Multi-Temporal Data Using Deep Hybrid Neural Networks
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Farm-scale crop yield prediction is a natural development of sustainable agriculture, producing a rich amount of food without depleting and polluting environmental resources. Recent studies on crop yield production are limited to regional-scale predictions. The regional-scale crop yield predictions usually face challenges in capturing local yield variations based on farm management decisions and the condition of the field. For this research, we identified the need to create a large and reusable farm-scale crop yield production dataset, which could provide precise farm-scale ground-truth prediction targets. Therefore, we utilise multi-temporal data, such as Sentinel-2 satellite images, weather data, farm data, grain delivery data, and cadastre-specific data. We introduce a deep hybrid neural network model to train this multi-temporal data. This model combines the features of convolutional layers and recurrent neural networks to predict farm-scale crop yield production across Norway. The proposed model could efficiently make the target predictions with the mean absolute error of 76 kg per 1000 m(2). In conclusion, the reusable farm-scale multi-temporal crop yield dataset and the proposed novel model could meet the actual requirements for the prediction targets in this paper, providing further valuable insights for the research community.

TI  - Identification and modelling of forest fire severity and risk zones in the Cross-Niger transition forest with remotely sensed satellite data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are a serious environmental hazard within the forest ecosystem, which can be studied with Remote Sensing and GIS. The aim of the study is to identify and model forest fires severity and risk zones within the Cross - Niger transition forest. To achieve this aim, remotely sensed data, such as Landsat - 8 OLI (2020) and ASTER DEM were used to produce land cover maps and topography parameters such as aspect, elevation and slope. The topographic maps and the Google Earth imagery were used to extract human settlements and road networks. The final forest fire risk zone (FFRZ) map was prepared by integrating the different parameters such as Land cover, aspect, elevation, slope, proximities to roads and settlements in the ArcGIS environment. The FFRZ was categorized into three categories as low, moderate and high risk zones, based on their fire susceptibility. The category of low, moderate and high FFRZ were represented as 2731.7 km(2) (12.5%), 17997.69 km(2) (82.59 %) and 1061.63 km(2) (4.87%) respectively. The study shows that Remote Sensing and GIS are excellent tools for modelling forest fire risk zones, hence proving that fires are anthropogenic in origin.

TI  - Drought analysis of Van Lake Basin with remote sensing and GIS technologies
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is defined as the amount of precipitation in a region less than the amount of evaporation. Human facts such as population growth, industrialization, deforestation, and uncontrolled irrigation in agriculture are among the factors that cause drought. Today, with the increase of human activities such as population growth and industrialization, drought has become a serious life-threatening issue. With a depth of around 450 m and a volume of over 600 km3, Lake Van (Turkey) is the world's largest soda lake and one of the world's largest closed-basin lakes. Increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation in recent years indicate that there may be a drought in Lake Ban. It is important to analyze this drought and determine its change. Methods derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems technologies provide speed, practicality, and high accuracy in determining drought. Research to date has not yet determined the change of drought in Van Lake Basin using remote sensing and GIS methods. In this study, the drought in Van Lake Basin was examined periodically from 1989 to 2019. In this context, Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps of the basin were obtained from Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellite images. In addition to remote sensing and GIS analysis, the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated with precipitation data obtained from meteorology stations to determine the drought in the region. According to the results, it was concluded that the drought level in the basin has been increasing from 1989 to 2019. The findings of this research provide insights for drought increase in Van Lake Basin. Also, this study strengthens the idea that remote sensing and GIS methods can be used in drought studies effectively. (c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Assessment of agricultural development preventive policies for restoration of Urmia Lake in Barandoz Basin, Iran
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake (UL), located in northwestern Iran, is an important global biosphere; however, it has been experiencing a sharp drop in its water levels since 1995. While some measures have been taken since 2013 for the lake restoration, their impact on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes in the UL basin have not been studied. In this study, we evaluated the restrictive policies effectiveness on agriculture development in the Barandoz basin, Iran. Therefore, the LULC changes of the study basin were analyzed using RS, GIS and Landsat satellite images from 1992 to 2018. The results showed an increase in rain-fed agricultural lands, garden, and built-up areas, which was about 268% (17248 ha), 160% (8934 ha), and 174% (1444 ha), respectively, during the period 1992-2018. On the other hand, rangelands, irrigated croplands, barren lands, and water bodies have decreased about 22% (19298 ha), 12% (1972 ha), 30% (5240 ha), and 99% (1117 ha), respectively. Our study also showed that gardens have increased about 40% (4174 ha), from 2013 to 2018. Analysis of the hydro-climatic parameters indicated no significant decrease in the precipitation, a significant decrease in the outflow from the basin, and a considerable increase in the groundwater depth in the Barandoz plain.

TI  - Analysis of the Cloud Removal Effect of Sentinel-2A/B NDVI Monthly Composite Images for Rice Paddy and High-altitude Cabbage Fields
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crops show sensitive spectral characteristics according to their species and growth conditions and although frequent observation is required especially in summer, it is difficult to utilize optical satellite images due to the rainy season. To solve this problem, Constrained Cloud-Maximum Normalized difference vegetation index Composite (CC-MNC) algorithm was developed to generate periodic composite images with minimal cloud effect. In this study, using this method, monthly Sentinel2A/B Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composite images were produced for paddies and high-latitude cabbage fields from 2019 to 2021. In August 2020, which received 200mm more precipitation than other periods, the effect of clouds, was also significant in MODIS NDVI 16-day composite product. Except for this period, the CC-MNC method was able to reduce the cloud ratio of 45.4% of the original daily image to 14.9%. In the case of rice paddy, there was no significant difference between Sentinel-2A/B and MODIS NDVI values. In addition, it was possible to monitor the rice growth cycle well even with a revisit cycle 5 days. In the case of high-latitude cabbage fields, Sentinel2A/B showed the short growth cycle of cabbage well, but MODIS showed limitations in spatial resolution. In addition, the CC-MNC method showed that cloud pixels were used for compositing at the harvest time, suggesting that the View Zenith Angle (VZA) threshold needs to be adjusted according to the domestic region.

TI  - Direct impact of solar farm deployment on surface longwave radiation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivated by a previous study of using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) observations to quantify changes in surface shortwave spectral reflectances caused by six solar farms in the southwest United States, here we used a similar method to study the longwave effects of the same six solar farms, with emphases on surface emissivities and land surface temperature (LST). Two MODIS surface products were examined: one relying on generalized split-window algorithm while assuming emissivities from land cover classifications (MYD11A2), the other based on Temperature Emissivity Separation algorithm capable of dynamically retrieving emissivities (MYD21A2). Both products suggest that, compared to adjacent regions without changes before and after solar farm constructions, the solar farm sites have reduced outgoing radiances in three MODIS infrared window channels. Such reduction in upward longwave radiation is consistent with previous in situ measurements. The MYD11A2 results show constant emissivities before and after solar farm constructions because its land type classification algorithm is not aware of the presence of solar farms. The estimated daytime and nighttime LST reduction due to solar farm deployment are similar to 1-4K and similar to 0.2-0.9K, respectively. The MYD21A2 results indicate a decrease in Band 31 (10.78-11.28 mu m) emissivity up to -0.01 and little change in Band 32 (11.77-12.27 mu m) emissivity. The LST decreases in the MYD21A2 is slightly smaller than its counterpart in the MYD11A2. Laboratory and in situ measurements indicate the longwave emissivity of solar panels can be as low as 0.83, considerably smaller than MODIS retrieved surface emissivity over the solar farm sites. The contribution of exposed and shaded ground within the solar farm to the upward longwave radiation needs to be considered to fully explain the results. A synthesis of MODIS observations and published in situ measurements is presented. Implication for parameterizing such solar farm longwave effect in the climate models is also discussed.

TI  - Research Progress on Remote Sensing Classification Methods for Farmland Vegetation
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop planting area and spatial distribution information have important practical significance for food security, global change, and sustainable agricultural development. How to efficiently and accurately identify crops in a timely manner by remote sensing in order to determine the crop planting area and its temporal-spatial dynamic change information is a core issue of monitoring crop growth and estimating regional crop yields. Based on hundreds of relevant documents from the past 25 years, in this paper, we summarize research progress in relation to farmland vegetation identification and classification by remote sensing. The classification and identification of farmland vegetation includes classification based on vegetation index, spectral bands, multi-source data fusion, artificial intelligence learning, and drone remote sensing. Representative studies of remote sensing methods are collated, the main content of each technology is summarized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed. Current problems related to crop remote sensing identification are then identified and future development directions are proposed.

TI  - Characteristics inversion of underground goaf based on InSAR techniques and PIM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The nature of coal mining areas, such as private exploitation, illegal exploitation, is not only a waste of a large amount of coal resources, but is also very likely to cause geological problems such as surface collapse and cracks. However, existing supervision methods are mostly in the form of mass report, on-site inspection, and geological exploration, which are not suitable for underground goaf detection in large-scale non-target areas. Therefore, this paper presents a method for locating and inversion of underground goaf based on a combination of interfero-metric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques and a probability integral model (PIM). Firstly, the Line-of-Sight deformation of the subsidence basin above goaf generated by combining InSAR and Offset-Tracking algorithm is taken as the real land subsidence. Then, according to the obtained surface deformation, the initial ranges of eight goaf locational parameters are determined, and the correlation function between the surface deformation and the location of underground goaf is constructed. The Oppositional-based Learning Chaotic Bat Algorithm (OLCBA) is used to search the optimal parameters to satisfy the minimum error between the ground deformation calculated by PIM and the Line-of-Sight deformation obtained by SAR. Therefore, the optimal pa-rameters are considered as the characteristics of underground goaf. The simulation results show that the maximum relative error appears in the dip angle of the inversed parameters of the goaf location, which is 3.70%. Taking a known working face of the Daliuta coal mine as the test object and 11 TerraSAR-X images as the data sources, the land subsidence is obtained and compared with GPS measurements, then the underground mining characteristics of the working face is successfully retrieved. Although the maximum relative error of the dip angle is 81.5%, the absolute error is only 1.63 degrees and the relative errors of the other main parameters are less than 15.03%.

TI  - An Efficient Satellite Resource Cooperative Scheduling Method on Spatial Information Networks
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To overcome the low timeliness of resource scheduling problems in spatial information networks, we propose a method based on a dynamic reconstruction of resource request queues and the autonomous coordinated scheduling of resources. First, we construct a small satellite network and combine the graph maximum flow theory to solve the link resource planning problem during inter-satellite data transmission. In addition, we design a multi-satellite resource scheduling algorithm with minimal time consumption based on graph theory. The algorithm is based on graph theory to reallocate the resource request queue to satellites with idle processing resources. Finally, we simulate the efficient resource scheduling capability in the spatial information network and empirically compare our approaches against two representative swarm intelligence baseline approaches and show that our approach has significant advantages in terms of performance and time consumption during resource scheduling.

TI  - New insights of global vegetation structural properties through an analysis of canopy clumping index, fractional vegetation cover, and leaf area index
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy clumping index (CI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and leaf area index (LAI) are important vege-tation structural variables. Characterization of the spatial and temporal variations of these variables is important for understanding the global vegetation properties, canopy radiative transfer processes, and land surface modeling studies. This study explores the global CI, FVC, and LAI and their relationships using currently available global products from 2003-2017: CAS-CI (V1.1), GEOV2 FVC, and MODIS LAI (C6.0). The results show that global FVC and LAI have increased, whereas CI has slightly decreased since 2003. CI shows a negative relationship with both FVC and LAI. The specific vegetation cover (SVC), defined as the ratio of FVC to LAI, shows distinct spatial and temporal patterns for different land cover types and has great potential for vegetation characterization and phenology studies. The base and full CIs, calculated as the CI values during leaf emergence and full ground coverage or maximum LAI, respectively, were proposed to determine the seasonal variations in CI for different vegetation types. A global monthly leaf projection function (G(0)) map was generated for the first time to characterize the leaf angular distribution. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the global CI, FVC, and LAI and provides new insights on characterizing the biophysical properties of global vegetation. These findings are important for canopy reflectance modeling and parameter retrieval studies.

TI  - Study on the Relationship between Topological Characteristics of Vegetation Ecospatial Network and Carbon Sequestration Capacity in the Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving carbon neutrality is a necessary effort to rid humanity of a catastrophic climate and is a goal for China in the future. Ecological space plays an important role in the realization of carbon neutrality, but the relationship between the structure of vegetation ecological space and vegetation carbon sequestration capacity has been the focus of research. In this study, we extracted the base data from MODIS products and other remote sensing products, and then combined them with the MCR model to construct a vegetation ecospatial network in the Yellow River Basin in 2018. Afterward, we calculated the topological indicators of ecological nodes in the network and analyzed the relationship between the carbon sequestration capacity (net biome productivity) of ecological nodes and these topological indicators in combination with the Biome-BGC model. The results showed that there was a negative linear correlation between the betweenness centrality of forest nodes and their carbon sequestration capacity in the Yellow River Basin (p < 0.05, R-2 = 0.59). On the other hand, there was a positive linear correlation between the clustering coefficient of grassland nodes and their carbon sequestration capacity (p < 0.01, R-2 = 0.49). In addition, we briefly evaluated the vegetation ecospatial network in the Yellow River BASIN and suggested its optimization direction under the background of carbon neutrality in the future. Increasing the carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation through the construction of national ecological projects is one of the ways to achieve carbon neutrality, and this study provides a reference for the planning of future national ecological projects in the Yellow River Basin. Furthermore, this is also a case study of the application of remote sensing in vegetation carbon budgeting.

TI  - The names of the diseases in the written language of the Siberian Tatars of the 19th - early 20th centuries (based on the mosque books of the Tobolsk province)
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper raises the question of studying the written heritage of the indigenous Turkic-speaking population of Western Siberia - the Siberian Tatars. The material of the study is the metric book "on a note of the dead" written in Arabic graphics in the Old Tatar language. The chronological framework of the study is the period from the 1830s to the beginning of the 20th century. The lexico-semantic classification of the names of diseases distinguishes four main groups: records containing the name of any part of the body/organ; records containing the name of the reaction / condition of the body; records containing the name of any change (internal or external) in the body / neoplasm on the body; names of diseases referring to a religious worldview. From the point of view of the structure, it was revealed that the names of diseases consist of two to three components, with the main semantic load in the first word. It was established that in 73.6 % of cases, the first component has a Turkic basis, and in 26.3 %, it was borrowed. The authors conclude that most lexemes in the modern pronunciation (or form) are widely used both in the Tatar literary language and in the dialects of the Siberian Tatars. The semantic dialectisms were identified, and lexemes used only in mosque books and dating back to foreign roots - Arabic or Persian - were distinguished.

TI  - A comparison of the integrated fuzzy object-based deep learning approach and three machine learning techniques for land use/cover change monitoring and environmental impacts assessment
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent improvements in the spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of satellite images necessitate (semi-)automated classification and information extraction approaches. Therefore, we developed an integrated fuzzy object-based image analysis and deep learning (FOBIA-DL) approach for monitoring the land use/cover (LULC) and respective changes and compared it to three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and classification and regression tree (CART). We investigated LULC impacts on drought by analyzing Landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2020 for the Urmia Lake area in northern Iran. In the FOBIA-DL approach, following the initial segmentation steps, object features were identified for each LULC class. We then derived their respective attributes using fuzzy membership functions and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), a deep learning method. The Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation and Dempster-Shafer Theory (FSE-DST) also applied to validate and carryout the spatial uncertainties. Our results indicate that the FOBIA-DL, with an accuracy of 90.1% to 96.4% and a spatial certainty of 0.93 to 0.97, outperformed the other approaches, closely followed by the SVM. Our results also showed that the integration of Fuzzy-OBIA and DCNNs could improve the strength and robustness of the OBIA's decision rules, while the FSE-DST approach notably improved the spatial accuracy of the object-based classification maps. While object-based image analysis (OBIA) is already considered a paradigm shift in GIScience, the integration of OBIA with fuzzy and deep learning creates more flexibility and robust OBIA decision rules for image analysis and classification. This research integrated popular data-driven approaches and developed a novel methodology for image classification and spatial accuracy assessment. From the environmental perspective, the results of this research support lake restoration initiatives by decision-makers and authorities in applications such as drought mitigation, land use management and precision agriculture programs.

TI  - Targeted Micellar Phthalocyanine for Lymph Node Metastasis Homing and Photothermal Therapy in an Orthotopic Colorectal Tumor Model
T2  - NANO-MICRO LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor lymph node (LN) metastasis seriously affects the treatment prognosis. Studies have shown that nanoparticles with size of sub-50 nm can directly penetrate into LN metastases after intravenous administration. Here, we speculate through introducing targeting capacity, the nanoparticle accumulation in LN metastases would be further enhanced for improved local treatment such as photothermal therapy. Trastuzumab-targeted micelles (< 50 nm) were formulated using a unique surfactant-stripping approach that yielded concentrated phthalocyanines with strong near-infrared absorption. Targeted micellar phthalocyanine (T-MP) was an effective photothermal transducer and ablated HT-29 cells in vitro. A HER2-expressing colorectal cancer cell line (HT-29) was used to establish an orthotopic mouse model that developed metastatic disease in mesenteric sentinel LN. T-MP accumulated more in the LN metastases compared to the micelles conjugated with control IgG. Following surgical resection of the primary tumor, minimally invasive photothermal treatment of the metastatic LN with T-MP, but not the control micelles, extended mouse survival. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that targeted small-sized nanoparticles have potential to enable superior paradigms for dealing with LN metastases.

TI  - Multi-cyclone analysis and machine learning model implications of cyclone effects on forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Past studies of cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons, tropical cyclones) disturbance showed that meteorological, topographical, and biological factors affect the patterns of forest disturbance intensity but left open the extent to which these findings were representative across different global cyclone regions. Using remote sensing data and machine learning models, we examined how these factors change over spatial scales and assessed their consistency across four major cyclones: Katrina (August 2005), Rita (September 2005), Yasi (February 2011), and Maria (September 2017). Our results revealed that the factors which best explained forest disturbance intensity pattern varied across these regions. Wind speed and precipitation were the dominant factors contributing to the variation in impacts of Katrina; terrain features, especially elevation, explained most of the variation in disturbance intensity of Rita; pre-disturbance vegetation condition was significant predictors of effects of Yasi; these factors played equal roles in explaining the disturbance intensity variation of Maria. A 40 m/s (144 km/h) wind speed threshold was proposed to split low-and high-level forest disturbance intensity. Other than wind speed, few generalizations can be made on features across multiple regions. We built several generalized hurricane impact models, which worked well with the test data from cyclones used for model development (R-2 = 0.89). However, these models did not have good predictions on other cyclones, such as Michael (October 2018) and Laura (August 2020). This study showed that each cyclone interacted with the landscape in a unique way and the challenges remained in building a generalized cyclone impact model.

TI  - Seismic hazard sensitivity assessment in the Ethiopian Rift, using an integrated approach of AHP and DInSAR methods
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seismic related natural hazard would be a major disaster as a result of the recent development and planning of new reservoirs, road networks, and the establishment of new urban settlements in previously uninhabited areas. Producing seismic hazard sensitivity maps could provide very fundamental knowledge to understand the probable occurrence of disasters in a seismic prone area. The aim of this paper was to produce seismic hazard sensitivity maps by integrating the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the differential interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) methods. For the AHP method, six parameters have been generated and evaluated, such as distance from the fault, Lineament density, Lithology, Soil texture, Proximity of historical earthquake epicenters, and slope. The result of the sensitivity mapping showed that 8% (561.51 km2) of the study area was low-risk, 53% (3801.99 km2) medium, 35 per cent (2526.04 km2) high and 2% (142.82 km2) very high. On the other hand, SLC products from Sentinel-1A data sets were analyzed using a six-month interval master and slave image co-registration using the DInSAR method. A mean annual vertical displacement map showing max subsidence of 9.8 mm/year and uplift of 1.7 mm/year was obtained after processing. The acceptability and accuracy of the resulting seismic hazard sensitivity maps was cross-validated using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Validation results showed a strong predictive value with an AUC of 0.848. Therefore, output maps will assist policy and decision makers in identifying natural disaster-prone areas.

TI  - Harnessing Machine Learning Techniques for Mapping Aquaculture Waterbodies in Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture in Bangladesh has grown dramatically in an unplanned manner in the past few decades, becoming a major contributor to the rural economy in many parts of the country. National systems for the collection of statistics have been unable to keep pace with these rapid changes, and more accurate, up to date information is needed to inform policymakers. Using Sentinel-2 top of atmosphere reflectance data within Google Earth Engine, we proposed six different strategies for improving fishpond detection as the existing techniques seem unreliable. These techniques include: (1) identification of the best time period for image collection, (2) testing the buffer size for threshold optimization, (3) determining the best combination of image reducer and water-identifying indices, (4) introduction of a convolution filter to enhance edge-detection, (5) evaluating the impact of ground truthing data on machine learning algorithm training, and (6) identifying the best machine learning classifier. Each enhancement builds on the previous one to develop a comprehensive improvement strategy called the enhanced method for fishpond detection. We compared the results of each improvement strategy to known ground truthing fishponds as the metric of success. For machine learning classifiers, we compared the precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the quality of results. Among four machine learning methods studied here, the classification and regression trees performed the best with a precision of 0.738, recall of 0.827, and F1 score of 0.780. Overall, the proposed strategies enhanced fishpond area detection in all districts within the study area.

TI  - Frequency and Correlates of <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> Antimicrobial Resistance Mutations and Their Association With Treatment Outcomes: Findings From a National Sentinel Surveillance Pilot in England
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mycoplasma genitalium infection is a public health concern due to extensive antimicrobial resistance. Using data from a pilot of M. genitalium antimicrobial resistance surveillance, we determined the prevalence and risk factors for resistance among specimens from sexual health clinic attendees and assessed treatment outcomes. Methods Seventeen sexual health clinics in England sent consecutive M. genitalium-positive specimens to the national reference laboratory from January to March 2019. Regions of the 23S rRNA, parC, and gyrA genes associated with macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance, respectively, were amplified and sequenced where appropriate. Fisher exact tests, and univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine associations between demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors and resistance-associated mutations. Results More than two-thirds (173 of 249 [69%]) of M. genitalium specimens had mutations associated with macrolide resistance, whereas predicted fluoroquinolone (21 of 251 [8%]) and dual-drug (12 of 237 [5%]) resistance were less prevalent. No specimens had both gyrA and parC resistance-associated mutations. Macrolide resistance was more common in specimens from men who have sex with men compared with heterosexual men (adjusted odds ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-6.38; P = 0.03). There was an association between both macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance and having a previous sexually transmitted infection (P = 0.06). Only 19% of individuals returned for a test of cure. Of those infected with a macrolide-resistant genotype who were given azithromycin, 57 of 78 (73%) were known or assumed to be clinically cured; however, 43 of these 57 (75%) also received doxycycline. Of the 21 with a macrolide-resistant genotype who failed treatment, 18 of 21 (86%) also received doxycycline. Conclusions Although macrolide resistance was widespread, particularly among specimens from men who have sex with men and those with a previous sexually transmitted infection diagnosis in the past year, resistance-associated mutations in M. genitalium did not seem to be unequivocally predictive of treatment failure.

TI  - Agriculture is the primary driver of tree cover loss across the Forestiere region of the Republic of Guinea, Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity hotspots are conservation priority areas that feature exceptionally high levels of species endemism and high levels of habitat loss. The Guinean Forests of West Africa hotspot, home to a quarter of all the mammal species of Africa, has experienced high levels of forest loss within its protected areas. Here, we analyzed tree cover loss and its proximate drivers within Guinee Forestiere, a high biodiversity region within the Guinean Forests of West Africa hotspot, both inside and outside protected areas. Using Landsat analysis ready data and a regionally calibrated, annual forest change detection model, we mapped tree cover loss occurring across this region from 2000 to 2018. We quantified the area of tree cover loss and identified proximate drivers using a statistical sample of reference data. The total tree cover loss in Guinee Forestiere between years 2000 and 2018 was 10,907 km(2) (SE 889 km(2)), which consists of approximately 25% of the region's total land area. Of this total loss, 364 km(2) (SE 91 km(2)) occurred within protected areas of high biodiversity value. Tree cover loss was not consistent across high biodiversity areas and did not appear to be related to protected area classification. Smallholder agriculture (subsistence and cash crop farming) was the primary driver of tree cover loss across Guinee Forestiere. This research provides multitemporal spatial data on tree cover dynamics that is required for effective implementation of sustainable management and biodiversity conservation strategies within the broader socioecological landscape of Guinee Forestiere. We also highlight important limitations to consider and address when using remote sensing to automate change detection across landscapes.

TI  - A Research Note Describing a More Inclusive Approach to Identifying Same-Sex Cohabiters in the American Time Use Survey
T2  - DEMOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of indi vid u als in same-sex relation ships in the Ameri can Time Use Survey (ATUS) is of increas ing inter est to the research community. While the ATUS inter views one person per house hold, by using information about who else lives in the house hold, research ers can eas ily iden tify respon dents in cores i dent same-sex couple arrange ments. Previous research has outlined two approaches to iden ti fy ing individ u als in same-sex relation ships in the ATUS that use information on the sex of house hold members. We extend that work in this research note by using additional information col lected from a direct ques tion to iden tify unmarried cohabiting partners in the Current Population Survey (CPS). We iden tify 23% more indi vid u als in cohabit-ing same-sex relation ships when we use the CPS direct ques tion information than when we use information from the ATUS alone. We argue that this iden ti fi cation strat egy is more inclu sive of indi vid u als in same-sex cohabiting relation ships.

TI  - Modeling Phenols, Anthocyanins and Color Intensity of Wine Using Pre-Harvest Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inclusion of technological innovation and the development of remote sensing tools in wine production are an efficient and productive factor that supports the production and improves the quality of the wine produced. In this study we explored models based on Sentinel-2 image bands and spectral indices to estimate key wine quality variables, such as phenols (TP), anthocyanins (TA) and color intensity (CI), providing different sensory characteristics of wine. Two Cabernet Sauvignon wine harvest seasons were studied, 2017 and 2018, and models with coefficients of determination (R-2) higher than 60% were obtained for color intensity and total anthocyanins during the first season, both in a period very close to harvest during the first days of April, so the high periodicity of Sentinel 2 becomes strategic. In addition, homogeneous sectors can be identified in the plots for selective harvesting and thus the winery space can be programmed appropriately. These results suggest further work on the number of samples in order to transform it into a useful tool with the potential to define a differentiated harvest and estimate the accumulation of phenolic compounds and the intensity of wine color, key elements in the final quality of the wine.

TI  - A Governmentality of Online Gambling: Quebec's Contested Internet Gambling Website Blocking Provisions
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines Canada's first internet gambling website blocking scheme, which was enacted in Quebec as part of the implementation of the province's 2015 budget. Using qualitative research methods, the article illustrates the complexities of regulating online gambling. Influenced by critical sociological and anthropological studies of gambling, and taking a socio-legal, governmentality perspective, it shows how socio-legal studies can illuminate research on the regulation of gambling, and how the study of online gambling can, as a sentinel site for the regulation of online consumption, contribute to the development of socio-legal studies. Our analysis shows that the governmentality of online gambling is framed so as to exclude 1) a range of risks (e.g., related to consumer profiling and the capacity to stimulate "addictive consumption"), 2) the heterogeneity of everyday experience that connects online gambling with online addictive consumption more generally, and 3) a range of possibilities for governing online gambling otherwise.

TI  - Temporal Information Extraction for Afforestation in the Middle Section of the Yarlung Zangbo River Using Time-Series Landsat Images Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation is one of the most efficient ways to control land desertification in the middle section of the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) valley. However, the lack of a quantitative way to record the planting time of artificial forest (AF) constrains further management for these forests. The long-term archived Landsat images (including the Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI)) provide a good opportunity to capture the temporal change information about AF plantations. Under the condition that there would be an abrupt increasing trend in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series curve after afforestation, and this characteristic can be thought of as the indicator of the AF planting time. To extract the indicator, an algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for detecting this trend change point (TCP) on the maximum NDVI time series within the growing season (May to September) was proposed. In this algorithm, the time-series NDVI was initially smoothed and segmented into two subspaces. Then, a trend change indicator S-diff was calculated with the difference between the fitting slopes of the subspaces before and after each target point. A self-adaptive method was applied to the NDVI series to find the right year with the maximum TCP, which is recorded as the AF planting time. Based on the proposed method, the AF planting time of the middle section of the YZR valley from 1988 to 2020 was derived. The detected afforestation temporal information was validated by 222 samples collected from the field survey, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.95 years. Meanwhile, the area distribution of the AF planted each year has good temporal consistency with the implementation of the eco-reconstruction project. Overall, the study provides a good way to map AF planting times that is not only helpful for sustainable management of AF areas but also provides a basis for further research on the impact of afforestation on desertification control.

TI  - Study on the impact of dam construction and interception on spatiotemporal changes in vegetation coverage in cascade reservoirs: Wujiang and Chishuihe catchments
T2  - Plant Science Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of cascade hydropower stations have been built in the Wujiang catchment in recent years. Here, we studied the sustainability of past and future changes in vegetation coverage and the scale of dam construction impact using MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data, Sen trend analysis, and Hurst index taking Wujiang (dam constructed) and Chishuihe (no dam construction) as examples. Results indicated that: (1) the NDVI in the Wujiang and Chishuihe catchments showed a fluctuating upward trend, and the main variation type increased significantly. (2) On the spatial scale, vegetation coverage in the middle and lower reaches of the Wujiang catchment decreased. (3) Future trends in vegetation coverage differed for the Wujiang and Chishuihe catchments. Average Hurst index of the Wujiang catchment was less than 0.5, indicating relatively strong anti-sustainability of vegetation coverage change, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment. Average Hurst index of the Chishuihe catchment was greater than 0.5, indicating strong sustainability of vegetation coverage change. Thus, dam construction has influenced vegetation coverage around the river in the past and will sustainably influence future vegetation coverage variation.

TI  - Spectral ζ-functions and ζ-regularized functional determinants for regular Sturm-Liouville operators
T2  - RESEARCH IN THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The principal aim in this paper is to employ a recently developed unified approach to the computation of traces of resolvents and zeta-functions to efficiently compute values of spectral zeta-functions at positive integers associated with regular (three-coefficient) self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville differential expressions tau. Depending on the underlying boundary conditions, we express the zeta-function values in terms of a fundamental system of solutions of tau y = zy and their expansions about the spectral point z = 0. Furthermore, we give the full analytic continuation of the zeta-function through a Liouville transformation and provide an explicit expression for the zeta-regularized functional determinant in terms of a particular set of this fundamental system of solutions. An array of examples illustrating the applicability of these methods is provided, including regular Schrodinger operators with zero, piecewise constant, and a linear potential on a compact interval.

TI  - Towards Routine Mapping of Crop Emergence within the Season Using the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop emergence is a critical stage for crop development modeling, crop condition monitoring, and biomass accumulation estimation. Green-up dates (or the start of the season) detected from remote sensing time series are related to, but generally lag, crop emergence dates. In this paper, we refine the within-season emergence (WISE) algorithm and extend application to five Corn Belt states (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Nebraska) using routine harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data from 2018 to 2020. Green-up dates detected from the HLS time series were assessed using field observations and near-surface measurements from PhenoCams. Statistical descriptions of green-up dates for corn and soybeans were generated and compared to county-level planting dates and district- to state-level crop emergence dates reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Results show that emergence dates for corn and soybean can be reliably detected within the season using the HLS time series acquired during the early growing season. Compared to observed crop emergence dates, green-up dates from HLS using WISE were ~3 days later at the field scale (30-m). The mean absolute difference (MAD) was ~7 days and the root mean square error (RMSE) was ~9 days. At the state level, the mean differences between median HLS green-up date and median crop emergence date were within 2 days for 2018-2020. At this scale, MAD was within 4 days, and RMSE was less than 5 days for both corn and soybeans. The R-squares were 0.73 and 0.87 for corn and soybean, respectively. The 2019 late emergence of crops in Corn Belt states (1-4 weeks to five-year average) was captured by HLS green-up date retrievals. This study demonstrates that routine within-season mapping of crop emergence/green-up at the field scale is practicable over large regions using operational satellite data. The green-up map derived from HLS during the growing season provides valuable information on spatial and temporal variability in crop emergence that can be used for crop monitoring and refining agricultural statistics used in broad-scale modeling efforts.

TI  - Novel Framework for 3D Road Extraction Based on Airborne LiDAR and High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - 3D GIS has attracted increasing attention from academics, industries, and governments with the increase in the requirements for the interoperability and integration of different sources of spatial data. Three-dimensional road extraction based on multisource remote sensing data is still a challenging task due to road occlusion and topological complexity. This paper presents a novel framework for 3D road extraction by integrating LiDAR point clouds and high-resolution remote sensing imagery. First, a multiscale collaborative representation-based road probability estimation method was proposed to segment road surfaces from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Then, an automatic stratification process was conducted to specify the layer values of each road segment. Additionally, a multifactor filtering strategy was proposed in consideration of the complexity of ground features and the existence of noise in LiDAR points. Lastly, a least-square-based elevation interpolation method is used for restoring the elevation information of road sections blocked by overpasses. The experimental results based on two datasets in Hong Kong Island show that the proposed method obtains competitively satisfactory results.

TI  - Improving Snow Analyses for Hydrological Forecasting at ECCC Using Satellite-Derived Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the National Hydrological Services Transformation Initiative, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) designed and implemented the National Surface and River Prediction System (NSRPS) in order to provide surface and river flow analysis and forecast products across Canada. Within NSRPS, the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) produces snow analyses that are used to initialise the land surface model, which in turn is used to force the river routing component. Originally, CaLDAS was designed to improve atmospheric forecasts with less focus on hydrological processes. When snow data assimilation occurs, the related increments remove/add water from/to the system, which can sometimes be problematic for streamflow forecasting, in particular during the snowmelt period. In this study, a new snow analysis method introduces multiple innovations that respond to the need for higher quality snow analyses for hydrological purposes, including the use of IMS snow cover extent data instead of in situ snow depth observations. The results show that the new snow assimilation methodology brings an overall improvement to snow analyses and substantially enhances water conservation, which is reflected in the generally improved streamflow simulations. This work represents a first step towards a new snow data assimilation process in CaLDAS, with the final objective of producing a reliable snow analysis to initialise and improve NWP as well as environmental predictions, including flood and drought forecasts.

TI  - A Self-Adaptive Method for Mapping Coastal Bathymetry On-The-Fly from Wave Field Video
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping coastal bathymetry from remote sensing becomes increasingly more attractive for the coastal community. It is facilitated by a rising availability of drone and satellite data, advances in data science, and an open-source mindset. Coastal bathymetry, but also wave directions, celerity and near-surface currents can simultaneously be derived from aerial video of a wave field. However, the required video processing is usually extensive, requires skilled supervision, and is tailored to a fieldsite. This study proposes a video-processing algorithm that resolves these issues. It automatically adapts to the video data and continuously returns mapping updates and thereby aims to make wave-based remote sensing more inclusive to the coastal community. The code architecture for the first time includes the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to reduce the data complexity of wavefield video. The DMD is paired with loss-functions to handle spectral noise and a novel spectral storage system and Kalman filter to achieve fast converging measurements. The algorithm is showcased for fieldsites in the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, and Australia. The performance with respect to mapping bathymetry was validated using ground truth data. It was demonstrated that merely 32 s of video footage is needed for a first mapping update with average depth errors of 0.9-2.6 m. These further reduced to 0.5-1.4 m as the videos continued and more mapping updates were returned. Simultaneously, coherent maps for wave direction and celerity were achieved as well as maps of local near-surface currents. The algorithm is capable of mapping the coastal parameters on-the-fly and thereby offers analysis of video feeds, such as from drones or operational camera installations. Hence, the innovative application of analysis techniques like the DMD enables both accurate and unprecedentedly fast coastal reconnaissance. The source code and data of this article are openly available.

TI  - A Spatial Downscaling Methodology for GRACE Total Water Storage Anomalies Using GPM IMERG Precipitation Estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A downscaling framework for coarse resolution Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Total Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) data is described, exploiting the observations of precipitation from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG). Considering that the major driving force for changes in TWS is precipitation, we tested our hypothesis that coarse resolution, i.e., 1 degrees, GRACE TWSA can be effectively downscaled to 0.1 degrees using GPM IMERG data. The algorithm for the downscaling process comprises the development of a regression equation at the coarse resolution between the GRACE and GPM IMERG data, which is then applied at the finer resolution with a subsequent residual correction procedure. An ensemble of GRACE data from three processing centers, i.e., GFZ, JPL and CSR, was used for the time period from June 2018 until March 2021. To verify our downscaling methodology, we applied it with GRACE data from 2005 to 2015, and we compared it against modeled TWSA from two independent datasets in the Thrace and Thessaly regions in Greece for the same period and found a high performance in all examined metrics. Our research indicates that the downscaled GRACE observations are comparable to the TWSA estimated with hydrological modeling, thus highlighting the potential of GRACE data to contribute to the improvement of hydrological model performance, especially in ungauged basins.

TI  - Is It All the Same? Mapping and Characterizing Deprived Urban Areas Using WorldView-3 Superspectral Imagery. A Case Study in Nairobi, Kenya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past two decades, Earth observation (EO) data have been utilized for studying the spatial patterns of urban deprivation. Given the scope of many existing studies, it is still unclear how very-high-resolution EO data can help to improve our understanding of the multidimensionality of deprivation within settlements on a city-wide scale. In this work, we assumed that multiple facets of deprivation are reflected by varying morphological structures within deprived urban areas and can be captured by EO information. We set out by staying on the scale of an entire city, while zooming into each of the deprived areas to investigate deprivation through land cover (LC) variations. To test the generalizability of our workflow, we assembled multiple WorldView-3 datasets (multispectral and shortwave infrared) with varying numbers of bands and image features, allowing us to explore computational efficiency, complexity, and scalability while keeping the model architecture consistent. Our workflow was implemented in the city of Nairobi, Kenya, where more than sixty percent of the city population lives in deprived areas. Our results indicate that detailed LC information that characterizes deprivation can be mapped with an accuracy of over seventy percent by only using RGB-based image features. Including the near-infrared (NIR) band appears to bring significant improvements in the accuracy of all classes. Equally important, we were able to categorize deprived areas into varying profiles manifested through LC variability using a gridded mapping approach. The types of deprivation profiles varied significantly both within and between deprived areas. The results could be informative for practical interventions such as land-use planning policies for urban upgrading programs.

TI  - A Review on Multi-Biomarkers in Fish for the Assessment of Aquatic Ecosystem Contamination with Organic Pollutants
T2  - Ecologia Balkanica
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the current review is to identify the most suitable biomarkers for evaluating chemical stress due to organic contamination in aquatic environments, as well as possible ways to reduce or limit this contamination. To safeguard the environmental status, the European Union has implemented the Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; 2008/56/EC) legislations, which encourage the use of biological tools to detect the quality of aquatic systems. Therefore, monitoring of sentinel fish species is widely used to assess the level of health status. Fishes have been found to be good biomonitors of water pollution because they occupy different trophic levels; they are of different sizes and ages and in comparison with invertebrates, are also more sensitive to different toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, such as pesticides. Biomarkers are defined as responses to any exposure evidenced in histological, physiological, biochemical, genetic and behavioral modification. The application of multi-biomarker approach is necessary in the development of a protocol for the aquatic assessment of organic pollutants. This protocol can be applied in risk assessment and water monitoring programs in order to provide an adequate legal basis for the presence of organic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems and biological responses under concentrations equal or lower to those permitted under the European and Bulgarian legislation.

TI  - Estimation of Individual Tree Stem Biomass in an Uneven-Aged Structured Coniferous Forest Using Multispectral LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stem biomass is a fundamental component of the global carbon cycle that is essential for forest productivity estimation. Over the last few decades, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven to be a useful tool for accurate carbon stock and biomass estimation in various biomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of multispectral LiDAR data for the reliable estimation of single-tree total and barkless stem biomass (TSB and BSB) in an uneven-aged structured forest with complex topography. Destructive and non-destructive field measurements were collected for a total of 67 dominant and co-dominant Abies borisii-regis trees located in a mountainous area in Greece. Subsequently, two allometric equations were constructed to enrich the reference data with non-destructively sampled trees. Five different regression algorithms were tested for single-tree BSB and TSB estimation using height (height percentiles and bicentiles, max and average height) and intensity (skewness, standard deviation and average intensity) LiDAR-derived metrics: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Gaussian Process (GP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results showcased that the RF algorithm provided the best overall predictive performance in both BSB (i.e., RMSE = 175.76 kg and R-2 = 0.78) and TSB (i.e., RMSE = 211.16 kg and R-2 = 0.65) cases. Our work demonstrates that BSB can be estimated with moderate to high accuracy using all the tested algorithms, contrary to the TSB, where only three algorithms (RF, SVR and GP) can adequately provide accurate TSB predictions due to bark irregularities along the stems. Overall, the multispectral LiDAR data provide accurate stem biomass estimates, the general applicability of which should be further tested in different biomes and ecosystems.

TI  - Improving Representation of Tropical Wetland Methane Emissions With CYGNSS Inundation Maps
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are the single largest source of methane to the atmosphere and their emissions are expected to respond to a changing climate. Inaccuracy and uncertainty in inundation extent drives differences in modeled wetland emissions and impacts representation of wetland emissions on inter-annual and seasonal time frames. Existing wetland maps are based on optical or NIR satellite data obscured by clouds and vegetation, often leading to underestimates in wetlands extent, especially in the Tropics. Here, we present new inundation maps based on the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) satellite constellation, operating in L-band that is not impacted by clouds or vegetation, providing reliable observations through canopy and cloudy periods. We map the temporal and spatial dynamics of the Pantanal and Sudd wetlands, two of the largest wetlands in the world, using CYGNSS data and a computer vision algorithm. We link these inundation maps to methane fluxes via WetCHARTs, a global wetland methane emissions model ensemble. We contrast CYGNSS-modeled methane emissions with WetCHARTs standard runs that use monthly rainfall data from ECMWF re-analysis (ERA5), as well as the commonly used SWAMPS wetland maps. We find that the CYGNSS-based inundation maps modify the methane emissions in multiple ways. The seasonality of inundation and methane emissions is shifted by two months because of the lag in wetland recharge following peak rainfall. Both inundation and methane emissions also respond non-linearly to wet-season precipitation totals, leading to large interannual variability in emissions. Finally, the annual magnitude of emissions is found to be greater than previously estimated.

TI  - UAV Patrolling for Wildfire Monitoring by a Dynamic Voronoi Tessellation on Satellite Data
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire monitoring and early detection are critical tasks in which Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are commonly employed. This paper presents a system to plan the drone patrolling schedule according to a real-time estimation of a fire propagation index that is derived from satellite data, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measurement and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the surveilled area. The proposed system employs a waypoint scheduling logic, derived from a dynamic Voronoi Tessellation of the area, that combines characteristics of the territory (e.g., vegetation density) with real-time measurements (e.g., wind speed and direction). The system is validated on a case study in Italy, in the municipality of the city of L'Aquila, on three different fire scenarios. In normal situations, the designed waypoint-based navigation system provided an effective monitoring of the area, enabling the early detection of starting fires. The developed solution also demonstrated good performance in tracking and anticipating the fire front advance, potentially providing a better situational awareness to emergency operators and support their response policies. Both the test environment and the simulator have been made open-source.

TI  - Spring fires in Russia: results from participatory burned area mapping with Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced fires play a crucial role in transforming landscapes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Russia is a country where human-induced fires are widespread and form distinctive spring and summer burning cycles. However, spring fires are not well documented and it is unclear which land-cover types are associated with the spread of spring fires. Using Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery, a wall-to-wall spring burned area data set for 1 January to 15 May 2020 was created for Russia (excluding the Arctic) using a participatory crowdsourcing digitizing approach on an online platform developed specifically for this application. The 2020 spring fire product had a producer accuracy of 85% and user accuracy of 92%. Approximately 13.38 million ha, comprising 1.8% of the study area, were mapped as burned, with the majority of the 2020 spring burned areas in Siberia. Our spring-fire product revealed five times more burned area estimates compared to the burned area estimates from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64 product. We also found high variability of burned area per active fire pixel across regions of Russia, when compared to MODIS and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite active fire data. Spring fires started to increase from the end of February and reached their maximum by the end of March through the middle of April. Spring fires were associated with arable lands and grasslands as land-cover types, except Siberia, where spring fires were most common in deciduous and needle-leaved forests, followed by arable lands. While spring fires were associated with croplands and grasslands, an estimate for Central Russia showed approximately 75% of spring fires occurred on abandoned agricultural lands. Our study demonstrated the suitability of optical Sentinel-2 imagery for spring fire mapping and the great utility of a participatory mapping approach for fast and accurate mapping as well as engagement of the community.

TI  - Protein-protein interaction networks reveal paths connecting functional domains associated in Alzheimer's disease.
T2  - Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease comprising 60-70% of dementia diagnoses. Despite known genetic risk factors and pathology of disease, AD mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To identify therapeutic targets in the context of AD mechanisms, we constructed a multi-modal neocortical protein-protein interaction network with integrated AD risk scores to track AD disease through protein interactions.METHOD: The Pathway Commons database was filtered for genes expressed in 9 brain regions from the Accelerated Medicines Partnership in AD (AMP-AD). This network of 13,867 genes and 806,950 interactions was integrated with co-expression networks yielding topology of interaction communities. Gene weights were derived from the genetic, transcriptome (RNA-Seq), and proteome (LFQ and TMT) components of the Target Enablement to Accelerate Therapy Development for Alzheimer's Disease (TREAT-AD) score, a score of overall AD-Risk for every gene compiled across ten components. We wrote an R package to trace paths enriched in AD risk between input target and sentinel genes. We identified 15 AD associated biological domains (domains) containing GO Terms enriched in high risk AD genes. Genes from these domains were filtered by TREAT-AD scores into the top AD-Candidates by biodomain. Each list of genes within a biodomain was traced pairwise to the genes within the 15 lists creating an AD subnetwork of 3,015 genes and 87,615 protein interactions.RESULT: This subnetwork represents a valuable resource to explore mechanistic paths of AD biology with respect to their contextual environments. Biodomains most enriched for AD-risk after tracing were Mitochondria and Metabolism, Synaptic Dysfunction, Structural Stabilization, Endolysosomal Dysfunction, and Immune Response.CONCLUSION: We created a valuable resource and framework to extract AD-relevant pathways from a massive cortical network of protein-protein interactions. Our subnetworks identify paths with AD mechanisms that connect relevant domains driving AD. This resource provides needed context for the community to use when designing therapeutic target candidates or hypotheses relevant to AD disease mechanisms. We hope that elucidating the relevant pathways contributing to AD disease progression, along with their contextual interactions, inform the communities' priors when designing experiments to alter AD pathways within model systems.

T2  - JOURNAL OF REFORMED THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to investigate how Abraham Kuyper and some late neo-Calvinists have addressed the doctrine of creation in light of the challenges posed by evolutionary scientific theory. I argue that most neo-Calvinists today, particularly scholars from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (vu), continue Kuyper's legacy by holding the core principles of a creationist worldview. Yet, they have taken a new direction by explaining the natural history of the earth in evolutionary terms. In my analysis, Kuyper's heirs at the vu today offer judicious parameters to guide Christians in conversation with evolutionary science, precisely because of their high appreciation of good science and awareness of the nonnegotiable elements that make up the orthodox Christian narrative.

M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of water properties from satellite-borne imagers viewing oceans and coastal areas in the visible region of the spectrum requires removing the effect of the atmosphere, which contributes approximately 80-90% of the measured radiance over the open ocean in the blue spectral region. The Gordon and Wang algorithm originally developed for SeaWiFS (and used with other NASA sensors, e.g., MODIS) forms the basis for many atmospheric removal (correction) procedures. It was developed for application to imagery obtained over the open ocean (Case 1 waters), where the aerosol is usually non-absorbing, and is used operationally to process global data from SeaWiFS, MODIS and VIIRS. Here, I trace the evolution of this algorithm from early NASA aircraft experiments through the CZCS, OCTS, SeaWiFs, MERIS, and finally the MODIS sensors. Strategies to extend the algorithm to situations where the aerosol is strongly absorbing are examined. Its application to sensors with additional and unique capabilities is sketched. Problems associated with atmospheric correction in coastal waters are described.

AB  - Primary adenoid cystic carcinoma(ACC)of the breast is a rare type of breast cancer. A 53-year-old woman with a right breast mass was examined at our institute. Ultrasonography showed 12.5*10.3*8.4 mm sized an ill-defined hypoechoic mass at zone C of the right breast. Pathological examination of core needle biopsy revealed atypical cells with solid and cribriform growth pattern. Computed tomography did not reveal lymph node metastases or distant metastases. The preoperative diagnosis was Stage ⅠA(cT1cN0M0, ER/PgR/HER2=-/-/1+)invasive ductal carcinoma or ACC. Surgery consisted of breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy. Pathological examination of the excised specimen revealed a so- called adenoid cystic pattern, so the final diagnosis was Stage ⅠA(pT1cN0M0, ER/PgR/HER2=-/-/1+)ACC. After 1 year of observation without adjuvant treatment, there has been no recurrence.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction ACOSOG-Z0011(Z11) trial showed that axillary node clearance (ANC) may be omitted in women with <= 2 positive nodes undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS) and whole breast radiotherapy (RD. A confirmatory study is needed to clarify the role of axillary treatment in women with <= 2 macrometastases undergoing BCS and groups that were not included in Z11 for example, mastectomy and those with microscopic extranodal invasion. The primary objective of POsitive Sentinel NOde: adjuvant therapy alone versus adjuvant therapy plus Clearance or axillary radiotherapy (POSNOC) is to evaluate whether for women with breast cancer and 1 or 2 macrometastases, adjuvant therapy alone is non-inferior to adjuvant therapy plus axillary treatment, in terms of 5-year axillary recurrence.Methods and analysis POSNOC is a pragmatic, multicentre, non-inferiority, international trial with participants randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Women are eligible if they have T1/12, unifocal or multifocal invasive breast cancer, and 1 or 2 macrometastases at sentinel node biopsy, with or without extranodal extension. In the intervention group women receive adjuvant therapy alone, in the standard care group they receive ANC or axillary RT. In both groups women receive adjuvant therapy, according to local guidelines. This includes systemic therapy and, if indicated, RT to breast or chest wall. The UK Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance Group manages the in-built radiotherapy quality assurance programme. Primary endpoint is 5-year axillary recurrence. Secondary outcomes are arm morbidity assessed by Lymphoedema and Breast Cancer Questionnaire and QuickDASH questionnaires; quality of life and anxiety as assessed witFACT B+4 and State/Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires, respectively; other ontological outcomes; economic evaluation using EQ-5D-5L. Target sample size is 1900. Primary analysis is per protocol. Recruitment started on 1 August 2014 and as of 9 June 2021, 1866 participants have been randomised.

T2  - PENNSYLVANIA HISTORY-A JOURNAL OF MID-ATLANTIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The case of Springfield and Upper Darby, two predominately Quaker townships in Chester County, Pennsylvania, in the late 1700s and early 1800s, shows how transitions to capitalism in the nineteenth century were rarely uniform. The townships persisted in maintaining subsistence characteristics even as other parts of southeastern Pennsylvania were transitioning to capitalist accumulation and urbanization. The principal mediums for this resistance were geographical and religious. However, by the 1820s, the introduction of mill technology eroded geographical resistance and encouraged the outmigration of entrepreneurs to urban environments. Also, a religious schism within the Quakers and the lure of evangelical Protestant sects undermined the religious cohesion of the townships. Springfield and Upper Darby transformed themselves into commercial farm communities with significant industrial components that "tethered" them to distant markets, and in which Quakerism ceased to serve the dominant religious worldview.

TI  - Landsat-8 OLI Multispectral Image Dehazing Based on Optimized Atmospheric Scattering Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite images are often affected by haze atmospheric conditions, which degrades the quality of remote sensing (RS) data and reduces the accuracy of interpretation and classification. Hence, haze removal becomes a necessary preprocessing step for most of the applications of RS image. In this article, we propose a novel haze removal method for Landsat-8 OLI multispectral image based on an optimized atmospheric scattering model. We focus on adaptively estimating the haze transmission map of each band by taking into account the effect of both wavelength and haze atmospheric conditions (haze particle size and haze particle concentration) thus improving dehazing performance. The experimental results on Landsat-8 OLI multispectral images show that the proposed dehazing model is able to remove haze successfully and significantly improve the image visibility as well as correct the spectral bias to some degree. Moreover, this method is simple and feasible, and has good practical value.

TI  - Estimating mangrove leaf area index based on red-edge vegetation indices: A comparison among UAV, WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of mangrove leaf area index (LAI) is fundamental for effective mangrove ecosystem management and protection. Remote sensing technology has showed its powerful potential in accurately retrieving mangrove LAI. The generic estimation model combining vegetation indices (VIs) with physically-based law, simplified as LAI-VIs model, has successfully estimated crop LAI. However, the capacity of estimating mangrove LAI using this model, so far, is unclear. Moreover, some studies have proved that estimation accuracy of terrestrial forests and crops LAI can be ameliorated with VIs based on red-edge band (VIs_RE) because of less affecting by canopy structure. However, little literature explores the ability of VIs_RE, especially, from different multispectral sensors, for estimating mangrove LAI. Therefore, our main purpose is to evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of the LAI-VIs_RE model from Sentinel-2, WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery for estimating mangrove LAI. The estimation models with input variables of NDVI, NDVI_RE1 (band combination from red-edge and visible band), NDVI_RE2 (band combination from red-edge and near-infrared reflectance) from three types of multispectral imagery are used to calculate mangrove LAI of 99 plots. The results showed that the WV-2 imagery acquires the best estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.414), followed by Sentinel-2 imagery (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.440), and UAV multispectral imagery (R-2 = 0.48, RMSE = 0.570). The analyses display the good results of the LAI-NDVI model and LAI-NDVI_RE1 model from WV-2 and Sentinel-2 imagery with the range of R-2 from 0.57 to 0.72, and the discrepant consequences of LAINDVI_RE2 model from UAV imagery with R-2 of 0.15, WV-2 imagery with R-2 of 0.67 and Sentienl-2 imagery with R-2 of 0.65, 0.18 and 0.12. This study proves that the generic estimation model and NDVI_RE1 derived from WV-2 and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery could be deemed as a basic method and input variables of mapping mangrove LAI.

TI  - Fine Classification of Rice Paddy Based on RHSI-DT Method Using Multi-Temporal Compact Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become a hotspot of SAR Earth observation. Meanwhile, CP SAR provides both relatively rich polarization information and large swath-width for rice mapping. Fine classification of rice paddy plays an important role in growth monitoring, pest prevention and yield estimation of rice. In this study, the multi-temporal CP SAR data were firstly simulated by fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data, and 22 CP parameters from each of the six temporal CP SAR data were extracted. Then we built a rice height-sensitive index (RHSI). Furthermore, a decision tree (DT) method was established by using the optimal CP parameters based on RHSI. Finally, the classification results of rice paddy based on DT and support vector machine (SVM) methods were compared. Results showed that the RHSI-DT method could obtain better results, with an overall accuracy of 97.94% and a kappa coefficient of 0.973, which was 2% higher and 0.03 larger than those of the SVM method. Besides, we found that the surface scattering of m-chi decomposition (m-chi_s (0627)) and Delta Shannon entropy intensity Hi (Hi (1015)-Hi (0627)) were highly effective parameters to distinguish paddies of transplanting hybrid rice (T-H) and direct-sown japonica rice (D-J).

TI  - A scSE-LinkNet Deep Learning Model for Daytime Sea Fog Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea fog is a precarious weather disaster affecting transportation on the sea. The accuracy of the threshold method for sea fog detection is limited by time and region. In comparison, the deep learning method learns features of objects through different network layers and can therefore accurately extract fog data and is less affected by temporal and spatial factors. This study proposes a scSE-LinkNet model for daytime sea fog detection that leverages residual blocks to encoder feature maps and attention module to learn the features of sea fog data by considering spectral and spatial information of nodes. With the help of satellite radar data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), a ground sample database was extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) L1B data. The scSE-LinkNet was trained on the training set, and quantitative evaluation was performed on the test set. Results showed the probability of detection (POD), false alarm rate (FAR), critical success index (CSI), and Heidke skill scores (HSS) were 0.924, 0.143, 0.800, and 0.864, respectively. Compared with other neural networks (FCN, U-Net, and LinkNet), the CSI of scSE-LinkNet was improved, with a maximum increase of nearly 8%. Moreover, the sea fog detection results were consistent with the measured data and CALIOP products.

TI  - Recent Spatiotemporal Trends in Glacier Snowline Altitude at the End of the Melt Season in the Qilian Mountains, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Qilian Mountains, China, play an important role in supplying freshwater to downstream populations, maintaining ecological balance, and supporting economic development on the Tibetan Plateau. Glacier snowline altitude (SLA) at the end of the melt season is an indicator of the Equilibrium line altitude (ELA), and can be used to estimate the mass balance and climate reconstruction. Here, we employ the height zone-area method to determine the SLA at the end of the melt season during the 1989-2018 period using Landsat, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) SLA and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data. The accuracy of glacier SLA obtained in 1989-2018 after adding MODIS SLA data to the years without Landsat data increased by about 78 m. The difference between the remote-sensing-derived SLA and measured equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is mostly within 50 m, suggesting that the SLA can serve as a proxy for the ELA at the end of the melt season. The SLA of Qiyi Glacier in the Qilian Mountains rose from 4690 +/- 25 m to 5030 +/- 25 m, with an average of 4900 +/- 103 m during the 30 year study period. The western, central, eastern sections and the whole range of the Qilian Mountains exhibited an upward trend in SLA during the 30 year study period. The mean glacier SLAs were 4923 +/- 137 m, 4864 +/- 135 m, 4550 +/- 149 m and 4779 +/- 149 m for the western, central, eastern sections and the whole range, respectively. From the perspective of spatial distribution, regardless of the different orientation, grid scale and basin scale, the glacier SLA of Qilian Mountains showed an upward trend from 1989 to 2018, and the glacier SLA is in general located at a comparably higher altitude in the southern and western parts of the Qilian Mountains while it is located at a comparably lower altitude in its northern and eastern parts. In an ideal condition, climate sensitivity studies of ELA in Qilian Mountains show that if the summer mean temperature increases (decreases) by 1 degrees C, then ELA will increase (decrease) by about 102 m. If the annual total solid precipitation increases (decreases) by 10%, then the glacier ELA will decrease (rise) by about 6 m. The summer mean temperature is the main factor affecting the temporal trend of SLA, whereas both summer mean temperature and annual total precipitation influence the spatial change of SLA.

TI  - Spectral aspects for monitoring forest health in extreme season using multispectral imagery
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest health monitoring is needed for forest management in respect to eradication of diseases and insects. Spectral indicators help to retrieve forest health at different scales. Although, indicators of forest condition from remote sensing require narrow spectral bands but these bands are not available in multispectral imagery. Therefore, a systematic approach to evaluate forest health using Sentinel 2A imagery is developed. Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (ARI1), Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) and Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were combined for forest health analysis using ENVI forest health tool model. Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) was retrieved using the SNAP software approach. The overall accuracy in forest health mapping was 0.82 and 0.86 in the month of May and October respectively, validated through in-situ analysis. The excellent forest health exhibit increased by 6 % in October (after the rainy season) compared to May (summer season). The substantial proportion of forest in the area is mature which showed low changes compared to young forest. The reduced regression was found during May (R2 = 0.249) between chlorophyll content and forest health due to decrease in leaf photosynthetic pigments whereas better relationships were noticed in October (R2 = 0.58). The 38% differences in the chlorophyll content in the two seasons indicated that CCC is sensitive to stress pigments in forest.(C) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Revisiting the use of red and near-infrared reflectances in vegetation studies and numerical climate models
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance data acquired in red and near-infrared spectra by remote sensing sensors are traditionally applied to construct various vegetation indices (VIs), which are related to vegetation biophysical parameters. Most VIs use pre-defined weights (usually equal to 1) for the red and NIR reflectance values, therefore con-straining particular weights for red and NIR during the VI design phase, and potentially limiting capabilities of the VI to explain an independent variable. In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate biophysical vari-ables, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) absorbed by green vegetation, represented as linear combinations of the red and NIR reflectances with weights determined empirically from observations and radiative transfer model (PROSAIL) simulations. The proof of concept is first tested on available close-range observations over maize and soybean crops in Nebraska, USA. The empirical results compare well with those from PROSAIL model simulations. The proposed LAI model is then used with data from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Planet/Dove, and the results are validated with in situ LAI measurements in Ukraine. We show that the weights on red and NIR reflectances are vegetation-specific and stable in time. The approach is further tested on crops and forests in the conterminous USA and on a global scale using MODIS LAI and FPAR products as proxies for "ground observations". These LAI and FPAR, however, are not independently measured but derived from the corresponding remotely sensed re-flectances, which precludes recommending a final set of the weights/coefficients for the users, and, thus, should be considered mostly for demonstrating the concept. The results for crop types, other than maize and soybean, and for all forests are conceptual and need to be tested with real ground data. It was, however, encouraging to see that the derived maps of coefficients/weights exhibit regular patterns over the globe compatible with those of vegetation classes and crop types. Tedious and thorough work on compiling available in situ measurements on various crops and forests needs to be accomplished prior to large-scale applications, and the method needs to be further tested and proven that it works at a large scale. The proposed parameterization may be attractive for global studies of various sub-classes of vegetation, once the parameter coefficients are established, validated, tabulated and their stability verified. Ultimately, this approach may provide quantification of vegetation traits for the past decades and be a useful asset for climate models that include satellite-derived land cover classifications and vegetation variables for simulating surface fluxes. This is a conceptual paper, with a proof-of-concept supported by observations over two crops, for which we had close-range observations. It is not a technical note, which would provide users with a recommended set of coefficients for global applications. Our intent was to develop a paradigm, which could ultimately be useful in global models.

TI  - Dissecting Communication Barriers in Healthcare: A Path to Enhancing Communication Resiliency, Reliability, and Patient Safety
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Suboptimal exchange of information can have tragic consequences to patient's safety and survival. To this end, the Joint Commission lists communication error among the most common attributable causes of sentinel events. The risk management literature further supports this finding, ascribing communication error as a major factor (70%) in adverse events. Despite numerous strategies to improve patient safety, which are rooted in other high reliability industries (e.g., commercial aviation and naval aviation), communication remains an adaptive challenge that has proven difficult to overcome in the sociotechnical landscape that defines healthcare. Attributing a breakdown in information exchange to simply a generic "communication error" without further specification is ineffective and a gross oversimplification of a complex phenomenon. Further dissection of the communication error using root cause analysis, a failure modes and effects analysis, or through an event reporting system is needed. Generalizing rather than categorizing is an oversimplification that clouds clear pattern recognition and thereby prevents focused interventions to improve process reliability. We propose that being more precise when describing communication error is a valid mechanism to learn from these errors. We assert that by deconstructing communication in healthcare into its elemental parts, a more effective organizational learning strategy emerges to enable more focused patient safety improvement efforts. After defining the barriers to effective communication, we then map evidence-based recovery strategies and tools specific to each barrier as a tactic to enhance the reliability and validity of information exchange within healthcare.

TI  - Zoning Seagrass Protection in Lap An Lagoon, Vietnam Using a Novel Integrated Framework for Sustainable Coastal Management
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass is a key factor of the nature-based solution to climate change impacts, however, this resource has been lost and degraded worldwide in both of area and habitats. Protection of extant seagrass often requires a zoning approach to fit the local conditions and to identify the spatial prioritization. In this study, we integrated the state-of-the-art machine learning model (CatBoost) and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery for mapping the extent of seagrass meadows, combined with the multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), fuzzy logic (Sigmoidal membership function), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique in a GIS database to score the ecological protection zoning of seagrass ecosystem in Lap An lagoon, Vietnam. Seagrass map retrieved from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery was used as the constrain factor, whilst salinity, water depth, substratum, and distance to aquaculture sites were conditioning factors. Our results presented accurate mapping of seagrass meadows in the study site (scores of overall accuracy, precision, and F-1 are 0.93, 0.90 and 0.92, respectively) and indicated 22.05 ha (scores 0.66-0.99) in high, 18.63 ha (scores 0.33-0.66) in medium, and 10.80 ha (scores 0-0.33) in low priority of protection in the southern and the eastern southwest parts of the lagoon, and the areas closed to the aquaculture sites, respectively. Our novel integrated approach to map the priority zones is useful for sustainable protection and management of seagrass meadows and provides a framework to strengthen the application of remote sensing and GIS-based techniques for further conservation of seagrass globally.

TI  - Functional singular spectrum analysis
T2  - STAT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we develop a new extension of the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) called functional SSA to analyze functional time series. The new methodology is constructed by integrating ideas from functional data analysis and univariate SSA. Specifically, we introduce a trajectory operator in the functional world, which is equivalent to the trajectory matrix in the regular SSA. In the regular SSA, one needs to obtain the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the trajectory matrix to decompose a given time series. Since there is no procedure to extract the functional SVD (fSVD) of the trajectory operator, we introduce a computationally tractable algorithm to obtain the fSVD components. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by an interesting example of remote sensing data. Also, we develop an efficient and user-friendly R package and a shiny web application to allow interactive exploration of the results.

TI  - Methylene Blue as Inexpensive and Reliable Sole Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping Agent for Patients with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.
T2  - Materia socio-medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Invasive ductal cancer (IDC) represents about 75% of all breast malignancies. There are many breast cancer prognostic factors, but the ones that have the most impact on the survival rates in advanced breast cancer are tumor size and regional lymph node involvement. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has particularly important and undoubtful role in current surgical options for breast cancer treatment. With the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer patients it was possible to identify those to whom regional spread of the disease did not occur at the time of surgery, and thus spare them an unnecessary ALND procedure.OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using only methylene blue dye as a mapping agent, as well as to correlate the number of positive SLNs with the number of positive non-sentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs).METHODS: The study represents a prospective study that included 50 female patients with histologically confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) who underwent SLNB using only methylene blue dye as the mapping agent, while the detection and harvest of SNL was done by visual control only. All patients also underwent an obligatory complete ALND, which was as that time the institutional oncological protocol for surgical treatment of histologically confirmed IDC. The final data such as tumor size, SLN and non-SLN status were obtained by further analysis of pathohistological reports from tumor biopsy and other surgical specimens.RESULTS: The accuracy rate of SLN detection was 98%. The number of detected SLN was in the range of 1 to 6, with an average of 2 for each patient. The number of positive SLN was in significant correlation with the number of tumor-affected non-SNL (p<0,001). Further analysis showed that for each increase in the number of positive SLN by 1, the risk of positive non-SLN increased 6-fold, OR=6,22 (p<0,001).CONCLUSION: Use of methylene blue dye as a sole mapping agent when performing SLNB in patients with IDC is a reliable and effective method that can be safely implemented in medical institutions that lack availability of nuclear medicine services or significant monetary funds.

TI  - Progress or Regress? A Systematic Review on Two Decades of Monitoring and Addressing Land Subsidence Hazards in Semarang City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a major cause of environmental degradation. It increases the exposure of global sea level rise-related disasters in coastal cities lying on young sediment. Ample monitoring, adaptation, and mitigation measures have been taken to tackle the impact of such coastal hazards for decades in Semarang City. However, to date, land subsidence still has a negative impact on people's quality of life. This brings us to the question of whether the measures are progressing towards better management or going to the opposite side. This paper is aimed to answer that question through an extensive literature review using PRISMA Guidelines to 125 scholarly articles and quantitative supporting analysis. We found that land subsidence is overlooked. Although the monitoring measures are progressing towards better technology utilization, it was not properly integrated into mitigation and adaptation measures. Instead of investing more on developing better urban water management, groundwater extraction still became the preferred water source. Thus, there is a major shift needed with regard to urban activities that need to pay more heed to the environment.

TI  - Change Detection for Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images with Improved Training of Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the problems of susceptibility to image noise, subjectivity of training sample selection, and inefficiency of state-of-the-art change detection methods with heterogeneous images, this study proposes a post-classification change detection method for heterogeneous images with improved training of hierarchical extreme learning machine (HELM). After smoothing the images to suppress noise, a sample selection method is defined to train the HELM for each image, in which the feature extraction is respectively implemented for heterogeneous images and the parameters need not be fine-tuned. Then, the multi-temporal feature maps extracted from the trained HELM are segmented to obtain classification maps and then compared to generate a change map with changed types. The proposed method is validated experimentally by using one set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained from Sentinel-1, one set of optical images acquired from Google Earth, and two sets of heterogeneous SAR and optical images. The results show that compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods, the proposed method can improve the accuracy of change detection by more than 8% in terms of the kappa coefficient and greatly reduce run time regardless of the type of images used. Such enhancement reflects the robustness and superiority of the proposed method.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study sought to validate the ability of a "Medical Error Disclosure Competence" (MEDC) model to predict the effects of physicians' communication skills on error disclosure outcomes in a simulated context. Method A random sample of 721 respondents was assigned to 16 experimental disclosure conditions that tested the MEDC model's constructs across 2 severity conditions (i.e., minor error and sentinel event). Results Severity did not affect survey respondents' perceptions of the physician's disclosure style. Respondents who viewed the nonverbally skilled disclosure perceived the disclosure as more adequate compared to respondents in the "low nonverbal skill" disclosure condition. Interpersonal adaptability did not affect respondents' adequacy ratings. Consistent with the MEDC model, those who viewed the physician's error disclosure as inadequate indicated that they would be more prone to engage in relational distancing behaviors, while those who rated the disclosure as adequate were more likely to reinvest into their relationship with their physician. These respondents also had higher resilience scores. In the context of a sentinel event, perceived adequacy significantly predicted endorsing legal redress or remedies (e.g., lawsuit). Verbal apology (e.g., "I'm sorry," "I apologize") did not predict any significant variance in the model beyond the physician's nonverbal skill. Conclusion In a simulated disclosure setting, physicians' communicative skills-particularly effective nonverbal communication during a disclosure-trigger outcomes that affect the patient, the physician, and the provider-patient relationship. Findings from this study suggest that MEDC guidelines may be helpful in reducing financial and reputational risks to individual providers and institutions, particularly in the context of a sentinel event.

TI  - Segmentation Scale Effect Analysis in the Object-Oriented Method of High-Spatial-Resolution Image Classification
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatial-resolution images play an important role in land cover classification, and object-based image analysis (OBIA) presents a good method of processing high-spatial-resolution images. Segmentation, as the most important premise of OBIA, significantly affects the image classification and target recognition results. However, scale selection for image segmentation is difficult and complicated for OBIA. The main challenge in image segmentation is the selection of the optimal segmentation parameters and an algorithm that can effectively extract the image information. This paper presents an approach that can effectively select an optimal segmentation scale based on land object average areas. First, 20 different segmentation scales were used for image segmentation. Next, the classification and regression tree model (CART) was used for image classification based on 20 different segmentation results, where four types of features were calculated and used, including image spectral bands value, texture value, vegetation indices, and spatial feature indices, respectively. WorldView-3 images were used as the experimental data to verify the validity of the proposed method for the selection of the optimal segmentation scale parameter. In order to decide the effect of the segmentation scale on the object area level, the average areas of different land objects were estimated based on the classification results. Experiments based on the multi-scale segmentation scale testify to the validity of the land object's average area-based method for the selection of optimal segmentation scale parameters. The study results indicated that segmentation scales are strongly correlated with an object's average area, and thus, the optimal segmentation scale of every land object can be obtained. In this regard, we conclude that the area-based segmentation scale selection method is suitable to determine optimal segmentation parameters for different land objects. We hope the segmentation scale selection method used in this study can be further extended and used for different image segmentation algorithms.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the accuracy of predicting pelvic lymph node status using sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with indocyanine green (ICG) and to examine the outcomes of SLN biopsy-guided abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART). Patients with stage IA2-IB2 cervical cancer from January 2009 to January 2021 were included. ICG was injected before ART and SLNs were identified, excised, and assessed intraoperatively using fast-frozen sections. Systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy was subsequently performed. The SLN detection rate, sensitivity, and false-negative rate were determined. Thirty patients desiring fertility preservation were enrolled, of whom 26 successfully completed ART and four underwent radical hysterectomies because of metastatic primary SLNs. Bilateral SLNs were identified in all patients. The sensitivity, false-negative rate, and negative predictive value were 100%, 7.7%, and 92.3%, respectively. Three (12%) patients were lost to follow-up: two relapsed and one died of tumor progression. Of the nine patients who tried to conceive after surgery, four achieved pregnancy and three delivered healthy live infants. In women with early-stage cervical cancer who desired to conserve fertility, SLN mapping with ICG had a very high detection rate, sensitivity, and low false-negative rate. SLN biopsy-guided ART is a feasible and accurate method for assessing pelvic node status.

TI  - Detecting Phenological Development of Winter Wheat and Winter Barley Using Time Series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the phenological development of agricultural plants is of high importance for farmers to adapt their management strategies and estimate yields. The aim of this study is to analyze the sensitivity of remote sensing features to phenological development of winter wheat and winter barley and to test their transferability in two test sites in Northeast Germany and in two years. Local minima, local maxima and breakpoints of smoothed time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of the Sentinel-1 VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical) intensities and their ratio VH/VV; of the polarimetric features entropy, anisotropy and alpha derived from polarimetric decomposition; as well as of the vegetation index NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculated using optical data of Sentinel-2 are compared with entry dates of phenological stages. The beginning of stem elongation produces a breakpoint in the time series of most parameters for wheat and barley. Furthermore, the beginning of heading could be detected by all parameters, whereas particularly a local minimum of VH and VV backscatter is observed less then 5 days before the entry date. The medium milk stage can not be detected reliably, whereas the hard dough stage of barley takes place approximately 6-8 days around a local maximum of VH backscatter in 2018. Harvest is detected for barley using the fourth breakpoint of most parameters. The study shows that backscatter and polarimetric parameters as well as the NDVI are sensitive to specific phenological developments. The transferability of the approach is demonstrated, whereas differences between test sites and years are mainly caused by meteorological differences.

TI  - Satellite Earth observation to support sustainable rural development
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional survey and census data are not sufficient for measuring poverty and progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Satellite Earth Observation (EO) is a novel data source that has considerable potential to augment data for sustainable rural development. To realise the full potential of EO data as a proxy for socioeconomic conditions, end-users - both expert and non-expert - must be able to make the right decisions about what data to use and how to use it. In this review, we present an outline of what needs to be done to operationalise, and increase confidence in, EO data for sustainable rural development and monitoring the socioeconomic targets of the SDGs. We find that most approaches developed so far operate at a single spatial scale, for a single point in time, and proxy only one socioeconomic metric. Moreover, research has been geographically focused across three main regions: West Africa, East Africa, and the Indian Subcontinent, which underscores a need to conduct research into the utility of EO for monitoring poverty across more regions, to identify transferable EO proxies and methods. A variety of data from different EO platforms have been integrated into such analyses, with Landsat and MODIS datasets proving to be the most utilised to-date. Meanwhile, there is an apparent underutilisation of fusion capabilities with disparate datasets, in terms of (i) other EO datasets such as RADAR data, and (ii) non-traditional datasets such as geospatial population layers. We identify five key areas requiring further development to encourage operational uptake of EO for proxying socioeconomic conditions and conclude by linking these with the technical and implementational challenges identified across the review to make explicit recommendations. This review contributes towards developing transparent data systems to assemble the high-quality data required to monitor socioeconomic conditions across rural spaces at fine temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - COMPARISON OF SENTINEL-2 AND MULTITEMPORAL SENTINEL-1 SAR IMAGERY FOR MAPPING AQUACULTURE POND DISTRIBUTION IN THE COASTAL REGION OF BREBES REGENCY, CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of land cover and land use is necessary to support the strategic management of coastal areas. The utilization of remote sensing technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been widely used for mapping the distribution of land cover and land use. This application includes the detection of aquaculture ponds in coastal areas due to SAR's sensitivity to surface water content. In addition, multitemporal Sentinel-1 data helps to distinguish between ponds and rice fields that possess a visually similar appearance during the flooding stage. This study aims to explore the accuracy of the gray level of co-occurrence model (GCLM) textures of multitemporal Sentinel-1 data for aquaculture pond mapping in Brebes Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia. In addition, single-date Sentinel-2 optical imagery was used to compare the results from Sentinel-1 data. The Sentinel-2 data has been identified using supervised classifications, e.g., maximum likelihood (ML), minimum distance (MD), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms, and the most accurate algorithm was selected to classify the Sentinel-1 data using GLCM textures. The results indicated that the Sentinel-1 imagery showed the best results using GLCM metrics from VH polarization with an accuracy value of 92.2% using the ML algorithm, while the best results from Sentinel-2 were also produced using ML, with an 88.4% overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that multitemporal Sentinel-1 data have higher accuracy than Sentinel-2 data when used for pond detection. This shows the potential of the combination of both sensors to increase the accuracy of aquaculture pond mapping.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in the Vrancea-Buzau Seismic Region, Southeast Romania
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the results of a landslide susceptibility analysis applied to the Vrancea-Buzau seismogenic region in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania. The target area is affected by a large diversity of landslide processes. Slopes are made-up of various types of rocks, climatic conditions can be classified as wet, and the area is a seismically active one. All this contributes to the observed high landslide hazard. The paper analyses the spatial component of the landslide hazard affecting the target area, the regional landslide susceptibility. First, an existing landslide inventory was completed to cover a wider area for the landslide susceptibility analysis. Second, two types of methods are applied, a purely statistical technique, based on correlations between landslide occurrence and local conditions, as well as the simplified spatial process-based Newmark Displacement analysis. Landslide susceptibility maps have been produced by applying both methods, the second one also allowing us to simulate different scenarios, based on various soil saturation rates and seismic inputs. Furthermore, landslide susceptibility was computed both for the landslide source and runout zones-the first providing information about areas where landslides are preferentially triggered and the second indicating where landslides preferentially move along the slope and accumulate. The analysis showed that any of the different methods applied produces reliable maps of landslide susceptibility. However, uncertainties were also outlined as validation is insufficient, especially in the northern area, where only a few landslides could be mapped due to the intense vegetation cover.

TI  - Understanding and modelling wildfire regimes: an ecological perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent extreme wildfire seasons in several regions have been associated with exceptionally hot, dry conditions, made more probable by climate change. Much research has focused on extreme fire weather and its drivers, but natural wildfire regimes-and their interactions with human activities-are far from being comprehensively understood. There is a lack of clarity about the 'causes' of wildfire, and about how ecosystems could be managed for the co-existence of wildfire and people. We present evidence supporting an ecosystem-centred framework for improved understanding and modelling of wildfire. Wildfire has a long geological history and is a pervasive natural process in contemporary plant communities. In some biomes, wildfire would be more frequent without human settlement; in others they would be unchanged or less frequent. A world without fire would have greater forest cover, especially in present-day savannas. Many species would be missing, because fire regimes have co-evolved with plant traits that resist, adapt to or promote wildfire. Certain plant traits are favoured by different fire frequencies, and may be missing in ecosystems that are normally fire-free. For example, post-fire resprouting is more common among woody plants in high-frequency fire regimes than where fire is infrequent. The impact of habitat fragmentation on wildfire crucially depends on whether the ecosystem is fire-adapted. In normally fire-free ecosystems, fragmentation facilitates wildfire starts and is detrimental to biodiversity. In fire-adapted ecosystems, fragmentation inhibits fires from spreading and fire suppression is detrimental to biodiversity. This interpretation explains observed, counterintuitive patterns of spatial correlation between wildfire and potential ignition sources. Lightning correlates positively with burnt area only in open ecosystems with frequent fire. Human population correlates positively with burnt area only in densely forested regions. Models for vegetation-fire interactions must be informed by insights from fire ecology to make credible future projections in a changing climate.

TI  - Evaluation of the operational Chlorophyll-a product from global ocean colour sensors in the coastal waters, south-eastern Arabian Sea
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to address the effect of spatial resolution and retrieval algorithms on the performance of operational chlorophyll-a (chl-a) product from different sensors. To meet the objective, chl-a product at different spatial resolutions derived from MODIS, SNPP-VIIRS, OC-CCI, and Sentinel-3A OLCI were compared with in-situ measurements of the coastal waters of Karnataka, south-eastern Arabian Sea and errors were quantified using statistical criteria. MODIS-derived chl-a concentrations at 4 km tends to overestimate in the nearshore waters as shown by a high mean relative percentage difference (MRPD) of 77.09%, and a low coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.35. A significant improvement was seen for MODIS 1 km chl-a product, (R-2 = 0.64, MRPD = 22.30%) and Mean Absolute Percentage Deviation (MAPD) = 47.08%. Validation of SNPP-VIIRS derived chl-a of 4 km with in-situ measurements showed moderate correlation (R-2 = 0.54, MAPD = 49.21%), whereas 1 km SNPP-VIIRS showed substantially better result than 4 km with majority of data points aggregated along the 1:1 line (R-2 = 0.86, MAPD = 43.66%, MRPD = 20.97%). Chlorophyll-a product at original resolution (750 m) showed less error than 4 km and 1 km resolution (MAPD = 39.18%, R-2 = 0.75, MRPD = 10.875%). In contrast, OC-CCI underestimated field measured chl-a concentrations as indicated by MRPD (-36.72%), with moderate R-2 = 0.58. All 4 km data showed poor results than higher spatial resolution data. Sentinel-3A OLCI 300 m full resolution (FR) derived chl-a, showed good agreement with sea-truth data (R-2 = 0.80, MAPD = 33.07%, and MRPD = 23.89%), whereas Sentinel-3A reduced-resolution (RR-1.2 km) exhibited slight overestimation (MRPD = 28.43%, MAPD = 39.88%, R-2 = 0.78) than Sentinel-3A(FR). Comparison of operational chl-a product from OC-CCI, MODIS, SNPP-VIIRS, and Sentinel-3A OLCI illustrated that Sentinel-3A OLCI performed best in coastal waters of Karnataka indicating the importance of higher spatial resolution and neural network-based algorithms.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 60-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer with a good postoperative course. At the age of 45, she had underwent skin-sparing total mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and right rectus abdominis flap reconstruction for left breast cancer. Since there is a certain risk of abdominal wall hernia after the abdominal flap reconstruction, laparoscopic surgery with less abdominal wall damage might be useful. Although the umbilicus is hollowed out and sutured to a small hole in the cranial skin after abdominal flap reconstruction, there seems to be no problem in using the umbilicus for the port. The abdominal wall is scarred after the abdominal flap reconstruction, but normal insufflation pressure was sufficient to perform the operation in our case. Additionally, we must be careful not to damage the flap pedicle, and it would be useful to check its location by ultrasonography before starting the operation.

TI  - The Heterogeneous Impact of High-Speed Railway on Urban Expansion in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-speed railway (HSR) promote the efficient flow of the population and materials between cities and have profoundly affected urban economic development in China. However, there is currently limited research about how HSR influences urban expansion, especially related to the variable impacts on different urban agglomerations, different size cities, and the conversion of non-urban land to urban land. In this study, from two levels of regional heterogeneity and type heterogeneity, a multi-stage difference-in-differences (multi-stage DID) model and land use remote sensing data are used to investigate these research areas. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The first opening of HSR had a more significant role in promoting urban expansion than HSR frequency, but several years after opening, HSR no longer promotes urban expansion. (2) The opening of HSR only played a significant role in promoting urban expansion in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. HSR frequency had a significant role in promoting urban expansion in the Yangtze River Delta. (3) The opening of HSR had no significant impact on urban expansion for different size cities, and HSR frequency only had a significant negative impact on urban expansion of small cities. (4) The first opening of HSR led to urban expansion dominated by the occupation of cultivated land. Cities in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia mainly converted barren land and vegetation cover to urban land after the first opening of HSR. In northeast China, the first opening of HSR made the conversion of vegetation cover and cultivated land to urban land roughly equivalent in size. The results of this study are helpful to understand the impact of the first opening of HSR and the scale of conversion of different types of non-urban land into urban land on urban expansion. In the era of HSR, these findings provide a valuable reference for regional planning and preventing the disorderly expansion of cities.

TI  - The Labor Productivity Consequences of Exposure to Particulate Matters: Evidence from a Chinese National Panel Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing body of literature has documented the negative impacts of air pollution on labor productivity, especially the effects of fine particulate matter. In this paper, we build on this literature by dissecting two channels of how particulate matter affects labor productivity: decreasing labor supply through damaging the physical functioning of the human body, and decreasing the marginal productivity of labor through damaging the cognitive functioning of the human brain. Using the household panel survey from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) spanning 2000 to 2015 and combining that information with remotely sensed data on exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5), namely, the most harmful air pollution, we find a significantly negative effect of PM2.5 (instrumented by thermal inversion) on labor productivity. We also find that workers who are male, without a college degree, and are employed in outdoor occupations are mainly affected by PM2.5 through decreasing working hours, whereas college-educated workers employed in indoor occupations are mainly affected by PM2.5 through decreasing unit wages. We provide suggestive evidence that health impacts are behind our measured labor-productivity losses as we find significantly lower metrics in physical activity and increasing disease prevalence under higher exposure to PM2.5.

TI  - Radiative Transfer Model Simulations for Ground-Based Microwave Radiometers in North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based microwave radiometer profilers (MWRPs) are widely used to provide high-temporal resolution atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. The quality of the observed brightness temperature (TB) from MWRPs is key for retrieving accurate atmospheric profiles. In this study, TB simulations derived from a radiative transfer model (RTM) were used to assess the quality of TB observations. Two types of atmospheric profile data (conventional radiosonde and ERA5 reanalysis) were combined with the RTM to obtain TB simulations, then compared with corresponding observations from three MWRPs located in different places in North China to investigate the influence of input atmospheric profiles on TB simulations and evaluate the quality of TB observations from the three MWRPs. The comparisons of the matching samples under clear-sky conditions showed that TB simulations derived from both radiosonde and ERA5 profiles were very close to the TB observations from most of the MWRP channels; however, the correlation was lower and the bias was obvious at 51.26 GHz and 52.28 GHz, which indicates that the oxygen absorption component in the RTM needs to be improved for lower-frequency temperature channels. The difference in location of the radiosonde and MWRP sites affected the TB simulations for the water vapor channels, but had little impact on temperature channels that are insensitive to humidity. Comparisons of both simulations (ERA5 and Radiosonde) and the corresponding TB observations from the three sites indicated that the water vapor channels observation quality for the MWRP located in southern Beijing needs improvement. For the two types of profile data, ERA5 profiles have a more positive effect on TB simulations in the water vapor channels, such as enhanced consistence, reduced bias and standard deviation between simulations and observations for those MWRPs located away from the radiosonde station. Therefore, hourly ERA5 data are an optimal option in terms of compensating for limited radiosonde measurements and enhancing the monitoring quality of MWRP observations within 24 h.

TI  - Climate Change and Ecological Projects Jointly Promote Vegetation Restoration in Three-River Source Region of China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the source of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Lancang River, the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) in China is very important to China's ecological security. In recent decades, TRSR's ecosystem has degraded because of climate change and human disturbances. Therefore, a range of ecological projects were initiated by Chinese government around 2000 to curb further degradation. Current research shows that the vegetation of the TRSR has been initially restored over the past two decades, but the respective contribution of ecological projects and climate change in vegetation restoration has not been clarified. Here, we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to assess the spatial-temporal variations in vegetation and explore the impact of climate and human actions on vegetation in TRSR during 2001-2018. The results showed that about 26.02% of the TRSR had a significant increase in EVI over the 18 yr, with an increasing rate of 0.010/10 yr (P < 0.05), and EVI significantly decreased in only 3.23% of the TRSR. Residual trend analysis indicated vegetation restoration was jointly promoted by climate and human actions, and the promotion of human actions was greater compared with that of climate, with relative contributions of 59.07% and 40.93%, respectively. However, the degradation of vegetation was mainly caused by human actions, with a relative contribution of 71.19%. Partial correlation analysis showed that vegetation was greatly affected by temperature (r = 0.62, P < 0.05) due to the relatively sufficient moisture but lower temperature in TRSR. Furthermore, the establishment of nature reserves and the implementation of the Ecological Protection and Restoration Program (EPRP) improved vegetation, and the first stage EPRP had a better effect on vegetation restoration than the second stage. Our findings identify the driving factors of vegetation change and lay the foundation for subsequent effective management.

TI  - A Diachronic Analysis of a Changing Landscape on the Duero River Borderlands of Spain and Portugal Combining Remote Sensing and Ethnographic Approaches
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arribes del Duero region spans the border of both Spain and Portugal along the Duero River. On both sides of the border, the region boasts unique human-influenced ecosystems. The borderland landscape is dotted with numerous villages that have a history of maintaining and managing an agrosilvopastoral use of the land. Unfortunately, the region in recent decades has suffered from massive outmigration, resulting in significant rural abandonment. Consequently, the once-maintained landscape is evolving into a more homogenous vegetative one, resulting in a greater propensity for wildfires. This study utilizes an interdisciplinary, integrated approach of "bottom up" ethnography and "top down" remote sensing data from Landsat imagery, to characterize and document the diachronic vegetative changes on the landscape, as they are perceived by stakeholders and satellite spectral analysis. In both countries, stakeholders perceived the current changes and threats facing the landscape. Remote sensing analysis revealed an increase in forest cover throughout the region, and more advanced, drastic change on the Spanish side of the study area marked by wildfire and a rapidly declining population. Understanding the evolution and history of this rural landscape can provide more effective management and its sustainability.

AB  - Achieving the rational, optimal, and sustainable use of resources (water and soil) is vital to drink and feed 9.725 billion by 2050. Agriculture is the first source of food production, the biggest consumer of freshwater, and the natural filter of air purification. Hence, smart agriculture is a "ray of hope " in regard to food, water, and environmental security. Satellites and artificial intelligence have the potential to help agriculture flourish. This research is an essential step towards achieving smart agriculture. Prediction of soil moisture is important for determining when to irrigate and how much water to apply, to avoid problems associated with over- and under-watering. This also contributes to an increase in the number of areas being cultivated and, hence, agricultural productivity and air purification. Soil moisture measurement techniques, in situ, are point measurements, tedious, time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. Therefore, we aim to provide a new approach to detect moisture content in soil without actually being in contact with it. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that can predict soil moisture content over agricultural areas from Sentinel-1 images. The dual-pol (VV-VH) Sentinel-1 SAR data have being utilized (V = vertical, H = horizontal). The CNN model is composed of six convolutional layers, one max-pooling layer, one flatten layer, and one fully connected layer. The total number of Sentinel-1 images used for running CNN is 17,325 images. The best values of the performance metrics (coefficient of determination (R-2=0.8664), mean absolute error (MAE=0.0144), and root mean square error (RMSE=0.0274)) have been achieved due to the use of Sigma naught VH and Sigma naught VV as input data to the CNN architecture (C). Results show that VV polarization is better than VH polarization for soil moisture retrieval, and that Sigma naught, Gamma naught, and Beta naught have the same influence on soil moisture estimation.

TI  - Enabling Year-round Cultivation in the Nordics-Agrivoltaics and Adaptive LED Lighting Control of Daily Light Integral
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - High efficacy LED lamps combined with adaptive lighting control and greenhouse integrated photovoltaics (PV) could enable the concept of year-round cultivation. This concept can be especially useful for increasing the production in the Nordic countries of crops like herbaceous perennials, forest seedlings, and other potted plants not native of the region, which are grown more than one season in this harsh climate. Meteorological satellite data of this region was analyzed in a parametric study to evaluate the potential of these technologies. The generated maps showed monthly average temperatures fluctuating from -20 degrees C to 20 degrees C throughout the year. The natural photoperiod and light intensity also changed drastically, resulting in monthly average daily light integral (DLI) levels ranging from 45-50 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) in summer and contrasting with 0-5 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) during winter. To compensate, growth room cultivation that is independent of outdoor conditions could be used in winter. Depending on the efficacy of the lamps, the electricity required for sole-source lighting at an intensity of 300 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) for 16 h would be between 1.4 and 2.4 kWh center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Greenhouses with supplementary lighting could help start the cultivation earlier in spring and extend it further into autumn. The energy required for lighting highly depends on several factors such as the natural light transmittance, the light threshold settings, and the lighting control protocol, resulting in electric demands between 0.6 and 2.4 kWh center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Integrating PV on the roof or wall structures of the greenhouse could offset some of this electricity, with specific energy yields ranging from 400 to 1120 kWh center dot kW(-1)center dot yr(-1) depending on the region and system design.

TI  - Climate change impact on sea surface winds in Southeast Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical representation and climate projections of sea surface winds over Southeast Asia (SEA) are assessed here using an ensemble of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) downscaled simulations performed over the 20th and 21st centuries under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios within the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX)-SEA project. The ensemble is based on two regional climate models (RCMs: RegCM4 and RCA4), and CMIP5 simulations are performed with five global climate models (GCMs: CNRM_CM5, HadGEM2, GFDL, MPI-ESM-MR, EC-Earth). Comparison with QuikSCAT satellite data shows that dynamical downscaling improves sea surface wind speed representation, mainly by reducing its underestimation. The level of improvement depends on the RCM choice, GCM performance, and wind strength. Our results reveal significant differences in modelled projections of sea surface wind, depending on the model, RCP, region, and season. GCMs simulate weak and contrasted changes, stronger for RCP8.5, with no clear common trend. RCA4 simulates weak changes, with high similarities between pairs, but contrasted results between RCPs. RegCM4 simulate stronger changes, with a weakening of average and intense winds for all seasons, stronger in June-August, and in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5. RCA4 and RegCM4 simulate different changes, with no clear common trend except a weakening of seasonal and intense winds and an increase of seasonal wind interannual variability for June-August in RCP4.5, stronger for RegCM4. This corresponds to a weakening of the boreal summer monsoon and a slight increase of its interannual variability and presumably to a decrease of the tropical cyclone frequency. Differences in seasonal sea surface wind changes between models are related to differences in sea level pressure gradient changes. For a given RCM, those differences are partly related to the differences between parent GCMs. Finally, results suggest that uncertainties related to the RCM choice are larger than those related to the GCM choice.

TI  - Groundwater prospecting using remote sensing and geoelectrical methods in the North Cameroon (Central Africa) metamorphic formations
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery and geoelectrical surveys used in this study help to evaluate the groundwater potentiality in the metamorphic formations of the North Cameroon. The methodology of the work is then mainly based on the extraction and identification of lineaments or fracture zones which acts as the pas-sageway for groundwater. Manual and automatic extraction technics applied on the Landsat-8 images made it possible to find sixty one (61) lineaments. The main directions of these lineaments are N-S and N22 degrees E (NNE-SSW) and the secondary directions are N10 degrees E, NE-SW, then W-E to N100 degrees E. According to the lineament density map, high density values are located at the centre and at the western part of the study area. The lineament density contrasts show the level of fracturing in the area. This frac-turing is also evidenced by the geoelectrical survey. Indeed, results of the electrical resistivity profiling and 2D electrical imaging around or near lineaments, reveal the existence of fractures and shear zones characterized by the conductive discontinuities in the electrical current responses. Usually, the disconti-nuities sus-evocated above form potential groundwater targets. So, based on the combined results from remote sensing and geoelectrical method, the present study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of using this approach for assessing the availability of potential groundwater zones in the metamorphic forma-tions. However, methods used in this study should be supported by the drill hole methods for the validity of results.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Geomorphology of the Tafilalt Basin, South-East Morocco - implications for fluvial-aeolian dynamics and wind regimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyper-arid Taflilat Basin, South-East Morocco, is dominated by two ephemeral fluvial networks and several ergs with various dune forms from barchans to mega dunes. Especially the genesis of the star dunes remains an open research question. Therefore, a new multi-sheet geomorphological map describes the surface dynamics in the basin. Identification of major surface features was done with remote sensing data and on-site surveys. The analyses were used to identify all different landscape units. Additionally, aeolian features are emphasized to deduce current wind directions. The identification of two opposite wind fields was possible and a spatial correlation in the fluvial-aeolian system is detected. The border of the opposite wind fields crosses Erg Chebbi. Hence, the star dunes are under the influence of a multimodal wind system. Overall, this new geomorphological map strengthens the understanding of the fluvial-aeolian interaction in the Tafilalt Basin and sets a baseline for ongoing in-depth studies.

TI  - Status of Filariasis Endemicity and Community Behavior Factor Associated to Filariasis Elimination in Enrekang District, South Sulawesi Province
T2  - MEDIA PENELITIAN DAN PENGEMBANGAN KESEHATAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Enrekang district is one of the regions in South Sulawesi Province that has been declared endemic for filariasis since the first case was found in the fingerblood survey (SDJ) in 2006. In Enrekang district, the Filariasis Mass Prevention Drug Administration (POPM) program has been implemented for five years continuously from 2007 to 2011, and passed the TAS-3 (Transmission Assessment Survey), also received a filariasis-free certificate from the Ministry of Health in 2016. This research aimed to determine the microfilaremia rate after passing TAS-3 and identify community behavioral factors related to filariasis elimination in filariasis endemic areas in Enrekang District, South Sulawesi Province. The research design was cross-sectional and conducted from February to December 2017. Data collections were carried out in two sentinel villages, namely Potokullin village Buntu Batu Sub District and Parombean village located in Curio Sub District, Enrekang District. Data were collected through fingerblood survey and interviews with 310 residents (minimum sample size) for each of these villages. The results of SDJ showed that there were no microfilariae in all samples examined. Enrekang District can be declared as a filariasis-free area. The behavior of community in using mosquito nets and closed clothing as an effort to avoid mosquito bites and community participation in taking filariasis mass drug greatly contributed to the succes of filariasis elimination in Enrekang District, South Sulawesi Province.

AB  - The consequences of the global COVID-19 health crisis and racial disparities have an impact on the employment opportunities of individuals with marginalized identities. The heightened need to address systemic oppression calls for advocacy-focused and social justice-informed career practitioners to provide culturally centered interventions to assist clients' career development. Practitioners need to be aware of the multiple sources of oppression affecting their clients and develop the skills necessary to understand their worldview. Using a case study and Furman's (2012) social justice leadership framework, we discuss the importance of career practitioners implementing praxis across internal and external dimensions.

TI  - Modeling the Dynamics of Supraglacial Rivers and Distributed Meltwater Flow With the Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Meltwater produced at the surface of glaciers and ice sheets has important implications for basal sliding rates and therefore ice flow velocities. In order to determine the role of supraglacial water in ice dynamics and predict future changes, we first need to understand and be able to accurately predict moulin input rates. To this end, we present the Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) model. SaDS is a dynamic model that couples supraglacial runoff in the bare-ice ablation zone in a distributed sheet with flow in discrete channels. Flow in the distributed sheet drives melt through potential energy dissipation, allowing a channel network to form naturally with no prior assumptions about channel locations. We apply the model to a synthetic ice sheet margin and carry out a suite of sensitivity tests. Modeled moulin inputs show expected behaviors including large diurnal variability, multi-hour lags following peak surface melt, and demonstrate complex and diverse seasonal dynamics. The sensitivity tests illustrate the range of possible model behaviors and constrain the parameter values for which the model predicts physically realistic moulin inputs. We also apply the model to a similar to 20 x 27 km(2) catchment on the southwestern Greenland Ice Sheet using RACMO melt forcing and previously mapped moulin locations. Modeled supraglacial lake and stream locations match those mapped from Landsat 8 images, and moulin inputs show varied daily and seasonal dynamics. These results demonstrate that the model is a promising tool to provide moulin inputs for subglacial and ice dynamic studies.Plain Language Summary Throughout the summer, the surface of glaciers is covered by a network of rivers and lakes. These rivers often drain through moulins (vertical shafts from the surface to the base of the ice that let water drain through the glacier). The rate of water flow through these moulins can change the speed at which glaciers flow since water can pool underneath the glacier, allowing the glacier to slide against the bedrock. This is important because changes to glacier flow speeds can impact the rate of sea level rise. In this study we introduce a new tool, called the Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) model, that simulates flow through glacial surface rivers and lakes in order to calculate water input into moulins. We show that SaDS more accurately represents changes in flow into moulins caused by rivers drying up or expanding than previous simulations. SaDS is a significant step forward for making realistic predictions of moulin inputs, which will be key for determining how the world's ice sheets and glaciers change as the climate continues to warm.Key PointsSaDS dynamically models supraglacial water flow in a distributed sheet and in supraglacial channelsModeled moulin inputs show complex and heterogeneous seasonal dynamicsPredicted supraglacial lake and river locations agree with mapping on the Greenland Ice Sheet

TI  - Spatiotemporal Filling of Missing Data in Remotely Sensed Displacement Measurement Time Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing data is a critical pitfall in the investigation of remotely sensed displacement measurement because it prevents from a full understanding of the physical phenomenon under observation. In the sight of reconstructing incomplete displacement data, this letter presents a data-driven spatiotemporal gap-filling method, which is an extension of the expectation-maximization-empirical orthogonal function (EM-EOF) method. The presented method decomposes an augmented spatiotemporal covariance of a displacement time series into EOF modes and then selects the optimal set of EOF modes to reconstruct the time series. This selection is based on the cross-validation root-mean-square error and a confidence index associated with each eigenvalue. The estimated missing values are then iteratively updated until convergence. Results on displacement time series derived from cross correlation of Sentinel-2 optical images over Fox Glacier in New-Zealand's Alps show that the reconstruction accuracy is improved compared with the EM-EOF method. The proposed extension can tackle challenging cases, i.e., short time series with heterogeneous displacement behaviors corrupted by a large amount of missing data and noise.

TI  - Function-Preserving Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary For patients with early gastric cancer (EGC), a good prognosis is achieved by conventional standard gastrectomy with radical lymphadenectomy. However, postgastrectomy syndrome is often inevitable and results in decreased quality of life (QOL). To improve patients' QOL, proximal gastrectomy instead of total gastrectomy and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy instead of distal gastrectomy have been widely accepted as function-preserving gastrectomies. Recently, personalized, minimized gastrectomy with sentinel node navigation surgery has been developed and is expected to be an ideal treatment option for patients with EGC. Herein, we review the indications, surgical techniques, and postoperative outcomes of function-preserving gastrectomy. Recently, minimally invasive (endoscopic or laparoscopic) treatment for early gastric cancer (EGC) has been widely accepted. However, a standard gastrectomy with radical lymphadenectomy is generally performed in patients with EGC who have no indications for endoscopic resection, and postgastrectomy dysfunction is one of the problems of standard gastrectomy. Function-preserving gastrectomy, such as proximal gastrectomy and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, can be considered when attempting to preserve the patient's quality of life (QOL) postoperatively. In addition, sentinel node navigation surgery for EGC has been applied in clinical practice in several prospective studies on function-preserving personalized minimized gastrectomy. In the near future, the sentinel lymph node concept is expected to form the basis for establishing an ideal, personalized, minimally invasive function-preserving treatment for patients with EGC, which will improve their postoperative QOL without compromising their long-term survival. In this review article, we summarize the current status, surgical techniques, and postoperative outcomes of function-preserving gastrectomy for EGC.

TI  - Satellite Time Series and Google Earth Engine Democratize the Process of Forest-Recovery Monitoring over Large Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary forest-health initiatives require technologies and workflows that can monitor forest degradation and recovery simply and efficiently over large areas. Spectral recovery analysis-the examination of spectral trajectories in satellite time series-can help democratize this process, particularly when performed with cloud computing and open-access satellite archives. We used the Landsat archive and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to track spectral recovery across more than 57,000 forest harvest areas in the Canadian province of Alberta. We analyzed changes in the normalized burn ratio (NBR) to document a variety of recovery metrics, including year of harvest, percent recovery after five years, number of years required to achieve 80% of pre-disturbance NBR, and % recovery the end of our monitoring window (2018). We found harvest areas in Alberta to recover an average of 59.9% of their pre-harvest NBR after five years. The mean number of years required to achieve 80% recovery in the province was 8.7 years. We observed significant variability in pre- and post-harvest spectral recovery both regionally and locally, demonstrating the importance of climate, elevation, and complex local factors on rates of spectral recovery. These findings are comparable to those reported in other studies and demonstrate the potential for our workflow to support broad-scale management and research objectives in a manner that is complimentary to existing information sources. Measures of spectral recovery for all 57,979 harvest areas in our analysis are freely available and browseable via a custom GEE visualization tool, further demonstrating the accessibility of this information to stakeholders and interested members of the public.

TI  - Automatic Open Water Flood Detection from Sentinel-1 Multi-Temporal Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Many technical infrastructure operators manage facilities distributed over large areas. They face the problem of finding out if a flood hit a specific facility located in the open countryside. Physical inspection after every heavy rain is time and personnel consuming, and equipping all facilities with flood detection is expensive. Therefore, methods are being sought to ensure that these facilities are monitored at a minimum cost. One of the possibilities is using remote sensing, especially radar data regularly scanned by satellites. A significant challenge in this area was the launch of Sentinel-1 providing free-of-charge data with adequate spatial resolution and relatively high revisit time. This paper presents a developed automatic processing chain for flood detection in the open landscape from Sentinel-1 data. Flood detection can be started on-demand; however, it mainly focuses on autonomous near real-time monitoring. It is based on a combination of algorithms for multi-temporal change detection and histogram thresholding open-water detection. The solution was validated on five flood events in four European countries by comparing its results with flood delineation derived from reference datasets. Long-term tests were also performed to evaluate the potential for a false positive occurrence. In the statistical classification assessments, the mean value of user accuracy (producer accuracy) for open-water class reached 83% (65%). The developed solution typically provided flooded polygons in the same areas as the reference dataset, but of a smaller size. This fact is mainly attributed to the use of universal sensitivity parameters, independent of the specific location, which ensure almost complete successful suppression of false alarms.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a combination of example-based feature extraction and visual interpretation was applied to analyze the coastline variations in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHMGBA) from the past four decades based on the Landsat satellite remote sensing image data from 1987-2018, using ENVI and ArcGIS software. The results showed that the total length of the coastline of the GHMGBA increased in the past four decades, rising from 1291 km in 1987 to 1411 km in 2018. Among these, artificial coastline increased by 450 km, while the other coastline types decreased. The type of coastline that decreased the most was bedrock coastline, by a total of 172 km. The silty coastline disappeared, and almost all of it was converted to artificial coastline. Variations in the coastline of the GHMGBA were mainly connected to human activities and showed an overall trend of advancing towards the ocean. Dynamic monitoring of coastline variations can provide a reference for the protection of natural resources, sustainable marine development and rational planning of the coastal zone.

TI  - Evaluation of ecological quality variation in mining area of Northeast China based on RSEI Index: A case study of Gongchangling District, Liaoning Province
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the important anthropogenic disturbance, mining exploitation has great influence on regional ecological quality. In this study, remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was computed based on the Landsat remote sensing images in 1999, 2003, 2010, 2015, and 2020, to evaluate the ecological environment quality in Gongchangling, Liaoyang, Liaoning. The results showed that the overall ecological quality was mainly excellent from 1999 to 2020, accounting for more than 80% of the total area. The average RSEI values in the five periods were 0.927, 0.931, 0.891, 0.883, and 0.894, respectively. The whole RSEI manifested as firstly slightly increasing, then decreasing, and finally increasing. The areas with obvious ecological degradation were mining districts and towns. The variation of ecological quality in Gongchangling was closely related to the mining exploitation activities.

TI  - Integrating Sentinel-1/2 Data and Machine Learning to Map Cotton Fields in Northern Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information of cotton planting areas is essential for monitoring and managing cotton fields. However, there is no large-scale and high-resolution method suitable for mapping cotton fields, and the problems associated with low resolution and poor timeliness need to be solved. Here, we proposed a new framework for mapping cotton fields based on Sentinel-1/2 data for different phenological periods, random forest classifiers, and the multi-scale image segmentation method. A cotton field map for 2019 at a spatial resolution of 10 m was generated for northern Xinjiang, a dominant cotton planting region in China. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the map were 0.932 and 0.813, respectively. The results showed that the boll opening stage was the best phenological phase for mapping cotton fields and the cotton fields was identified most accurately at the early boll opening stage, about 40 days before harvest. Additionally, Sentinel-1 and the red edge bands in Sentinel-2 are important for cotton field mapping, and there is great potential for the fusion of optical images and microwave images in crop mapping. This study provides an effective approach for high-resolution and high-accuracy cotton field mapping, which is vital for sustainable monitoring and management of cotton planting.

TI  - Study on the Estimation of Forest Volume Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed a comparative analysis of the prediction accuracy of machine learning methods and ordinary Kriging (OK) hybrid methods for forest volume models based on multi-source remote sensing data combined with ground survey data. Taking Larix olgensis, Pinus koraiensis, and Pinus sylvestris plantations in Mengjiagang forest farms as the research object, based on the Chinese Academy of Forestry LiDAR, charge-coupled device, and hyperspectral (CAF-LiTCHy) integrated system, we extracted the visible vegetation index, texture features, terrain factors, and point cloud feature variables, respectively. Random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used to estimate forest volume. In the small-scale space, the estimation of sample plot volume is influenced by the surrounding environment as well as the neighboring observed data. Based on the residuals of these three machine learning models, OK interpolation was applied to construct new hybrid forest volume estimation models called random forest Kriging (RFK), support vector machines for regression Kriging (SVRK), and artificial neural network Kriging (ANNK). The six estimation models of forest volume were tested using the leave-one-out (Loo) cross-validation method. The prediction accuracies of these six models are better, with RLoo2 values above 0.6, and the prediction accuracy values of the hybrid models are all improved to different extents. Among the six models, the RFK hybrid model had the best prediction effect, with an RLoo2 reaching 0.915. Therefore, the machine learning method based on multi-source remote sensing factors is useful for forest volume estimation; in particular, the hybrid model constructed by combining machine learning and the OK method greatly improved the accuracy of forest volume estimation, which, thus, provides a fast and effective method for the remote sensing inversion estimation of forest volume and facilitates the management of forest resources.

TI  - Intercomparison of High-Resolution SST Climatologies Over the Australian Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) climatology data sets provide the reference for observations of ocean anomalous events, which may have significant effects on the local marine ecosystem. The representativeness of the SST climatologies of the historical and current ocean surface states is essential to identify and predict anomalous events. Here, we compare five high-resolution SST climatology data sets around the Australian coast to investigate the uncertainty introduced by the reference SSTs to current estimates of SST anomalies. The data sets studied are (a) 0.05 degrees global daily climatology calculated by this study from the ESA SST Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Analysis v2.0 product (1981-2016); (b) 0.25 degrees global daily climatology for 1981-2016 derived from the NCEI daily AVHRR_OI SST; (c) 0.02 degrees SST Atlas of the Australian Regional Seas (SSTAARS), a pixel-wise daily climatology for 1992-2016; (d) 0.05 degrees NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) global monthly climatology for 1985-2012; and (e) 0.1 degrees global daily climatology for 1994-2016 derived from the BRAN_2016 ocean reanalysis. The climatology data sets formed from SST CCI analysis v2.0 data are used as the reference to compare data sets (b)-(e) based on the same reference time period and central year. This study indicates that climatologies (a) and (e) would be suitable for use as a reference over the Australian region. However, for smaller spatial scales or where a night-only SST climatology is required, the 2-km daily SSTAARS would also be suitable. The feature resolution of the climatology data sets (a) and (e) is significantly coarser than SSTAARS climatology.

TI  - A Dual-Polarimetric SAR Ship Detection Dataset and a Memory-Augmented Autoencoder-Based Detection Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of imaging and space-borne satellite technology, a growing number of multipolarized SAR imageries have been implemented for object detection. However, most of the existing public SAR ship datasets are grayscale images under single polarization mode. To make full use of the polarization characteristics of multipolarized SAR, a dual-polarimetric SAR dataset specifically used for ship detection is presented in this paper (DSSDD). For construction, 50 dual-polarimetric Sentinel-1 SAR images were cropped into 1236 image slices with the size of 256 x 256 pixels. The variances and covariance of both VV and VH polarization were fused into R,G,B channels of the pseudo-color image. Each ship was labeled with both a rotatable bounding box (RBox) and a horizontal bounding box (BBox). Apart from 8-bit pseudo-color images, DSSDD also provides 16-bit complex data for readers. Two prevalent object detectors R(3)Det and Yolo-v4 were implemented on DSSDD to establish the baselines of the detectors with the RBox and BBox respectively. Furthermore, we proposed a weakly supervised ship detection method based on anomaly detection via advanced memory-augmented autoencoder (MemAE), which can significantly remove false alarms generated by the two-parameter CFAR algorithm applied upon our dual-polarimetric dataset. The proposed advanced MemAE method has the advantages of a lower annotation workload, high efficiency, good performance even compared with supervised methods, making it a promising direction for ship detection in dual-polarimetric SAR images. The dataset is available on github.

TI  - Multi-Model Estimation of Forest Canopy Closure by Using Red Edge Bands Based on Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, red edge bands are important indicators for monitoring vegetation growth. To examine the application potential of red edge bands in forest canopy closure estimation, three types of commonly used models-empirical statistical models (multiple stepwise regression (MSR)), machine learning models (back propagation neural network (BPNN)) and physical models (Li-Strahler geometric-optical (Li-Strahler GO) models)-were constructed and verified based on Sentinel-2 data, DEM data and measured data. In addition, we set up a comparative experiment without red edge bands. The relative error (E-R) values of the BPNN model, MSR model, and Li-Strahler GO model with red edge bands were 16.97%, 20.76% and 24.83%, respectively. The validation accuracy measures of these models were higher than those of comparison models. For comparative experiments, the E-R values of the MSR, Li-Strahler GO and BPNN models were increased by 13.07%, 4% and 1.22%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that red edge bands can effectively improve the accuracy of forest canopy closure estimation models to varying degrees. These findings provide a reference for modeling and estimating forest canopy closure using red edge bands based on Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - An Improved Method Combining CNN and 1D-Var for the Retrieval of Atmospheric Humidity Profiles from FY-4A/GIIRS Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-4A/GIIRS (Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder) is the first infrared hyperspectral atmospheric vertical detector in geostationary orbit. Compared to other similar instruments, it has the advantages of high temporal resolution and stationary relative to the ground. Based on the characteristics of GIIRS observation data, we proposed a humidity profile retrieval method. We fully utilized the information provided by the observation and forecast data, and used the two-dimensional brightness temperature data with the dimension of time and optical spectrum as the input of the CNN (convolution neural network model). Then, the obtained brightness temperature data were shown to be more suitable as the input for the physical retrieval method for humidity than the conventional correction method, improving the accuracy of humidity profile retrieval. We performed two comparative experiments. The first experiment results indicate that, compared to ordinary linear correction and ANN (artificial neural network algorithm) correction, our revised observed brightness temperature data are much closer to the simulated brightness temperature obtained by inputting ERA5 reanalysis data into RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS). The results of the second experiment indicate that the accuracy of the humidity profile retrieved by our method is higher than that of conventional ANN and 1D-Var (one-dimensional variational algorithm). With ERA5 reanalysis data as the reference value, the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of the humidity profiles by our method is less than 8.2% between 250 and 600 hPa. Our method holds the unique advantage of the high temporal resolution of GIIRS, improves the accuracy of humidity profile retrieval, and proves that the combination of machine learning and the physical method is a compelling idea in the field of satellite atmospheric remote sensing worthy of further exploration.

TI  - Analysis of atmospheric SO<sub>2</sub> in Sichuan-Chongqing region based on OMI data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sichuan-Chongqing region is the leader and growth pole of economic development in western China. With the rapid development of economy and unique geographical environment, high concentration of sulfur dioxide air pollution has existed for a long time in Sichuan-Chongqing area. Based on 10 years of remote sensing data, this paper studies the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics, stability, and influencing factors of sulfur dioxide in this area. Based on potential sources, the impact of surrounding areas on sulfur dioxide in Sichuan and Chongqing is analyzed. The results shows that the spatial distribution of sulfur dioxide in the SichuanChongqing region is higher in the southeast and lower in the west. The Midwest region has low fluctuation and good stability. The time distribution shows obvious seasonal regularity. The concentration of sulfur dioxide is affected by socio-economic factors and natural factors. In this study, it is found that the distribution of sulfur dioxide is closely related to -PM2.5, which provides an important reference for the comprehensive management of air pollution. The OMI data effectively reflects the distribution and change of atmospheric sulfur dioxide in the Sichuan-Chongqing region, and provides certain ideas for air pollution control in the Sichuan-Chongqing region and other regions in China.

TI  - A Multispectral and Multiangle 3-D Convolutional Neural Network for the Classification of ZY-3 Satellite Images Over Urban Areas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent availability of high-resolution multiview ZY-3 satellite images, with angular information, can provide an opportunity to capture 3-D structural features for classification. In high-resolution image classification over urban areas, objects with diverse vertical structures make urban landscape more heterogeneous in 3-D space and consequently can make the classification challenging. In this article, a novel multiangle gray-level cooccurrence tensor feature is proposed based on the multiview bands of the ZY-3 imagery, namely, GLCM(MA-T). The GLCM(MA-T) feature captures the distributions of the gray-level spatial variation under different viewing angles, which can depict the 3-D textures and structures of urban objects. The spectral and GLCM(MA-T) tensor features are interpreted by two 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) streams and then concatenated as the input to the fully connected layer. This novel multispectral and multiangle 3-D convolutional neural network (M-2-3-DCNN) combines the spectral and angular information, and the fused feature has the potential to provide a comprehensive description of urban objects with complex vertical structures. The experimental results on ZY-3 multiview images from four test areas indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the classification accuracy when compared with several state-of-the-art multiangle features and deep-learning-based image classification methods.

TI  - Tituba, 'Dark Eve' in the Origins of the American Myth: The Subject of History and Writing about Salem
T2  - CLCWEB-COMPARATIVE LITERATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recasting the Salem witchcraft trials in light of Walter Benjamin's theses on historiography, this paper revisits the question of history by examining ways in which Tituba is dis/con-figured as the subject of American history in Arthur Miller's The Crucible and Maryse Conde's I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem. Both stories of persecution revolve around the figure of Tituba, a slave from the Caribbean to whom the beginning of the witch trials is attributed, as the nodal point of different modes of representing the Salem history. The telos in Miller's drama coincides with the subject-formation of Proctor as the legitimate inheritor of American history from the Puritan civilizing mission to the Cold War Manichean worldview. Miller's reaffirmation of the American myth is problematic because it ends up reproducing the same oppressive ideology it proposes to criticize by displacing its contradictions onto peripheral figures. Conde begins from this periphery, collecting pieces from disparate historical and cultural records into a collage of Tituba's story, which does not reproduce, but instead ruptures, the narrative of progress. Conde captures history not as linear but sedimented, and Tituba does not progress to identify with the American telos but re-articulates the sum total of its ideology.

TI  - Characterizing the impact of Land-Use/Land-Cover changes on a Temperate Forest using the Markov model
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-Use/Land-Cover (LULC) change is one of the main factors contributing to ecosystem degradation and to the global climate change. The Markov Chains (MC) model is a widely used technique for the spatio-temporal evaluation of LULC changes, allowing the projection of the landscape variability based on the multidirectional potential of LULC changes. This study assessed the LULC changes in a disturbed temperate forest basin of northern Mexico during the period 1990-2019. In addition, three LULC scenarios, employing the MC model, were projected for 2048. Supervised classification techniques were performed on data from Landsat sensors to generate LULC maps. Results from the Kappa Index showed a precision of 85 and 85.8% for the classifications of 1990 and 2019, respectively. During the evaluated period, degradation and deforestation processes in the basin were the main factors of disturbance, causing the pine-oak forest to show the biggest loss of coverage (190.81 km2). Conversely, open lands showed the biggest increase in its coverage, which indicates anthropogenic activities as the main driver causing changes on the ecosystem. Projections for 2048 indicate processes of degradation and deforestation will continue, expecting increases in coverage for open lands, deciduous forest, and secondary forest. The current and projected conditions of the landscape highlight the importance of the implementation of conservation and restoration strategies, as well as responsible public policies in the study area to mitigate the impacts on these ecosystems.

TI  - Geographic barriers to establishing a successful hospital referral system in rural Madagascar
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The provision of emergency and hospital care has become an integral part of the global vision for universal health coverage. To strengthen secondary care systems, we need to accurately understand the time necessary for populations to reach a hospital. The goal of this study was to develop methods that accurately estimate referral and prehospital time for rural districts in low and middle-income countries. We used these estimates to assess how local geography can limit the impact of a strengthened referral programme in a rural district of Madagascar. Methods We developed a database containing: travel speed by foot and motorised vehicles in Ifanadiana district; a full mapping of all roads, footpaths and households; and remotely sensed data on terrain, land cover and climatic characteristics. We used this information to calibrate estimates of referral and prehospital time based on the shortest route algorithms and statistical models of local travel speed. We predict the impact on referral numbers of strategies aimed at reducing referral time for underserved populations via generalised linear mixed models. Results About 10% of the population lived less than 2 hours from the hospital, and more than half lived over 4 hours away, with variable access depending on climatic conditions. Only the four health centres located near the paved road had referral times to the hospital within 1 hour. Referral time remained the main barrier limiting the number of referrals despite health system strengthening efforts. The addition of two new referral centres is estimated to triple the population living within 2 hours from a centre with better emergency care capacity and nearly double the number of expected referrals. Conclusion This study demonstrates how adapting geographic accessibility modelling methods to local scales can occur through improving the precision of travel time estimates and pairing them with data on health facility use.

TI  - Mapping Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in the Kastela Bay and Brac Channel Using Ridge Regression and Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we describe a method for the prediction of concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from satellite data in the coastal waters of Kastela Bay and the Bra.c Channel (our case study areas) in the Republic of Croatia. Chl-a is one of the parameters that indicates water quality and that can be measured by in situ measurements or approximated as an optical parameter with remote sensing. Remote sensing products for monitoring Chl-a are mostly based on the ocean and open sea monitoring and are not accurate for coastal waters. In this paper, we propose a method for remote sensing monitoring that is locally tailored to suit the focused area. This method is based on a data set constructed by merging Sentinel 2 Level-2A satellite data with in situ Chl-a measurements. We augmented the data set horizontally by transforming the original feature set, and vertically by adding synthesized zero measurements for locations without Chl-a. By transforming features, we were able to achieve a sophisticated model that predicts Chl-a from combinations of features representing transformed bands. Multiple Linear Regression equation was derived to calculate Chl-a concentration and evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative evaluation resulted in R-2 scores 0.685 and 0.659 for train and test part of data set, respectively. A map of Chl-a of the case study area was generated with our model for the dates of the known incidents of algae blooms. The results that we obtained are discussed in this paper.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Territories of the eastern slope of the Polar Urals are promising for the identification of gold mineralization based on the materials of the multispectral satellite imagery of the Landsat 8 spacecraft-the Yun'yaginskoe ore field (Shchuch'inskaya zone), Toupugol-Khan'meyshorskiy ore district, and Manyukuyu-Vorchatinsky ore cluster (central part of the Maloural'skaya zone)-are analyzed. These areas are compared to reveal similar features of geological structure and the location of deposits and ore occurrences in the system of morphostructures, which will help to develop prospecting indicators (geological, morphological) for gold-bearing ore mineralization. It is found that prospecting for gold-ore mineralization in this area should be performed in the concentric circles of the ring structures of the second order (diameter >= 10 km) in association with subvolcanic bodies of quartz diorites/granodiorites, as well as on the periphery of the inner part of large ring structures of the first order (more than 50 km in diameter) of a complex structure with signs of "telescoping" related to intrusive formations, represented by diorites, quartz monzodiorites, and granodiorites of the final phase of intrusion. The mineralization should be localized together with areas of lineaments thickened in NW, NE and/or sublatitudinal directions and within the regional fault zones up to hundreds of kilometers in length. The mineralization is formed at the final stage of the development of volcanic structures.

AB  - Accurate maps of the spatial distribution of tropical tree species provide valuable insights for ecologists and forest management. The discrimination of tree species for economic, ecological, and technical reasons is usually necessary for achieving promising results in tree species mapping. Most of the data used in tree species mapping normally have some degree of imbalance. This study aimed to assess the effects of imbalanced data in identifying and mapping trees species under threat in a selectively logged sub-montane heterogeneous tropical forest using random forest (RF) and support vector machine with radial basis function (RBF-SVM) kernel classifiers and WorldView-2 multispectral imagery. For comparison purposes, the original imbalanced dataset was standardized using three data sampling techniques: oversampling, undersampling, and combined oversampling and undersampling techniques in R. The combined oversampling and undersampling technique produced the best results: F1-scores of 68.56 +/- 2.6% for RF and 64.64 +/- 3.4% for SVM. The balanced dataset recorded improved classification accuracy compared to the original imbalanced dataset. This research observed that more separable classes recorded higher F1-scores. Among the species, Syzygium guineense and Zanthoxylum gilletii were the most accurately mapped whereas Newtonia buchananii was the least accurately mapped. The most important spectral bands with the ability to detect and distinguish between tree species as measured by random forest classifier, were the Red, Red Edge, Near Infrared 1, and Near Infrared 2.

TI  - Measurements and Modeling of Optical-Equivalent Snow Grain Sizes under Arctic Low-Sun Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The size and shape of snow grains directly impacts the reflection by a snowpack. In this article, different approaches to retrieve the optical-equivalent snow grain size (ropt) or, alternatively, the specific surface area (SSA) using satellite, airborne, and ground-based observations are compared and used to evaluate ICON-ART (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic-Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) simulations. The retrieval methods are based on optical measurements and rely on the ropt-dependent absorption of solar radiation in snow. The measurement data were taken during a three-week campaign that was conducted in the North of Greenland in March/April 2018, such that the retrieval methods and radiation measurements are affected by enhanced uncertainties under these low-Sun conditions. An adjusted airborne retrieval method is applied which uses the albedo at 1700 nm wavelength and combines an atmospheric and snow radiative transfer model to account for the direct-to-global fraction of the solar radiation incident on the snow. From this approach, we achieved a significantly improved uncertainty (< 25%) and a reduced effect of atmospheric masking compared to the previous method. Ground-based in situ measurements indicated an increase of r(opt) of 15mum within a five-day period after a snowfall event which is small compared to previous observations under similar temperature regimes. ICON-ART captured the observed change of r(opt) during snowfall events, but systematically overestimated the subsequent snow grain growth by about 100%. Adjusting the growth rate factor to 0.012mum(2) s(-1) minimized the difference between model and observations. Satellite-based and airborne retrieval methods showed higher r(opt) over sea ice (< 300mum) than over land surfaces (< 100mum) which was reduced by data filtering of surface roughness features. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals revealed a large spread within a series of subsequent individual overpasses, indicating their limitations in observing the snow grain size evolution in early spring conditions with low Sun.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Digital Model of the Absheron Peninsula
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a digital terrain model of the Absheron Peninsula, Azerbaijan, produced to optimize the use of its natural resources. This dynamically developing region requires a geographically distributed information system accumulating expert knowledge and geospatial information of various levels. The main idea is to integrate diverse data in a single information space: vector layers of varying scale and thematic content, satellite data, cartographic materials, and ground survey data. To ensure quick access to the information, all data are classified by scale and theme and presented in a single cartographic projection in the Geodatabase. The creation of a single information space reduces the amount of computation and data processing time required to produce new thematic materials based on the incoming satellite information. Furthermore, it significantly facilitates the processing and interpretation of remote sensing data. Data management tools embedded in geographic information systems ensure the interconnection of data.

TI  - A Synergic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery for Complex Wetland Classification Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Scheme
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to anthropogenic activities and climate change, many natural ecosystems, especially wetlands, are lost or changing at a rapid pace. For the last decade, there has been increasing attention towards developing new tools and methods for the mapping and classification of wetlands using remote sensing. At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly deep learning models, have provided opportunities to advance wetland classification methods. However, the developed deep and very deep algorithms require a higher number of training samples, which is costly, logistically demanding, and time-consuming. As such, in this study, we propose a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that uses a modified architecture of the well-known DCNN of the AlexNet and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation and classification of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Applying to an area of approximately 370 sq. km in the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, the proposed model with an average accuracy of 92.30% resulted in F-1 scores of 0.82, 0.85, 0.87, 0.89, and 0.95 for the recognition of swamp, fen, marsh, bog, and shallow water, respectively. Moreover, the proposed DCNN model improved the F-1 score of bog, marsh, fen, and swamp wetland classes by 4%, 8%, 11%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the original CNN network of AlexNet. These results reveal that the proposed model is highly capable of the generation and classification of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 wetland samples and can be used for large-extent classification problems.

TI  - The 2019-2020 Khalili (Iran) Earthquake Sequence-Anthropogenic Seismicity in the Zagros Simply Folded Belt?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the origin of a long-lived earthquake cluster in the Fars arc of the Zagros Simply Folded Belt that is colocated with the major Shanul natural gas field. The cluster emerged in January 2019 and initially comprised small events of M-n similar to 3-4. It culminated on 9 June 2020 with a pair of M-w 5.4 and 5.7 earthquakes, which was followed by >100 aftershocks. We assess the spatiotemporal evolution of the earthquake sequence using multiple event hypocenter relocations, waveform inversions, and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements and models. We find that the early part of the sequence is spatially distinct from the 9 June 2020 earthquakes and their aftershocks. Moment tensors, centroid depths, and source parameter uncertainties of 15 of the largest (M-n >= 4.0) events show that the sequence is dominated by reverse faulting at shallow depths (mostly <= 4 km) within the sedimentary cover. InSAR modeling shows that the M-w 5.7 mainshock occurred at depths of 2-8 km with a rupture length and maximum slip of similar to 20 km and similar to 0.5 m, respectively. Our results suggest that the 2019-2020 Khalili earthquake sequence was likely influenced by operation of the Shanul field, though elevated natural seismicity in the Zagros makes the association difficult to prove. Understanding how to distinguish man-made from natural seismicity is helpful for hazard and risk assessment, notably in the Zagros, which is both seismically active and rich in oil and gas reserves.Plain Language Summary Earthquakes caused by human activities have been documented in a growing number of regions worldwide, but recognizing these events in areas of naturally elevated seismicity remains challenging. We investigate the origin of a long-lived earthquake cluster in the Fars arc of the Zagros Simply Folded Belt-one of the world's most seismically active mountain belts-that is colocated with a major natural gas field. The seismicity led to public concern and speculation that nearby natural gas extraction was responsible for the seismicity. We assess the spatiotemporal evolution of the earthquake sequence using satellite geodesy and seismology measurements and models. Our results support these being anthropogenic earthquakes, most probably related to operations in the gas field. We suggest that the exploitation of the reservoirs in Iran should be preceded by risk assessment studies and accompanied by the implementation of dedicated, sophisticated monitoring, which would allow seismicity to be detected early and tracked more closely.

TI  - MDPrePost-Net: A Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Fully Convolutional Network for Mapping of Mangrove Degradation Affected by Hurricane Irma 2017 Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are grown in intertidal zones along tropical and subtropical climate areas, which have many benefits for humans and ecosystems. The knowledge of mangrove conditions is essential to know the statuses of mangroves. Recently, satellite imagery has been widely used to generate mangrove and degradation mapping. Sentinel-2 is a volume of free satellite image data that has a temporal resolution of 5 days. When Hurricane Irma hit the southwest Florida coastal zone in 2017, it caused mangrove degradation. The relationship of satellite images between pre and post-hurricane events can provide a deeper understanding of the degraded mangrove areas that were affected by Hurricane Irma. This study proposed an MDPrePost-Net that considers images before and after hurricanes to classify non-mangrove, intact/healthy mangroves, and degraded mangroves classes affected by Hurricane Irma in southwest Florida using Sentinel-2 data. MDPrePost-Net is an end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) that consists of two main sub-models. The first sub-model is a pre-post deep feature extractor used to extract the spatial-spectral-temporal relationship between the pre, post, and mangrove conditions after the hurricane from the satellite images and the second sub-model is an FCN classifier as the classification part from extracted spatial-spectral-temporal deep features. Experimental results show that the accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU) score by the proposed MDPrePost-Net for degraded mangrove are 98.25% and 96.82%, respectively. Based on the experimental results, MDPrePost-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art FCN models (e.g., U-Net, LinkNet, FPN, and FC-DenseNet) in terms of accuracy metrics. In addition, this study found that 26.64% (41,008.66 Ha) of the mangrove area was degraded due to Hurricane Irma along the southwest Florida coastal zone and the other 73.36% (112,924.70 Ha) mangrove area remained intact.

TI  - Whirling disease in the Crowsnest River: an emerging threat to wild salmonids in Alberta
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide the first documented case of whirling disease (WD) impacts to wild, self-sustaining rainbow trout (RNTR, Oncorynchus mykiss) populations in Canada. Myxobolus cerebralis (Mc), the causative agent of WD, was first confirmed in Alberta in 2016. However, evidence of disease in local fish populations was unknown. Using a weight-of-evidence approach, we examined multiple parasite life cycle stages in the Crowsnest River, Alberta. Percentage of infected Tubifex tubifex worms actively shedding triactinomyxons (TAMS) exceeded known thresholds of Mc establishment and TAM densities instream exceeded thresholds known to cause >= 90% declines in RNTR populations. Mc was detected at 5 of 6 study sites in water, fish, and worms. Disease severity was highest in the lower watershed where 100% of sentinel fish tested positive for Mc 7 to 14 days post-exposure; up to 85% of wild fingerling RNTR showed clinical signs of disease and yearling trout were largely absent from the river suggesting reduced survival. Our findings indicate conditions necessary for outbreak of WD exist in Alberta, highlighting the need to consider this disease as an emerging threat to wild salmonid populations.

TI  - Trends in Breast Cancer Mortality Between 2001 and 2017: An Observational Study in the European Union and the United Kingdom
T2  - JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, representing 25.4% of the newly diagnosed cases in 2018. The past two decades have seen advancements in screening technologies, guidelines, and newer modalities of treatment. Our study reports and compares trends in breast cancer mortality in the European Union and the United Kingdom.MATERIALS AND METHODS We used the WHO Mortality Database. We extracted breast cancer mortality data from 2001 to 2017 on the basis of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision system. Crude mortality rates were dichotomized by sex and reported by year. We computed age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100,000 population using the world standard population. Breast cancer mortality trends were compared using joinpoint regression analysis.RESULTS We analyzed data from 24 EU countries, including the United Kingdom. For women, breast cancer mortality was observed to be downtrending in all countries except Croatia, France, and Poland. For the most recent female data, the highest ASDR for breast cancer was identified in Croatia (19.29 per 100,000), and the lowest ASDR was noted in Spain (12.8 per 100,000). Denmark had the highest change in ASDR and the highest estimated annual percentage change of -3.2%. For men, breast cancer mortality decreased in 18 countries, with the largest relative reduction observed in Denmark with an estimated annual percentage change of -27.5%. For the most recent male data, the highest ASDR for breast cancer was identified in Latvia (0.54 per 100,000).CONCLUSION Breast cancer mortality rates have down trended in most EU countries between 2001 and 2017 for both men and women. Given the observational nature of this study, causality to the observed trends cannot be reliably ascribed. However, possible contributing factors should be considered and subject to further study.

TI  - Observation of Ground Subsidence in Bangkok, Thailand Using PSInSAR Technique
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bangkok, Thailand, there is an increasing concern for ground subsidence with the rapid urbanization. Given the presence of flood vulnerability due to the flat low-lying topography and proximity to the river delta, it is particularly significant to monitor deformation that can potentially augment flood hazards. In this paper, we have applied persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) technique to investigate subsidence in Bangkok with the use of Sentinel-1 acquisitions spanning from June 2018 to October 2021. The vertical displacement velocity obtained from both ascending and descending orbits revealed regional-scale subsidence at rates up to 30 mm/yr. In addition, ongoing subsidence was observed in the suburb areas with the localized vertical subsidence exceeding 80 mm. The areas are primarily industrial and agricultural sectors, thus, the ground subsidence detected is probably caused by groundwater withdrawal. However, further work is needed to diagnose the trends of aquifer resources.

TI  - Investigating ocean surface responses to typhoons using reconstructed satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the cloud blocking, the research on the responses of upper ocean to typhoons using satellite data is greatly affected. At present, most of the solutions are based on lower time resolution data or composite satellite data. In this paper, multi-source satellite data were fused by weighted average method and reconstructed through the Data INterpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder method (DINCAE) and used to investigate daily sea surface responses to typhoons. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between the reconstructed data and the cross validation data for SST and CHL was only 1.093 degrees C and 0.7833 mg/m(3). Three response patterns were reported over the East China Sea (ECS). The first one was that both SST and CHL have significant changes, the second was that only SST changes a lot, and the third one was only CHL changes significantly after typhoons. Moreover, it was found that, after some typhoons, the SST or CHL had a wide range of changes, but the amount of changes is not large. The different responses were related to the wind speed and moving speed of typhoons. In addition, when two typhoons pass by successively, although the wind speed is low, the sea surface would have significant responses. Further, areas of significant SST drops coincide with negative sea level anomaly (SLA) fields in some typhoon tracks. SST drops to its minimum level 2 days after the arrival of a typhoon and returns to its previous level 15 days after the arrival. CHL keeps increasing until 4 days after the typhoon's passage, and then drops to its initial level around 10 days after the passage. The responses of SST and CHL decrease with distance, with prominent changes occurring within 100 km of the typhoon's center.

TI  - Modeling Tumor: Lymphatic Interactions in Lymphatic Metastasis of Triple Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Lymphatic metastasis is a critical prognostic factor of breast cancer aggressiveness and patient survival. Since existing therapeutic approaches have shown limited efficacy, new strategies to identify effective therapeutic targets for reducing breast cancer lymphatic metastasis are needed. We have used novel culture chambers, designed and fabricated by our group, to develop 3D models in which we can study spat ial interactions between breast cancer cells and lymphatic cells as they occur in real-time. This approach provides information on the complex cell-cell interactions involved in lymphatic metastasis of breast cancers. Factors in the secretome of the lymphatic cells promote invasive outgrowths from 3D cultures of breast cancer cells, suggesting that targeting interactions between breast cancer cells and lymphatic cells could be a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention of lymphatic metastasis. Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to lymphatics and the presence of breast cancer cells in regional lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor. Delineating the mechanisms by which breast cancer cells disseminate and spatiotemporal aspects of interactions between breast cancer cells and lymphatics is needed to design new therapies to prevent lymphatic metastases. As triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a high incidence of lymphatic metastasis, we used a three-dimensional (3D) coculture model of human TNBC cells and human microvascular lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to analyze TNBC:LEC interactions. Non-invasive analyses such as live-cell imaging in real-time and collection of conditioned media for secretomic analysis were facilitated by our novel microfluidic chambers. The volumes of 3D structures formed in TNBC:LEC cocultures are greater than that of 3D structures formed by either LEC or TNBC monocultures. Over 4 days of culture there is an increase in multicellular invasive outgrowths from TNBC spheroids and an association of TNBC spheroids with LEC networks. The increase in invasive phenotype also occurred when TNBC spheroids were cultured in LEC-conditioned media and in wells linked to ones containing LEC networks. Our results suggest that modeling spatiotemporal interactions between TNBC and LECs may reveal paracrine signaling that could be targeted to reduce lymphatic metastasis.

TI  - Influences of Deep-Water Seamounts on the Hydrodynamic Environment in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of seamounts impacts the ocean's hydrodynamic environment. A 5-year numerical simulation is conducted over the Northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO) to investigate the influence of seamounts. The results are validated against satellite remote sensing data and in-situ measurements. Sensitivity experiments show that the presence of seamounts increases the complexity of the flow field, leading to enhanced relative vorticity, divergence, and strain rate. Additionally, eddy activity is enhanced while eddy propagation is suppressed. Five main physical processes that affect the hydrodynamic environment are examined around the Caiwei (CS), Weijia (WS) and Niulang (NS) seamounts. (a) Seamount-induced negative vorticities are found above the three seamounts most of the time and extend to about 600 m above the summit of the seamounts; (b) density fronts, a few kilometers in width, are present in the bottom boundary layer of the three seamounts, with accompanying jets occurring at the same locations; (c) seamount-induced topographic Rossby waves (TRWs) signals are extracted when a 7- to 10-day band-pass filter is applied to the temperature and velocity anomaly fields around CS (WS and NS) at 5,350 m (5,350 m and 4,500 m); (d) seamount-eddy interactions result in abundant eddies generated and trapped around the three seamounts; and (e) lee waves are found at the three seamounts. The systematic discussion of these physical processes near the deep seamounts provides a new understanding of how these processes enhance biological connectivity among seamounts.

TI  - Evaluations of Remote Sensing-Based Global Evapotranspiration Datasets at Catchment Scale in Mountain Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for connecting ecosystems and directly affects the water consumption of forests, grasslands, and farmlands. Eight global remote sensing-based ET (RS_ET) datasets generated using satellite imagery and ground-based observations were comprehensively assessed using monthly ET time series simulated by the water balance (WB) method at the catchment scale in the Hengduan Mountain (HDM) region, including the Nu River, Lancang River, and Jinsha River basins. The complementary relationship (CR) model, which derives ET from meteorological data, was also evaluated against WB-based ET (WB_ET). In addition, WB_ET, RS_ET, and CR-based ET (CR_ET) data were used to investigate ET spatial and temporal variations at the catchment, grid, and site scale, respectively. Most RS_ET datasets accurately simulated monthly ET with an average index of agreement ranging from 0.71-0.91. The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance dataset outperformed other RS_ET datasets, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and Kling-Gupta efficiency values of 0.80 and 0.90, respectively. RS_ET datasets generally performed better in northern semiarid areas than in humid southern areas. The monthly ET simulation by the CR model was consistent with that of the WB_ET in the HDM region, with mean values of correlation coefficient (cc) and NSE at each site of 0.89 and 0.68, respectively. The model showed better performance in simulating monthly ET in the Lancang River Basin than in the Nu River and Lancang River basins, with mean cc and NSE of 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. Generally, annual ET trends were consistent at the catchment, grid, and site scale, as estimated by the WB method, RS_ET datasets, and CR model. It showed a significant decreasing trend in the northern semiarid region of the HDM while exhibiting an increasing trend in the humid southern region.

TI  - Comparison of Different Analytical Strategies for Classifying Invasive Wetland Vegetation in Imagery from Unpiloted Aerial Systems (UAS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting newly established invasive plants is key to prevent further spread. Traditional field surveys are challenging and often insufficient to identify the presence and extent of invasions. This is particularly true for wetland ecosystems because of difficult access, and because floating and submergent plants may go undetected in the understory of emergent plants. Unpiloted aerial systems (UAS) have the potential to revolutionize how we monitor invasive vegetation in wetlands, but key components of the data collection and analysis workflow have not been defined. In this study, we conducted a rigorous comparison of different methodologies for mapping invasive Emergent (Typha x glauca (cattail)), Floating (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae (European frogbit)), and Submergent species (Chara spp. and Elodea canadensis) using the machine learning classifier, random forest, in a Great Lakes wetland. We compared accuracies using (a) different spatial resolutions (11 cm pixels vs. 3 cm pixels), (b) two classification approaches (pixel- vs. object-based), and (c) including structural measurements (e.g., surface/canopy height models and rugosity as textural metrics). Surprisingly, the coarser resolution (11 cm) data yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 81.4%, 2.5% higher than the best performing model of the finer (3 cm) resolution data. Similarly, the Mean Area Under the Receiving Operations Characteristics Curve (AUROC) and F1 Score from the 11 cm data yielded 15.2%, and 6.5% higher scores, respectively, than those in the 3 cm data. At each spatial resolution, the top performing models were from pixel-based approaches and included surface model data over those with canopy height or multispectral data alone. Overall, high-resolution maps generated from UAS classifications will enable early detection and control of invasive plants. Our workflow is likely applicable to other wetland ecosystems threatened by invasive plants throughout the globe.

T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of Thailand's most common catastrophes and causes a considerable amount of damage, especially to farming, in the northeast of the country. The objective of this study is to analyze vegetation drought variability from a vegetation phenology perspective using the vegetation condition index (VCI) from Terra/MODIS satellite data in the middle of the northeast region of Thailand .The MOD09A1 dataset from Terra/MODIS satellites was analyzed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the results were analyzed with the VCI to examine vegetation drought variability in July, August, and September 2009-2019. The study found that in August 2013, the drought was most severe and accounted for 47.71% coverage (22,456.76 km(2)), and in September 2013, the drought was the least severe at 55.55% coverage (17,456.42 km(2)) Moreover, using simple linear regression analysis, the VCI results for each month of the 11-year period were used to fmd the statistical correlation with rainfall data from ground monitoring stations. It found that July, August, and September showed a coefficient of determination (r(2)) equal to 0.835, 0.834, and 0.849, respectively. The r(2) value showed that this method was reliable. Furthermore, the analyzed VCI averages can be used as a very good indicator of drought in the middle of the northeast region of Thailand.

TI  - Multi-Dimensional Remote Sensing Analysis Documents Beaver-Induced Permafrost Degradation, Seward Peninsula, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beavers have established themselves as a key component of low arctic ecosystems over the past several decades. Beavers are widely recognized as ecosystem engineers, but their effects on permafrost-dominated landscapes in the Arctic remain unclear. In this study, we document the occurrence, reconstruct the timing, and highlight the effects of beaver activity on a small creek valley confined by ice-rich permafrost on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska using multi-dimensional remote sensing analysis of satellite (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Planet CubeSat, and DigitalGlobe Inc./MAXAR) and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) imagery. Beaver activity along the study reach of Swan Lake Creek appeared between 2006 and 2011 with the construction of three dams. Between 2011 and 2017, beaver dam numbers increased, with the peak occurring in 2017 (n = 9). Between 2017 and 2019, the number of dams decreased (n = 6), while the average length of the dams increased from 20 to 33 m. Between 4 and 20 August 2019, following a nine-day period of record rainfall (>125 mm), the well-established dam system failed, triggering the formation of a beaver-induced permafrost degradation feature. During the decade of beaver occupation between 2011 and 2021, the creek valley widened from 33 to 180 m (~450% increase) and the length of the stream channel network increased from ~0.6 km to more than 1.9 km (220% increase) as a result of beaver engineering and beaver-induced permafrost degradation. Comparing vegetation (NDVI) and snow (NDSI) derived indices from Sentinel-2 time-series data acquired between 2017 and 2021 for the beaver-induced permafrost degradation feature and a nearby unaffected control site, showed that peak growing season NDVI was lowered by 23% and that it extended the length of the snow-cover period by 19 days following the permafrost disturbance. Our analysis of multi-dimensional remote sensing data highlights several unique aspects of beaver engineering impacts on ice-rich permafrost landscapes. Our detailed reconstruction of the beaver-induced permafrost degradation event may also prove useful for identifying degradation of ice-rich permafrost in optical time-series datasets across regional scales. Future field- and remote sensing-based observations of this site, and others like it, will provide valuable information for the NSF-funded Arctic Beaver Observation Network (A-BON) and the third phase of the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Field Campaign.

TI  - Evaluating Image Normalization via GANs for Environmental Mapping: A Case Study of Lichen Mapping Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Illumination variations in non-atmospherically corrected high-resolution satellite (HRS) images acquired at different dates/times/locations pose a major challenge for large-area environmental mapping and monitoring. This problem is exacerbated in cases where a classification model is trained only on one image (and often limited training data) but applied to other scenes without collecting additional samples from these new images. In this research, by focusing on caribou lichen mapping, we evaluated the potential of using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for the normalization of WorldView-2 (WV2) images of one area to a source WV2 image of another area on which a lichen detector model was trained. In this regard, we considered an extreme case where the classifier was not fine-tuned on the normalized images. We tested two main scenarios to normalize four target WV2 images to a source 50 cm pansharpened WV2 image: (1) normalizing based only on the WV2 panchromatic band, and (2) normalizing based on the WV2 panchromatic band and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance (SR) imagery. Our experiments showed that normalizing even based only on the WV2 panchromatic band led to a significant lichen-detection accuracy improvement compared to the use of original pansharpened target images. However, we found that conditioning the cGAN on both the WV2 panchromatic band and auxiliary information (in this case, Sentinel-2 SR imagery) further improved normalization and the subsequent classification results due to adding a more invariant source of information. Our experiments showed that, using only the panchromatic band, F1-score values ranged from 54% to 88%, while using the fused panchromatic and SR, F1-score values ranged from 75% to 91%.

TI  - Monitoring of a Time-series of Land Subsidence in Mexico City Using Space-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Observations
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities and natural processes have been causes of land subsidence which is sudden sinking or gradual settlement of the earth's solid surface. Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, is one of the most severe land subsidence areas which are resulted from excessive groundwater extraction. Because groundwater is the primary water resource occupies almost 70% of total water usage in the city. Traditional terrestrial observations like the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or leveling survey have been preferred to measure land subsidence accurately. Although the GNSS observations have highly accurate information of the surfaces' displacement with a very high temporal resolution, it has often been limited due to its sparse spatial resolution and highly time-consuming and high cost. However, space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry has been widely used as a powerful tool to monitor surfaces' displacement with high spatial resolution and high accuracy from mm to cm-scale, regardless of day-or-night and weather conditions. In this paper, advanced interferometric approaches have been applied to get a time-series of land subsidence of Mexico City using four-year-long twenty ALOS PALSAR L-band observations acquired from Feb-11, 2007 to Feb22, 2011. We utilized persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) and small baseline subset (SBAS) techniques to suppress atmospheric artifacts and topography errors. The results show that the maximum subsidence rates of the PSI and SBAS method were -29.5 cm/year and -27.0 cm/year, respectively. In addition, we discuss the different subsidence rates where the study area is discriminated into three districts according to distinctive geotechnical characteristics. The significant subsidence rate occurred in the lacustrine sediments with higher compressibility than harder bedrock.

TI  - Fusing Sentinel-1 and-2 to Model GEDI-Derived Vegetation Structure Characteristics in GEE for the Paraguayan Chaco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation structure is a key component in assessing habitat quality for wildlife and carbon storage capacity of forests. Studies conducted at global scale demonstrate the increasing pressure of the agricultural frontier on tropical forest, endangering their continuity and biodiversity within. The Paraguayan Chaco has been identified as one of the regions with the highest rate of deforestation in South America. Uninterrupted deforestation activities over the last 30 years have resulted in the loss of 27% of its original cover. The present study focuses on the assessment of vegetation structure characteristics for the complete Paraguayan Chaco by fusing Sentinel-1, -2 and novel spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) samples from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). The large study area (240,000 km(2)) calls for a workflow in the cloud computing environment of Google Earth Engine (GEE) which efficiently processes the multi-temporal and multi-sensor data sets for extrapolation in a tile-based random forest (RF) regression model. GEDI-derived attributes of vegetation structure are available since December 2019, opening novel research perspectives to assess vegetation structure composition in remote areas and at large-scale. Therefore, the combination of global mapping missions, such as Landsat and Sentinel, are predestined to be combined with GEDI data, in order to identify priority areas for nature conservation. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of the vegetation structure of the Paraguayan Chaco has not been conducted yet. For that reason, the present methodology was developed to generate the first high-resolution maps (10 m) of canopy height, total canopy cover, Plant-Area-Index and Foliage-Height-Diversity-Index. The complex ecosystems of the Paraguayan Chaco ranging from arid to humid climates can be described by canopy height values from 1.8 to 17.6 m and canopy covers from sparse to dense (total canopy cover: 0 to 78.1%). Model accuracy according to median R-2 amounts to 64.0% for canopy height, 61.4% for total canopy cover, 50.6% for Plant-Area-Index and 48.0% for Foliage-Height-Diversity-Index. The generated maps of vegetation structure should promote environmental-sound land use and conservation strategies in the Paraguayan Chaco, to meet the challenges of expanding agricultural fields and increasing demand of cattle ranching products, which are dominant drivers of tropical forest loss.

TI  - Deep Learning Spatial-Spectral Classification of Remote Sensing Images by Applying Morphology-Based Differential Extinction Profile (DEP)
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the technology of remote sensing has been improved recently, the spatial resolution of satellite images is getting finer. This enables us to precisely analyze the small complex objects in a scene through remote sensing images. Thus, the need to develop new, efficient algorithms like spatial-spectral classification methods is growing. One of the most successful approaches is based on extinction profile (EP), which can extract contextual information from remote sensing data. Moreover, deep learning classifiers have drawn attention in the remote sensing community in the past few years. Recent progress has shown the effectiveness of deep learning at solving different problems, particularly segmentation tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach based on a new concept, which is differential extinction profile (DEP). DEP makes it possible to have an input feature vector with both spectral and spatial information. The input vector is then fed into a proposed straightforward deep-learning-based classifier to produce a thematic map. The approach is carried out on two different urban datasets from Pleiades and World-View 2 satellites. In order to prove the capabilities of the suggested approach, we compare the final results to the results of other classification strategies with different input vectors and various types of common classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF). It can be concluded that the proposed approach is significantly improved in terms of three kinds of criteria, which are overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and total disagreement.

TI  - The effects of diagnosis-related groups payment on efficiency of the hospital health care in Croatia
T2  - CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To assess the impact of Croatian reforms related to the funding of inpatient care on the efficiency of acute hospitals. Methods Between 2009 and 2018, the study analyzed resourcing, performance, and financing data for 33 acute hospitals. It used data from the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (CHIF) and the Croatian Institute of Public Health and included hospital activity and diagnosis-related grouping; average length of stay (ALOS); hospital staffing; CHIF rev-enue streams; and hospital incomes and expenditures. Results During the study period, the cost-efficiency of Croatian public hospitals did not meaningfully improve. While ALOS decreased by 14% and the number of beds decreased by 12%, bed occupancy rates decreased by 9%, acute inpatient admissions by 5%, and diagnosis-related group (DRG)-weighted output by 16%. Hospitals operat-ed at higher costs, as the average cost per DRG-weighted case increased by 17%, from HRK 11 828 in 2016, to HRK 13 897 in 2018. Conclusions In this period, Croatian reforms failed to im-prove hospital efficiency. This may be explained by the failure of reformers to heed the experience of other coun-tries, which showed that hospital payment reform of this nature calls for systematic and coordinated actions, inter -agency collaboration, and a strategic approach where the various interventions are in congruence and act to rein -force one another.

T2  - ECUMENICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - While many scholars conclude that increased artistic contact between religions facilitates cross-cultural interaction, their analysis stops there. This paper aims to demonstrate the artistic gap in modern interreligious dialogue. To combat the lack of specificity of different art forms' impact, the paper considers how dance, by communicating values through the physical human body, is an artistic mode of dialogue. Dance in Hinduism, in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in nondenominational Christianity is examined regarding their scriptural and socio-cultural expression. Given dance's multicultural presence, modern scholars need to increase publications that analyze this art's impact on interreligious dialogue.

TI  - Impacts of Sea Temperature Rise on <i>Rastrelliger kanagurta</i> Potential Fishing Grounds in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off South China Sea
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) is one of the most commercially crucial epipelagic scombrid where it is caught in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the South China Sea (SCS). High demand forfisheries resources is a challenge for fishers to achieve optimal fish landing targets. By using R. kanagurta catch data, and high resolution satellite data of chl-a and SST (MODIS-Aqua) and SSH (AVISO) from 2018 together with boosted regression tree (BRT) model, this study aims to determine the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) increase on the potential catch of R. kana gurta based on temperature projection of IPCC-AR5-RCPs scenarios. BRT modelling result indicated that during the northeast monsoon (NEM), at elevated temperature of 1.80 and 2.60 degrees C showed that the potential fishing grounds of R. kana gurta increase in the area especially in the northern part of the EEZ. However, at elevated temperature of 3.30 degrees C, the potential fishing areas was found to decrease along the coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Meanwhile, during southwest monsoon (SIVM) and inter-monsoon transition, at temperature rise of 1.80, 2.60 and 3.30 degrees C showed a significant reduction in the potential fishing area of the R. kanagurta potential fishing grounds especially along the coast of the EEZ off SCS. Results indicated that changes in SST influenced suitability of habitat which affected the distribution of R. kana gurta. Understanding the impacts of temperature increase would contribute towards future sustainable fisheries resource management strategies.

TI  - Utilization of Landsat-8 data for lithological mapping of neoproterozoic basement rocks in north Qena-Safaga road, North Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping an area accurately with semi-variable lithological units of basement rocks is challenging. Although freeof-charge remote sensing data have boosted the lithological mapping studies, the accuracy and validation of the results are still questionable. This work aims to combine remote sensing techniques and petrographical studies with field investigation in order to discriminate the basement rocks at a part of the Arabian Nubian Shield (ANS) near Al-Baroud area, North Eastern Desert of Egypt. The lithological units in the study area were successfully discriminated based on their spectral characteristics. Several processing techniques on Landsat-8 images were applied, such as MNF (3, 2, and 1), FCC (7, 6, and 5), and (7, 5, and 1), and PCA (PC1, PC2, and PC3) and (PC2, PC1, and PC4), in addition to three composite band ratios (6/7, 5/6, and 4/2), (5/7, 6/4x7, and 5/1), and (7/ 5x3, 6/4x7, and 5/3x4), with the aid of supervised and unsupervised classifications. The results reveal that the rock units in the study area belong to the Late Cryogenian-Ediacaran magmatism of East African Orogeny (EAO). The core idea of this work is to combine several remote sensing techniques with petrographical study and field investigation to provide an innovative and integrated methodology to discriminate the ANS basement rocks, which can be applied elsewhere in similar territories.

TI  - Shoreline change along Odisha coast using statistical and geo-spatial techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The historical shoreline change from 1978 to 2017 along Odisha coast are studied using toposheet, time-series Landsat, Indian Remote Sensing satellite data, and observed data. Shoreline change at south Odisha coast, Puri, Konark, Paradip and Pentha at different epochs (3-12 yrs) during 1978-2017 shows distinct spatio-temporal variability, which is discussed in relation to cyclonic storms and coastal structures associated with ports and harbours. The study also generated a long-term (1978-2017) shoreline change statistics (EPR, LRR, SCE and NSM) using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) at every 500 m interval for the five zones of Odisha coast covering 425 km, identified the hotspots of erosion and accretion and divided the shoreline into five different classes of erosion and accretion. Identified lengths of shoreline with high erosion, low erosion, stable, low accretion and high accretion are respectively, 257.1, 92.2, 25.5, 10.2 and 40 km, based on LRR. The results indicate that erosion is predominant along Odisha coast. Zone-D (Paradip to Pentha) with highest percentage of high erosion is most vulnerable, while Zone-E (Pentha-Balasore) with highest percentage of accretion is least vulnerable. Zone-B (Chilika to Konark) with lowest percentage of high erosion and no high accretion is stable.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - This audit describes the lymphatic flow from oral tumours seen on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) to help sentinel node (SN) identification. A total of 95 consecutive sentinel node biopsies (SNB) were taken between 2010 and 2019. Eligibility criteria for SNB were patients over 18 years of age with a T-1 -T-2 oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and an No neck. SNs collect at high-frequency sites irrespective of the primary tumour (22.7% level Ib; 64.8% levels II/III; and 7.6% level IV), but with individual variation. Radiotracer activity did not influence the number of nodes identified, and metastatic deposits were found in the hottest nodes. SNs occur at the same high-frequency locations in the neck, so familiarity with anatomical detail may reduce false-negative results.

TI  - Analysis of Vegetative Cover Vulnerability in Rohingya Refugee Camps of Bangladesh Utilizing Landsat and Per Capita Greening Area (PCGA) Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetative cover in and surrounding the Rohingya refugee camps in Ukhiya-Teknaf is highly vulnerable since millions of refugees moved into the area, which led to severe environmental degradation. In this research, we used a supervised image classification technique to quantify the vegetative cover changes both in Ukhiya-Teknaf and thirty-four refugee camps in three time-steps: one pre-refugee crisis (January 2017), and two post-refugee crisis (March 2018, and February 2019), in order to identify the factors behind the decline in vegetative cover. The vegetative cover vulnerability of the thirty-four refugee camps was assessed using the Per Capita Greening Area (PCGA) datasets and K-means classification techniques. The satellite-based monitoring result affirms a massive loss of vegetative cover, approximately 5482.2 hectares (14%), in Ukhiya-Teknaf and 1502.56 hectares (79.57%) among the thirty-four refugee camps, between 2017 and 2019. K-means classification revealed that the vegetative cover in about 82% of the refugee camps is highly vulnerable. In the end, a recommendation as to establishing the studied region as an ecological park is proposed and some guidelines discussed. This could protect and reserve forests from further deforestation in the area, and foster future discussion among policymakers and researchers.

TI  - Development of A Spatiotemporal Database for Evolution Analysis of the Moscow Backbone Power Grid
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently in the field of transport geography, the spatial evolution of electrical networks remain globally understudied. Publicly available data sources, including remote sensing data, have made it possible to collect spatial data on electrical networks, but at the same time a suitable data structure for storing them has not been defined. The main purpose of this study was the collection and structuring of spatiotemporal data on electric networks with the possibility of their further processing and analysis. To collect data, we used publicly available remote sensing and geoinformation systems, archival schemes and maps, as well as other documents related to the Moscow power grid. Additionally, we developed a web service for data publication and visualization. We conducted a small morphological analysis of the evolution of the network to show the possibilities of working with the database using a Python script. For example, we found that the portion of new lines has been declining since 1950s and in the 2010s the portion of partial reconstruction reached its maximum. Thus, the developed data structure and the database itself provide ample opportunities for the analysis and interpretation of the spatiotemporal development of electric networks. This can be used as a basis to study other territories. The main results of the study are published on the web service where the user can interactively choose a year and two forms of power lines representation to visualize on a map.

M3  - Article
AB  - The authors, based on the publications of the journal "Russkoe bogatstvo", consider the views and assessments of legal-populist authors on the problems of parliamentarism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Great Britain, France, Germany and Austria-Hungary.The study of the experience of Western parliamentarism by representatives of the socio-political thought of Russia is intensified at the beginning of the loth century in connection with the formation of a multi-party system and a Duma monarchy in our country. The publicists of "Russkoe bogatstvo" considered it useful to use the experience of this experience in the process of forming a constitutional state in Russia that guarantees civil and political human rights. The legal-populist authors called for taking into account and adopting the positive experience of Western states, the political structure of which provided the working people within the framework of the existing system with real opportunities to defend their economic, political, ethnic interests and raise the standard of living. This was a typical point of view of the reformist populists, whose worldview contained both socialist and liberal elements. The experience of parliamentarism in Great Britain and France seemed to them more valuable in comparison with the experience of Austria-Hungary and Germany.The publicists of "Russkoe bogatstvo" were close to an objective assessment of the realities of the social and political life of Western countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and led their readers to the idea that the main direction of the state's development should be progressive, consist of socio-economic and political legal, not revolutionary transformations.The study shows that the study of the ideas of parliamentarism by legal populists still has its relevance from a practical and scientific point of view.

TI  - Automated classification of heat sources detected using SWIR remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of shortwave infrared (SWIR) remote sensing to detect hotspots has been investigated using satellite data for decades. The hotspots detected by satellite SWIR sensors include very high-temperature heat sources such as wildfires, volcanoes, industrial activity, or open burning. This study proposes an automated classification method of heat source detected utilizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. We created training data of heat sources via visual inspection of hotspots detected by Landsat 8. A scheme to classify heat sources for daytime data was developed by combining classification methods based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm utilizing spatial features and a decision tree algorithm based on thematic land-cover information and our time series detection record. Validation work using 10,959 classification results corresponding to hotspots acquired from May 2017 to July 2019 indicated that the two classification results were in 79.7% agreement. For hotspots where the two classification schemes agreed, the classification was 97.9% accurate. Even when the results of the two classification schemes conflicted, either was correct in 73% of the samples. To improve the accuracy, the heat source category was re-allocated to the most probable category corresponding to the combination of the results from the two methods. Integrating the two approaches achieved an overall accuracy of 92.8%. In contrast, the overall accuracy for heat source classification during nighttime reached 79.3% because only the decision tree-based classification was applicable to limited available data. Comparison with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire product revealed that, despite the limited data acquisition frequency of Landsat 8, regional tendencies in hotspot occurrence were qualitatively appropriate for an annual period on a global scale.

TI  - Climate-Based Regionalization and Inclusion of Spectral Indices for Enhancing Transboundary Land-Use/Cover Classification Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land use and cover data are essential for effective land-use planning, hydrological modeling, and policy development. Since the Okavango Delta is a transboundary Ramsar site, managing natural resources within the Okavango Basin is undoubtedly a complex issue. It is often difficult to accurately map land use and cover using remote sensing in heterogeneous landscapes. This study investigates the combined value of climate-based regionalization and integration of spectral bands with spectral indices to enhance the accuracy of multi-temporal land use/cover classification using deep learning and machine learning approaches. Two experiments were set up, the first entailing the integration of spectral bands with spectral indices and the second involving the combined integration of spectral indices and climate-based regionalization based on Koppen-Geiger climate zones. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images, machine learning classifiers (random forest and extreme gradient boosting), and deep learning (neural network and deep neural network) classifiers were used in this study. Supervised classification using a total of 5140 samples was conducted for the years 1996, 2004, 2013, and 2020. Average overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were used to validate the results. The study found that the integration of spectral bands with indices improves the accuracy of land use/cover classification using machine learning and deep learning. Post-feature selection combinations yield higher accuracies in comparison to combinations of bands and indices. A combined integration of spectral indices with bands and climate-based regionalization did not significantly improve the accuracy of land use/cover classification consistently for all the classifiers (p < 0.05). However, post-feature selection combinations and climate-based regionalization significantly improved the accuracy for all classifiers investigated in this study. Findings of this study will improve the reliability of land use/cover monitoring in complex heterogeneous TDBs.

TI  - Open-Source Software Implementation and Validation of the Split-Window Method for Automated Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Landsat 8 Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An open software implementation of the algorithm for retrieving the land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 remote sensing satellite data is presented using the split-window algorithm, supplemented by a covariance-variational technique to modeling the water-vapor content in the atmosphere. The implementation also uses the Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method (SREM), a physical-based atmospheric correction method, and the FMASK cloud and cloud-shadow detection algorithm. All components of the complex algorithm are fully automated and do not require additional information, including external data on the state of the atmosphere. The implementation of the algorithm has been validated at various settings on the basis of ten ground stations in the United States that publish data on observations of the LST with a high time resolution; the average absolute error according to its results was 1.1 degrees C. The software component is developed in Python and is available in the public repository ; the source code is distributed under an open license.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses remote sensing technology and GIS technics for structural study of the Haut-Nkam divi-sion with the aim of mapping the lineaments that can significantly influence all geo-structures by iden-tifying major geological features and comes out with a new major structural map. Two methods are used: (i) the spatial reclassification of satellite images LANSAT 7 ETM + and 8 OLI/TIRS; and (ii) the application of band ratios. The confirmation of the structural features (faults, fractures and tectonic directions) is made by (i) a wide variety of digital image processing techniques such as (a) Composite bands and color composition filtrations; (b) Principal Component Analysis (PCA); (c) lineaments density map filtration: (ii) the superposition of the lineaments with the geological maps of each Subdivision and district of the study area. A total of 578 lineaments have been identified following the major directions of NE-SW, NNE-SSW, ENE-WSW, ESE-WNW and E-W with a total length of about 2273 km. These lengths vary from 38.11 to 128.08 km with an average length of 58.87 km. Major lineaments are identified in the six sub-divisions (Bana, Kekem, Bandja, Banka, Bakou, Bafang) and district (Bawa) of the Haut-Nkam division with a majority concentrated at Bakou followed by Bandja and finally Kekem. These major structural deformations identified which could be eminent faults, breakage, or tectonic direction, etc. .. could have hydrological or hydrogeological implications.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Exploring relationships among landownership, landscape diversity, and ecological productivity in Kentucky
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Kentucky has varied landscapes favorable for different land use land cover and agroecosystem management. The changes in land use land cover concerning a change in landownership structure can potentially alter landscape diversity and ecological productivity. This research examined the relationship among land cover, ownership structure (small, medium, and large parcel), and ecological productivity in Scott, Morgan, and Graves counties of Kentucky. Landsat 4-5 TM and 8 OLI (30-meter) imagery were used for supervised classification, accuracy assessment, and change detection at the pixel level in the years 2001, 2011, and 2016 for major land cover classes. The correlations in landscape diversity were analyzed using parcel data and thematic maps. Ecological productivity was estimated using the MODIS-NDVI 250 m, 16-day mean composite data along with parcel data. The change in land cover was primarily noticed in the cultivated crops and water, cultivated crops, and forest and pasture in Scott, Morgan, and Graves Counties, respectively. There was a strong negative correlation among agriculture, forest, and developed lands. The parcel size was significant (p < 0.05) for most of the land cover classes, but the relationships were not consistent in all combinations of year and counties. The ecological productivity was significantly different (p < 0.05) between small, medium, and large parcels. Further research is needed on other driving factors so that appropriate policy and decisions can be set for sustainable agroecosystem management.

TI  - Evaluating spectral indices for water bodies extraction in western Tibetan Plateau
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterbody extraction in the high-elevated region of the Tibetan Plateau from remote sensing imagery is an efficient way to investigate and monitor water resources. The intrusion of shadows, snow/ice, and other impediments are still unconvincing in cryospheric regions. Landsat 8 OLI images were used to extract water bodies by applying various spectral indices such as; Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI_sh), New Water Index (NWI), Water Ratio Index (WRI), and LST based Water Extraction Index (LBWEI). The result showed that the LBWEI index has high accuracy in all weather conditions from 93.66% to 97.63% and improved consistency around 3% to 7% as compared to other techniques. The study suggests the LBWEI technique may be used in the cryospheric region for quick evaluation and provide the baseline information for researchers in algorithm developments.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Alpine ecotone in the Siberian Mountains: vegetation response to warming
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Birch (Betula tortuosa) is one of the treeline forming species within the Siberian Mountains. We analysed the area dynamics of birch stands and the upslope climb of birch treeline based on the Landsat time series scenes and on-ground data. We found that since the warming onset (1970(th)) birch area increased by 10%, birch stands and treeline boundary were moving upslope with a rate of 1.4 m/yr and 4.0 m/yr. Birch upslope shift correlated with air temperatures at the beginning (May-June) and the end (August-October) of the growth period. Meanwhile, no correlation was found between birch upslope migration and precipitation. Winds negatively influenced both birch area growth and birch upslope climb during spring, fall, and wintertime. In the windy habitats, birch, together with larch and Siberian pine, formed clusters (hedges) which mitigated the influence of adverse winds. These clusters are the adaptive pattern for trees' upslope climb within windward slopes. The other adaptation to the harsh alpine ecotone habitat is non-leaf (bark) photosynthesis which supports tree survival. Thereby, Betula tortuosa upslope climb depends on the wind impact and warming in spring and fall that extended growth period. With ongoing warming and observed wind speed decrease on the background of sufficient precipitation, it is expected to further birch advance into alpine tundra in the Siberian Mountains.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term average values and anomalies of the duration of the period of positive temperatures and the total water-temperature value have been calculated using satellite data sets on the average daily temperature of the surface water layer for 2010-2020 in sites of traditional fishing for Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Salmon Bay and Busse Lagoon). The dependence of the shell size and total weight of Crassostrea gigas on temperature has been revealed. On the whole, the average values of its height and weight are much lower than the normal value in abnormally warm years and higher than the normal value in abnormally cold years. This may indicate that the oyster, as a temperate-latitude species, is tolerant to cold and moderate temperatures; however, it can hardly develop under conditions of long-term elevated temperatures. The exception is the weight of the mollusk in the Salmon Bay, where its weight is directly correlated with the total water-temperature value.

Therefore in this retrospective study, the usefulness of SLNB in thyroid carcinoma patients who had micro-PTC without cervical lymphadenopathy was assessed.Methods: SLNB was performed in 114 patients who were diagnosed with micro-PTC in a single lobe without palpable or ultrasound-detected lymph node at the tertiary center between January 2012 and December 2013. After SLNB, all patients underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection or thyroid lobectomy and central neck dissection of the single side.Results: SLNs were identified in 112 of 114 patients with 41 positive SLNs and 71 negative SLNs on intraoperative frozen sections. However, eight negative patients were found to be positive in the final pathology. Sentinel node identification rate and false negative value of SLNB were 98.2% and 11.3%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, higher lymph node metastasis was detected in men than in women. Higher detection number of SLN showed higher probability of lymph node metastasis.Conclusion: SLNB may be helpful in papillary thyroid cancer, especially in male patients. Also, it is useful for the staging of nodal status and clearance of persistent disease.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients With Pathological Complete Response in the Axillary Lymph Node After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains controversial in patients with breast cancer who are initially lymph node positive. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on breast cancer recurrence and survival in patients who converted from lymph node-positive to pathological node-negative (ypN0) after NAC.Methods: This single-center retrospective study included 223 patients who converted to axillary lymph node-negative status after NAC and underwent breast and axillary surgery between January 2006 and December 2015. This study compared the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), ipsilateral axillary lymph node recurrence rates and incidence of postoperative complications, especially, arm lymphedema and shoulder stiffness between SLNB and ALND.Results: This study included 223 patients with axillary pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC and surgery. The SLNB and ALND groups included 94 and 129 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 57 (range, 6-155) in the SLNB group and 99 (range 2-159) months in the ALND group. The corresponding 5-year OS and DFS rates were 96.3% and 94.2% (p = 0.392), and 89.2% and 86.4% (p = 0.671), respectively. Four patients (4.3%) in the SLNB group and nine (7.0%) in the ALND group developed locoregional recurrences. Ipsilateral axillary lymph node recurrence and distant metastasis were observed in one (1.1%) and three (2.3%) patients, and in 10 (10.6%) and 11 (8.5%) patients, respectively. Patients in the ALND group were more likely than their SLNB counterparts to experience complications, such as shoulder stiffness (9 [7.0%] vs. 4 [4.3%] patients, p = 0.57). The rate of lymphedema in the ALND group was three times that in the SLNB group (35 [27.1%] vs. 8 [8.5%] patients, p < 0.001).Conclusion: As an alternative to ALND, SLNB has oncological safety in patients with axillary pathological complete response after NAC.

TI  - Underground burning of Jharia coal mine (India) and associated surface deformation using InSAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The underground burning in the Jharia coal mine (JCM) in India is a highly devastating environmental hazard inducing various adverse consequences. In the present study, we carried out time series analyses based on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and land surface temperature (LST) to study the environmental risk. First, a permanent scatterer (PS) time series analysis using Sentinel-1 images over three years was performed to detect the spatio-temporal distribution of ground deformation. Comparison of ground thermal anomaly clearly delineated the subsidence spots associated with the oxygen supply to combustion areas. On the contrary, few deformations were mapped showing pronounced uplift up to 10 mm/year compared with the horizontal creeping associated with underground fire activities. Such ground deformation and thermal anomaly patterns have never been observed. We modeled these observations from satellite data as a consequence of a strong pressurized source that induces surface migration in the coal mine and surrounding geological formations. Further, detailed investigations and modeling are required to mitigate the impact of hazards associated with the underground fires at different locations in the JCM.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Geospatial Data for Water Body Extraction from Sentinel-1 Images for Operational Flood Monitoring across Southeast Asia Using Deep Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning is a promising method for image classification, including satellite images acquired by various sensors. However, the synergistic use of geospatial data for water body extraction from Sentinel-1 data using deep learning and the applicability of existing deep learning models have not been thoroughly tested for operational flood monitoring. Here, we present a novel water body extraction model based on a deep neural network that exploits Sentinel-1 data and flood-related geospatial datasets. For the model, the U-Net was customised and optimised to utilise Sentinel-1 data and other flood-related geospatial data, including digital elevation model (DEM), Slope, Aspect, Profile Curvature (PC), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI), and Buffer for the Southeast Asia region. Testing and validation of the water body extraction model was applied to three Sentinel-1 images for Vietnam, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. By segmenting 384 Sentinel-1 images, model performance and segmentation accuracy for all of the 128 cases that the combination of stacked layers had determined were evaluated following the types of combined input layers. Of the 128 cases, 31 cases showed improvement in Overall Accuracy (OA), and 19 cases showed improvement in both averaged intersection over union (IOU) and F1 score for the three Sentinel-1 images segmented for water body extraction. The averaged OA, IOU, and F1 scores of the 'Sentinel-1 VV' band are 95.77, 80.35, and 88.85, respectively, whereas those of 'band combination VV, Slope, PC, and TRI' are 96.73, 85.42, and 92.08, showing improvement by exploiting geospatial data. Such improvement was further verified with water body extraction results for the Chindwin river basin, and quantitative analysis of 'band combination VV, Slope, PC, and TRI' showed an improvement of the F1 score by 7.68 percent compared to the segmentation output of the 'Sentinel-1 VV' band. Through this research, it was demonstrated that the accuracy of deep learning-based water body extraction from Sentinel-1 images can be improved up to 7.68 percent by employing geospatial data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of research that demonstrates the synergistic use of geospatial data in deep learning-based water body extraction over wide areas. It is anticipated that the results of this research could be a valuable reference when deep neural networks are applied for satellite image segmentation for operational flood monitoring and when geospatial layers are employed to improve the accuracy of deep learning-based image segmentation.

TI  - Statistical Analysis for Tidal Flat Classification and Topography Using Multitemporal SAR Backscattering Coefficients
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are very dynamic natural systems that experience short-term and long-term morphological changes. Their highly dynamic behavior requires frequent monitoring. Tidal flat topography for a large spatial coverage has been generated mainly by the waterline extraction method from multitemporal remote sensing observations. Despite the efficiency and robustness of the waterline extraction method, the waterline-based digital elevation model (DEM) is limited to representing small scale topographic features, such as localized tidal tributaries. Tidal flats show a rapid increase in SAR backscattering coefficients when the tide height is lower than the tidal flat topography compared to when the tidal flat is covered by water. This leads to a tidal flat with a distinct statistical behavior on the temporal variability of our multitemporal SAR backscattering coefficients. Therefore, this study aims to suggest a new method that can overcome the constraints of the waterline-based method by using a pixel-based DEM generation algorithm. Jenks Natural Break (JNB) optimization was applied to distinguish the tidal flat from land and ocean using multitemporal Senitnel-1 SAR data for the years 2014-2020. We also implemented a logistic model to characterize the temporal evolution of the SAR backscattering coefficients along with the tide heights and estimated intertidal topography. The Sentinel-1 DEM from the JNB classification and logistic function was evaluated by an airborne Lidar DEM. Our pixel-based DEM outperformed the waterline-based Landsat DEM. This study demonstrates that our statistical approach to intertidal classification and topography serves to monitor the near real-time spatiotemporal distribution changes of tidal flats through continuous and stable SAR data collection on local and regional scales.

TI  - Calculation Method of Oil Slick Area on Sea Surface Using High-resolution Satellite imagery: <i>M/V Symphony</i> Oil Spill Accident
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to minimize damage to oil spill accidents in the ocean, it is essential to collect a spilled area as soon as possible. Thus satellite-based remote sensing is a powerful source to detect oil spills in the ocean. With the recent rapid increase in the number of available satellites, it has become possible to generate a status report of marine oil spills soon after the accident. In this study, the oil spill area was calculated using various satellite images for the Symphony oil spill accident that occurred off the coast of Qingdao Port, China, on April 27,2021. In particular, improving the accuracy of oil spill area determination was applied using high-resolution commercial satellite images with a spatial resolution of 2m. Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, LANDSAT-8, GEO-KOMPSAT-2B (GOCI-II) and Skysat satellite images were collected from April 27 to May 13, but five images were available considering the weather conditions. The spilled oil had spread northeastward, bound for coastal region of China. This trend was confirmed in the Skysat image and also similar to the movement prediction of oil particles from the accident location. From this result, the look-alike patch observed in the north area from the Sentinel-1A (2021.05.01) image was discriminated as a false alarm. Through the survey period, the spilled oil area tends to increase linearly after the accident. This study showed that high-resolution optical satellites can be used to calculate more accurately the distribution area of spilled oil and contribute to establishing efficient response strategies for oil spill accidents.

TI  - Distribution, abundance and natural enemies of the invasive tomato leafminer, <i>Tuta absoluta</i> (Meyrick) in Kenya
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) has become a serious menace to sustainable production of tomato in Kenya. A survey was conducted between April 2015 and June 2016 to determine its distribution, abundance, infestation, and damage levels on tomato, and associated natural enemies. Trap counts of T. absoluta moths were recorded in all surveyed 29 counties, which indicated its nationwide distribution irrespective of altitude. Tuta absoluta was present in both open fields and greenhouses. The highest moth/trap/day was 115.38 +/- 15.90. Highest leaf infestation was 92.22% and the highest number of mines and larvae per leaf were 3.71 +/- 0.28 and 2.16 +/- 0.45, respectively. Trap captures in terms of moth/trap/day were linearly and positively related to leaf infestations in open fields (R-2 = 0.81) and greenhouses (R-2 = 0.61). Highest fruits' infestation and damage were 60.00 and 59.61%, respectively, while the highest number of mines per fruit was 7.50 +/- 0.50. Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) and Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) were identified as predators of T. absoluta larvae. Nine species of larval parasitoids were recovered from infested foliage, with a combined parasitism of 7.26 +/- 0.65%. Hockeria species was the most dominant (31.25%) and accounted for 12.88 +/- 1.47% parasitism. Two species of larval parasitoids, Hockeria and Necremnus were obtained from sentinel plants with an average parasitism of 1.13 +/- 0.25. The overall abundance and parasitism rates of recovered natural enemies were low to effectively control the field populations of T. absoluta. These findings form the basis of researching and developing effective and sustainable management strategies for the pest.

TI  - Seasonal and Interannual Variability of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in the Bering Sea Found from Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterizes the spatiotemporal variability of chlorophyll-a in the Bering Sea and adjacent Pacific Ocean based on 2003-2019 MODIS data. Average long-term seasonal variations of the chlorophyll-a concentration are described, and the typical times of phytoplankton bloom in various parts of the given area are found. Interannual variability of spring bloom times is analyzed for three regions: the western part of the sea northeast of the Kamchatka Strait, the northern part of the sea near Cape Navarin, and the central part of the sea. The first two of these regions have similar average long-term characteristics. We have shown that the interannual variability of the onset of spring bloom times vary between these two regions with an amplitude of around 2 months. The western part of the sea is characterized by a shift in bloom to earlier periods (March-April), while the spring bloom in the northern region shifts to May-June. Unlike these two regions, the spring bloom is much less pronounced in the central part of the sea; it usually starts in May-June and may last for several weeks. In this case, the chlorophyll-a concentration can be relatively high in August-October as well. In some years, the fall bloom can be even more pronounced by intensity (with a peak of the chlorophyll-a concentration) than the spring bloom. This situation is more typical for the open Pacific Ocean, rather than for the Bering Sea. For the entire water area under consideration, we have compared the course of spring bloom in 2010 and 2015 to reveal that the spatial development of bloom in different years can also vary significantly. The interannual differences in its onset in different regions of the sea are most likely associated with the features of physical processes that control the formation of stable water stratification (spring ice melting and solar heating under weak wind impact) and can also be associated with the variability of currents.

TI  - The Arctic Nearshore Turbidity Algorithm (ANTA)-A multi sensor turbidity algorithm for Arctic nearshore environments
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is greatly impacted by climate change. The increase in air temperature drives the thawing of permafrost and an increase in coastal erosion and river discharge. This leads to a greater input of sediment and organic matter into coastal waters, which substantially impacts the ecosystems by reducing light transmission through the water column and altering the biogeochemistry, but also the subsistence economy of local people, and changes in climate because of the transformation of organic matter into greenhouse gases. Yet, the quantification of suspended sediment in Arctic coastal and nearshore waters remains unsatisfactory due to the absence of dedicated algorithms to resolve the high loads occurring in the close vicinity of the shoreline. In this study we present the Arctic Nearshore Turbidity Algorithm (ANTA), the first reflectance-turbidity relationship specifically targeted towards Arctic nearshore waters that is tuned with in-situ measurements from the nearshore waters of Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk in the western Canadian Arctic. A semi-empirical model was calibrated for several relevant sensors in ocean color remote sensing, including MODIS, Sentinel 3 (OLCI), Landsat 8 (OLI), and Sentinel 2 (MSI), as well as the older Landsat sensors TM and ETM+. The ANTA performed better with Landsat 8 than with Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3. The application of the ANTA to Sentinel 2 imagery that matches in-situ turbidity samples taken in Adventfjorden, Svalbard, shows transferability to nearshore areas beyond Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk.

TI  - Developments and prospects for biological control of <i>Prosopis</i> (Leguminosae) in South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa was the first country to deploy biological control (biocontrol) against invasive Prosopis populations. Developments in this regard have been ongoing, and have been reviewed, at approximately 10-year intervals, since 1991. This review spans the period 2011-2020, a timespan globally characterised by increased awareness of the impacts of invasive Prosopis populations, and recognition of the need for improved management. Concerted international collaboration has resulted in enhanced clarity on phylogenetic relationships within the Leguminosae and the phylogenetic placement of Prosopis. These advances have improved the framework for interpreting the host range of potential agents and for evaluating risk. At the outset of the biocontrol programme, in the 1980s, only agents that consumed mature seeds were considered. The intention was to reduce the invasiveness of Prosopis while simultaneously retaining it as a usable resource. The programme was subsequently expanded to investigate agents that prevent pod set or maturation of seed. More recently, potential agents that damage the vegetative growth of the plants have been included in response to recognition in South Africa, that there is no other route to successful management of Prosopis. There is a wealth of largely unexplored potential in this regard.

TI  - Reconnecting moral education and philosophy
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tilburg University in The Netherlands is distinct from other Dutch universities because it is intent on character formation as an educational goal and offers general philosophy classes to support such character formation. However, these courses focus more on theoretical knowledge than on actual practical competencies and actions. Both these components can be seen as "moral education". My core argument is that moral education should be taught in philosophy classes and my aim is to offer tools as to how to teach both components. In section 2, building on Martha Nussbaum, I will place moral education in a context of different ways of learning ethics. There is more than one way of learning ethics, in which an ordering can be seen from theory to practice. Learning ethics ranges from cognitive learning, through reflection and through judgments, to moral action and moral education: -learning ethics as knowledge-oriented -learning ethics as reflection-oriented -learning ethics as moral judgement-oriented -learning ethics as competence/action-oriented. The latter ways of learning ethics receive less attention in education and these are precisely the ways Nussbaum focuses on . I will argue that moral education has two components: a cognitive and skills component, and an attitude component. For the cognitive and skills component, we discuss the task of the philosophy teacher as well as characteristics of effective philosophy lessons derived from empirical research. Thus, I reconnect moral education and philosophy. Reconnect, in the sense that here I make a (new) connection via empiricism. In section 3, I will outline the teacher's pedagogical task. Teaching scaffolds are important in guiding students through the learning process. Feedback involves the direct evaluation of students' behaviour, whereas hints entail providing clues regarding a given topic (and the deliberate withholding of a complete solution); instructing encompasses requesting a specific action or supplying information so that students understand what to do and how. Likewise, explaining involves providing information concerning how and why. Modelling encompasses demonstrating a behaviour for the purpose of imitation; questioning entails prompting students to think, or to request a specific reaction. In research on the above guiding skills, it has been found within religious and worldview lessons (where moral education also takes place) that in addition to the aforementioned scaffolds, the specific contribution of an effective teacher is to show understanding, give space, and listen. In doing so, it is ensured that learners can form their own opinions. To do this, students will need to be encouraged to think. Of course, moral education does not aim to realise, let alone impose, a unitary view in students, because moral action is always partly dependent on the individual situation and the social context. In section 4, building on John Dewey and Hannah Arendt, I will provide characteristics of effective philosophy lessons derived from empirical research. In How we think, Dewey explains what he means by the thinking that he believes should be trained in education. He defines reflective thought as "active, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the further conclusions to which it tends". This kind of thinking corresponds to the notion of producing criticism and reflecting in my own research on doing philosophy effectively. There I argue that doing philosophy occurs in phases during a lesson.To qualify such a moment, we propose the Pearl Model. Pearls have different layers and these layers of pearls represent five philosophical activities: rationalising, analysing, testing, producing criticism, and reflecting. These activities are ordered hierarchically and conditionally. This indicates, for example, that while rationalising exists at a lower level than reflecting, reaching the level of reflection assumes that rationalising also has taken place. Therefore, the higher the level that a pearl reaches and the more layers have been achieved, the more thorough the philosophical understanding, and the more effectiveness of doing philosophy are acknowledged. Metaphorically, a pearl "shines" if the level of reflection has been reached while doing philosophy. A quantitative correspondence analysis yielded a scale that contrasts more from less effective lessons. In particular, we have found students to produce a higher level of doing philosophy with teachers who chose to organize a philosophical discussion with shared guidance, i.e. guidance by the teacher and the students. Here we find the answer to Arendt's initial question whether the activity of thinking could be the condition that makes men abstain from evil-doing: from this thinking, and dialogue, conscience and the ability to judge are effected. Earlier in this paper I indicated that learning ethics ranges from learning ethics as knowledge-oriented, through learning ethics as reflection-oriented and through learning ethics as moral judgment-oriented, to learning ethics as competence/action-oriented. I arrive at the following position here: doing philosophy effectively can be classified as learning ethics as moral judgement-oriented. This is the first component of moral education, focusing on cognition and skills. In section 5, building on Pierre Hadot, I will propose the good as exercise that shapes character: doing good can be classified as learning ethics as competence/action-oriented. This is the second component of moral education, focusing on attitudes. This brings us to another dimension of philosophy, which has to do with the question whether philosophy is something theoretical or rather an attitude. Hadot shows that while Aristotle makes a distinction between theoretical and practical wisdom, this certainly does not imply a separation between the two. That is to say, theoretical wisdom is not completely separated from human life; similarly, practical wisdom is not merely and solely an application of theoretical insights to practice. Moral action and philosophy thus require action in addition to thought: an amalgamation of knowledge, insight, skills, and attitudes. In conclusion, I offer some tools that enable learning ethics in different ways. Supported by research from faculties where character formation is core business, philosophy and theology, we can work on the moral education of students. Not only will students and their teachers benefit, but also the community around the students (e.g., peers and family) and their professional practices (pastoral care, justice, defense, spiritual care, and education) will share in such achievement.

AB  - Globally, the process of urbanization is transforming land use and, as a consequence, reducing the efficiency of ecosystem services (ESs), which ensure a healthy and comfortable urban environment. In cities, green infrastructure (GI) is a key source of urban ESs. Russia is a highly urbanized country: 70% of its population live in towns or cities. As cities continue to expand, they are swallowing unsealed lands that support ESs. In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of the current state and recent changes in urban GI in Russia's 16 largest cities, including a biophysical evaluation of key urban ESs, using remote sensing data and freely available statistics. Our analysis identifies a weak correlation between GI area, ES volume, and favorable climate conditions as well as a stronger correlation between ESs and the increasing rate of urbanization. Considering Russia's high level of urbanization, the key importance of ESs for the well-being of citizens, and ongoing reductions of urban GI, major revisions to urban planning policy are required. Indicators of urban biodiversity, GI, and ESs should be incorporated into decision-making processes. In particular, it is vital that the accounting and monitoring of GI and ESs are established in all of Russia's larger cities.

TI  - The linguistic image of,the Jew" in Arnold Zweig's essayistic work. An analysis using the DIMEAN model
T2  - ACTA GERMANICA-GERMAN STUDIES IN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of linguistic worldview has emerged as a theoretical term with analogous use outside of the discipline of linguistics, especially within the context of interdisciplinary studies, where literary works are approached from a linguistic perspective. This article aims to examine the linguistic image of the Jew in the essayistic work of German-Jewish writer Arnold Zweig (18871968), and to consider his role as an actor within a broader discourse. The methodological framework used is based on quantitative corpus analysis methodology and the DIMEAN model, as developed by Warnke and Spitzmuller.

TI  - Geospatial Approaches to Monitoring the Spread of Invasive Species of <i>Solidago</i> spp.
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change influences plant invasion which spreads all over the Europe. Invasive plants are predominantly manifest negative impacts, which require increased attention not only from ecologists. The research examines the possibilities offered by geospatial technologies in mapping the spatial spread of invasive plants of the genus Solidago. Invasive plant population was investigated at two localities, MalATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Saris and Chminianska Nova Ves in Slovakia, as well as the mapping of the area by multispectral imaging to determine the spectral reflectance curve of the monitored plant species. Using spatial analyses in the geographic information system, we evaluated changes in the plant density in the two localities. Based on the obtained results, we found that the number of individuals (ramets) in the MalATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Saris is significantly increasing, while in the examined area of Chminianska Nova Ves, there is a decrease in the number of Solidago spp. in the last monitored year. At the same time, we can state that in the areas with the highest increase in the number of ramets, the highest plant density per hectare was also recorded. We can also say that due to the spectral proximity of the surrounding vegetation, the spectral resolution in four spectral bands is insufficient for the classification of multispectral records in the case of Solidago spp. and cannot replace the advantages of high spectral resolution hyperspectral imaging, which significantly refines the feature space for Solidago spp. and the surrounding vegetation.

TI  - Informativeness of the Spectral and Morphometric Characteristics of the Canopy-Gap Structure Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The differences in morphometric features of the canopy-gap structure of the three dominant forest types in the Valuevsky Forest Park were investigated with high-resolution and detailed-resolution remote sensing data. The forest-community groups (deciduous forest with a predominance of lime, deciduous forest with a predominance of birch or aspen, and coniferous forest with a predominance of spruce or pine) were classified according to the random forest method based on Sentinel-2/MSI multispectral satellite images. The better classificaton accuracy was 0.96 (k = 0.88). The Sentinel-2 data were used to create a layer of segments: spectrally homogeneous forest parcels. The forest gaps were obtained via cluster analysis with Resurs-P1 Geoton panchromatic data and visual interpretation of the clusters. Eight morphometric parameters were calculated for each gap. The differences were analyzed at the segment level (the Mann-Whitney U-test) and for all gap sets of each forest-community group (the Kruskal-Wallis H-test). The highest U-test values for the average values of morphometric features at the level of forest-community segments were obtained for the gap area (U = 24), gap perimeter (U = 19.3), gap-shape complexity index (U = 19.0), and the ratio of the perimeter to the gap area (U = 18.7). The highest values of the H-test at the level of individual gaps were calculated for the fractal dimension of the gap (H = 2229.2), the ratio of the perimeter to gap area (H = 2064.9), and the gap area (H = 1718.4). Analysis of the calculated and published data made it possible to find the possible reasons for the differences in the gap structure and gap parameters of coniferous, small-leaved, and lime communities of the model territory.

TI  - Combined Use of Space Borne Optical and SAR Data to Improve Knowledge about Sea Ice for Shipping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a first step towards a new combined product for sea ice classification based on optical/thermal data collected by Sentinel-3 satellites and SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellites, which can be used as an appropriate support for navigation in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters, two existing classification algorithms are adapted to these data. The classification based on optical data has improved, so it is expected that the results will be ideally suited to be processed together with SAR data into significantly improved sea ice information products to support marine navigation. The usefulness of the combined processing is demonstrated by means of two simple algorithms and a more sophisticated approach is outlined, which will be realized in the future in order to form the basis for an integration into an operational service with the involvement of further partners and users.

TI  - The new perspective of PET/CT for axillary nodal staging in early breast cancer patients according to ACOSOG Z0011 trial PET/CT axillary staging according to Z0011
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Post Z0011 trial, axillary lymph node dissections (ALNDs) can be performed in patients with >= 3 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). We investigated the diagnostic performance of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) to predict >= 3 metastasis [high nodal burden (HNB)]. Methods We retrospectively analyzed preoperative FDG PET/CT from January 2010 to June 2012. Patients had clinical T1-2N0 primary invasive breast cancer and underwent breast-conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy +/- ALND. All suspicious ALNs were counted considering FDG-avidity with morphologic changes. Images were considered positive if the axillary basin took up more FDG than the surrounding tissue. On CT, abnormal ALNs were round/ovoid or had cortical thickening with contrast enhancement. PET/CT results were compared with the histology and follow-up findings. Results In total, 221 females with 224 axillae were enrolled; 161 had negative, 53 had 1-2 metastasis [low nodal burden (LNB)] and 10 had HNB. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of PET/CT for HNB were 70, 100, 98.6 and 100%, respectively. There was a correlation between the number of suspicious ALNs on PET/CT and the metastatic nodes on final histology. There were no significant differences in age, tumor size and FDG-avidity between patients with negative or LNB and HNB. During follow-up, 25 patients had a recurrence. The three false-negative patients did not show recurrence. Conclusion Preoperative PET/CT predicts HNB with high accuracy and is useful for evaluating clinical T1-2N0 invasive breast cancer.

TI  - Modeling the Forest Cover of the Vengeri River Basin (Sakhalin Island) with Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study concerns mapping of the actual vegetation cover of the Vengeri River basin (eastern coast of the central Sakhalin) with an area of more than 33 000 ha. A cartographic model has been created with the use of the algorithm of stepwise discriminant analysis based on the original geobotanical data, a digital elevation model, and the spectral data of Landsat 5 images. Nine physiognomical vegetation types were recognized: three of them are nonforest (open rock vegetation, alpine tundra, and alpine meadows), while six feature different kinds of forests: fir-spruce forests (Abies sachalinensis, Picea ajanensis), larch forests and sparse stands (Larix cajanderi), shrub thickets (Pinus pumila, Dushekia fruticosa), Erman's birch forests (Betula ermanii), and broad-leaved and riparian deciduous forests (Alnus hirsuta, Betula platyphylla, Chosenia arbutifolia, Populus suaveolens, Salix udensis). The dependence between the physiognomical types of the forest and the syntaxa of traditional Russian dominant (ecophytocoenotic) and floristic classification systems was determined. Forest communities evolved on 89.1% of the river basin; the largest area was covered by larch forests and open woodlands (natural sparse forests) (33.32%). The landscape and climatic conditions of the region allow the existence of fir-spruce forests, which are typical of the zone, but they account for as little as 11.23% of the entire territory. The widespread distribution of larch forests results from the natural pyrogenic transformation of the dark coniferous forests. Under the conditions of the strongly rugged mountain relief, it was impossible to decode and model the vegetation areas situated on the shadowed northern slopes automatically. The paper proposes that the reconstruction should be performed with visual decoding of high-resolution images and field-study data.

TI  - TIC 172900988: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet Detected in One Sector of TESS Data
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the first discovery of a transiting circumbinary planet detected from a single sector of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. During Sector 21, the planet TIC 172900988b transited the primary star and then five days later it transited the secondary star. The binary is itself eclipsing, with a period P approximate to 19.7 days and an eccentricity e approximate to 0.45. Archival data from ASAS-SN, Evryscope, KELT, and SuperWASP reveal a prominent apsidal motion of the binary orbit, caused by the dynamical interactions between the binary and the planet. A comprehensive photodynamical analysis of the TESS, archival and follow-up data yields stellar masses and radii of M (1) = 1.2384 +/- 0.0007 M (circle dot) and R (1) = 1.3827 +/- 0.0016 R (circle dot) for the primary and M (2) = 1.2019 +/- 0.0007 M (circle dot) and R (2) = 1.3124 +/- 0.0012 R (circle dot) for the secondary. The radius of the planet is R (3) = 11.25 +/- 0.44 R (circle plus) (1.004 +/- 0.039R (Jup)). The planet's mass and orbital properties are not uniquely determined-there are six solutions with nearly equal likelihood. Specifically, we find that the planet's mass is in the range of 824 less than or similar to M (3) less than or similar to 981 M (circle plus) (2.65 less than or similar to M (3) less than or similar to 3.09M (Jup)), its orbital period could be 188.8, 190.4, 194.0, 199.0, 200.4, or 204.1 days, and the eccentricity is between 0.02 and 0.09. At V = 10.141 mag, the system is accessible for high-resolution spectroscopic observations, e.g., the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and transit spectroscopy.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The well-known literary critic, philosopher of religion and culture, art critic and ballet theorist Akim Volynsky (Chaim Leibovich Flexer, 1861 or 1863-1926) in his unreleased book "Rembrandt" (1925) develops a new perspective on the artist's work. At the same time, he follows his idea of the special cultural and historical significance of Judaism. He raises the question of Rembrandt's attitude to Jewry in genealogical and spiritual terms, reveals his connections with the religious, cultural, everyday traditions of Judaism, and examines in detail the Judaizing trend in his work. This aspect of the study is combined with the consideration of thematic, genre, style, technical features of painting and graphics of Rembrandt. Volynsky problematicizes the content of those paintings of Rembrandt, in which it is customary to see the development of evangelical and later Christian subjects. The purposeful reconstruction of the Judaic tradition in the biographical material and in Rembrandt's work is explained by Volynsky's deep disappointment in modern Christianity. In "The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (Hannah and Simeon)" (1627-1628). Volynsky sees first of all the Jewish domestic scene. The painting "Saint Paul in the prison" (1627) was radically audited. The Rembrandt's John the Baptist ("Preaching of Saint John the Baptist" circa 1633-1634) has also been bred beyond Christian history. For criticism is important to compare the preaching John and the surrounding crowd - in light of the contrast between the material and the spiritual. Rembrandt's personality is very convincingly shown by the life-related circle of Amsterdam Jews, their way of life and worldview. Volynsky also points out that the ideological landmarks of Rembrandt were the teachings of Rabbi Moshe bin Maimon, Menasse ben Israel, Spinoza. All this led the artist away from the experience and creative reflection of Christian subjects. In the later development of the theme "Ecce homo", in the etching "Christ presented to the people" (1655), Volynsky found, from his point of view, genuine Rembrandt characters who change the meaning of the depiction of the famous evangelical scene. A successful pictorial interpretation of the image of Christ finds Volynsky in Rembrandt paintings dedicated to the "Emmaus legend". Of all Rembrandt's works on evangelical subjects, he is most impressed by the etching and painting " The Return of the Prodigal Son" (etching 1636, painting 1666-1668).The artist's intimate feelings also colored the "greatest graphic masterpiece" - the etching " The Adoration of the Shepherds" (1652). Rembrandt's early experiments on Old Testament plots seem to Volynsky to be unsuccessful. But already in the picture "Saul and David" (circa 1630) he felt the music embodied in the image of the hands of a psalm singer playing the harp. Volynsky masterfully describes the position and movement of his fingers. However, in Rembrandt's transmission of Old Testament subjects Volynsky notices the split of the historical consciousness of the artist and, accordingly, the duality of the image. One of the few things that Volynsky recognized as successful are Rembrandt's paintings and graphic works related to the biblical Book of Tovit.

TI  - The Impact of Cocirculating Pathogens on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/Coronavirus Disease 2019 Surveillance: How Concurrent Epidemics May Introduce Bias and Decrease the Observed SARS-CoV-2 Percentage Positivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Circulation of seasonal non-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory viruses with syndromic overlap during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may alter the quality of COVID-19 surveillance, with possible consequences for real-time analysis and delay in implementation of control measures.Methods. Using a multipathogen susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) transmission model formalizing cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory virus, we assessed how an outbreak of secondary virus may affect 2 COVID-19 surveillance indicators: testing demand and positivity. Using simulation, we assessed to what extent the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests on a subsample of symptomatic individuals can help correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positivity and improve surveillance quality.Results. We find that a non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic strongly increases SARS-CoV-2 daily testing demand and artificially reduces the observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positivity for the duration of the outbreak. We estimate that performing 1 multiplex test for every 1000 COVID-19 tests on symptomatic individuals could be sufficient to maintain surveillance of other respiratory viruses in the population and correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percentage positivity.Conclusions. This study showed that cocirculating respiratory viruses can distort SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Correction of the positivity rate can be achieved by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests, and a low number of samples is sufficient to avoid bias in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.

The values for in 2003-2017 were compared for control (unharmed) and damaged test plots in the Khamar-Daban zone near the coast of Lake Baikal (Irkutsk oblast). It is shown that the use of the proposed integral indicators of the seasonal NDVI dynamics makes it possible to classify the test plots according to the tree state.

TI  - Using a single-board computer as a low-cost instrument for SPAD value estimation through colour images and chlorophyll-related spectral indices
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf chlorophyll content is a major indicator of plant stress. Therefore, it is often used for the evaluation of crop status to adjust agricultural management to ensure high quality yield while concurrently applying water and agrochemicals in a sustainable manner. Since laboratory procedures for their assessment are time-consuming and destructive, nondestructive methods have been developed recently based on known vegetation spectral response characteristics. In addition to various vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data, hand-held sensors such as SPAD-502 are currently widely used for in-field sampling to gain precise information for decision-making in terms of best-fitting agricultural management. However, the costs of such commercial devices can be limiting for farmers. The low-cost alternatives that have been developed recently exploit widely accessible digital cameras with sensors sensitive to the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Digital numbers extracted from colour images in RGB channels serve as the input for broadband "chlorophyll index" calculations. Major constraints regarding digital cameras are, however, the natural light illuminance and the necessity of data postprocessing. In the framework of this study, a novel technological solution was developed to address these issues. A Raspberry Pi single-board computer together with a Pi Camera and a simple LED incorporated in a 3D print case created a prototype called Rasp2SPAD, which was programmed to acquire and analyse a colour image. The prototype and its setup were further tested on the experimental plant material of the winter rapeseed. A set of 22 chlorophyll-related parameters across various colour representation models were generated, from which an SPAD value was modelled using i) a simple linear model, ii) a generalized linear model, and iii) an artificial neural network. The blue (Cb) and red (Cr) chroma components of the YUV colour space were found to be most suitable for SPAD value modelling. Calibration equations were determined, and the results reached relatively high accuracy (mean absolute deviance 1.85 and R-squared 0.81 for simple linear model) while keeping the costs significantly low compared to the most commonly used commercial sensor. In this way, a simple and cheap methodology was introduced to bring the results of research closer to practice, which should help first spread the precision agriculture concept to a wider audience and second allow them to utilize with it.

AB  - In this paper, the technology for determining the ice cover mask using a convolutional neural network as applied to data of a low-resolution multispectral scanning device installed on the Meteor-M No. 2 Russian satellite is considered. The selection criteria for the parameters involved in training the neural network and the process of determining texture size are described. The classification score of the developed model is determined using the machine learning metrics. Validation of the results shows that the algorithm has an accuracy of 94.9 and 96.7% in comparison with ice cover masks according to data of the MOD10 product of the MODIS instrument and archived ice condition maps created in accordance with the international WMO Sea Ice Nomenclature.

TI  - Change Detection of Selective Logging in the Brazilian Amazon Using X-Band SAR Data and Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is estimated that, in the Brazilian Amazon, forest degradation contributes three times more than deforestation for the loss of gross above-ground biomass. Degradation, in particular those caused by selective logging, result in features whose detection is a challenge to remote sensing, due to its size, space configuration, and geographical distribution. From the available remote sensing technologies, SAR data allow monitoring even during adverse atmospheric conditions. The aim of this study was to test different pre-trained models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for change detection associated with forest degradation in bitemporal products obtained from a pair of SAR COSMO-SkyMed images acquired before and after logging in the Jamari National Forest. This area contains areas of legal and illegal logging, and to test the influence of the speckle effect on the result of this classification by applying the classification methodology on previously filtered and unfiltered images, comparing the results. A method of cluster detections was also presented, based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which would make it possible, for example, to guide inspection actions and allow the calculation of the intensity of exploitation (IEX). Although the differences between the tested models were in the order of less than 5%, the tests on the RGB composition (where R = coefficient of variation; G = minimum values; and B = gradient) presented a slightly better performance compared to the others in terms of the number of correct classifications for selective logging, in particular using the model Painters (accuracy = 92%) even in the generalization tests, which presented an overall accuracy of 87%, and in the test on RGB from the unfiltered image pair (accuracy of 90%). These results indicate that multitemporal X-band SAR data have the potential for monitoring selective logging in tropical forests, especially in combination with CNN techniques.

TI  - Analysing principal components of physiographic factors affecting groundwater occurrences within Keffi, North-Central Nigeria
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is to employ remotely sensed data and evaluate the principal components (PC) of physiographic variables like topography, drainage, slope and wetness. These variables may wield physio-graphic influence on groundwater. The software ENVI 5.0 and GLOBAL MAPPER 15 were used to obtain these information from Landsat ETM+ and SRTM-DEM, while ARCMAP 10.3 was used to perform the extraction of slope data. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that there was very strong negative loading of Eigen Values for the variables; topography, wetness, and drainage density within PC1, PC2, and PC4, respectively. However, slope showed a very strong positive loading of Eigen Values in PC3. PC3 mul-tiplied by-1 was then performed in order to realise a more ideal relationship between these physio-graphic variables and the availability of groundwater. It showed weak positive Eigen Values of +0.031 and +0.012 for wetness and slope respectively, although their influence on groundwater occurrence is not very strong. Three classes namely; low, moderate, and high groundwater potentials were well-defined based on these physiographic variables using multi-fractal analysis (MFA). The regions delineated are 26%, 65%, and 9% respectively, in terms of percentage areal coverage. Therefore, variables other than the physiographic influences exert stronger influences on the spatial distribution of groundwater in the study area.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

AB  - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive disease. Pure DCIS is not associated with the risk of metastasizing. Some areas of DCIS may rarely contain invasive islands. For patients who undergo breast conserving therapy sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is recommended as a second procedure, while all mastectomy patients should undergo SLNB. The paper analyses which patients require primary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and what is the best technique to identify the sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Field-scale Assessment of Sugarcane for Mill-level Production Forecasting using Indian Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) production at micro-scale prior to harvest is required for fixing of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) payable by sugar factories, levy price of sugar and its supply for public distribution systems and regulating supply of free-sale sugar. This may also help the sugar mill owners to plan for crushing the expected cane biomass, estimate the production of sugar in each mill and look for opportunities to sell or buy from nearest sugar mills if expected production is more or less than factory's crushable capacity. A pilot-scale study was carried out in four sugar mills of Gujarat and Maharashtra states during 2017-2019 period. Multi-date multispectral data from LISS IV, LISS III of Resourcesat-2&2A, GPS and mobile-based ground truth data and Crop Cutting Experiment data (CCE) were used. Crop discrimination in the form of fresh and ratoon, field-scale crop health assessment, yield-model development and mill-level crop acreage and production estimation were carried out. LISS IV data along with error-free GPS-based polygons could lead to discrimination with 95% accuracy and between 88-91% with mobile-based point locations. The mill-level production was found to have less than 10% deviation from reported production. The field-scale assessment and enumeration could lead to mill-level crushable cane production forecast 2 months before harvest. Future efforts are needed to utilize agro-met products and SAR-based metrics to improve the production forecasting.

TI  - Grouping Small Spacecraft for Global Meteorological Observations Using a Microwave Radiometer-Spectrometer
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current state of microwave radiometry for remote sensing of the Earth is considered. There are currently some 30 satellite microwave radiometers operating and supplying data in the world, while Russia has only one microwave radiometer (MTVZA-GYa) with a 65 degrees sounding angle. We propose to create a constellation of small spacecraft for global meteorological observations on the basis of the MIRS microwave radiometer, which is being developed for the Konvergentsiya space experiment on the Russian Segment of the International Space Station. Optimal parameters for satellite data of the microwave space system are a spatial resolution of 10-12 km and a temporal resolution of 3-6 h for analyzing current atmospheric processes, improving the quality of weather forecast, and predicting emergency situations. This problem can be solved if there are 4 to 8 simultaneous satellites with onboard radiometers in a single orbit of the Earth.

TI  - Using Deep Learning to Nowcast the Spatial Coverage of Convection from <i>Himawari-8</i> Satellite Data
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the timing and location of thunderstorms ("convection'') allows for preventive actions that can save both lives and property. We have applied U-nets, a deep-learning-based type of neural network, to forecast convection on a grid at lead times up to 120 min. The goal is to make skillful forecasts with only present and past satellite data as predictors. Specifically, predictors are multispectral brightness-temperature images from the Himawari-8 satellite, while targets (ground truth) are provided by weather radars in Taiwan. U-nets are becoming popular in atmospheric science due to their advantages for gridded prediction. Furthermore, we use three novel approaches to advance U-nets in atmospheric science. First, we compare three architectures-vanilla, temporal, and U-net++-and find that vanilla U-nets are best for this task. Second, we train U-nets with the fractions skill score, which is spatially aware, as the loss function. Third, because we do not have adequate ground truth over the full Himawari-8 domain, we train the U-nets with small radar-centered patches, then apply trained U-nets to the full domain. Also, we find that the best predictions are given by U-nets trained with satellite data from multiple lag times, not only the present. We evaluate U-nets in detail-by time of day, month, and geographic location-and compare them to persistence models. The U-nets outperform persistence at lead times >= 60 min, and at all lead times the U-nets provide a more realistic climatology than persistence. Our code is available publicly.

TI  - Analysis of Thermal Plume Dispersion into the Sea by Remote Sensing and Numerical Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to study, by remote sensing and numerical modeling, the thermal dispersion of a plume discharged into the sea by a nuclear power plant. The case study is the thermal discharge of the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant, located on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. First, the thermal plume dispersion was characterized by applying remote sensing for different scenarios. Afterwards, Delft3D-FLOW numerical simulations were performed to expand the analysis of the thermal processes for a case in which the thermal plume tends towards the intake of the power plant. This thermal analysis was carried out by comparing the behavior of different dimensionless parameters. Moreover, the results of the numerical simulations were used to investigate the performance of the AEM and the k-L and k-epsilon turbulence models, available in the Delft3D-FLOW model. An LES turbulence model contribution was also analyzed. The results show that forced convection is predominant near the plume discharge area and at the vicinity of the intake structure. According to the metrics calculated, all turbulence models produced good agreement with the remote sensing data, except when the LES scheme was considered. Finally, the use of remote sensing and numerical simulations is helpful to better understand thermal plume dispersion.

TI  - Use of Multi-Seasonal Satellite Images to Predict SOC from Cultivated Lands in a Montane Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although algorithms are well developed to predict soil organic carbon (SOC), selecting appropriate covariates to improve prediction accuracy is an ongoing challenge. Terrain attributes and remote sensing data are the most common covariates for SOC prediction. This study tested the predictive performance of nine different combinations of topographic variables and multi-season remotely sensed data to improve the prediction of SOC in the cultivated lands of a middle mountain catchment of Nepal. The random forest method was used to predict SOC contents, and the quantile regression forest for quantifying the prediction uncertainty. Prediction of SOC contents was improved when remote sensing data of multiple seasons were used together with the terrain variables. Remote sensing data of multiple seasons capture the dynamic conditions of surface soils more effectively than using an image of a single season. It is concluded that the use of remote sensing images of multiple seasons instead of a snapshot of a single period may be more effective for improving the prediction of SOC in a digital soil mapping framework. However, an image with the right timing of cropping season can provide comparable results if a parsimonious model is preferred.

TI  - Recent warming reverses forty-year decline in catastrophic lake drainage and hastens gradual lake drainage across northern Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes represent as much as similar to 25% of the total land surface area in lowland permafrost regions. Though decreasing lake area has become a widespread phenomenon in permafrost regions, our ability to forecast future patterns of lake drainage spanning gradients of space and time remain limited. Here, we modeled the drivers of gradual (steady declining lake area) and catastrophic (temporally abrupt decrease in lake area) lake drainage using 45 years of Landsat observations (i.e. 1975-2019) across 32 690 lakes spanning climate and environmental gradients across northern Alaska. We mapped lake area using supervised support vector machine classifiers and object based image analyses using five-year Landsat image composites spanning 388 968 km(2). Drivers of lake drainage were determined with boosted regression tree models, using both static (e.g. lake morphology, proximity to drainage gradient) and dynamic predictor variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation, wildfire). Over the past 45 years, gradual drainage decreased lake area between 10% and 16%, but rates varied over time as the 1990s recorded the highest rates of gradual lake area losses associated with warm periods. Interestingly, the number of catastrophically drained lakes progressively decreased at a rate of similar to 37% decade(-1) from 1975-1979 (102-273 lakes draining year(-1)) to 2010-2014 (3-8 lakes draining year(-1)). However this 40 year negative trend was reversed during the most recent time-period (2015-2019), with observations of catastrophic drainage among the highest on record (i.e. 100-250 lakes draining year(-1)), the majority of which occurred in northwestern Alaska. Gradual drainage processes were driven by lake morphology, summer air and lake temperature, snow cover, active layer depth, and the thermokarst lake settlement index (R (2) (adj) = 0.42, CV = 0.35, p < 0.0001), whereas, catastrophic drainage was driven by the thawing season length, total precipitation, permafrost thickness, and lake temperature (R (2) (adj) = 0.75, CV = 0.67, p < 0.0001). Models forecast a continued decline in lake area across northern Alaska by 15%-21% by 2050. However these estimates are conservative, as the anticipated amplitude of future climate change were well-beyond historical variability and thus insufficient to forecast abrupt 'catastrophic' drainage processes. Results highlight the urgency to understand the potential ecological responses and feedbacks linked with ongoing Arctic landscape reorganization.

TI  - Recent greening driven by species-specific shrub growth characteristics in Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a popular approach for identifying vegetation change in northern environments; however, disentangling ecological processes causing variability in spectral indices remains a challenge. Here, we aim to determine how shrub characteris-tics differ between low and rapidly greening areas near Nain, Nunatsiavut, Canada. Using a cross-scale approach, we combined remotely sensed spectral greening trends (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Landsat Collection 1, 1985-2018) with shrub dynamics derived from ring-widths of green alder (Alnus alnobetula (Ehrh.) K. Koch) and dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa Michx.). Differentiation of spectral greening classes appears to be driven by the distribution of shrub species. Alder were taller, grew faster, had more recent stem initiation than dwarf birch, and were dominant in rapid greening subplots. In low greening subplots, alder were co-dominant with dwarf birch, whose dominant stems initiated more gradually, were shorter, and had lower rates of vertical growth. The radial growth of both shrub species was favoured by warm winter temperatures and precipitation, whereas rapid greening alder was also favoured by warm summer temperatures. Further shrub growth will likely be enhanced under continued climate warming if moisture does not become limiting. This research demonstrates the importance of species identity in determining rates of spectral greening in northern environments.

TI  - Integrating Satellite, UAV, and Ground-Based Remote Sensing in Archaeology: An Exploration of Pre-Modern Land Use in Northeastern Iraq
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is well demonstrated to be a powerful tool for investigating ancient land use in Southwest Asia. However, few regional studies have systematically integrated satellite-based observations with more intensive remote sensing technologies, such as drone-deployed multispectral sensors and ground-based geophysics, to explore off-site areas. Here, we integrate remote sensing data from a variety of sources and scales including historic aerial photographs, modern satellite imagery, drone-deployed sensors, and ground-based geophysics to explore pre-modern land use along the Upper Diyala/Sirwan River in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Our analysis reveals an incredible diversity of land use features, including canals, qanats, trackways, and field systems, most of which likely date to the first millennium CE, and demonstrate the potential of more intensive remote sensing methods to resolve land use features. Our results align with broader trends across ancient Southwest Asia that document the most intensive land use in the first millennium BCE through the first millennium CE. Land use features dating to the earlier Bronze Age (fourth through second millennium BCE) remain elusive and will likely require other investigative approaches.

TI  - Mapping and Assessing Landfills Surface Temperature Using Landsat 8 Satellite Data. A Case Study in Vietnam
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, rapid urbanization and population growth have led to an overload of waste in big cities of Vietnam. Waste decomposition is always associated with the effects of heat generation as a result of the continuous aerobic and anaerobic processes, resulting in landfill surface temperature is significantly higher than the surrounding area. This paper presents the results of assessment of land surface temperature distribution in two largest landfills in Vietnam, including Nam Son landfill (Hanoi city, northern Vietnam) and Da Phuoc landfill (Ho Chi Minh city, southern Vietnam). Landsat 8 satellite image data is used to calculate land surface temperatures based on the split-window method. The results showed that the landfill surface temperature was much higher than the surrounding area, even compared to the areas characterized by impervious surfaces. The difference between the landfill surface temperature and temperature in areas covered by vegetation was about 20 degrees C. The results obtained in this study provide input information to develop monitoring models of pollution at landfills.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) provides valuable information necessary for sustainable and effective management of forests. Although global high resolution LAI data are provided by European Space Agency using Sentinel-2 satellite images, they have not considered forest characteristics in model development and have not been evaluated for various forest ecosystems in South Korea. In this study, we proposed a LAI estimation model combining machine learning and the PROSAIL radiative transfer model using Sentinel-2 satellite data over a local forest area in South Korea. LAI-2200C was used to measure in situ LAI data. The proposed LAI estimation model was compared to the existing Sentinel-2 LAI product. The results showed that the proposed model outperformed the existing Sentinel-2 LAI product, yielding a difference of bias similar to 0.97 and a difference of root-mean-square-error similar to 0.81 on average, respectively, which improved the underestimation of the existing product. The proposed LAI estimation model provided promising results, implying its use for effective LAI estimation over forests in South Korea.

TI  - Algorithm for Improved Stereoscopic Cloud-Top Height Retrieval Based on Visible and Infrared Bands for Himawari-8 and FY-4A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stereoscopic cloud-top height (CTH) retrieval from two geostationary (GEO) satellites is usually realized through a visible (VIS) band with a high horizontal resolution. A stereoscopic-based CTH retrieval algorithm (prototype dual-GEO CTH algorithm) proposed in our previous study also adopts this approach. Although this approach can retrieve accurate stereoscopic CTHs, the heights of optically thin upper clouds overlying the lower clouds are challenging to retrieve because the parallax difference between two GEOs is determined by the lower clouds owing to the low reflectance from the upper clouds. To address this problem, this paper proposes an improved stereoscopic CTH retrieval algorithm, named the improved dual-GEO CTH algorithm, for Himawari-8 and FengYun (FY)-4A GEOs. The proposed algorithm employs an infrared (IR) band in addition to a VIS band. A seamless image cloning technique is adopted to blend the VIS and IR images, which are then used to retrieve the stereoscopic CTHs. The retrieved CTHs are compared with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) CTHs for three occasions involving upper clouds overlying lower clouds. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prototype dual-GEO CTH algorithm in the case of upper clouds overlying lower clouds. Notably, although the proposed algorithm is intended for Himawari-8 and FY-4A GEOs, it can be easily extended to any combination of two GEOs.

TI  - Exploiting GOCI-II UV Channel to Observe Absorbing Aerosols
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 19 February 2020, the 2nd Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI-II), a maritime sensor of GEO-KOMPSAT-2B, was launched. The GOCI-II instrument expands the scope of aerosol retrieval research with its improved performance compared to the former instrument (GOCI). In particular, the newly included UV band at 380 nm plays a significant role in improving the sensitivity of GOCI-II observations to the absorbing aerosols. In this study, we calculated the aerosol index and detected absorbing aerosols from January to June 2021 using GOCI-II 380 and 412 nm channels. Compared to the TROPOMI aerosol index, the GOCI-II aerosol index showed a positive bias, but the dust pixels still could be clearly distinguished from the cloud and clear pixels. The high GOCI-II aerosol index coincided with ground-based observations indicating dust aerosols were detected. We found that 70.5% of dust and 80% of moderately-absorbing fine aerosols detected from the ground had GOCI-II aerosol indices larger than the 75th percentile through the whole study period.

TI  - SRSDD-v1.0: A High-Resolution SAR Rotation Ship Detection Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has been widely used in the field of SAR ship detection. However, current SAR ship detection still faces many challenges, such as complex scenes, multiple scales, and small targets. In order to promote the solution to the above problems, this article releases a high-resolution SAR ship detection dataset which can be used for rotating frame target detection. The dataset contains six categories of ships. In total, 30 panoramic SAR tiles of the Chinese Gaofen-3 of port areas with a 1-m resolution were cropped to slices, each with 1024 x 1024 pixels. In addition, most of the images in the dataset contain nearshore areas with complex background interference. Eight state-of-the-art rotated detectors and a CFAR-based method were used to evaluate the dataset. Experimental results revealed that the complex background will have a great impact on the performance of detectors.

TI  - Philosophy and classic psychedelics: A review of some emerging themes
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHEDELIC STUDIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Serotonergic (or "classic") psychedelics have struck many researchers as raising significant philosophical questions that, until recently, were largely unexplored by academic philosophers. This paper provides an overview of four emerging lines of research at the intersection of academic philosophy and psychedelic science that have gained considerable traction in the last decade: selfless consciousness, psychedelic epistemology, psychedelic ethics, and spiritual/religious naturalism. In this paper, we highlight philo-sophical questions concerning (i) psychedelics, self-consciousness, and phenomenal consciousness, (ii) the epistemic profile of the psychedelic experience; (iii) ethical concerns about the appropriate use of psychedelics; and (iv) whether spiritual or religious dimensions of psychedelic use are compatible with a naturalistic worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - Even though aesthetics is often not explicitly included in computer science curricula, a review of computer science literature shows that incorporating beauty is beneficial in areas such as programming and design. Beauty in the field of computer science unified with a theological view of beauty forms a faith-integrated perspective with vertical and horizontal dimensions. This article shows that a faith-integrated perspective of beauty in computer science adds transcendent meaning and purposes for incorporating aesthetics as part of a computer science academic curriculum. Some examples are also provided for teaching with a faith-integrated perspective of beauty in computer science courses for Christian higher education.

TI  - Changes in the grasslands of the Caucasus based on Cumulative Endmember Fractions from the full 1987-2019 Landsat record
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are important for global biodiversity, food security, and climate change analyses, which makes mapping and monitoring of vegetation changes in grasslands necessary to better understand, sustainably manage, and protect these ecosystems. However, grassland vegetation monitoring at spatial and temporal resolution relevant to land management (e.g., ca. 30-m, and at least annually over long time periods) is challenging due to complex spatio-temporal pattern of changes and often limited data availability. Here we assess both short and long-term changes in grassland vegetation cover from 1987 to 2019 across the Caucasus ecoregion at 30-m resolution based on Cumulative Endmember Fractions (i.e., annual sums of monthly ground cover fractions) derived from the full Landsat record, and temporal segmentation with LandTrendr. Our approach combines the benefits of physically-based analyses, missing data prediction, annual aggregations, and adaptive identification of changes in the time-series. We analyzed changes in vegetation fraction cover to infer the location, timing, and magnitude of vegetation change episodes of any length, quantified shifts among all ground cover fractions (i.e., green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade), and identified change pathways (i.e., green vegetation loss, desiccation, dry vegetation loss, revegetation green fraction, greening, or revegetation dry fraction). We found widespread long-term positive changes in grassland vegetation (32.7% of grasslands), especially in the early 2000s, but negative changes pathways were most common before the year 2000. We found little association between changes in green vegetation and meteorological conditions, and varied relationships with livestock populations. However, we also found strong spatial heterogeneity in vegetation dynamics among neighboring fields and pastures, demonstrating capability of our approach for grassland management at local levels. Our results provide a detailed assessment of grassland vegetation change in the Caucasus Ecoregion, and present an approach to map changes in grasslands even where availability of Landsat data is limited.

TI  - Evaluating the Persistence of Post-Wildfire Ash: A Multi-Platform Spatiotemporal Analysis
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As wildland fires amplify in size in many regions in the western USA, land and water managers are increasingly concerned about the deleterious effects on drinking water supplies. Consequences of severe wildfires include disturbed soils and areas of thick ash cover, which raises the concern of the risk of water contamination via ash. The persistence of ash cover and depth were monitored for up to 90 days post-fire at nearly 100 plots distributed between two wildfires in Idaho and Washington, USA. Our goal was to determine the most 'cost' effective, operational method of mapping post-wildfire ash cover in terms of financial, data volume, time, and processing costs. Field measurements were coupled with multi-platform satellite and aerial imagery collected during the same time span. The image types spanned the spatial resolution of 30 m to sub-meter (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, and a drone), while the spectral resolution spanned visible through SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands, and they were all collected at various time scales. We that found several common vegetation and post-fire spectral indices were correlated with ash cover (r = 0.6-0.85); however, the blue normalized difference vegetation index (BNDVI) with monthly Sentinel-2 imagery was especially well-suited for monitoring the change in ash cover during its ephemeral period. A map of the ash cover can be used to estimate the ash load, which can then be used as an input into a hydrologic model predicting ash transport and fate, helping to ultimately improve our ability to predict impacts on downstream water resources.

TI  - Study on Spatiotemporal Evolution of the Yellow River Delta Coastline from 1976 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta in China is the most active one for sea-land changes over all deltas worldwide, and its coastline evolution is critical to urban planning and environmental sustainability in coastal areas. Existing studies rarely used yearly temporal resolution, and lack more detailed and quantitative analysis of coastline evolution characteristics. This paper used visual interpretation to extract the coastline of the Yellow River Delta in year interval Landsat images for 45 years from 1976 to 2020, and analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of the coastline evolution through statistical methods such as calculating change values and change rate. The main results are as follows: (1) overall, the coastline of the Yellow River Delta presented a spatial pattern involving northern landward retreat and southern seaward expansion. Since 1990, the Yellow River Delta has entered a period of decline. In addition, the length of the artificial coastline increased by about 55 km; (2) in the Qingshuigou region, the land area and the coastline length increased first and then stabilized. The southeastern part of the Qingshuigou was in a state of erosion, while the northeastern part was expanding toward the sea along the north direction; (3) in the Diaokou region, the land area has been decreasing, but the reduction rate has gradually slowed down. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) through the research on the evolution model and mechanism of the coastline of the Yellow River Delta, it was found that human factors and natural factors were the two major driving factors that affect the evolution of the coastline; (2) a river branch appeared in the northern part of the Qingshuigou region in 2014 and became a major branch in 2020, which would affect the development of the coastal region of Chengdao. This study is important for better understanding the evolution pattern of the Yellow River Delta coastline and will help to provide guidance for coastline management and resource exploitation.

TI  - CNN-Based Individual Tree Species Classification Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) has shown promising performances in various remote sensing applications as a powerful tool. To explore the great potential of DL in improving the accuracy of individual tree species (ITS) classification, four convolutional neural network models (ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-40) were employed to classify four tree species using the combined high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data. A total of 1503 samples of four tree species, including maple, pine, locust, and spruce, were used in the experiments. When both WorldView-2 and airborne LiDAR data were used, the overall accuracies (OA) obtained by ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-40 were 90.9%, 89.1%, 89.1%, and 86.9%, respectively. The OA of ResNet-18 was increased by 4.0% and 1.8% compared with random forest (86.7%) and support vector machine (89.1%), respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the size of input images impacted on the classification accuracy of ResNet-18. It is suggested that the input size of ResNet models can be determined according to the maximum size of all tree crown sample images. The use of LiDAR intensity image was helpful in improving the accuracies of ITS classification and atmospheric correction is unnecessary when both pansharpened WorldView-2 images and airborne LiDAR data were used.

TI  - Study of Persistent Haze Pollution in Winter over Jinan (China) Based on Ground-Based and Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive study of the formation process of haze events in the Jinan area of China during winter is conducted based on the ground-based and satellite observation data from 1 December 2020 to 12 January 2021. According to variation of pollutant concentrations, two typical types of haze pollution are found in the Jinan area. During the type 1 haze pollution, the PM2.5 concentrations are greater than 75 mu gm(-3) and less than 115 mu gm(-3) with a short duration. The haze is mainly caused by local pollutant emissions and the accumulation of pollutants transported from areas around Jinan. By contrast, type 2 haze pollution episodes have a long duration and peak PM2.5 concentrations between 150 mu gm(-3) and 250 mu gm(-3), which is considered heavy pollution. Type 2 haze pollution is mainly caused by a mixture of long-range transported dust with locally emitted pollutants. Moreover, the unfavorable meteorological factors such as stable inversion layer, continuous cold high-pressure system, high relative humidity, and low wind speed play an important role in the formation of both types of haze pollution. In addition, there are significant photochemical processes during the haze pollutions. According to satellite data, the AOD in Jinan and surrounding areas is maintained at a high-level during haze pollution. It indicates that the local pollution is often accompanied by regional pollution during haze pollution events. This study reveals the formation process of haze pollution and promotes the study of regional climate change, which can provide guidance to the government in the prevention and control of haze pollution in East China.

TI  - Satellite Observation of the Marine Light-Fishing and Its Dynamics in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The South China Sea (SCS) is one of the most important fishery resource bases in the world. Marine fisheries, as a crucial component of regional food security and national revenue, raise wide concern about marine ecology, social-economic and political consequences at regional, national and local scales. The large-scale dynamic detection and analysis of fishing activity in the SCS is still unclear because of the accessibility of in-site data, finite automatic identification system (AIS) usage, complex geopolitics and poor additional data coverage. Nighttime light imagery (NTL) derived from low light imaging sensors and the popularity of light fishing in the SCS offers a unique way to unveil fishing activities and its dynamics. In this study, we proposed a set of algorithms for automatic detection of nighttime fishing activity and provided the first large-scale dynamic analysis of nighttime fishing activity in the SCS using monthly Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) images between 2012 and 2019. The proposed method effectively minimized the spatio-temporal fluctuations in radiance values of background and their implications to ship detection by integrating high radiance gradient detection and local adaptive thresholding. Further, nighttime fishing activity trajectories were decomposed into trend and seasonal components by using Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) to accurately access general trends and the seasonality of nighttime fishing activity in the SCS. The typical subregions analysis, environmental driver analysis, correlation coefficient analysis and hot spot analysis were integrated to characterize the nighttime fishing activity. It appears that the nighttime fishing activity in the SCS exhibited spatio-temporal variability and heterogeneity and was shaped by policy and natural factors such as holidays, annual Chinese fishery moratoria in the Chinese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and seasonal tropical storm activity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the characteristic of anisotropic reflectance of nighttime TOA (top-of-atmosphere) , a new method was proposed to evaluate the accuracy of on-orbit radiometric calibration of nighttime sensors using a relative accurate simulation of the nighttime radiative transfer. Specially, the Antarctic Dome C site was selected as the study area, and the nighttime on-orbit radiance was simulated by the MT2009 (Miller-Turner 2009) TOA lunar irradiance model and TOA BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) model. After the analysis of the consistency of VIIRS DNB (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suit Day/Night Band) observed and simulated radiance under the same geometry, it was found that their differences were about 4.97x10(-10) W.cm(-2).sr(-1) one order of magnitude blow the minimum detection threshold of VIIRS DNB (3x 10(-9)W.cm(-2).sr(-1)) during 2018-2020. So there is good performance of on-orbit radiometric calibration of VIIRS DNB on SNPP and NOAA-20 based on the error range of acceptable instrument sensitivity. Besides, an evaluation of on-orbit radiometric calibration stability of VIIRS DNB was conducted based on the distance-corrected radiance of SNPP VIIRS DNB and NOAA-20 VIIRS DNB. And it was found that when under the same lunar phase angle, the VIIRS DNB radiance kept a good consistency within 6% between SNPP and NOAA-20.

TI  - Effectiveness of machine learning methods for water segmentation with ROI as the label: A case study of the Tuul River in Mongolia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The carrying capacity of water resources is key to the sustainable development of arid and semi-arid regions. There are important challenges related to the detection of discontinuous and crooked water bodies in the vast Mongolian Plateau, despite the availability of remote sensing technology which has the advantage of facilitating water observations over large areas and timelines. Given the high cost and low coverage of high-resolution images and the low resolution of images with high coverage, this study proposes a pixel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) method for the application of water extracted from the region of interest (ROI) to mediumresolution Landsat images. The pixel-based CNN method combines the texture and spectral features of the ground object by connecting the center pixels of the images to the surrounding pixels. ROI is used instead of full-label datasets, reduce the difficulty of building labels in low-to-medium-resolution images. Taking the Tuul River in Mongolia as a case, the pixel-based CNN method, the normalized difference water index threshold (NDWI) method, the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) threshold method, U-net model in deep learning, and the pixel-based deep neural network (DNN) method were used with medium-resolution Landsat 8 images with ROI labels. The pixel-based CNN method shows better water extraction results for the cloud, cloud shadows, and building areas, compared with other methods. The method proposed in this study had the highest verification accuracy (92.07%). It also has the advantages of fewer training parameters and shorter training time. The training accuracies of the pixel-based CNN, pixel-based DNN, and U-net were 99.90%, 96.98%, and 93.70%, respectively. All training models and calling methods were uploaded to GitHub (https://github.com/CaryLee 17/Pixel-based-CNN).

TI  - Retrieval of Daily Mean VIIRS SST Products in China Seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important factors in regulating air-sea heat flux and, thus, climate change. Most of current global daily SST products are derived from one or two transient measurements of polar-orbiting satellites, which are not the same to daily mean SST values. In this study, high-temporal-resolution SST measurements (32-40 snapshots per day) from a geostationary satellite, FengYun-4A (FY-4A), are used to analyze the diurnal variation of SST in China seas. The results present a sinusoidal pattern of the diurnal variability in SST, with the maximum value at 13:00-15:00 CST and the minimum at 06:00-08:00 CST. Based on the diurnal variation of SST, a retrieval method for daily mean SST products from polar-orbiting satellites is established and applied to 7716 visible infrared imaging radiometer (VIIRS) data in China seas. The results suggest that it is feasible and practical for the retrieval of daily mean SST with an average RMSE of 0.133 degrees C. This retrieval method can also be utilized to other polar-orbiting satellites and obtain more daily mean satellite SST products, which will contribute to more accurate estimation and prediction between atmosphere and ocean in the future.

TI  - Toward a Simple and Generic Approach for Identifying Multi-Year Cotton Cropping Patterns Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable development goals of the United Nations, as well as the era of pandemics have introduced serious challenges for agricultural production and management. Precise management of agricultural practices based on satellite-borne remote sensing has been considered an effective means for monitoring cropping patterns and crop-farming patterns. Therefore, we proposed a simple and generic approach to identify multi-year cotton-cropping patterns based on time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, with few ground samples that covered many years, a simple classification algorithm, and had a high classification accuracy. In this approach, we extended the size of training samples using active learning, and we employed a random forest algorithm to extract multi-year cotton planting patterns based on dense time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data from 2014 to 2018. We created annual crop cultivation maps based on training samples with an accuracy greater than 95.69%. The accuracy of multi-year cotton cropping patterns was 96.93%. The proposed approach was effective and robust in identifying multi-year cropping patterns, and it could be applied in other regions.

AB  - The downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is a critical parameter of the surface radiation budget. Several DSR satellite products have been developed in recent years. In this study, five updated global satellite daily DSR products were evaluated using in situ measurements from 142 global sites with a special focus on high latitudes in 2004. These five products are Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic TOA and surface fluxes and clouds (CERES), Clouds, Albedo and Radiation Edition 2 data (CLARA), Global Land Surface Satellite Downward Shortwave Radiation (GLASS), Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) shortwave radiation product, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land surface Downward Shortwave Radiation (MCD18) with a spatial resolution of 100, 25, 5, 5, and 1 km, respectively. The CERES, BESS, and MCD18 provide full global coverage throughout the year, whereas CLARA and GLASS present different levels of seasonal data loss over high-latitude areas. The products were aggregated and compared at various spatial resolutions over different subareas. The overall accuracy increased after the products were aggregated to 100 km. However, the highest accuracy was achieved at a resolution of 25 km over high-latitude areas for GLASS and MCD18. When all products were evaluated at a resolution of 100 km, the global root-mean-square error of CERES, CLARA, GLASS, BESS, and MCD18 was 27.6, 29.1, 30.3, 29.6, and 31.6 W/m(2), respectively, and the mean bias difference was 2.2, 1.5,-1.8,-3.4, and-8.0 W/m2. The accuracies of most products are similar to 7 W/m(2) lower over high-latitude areas. A seasonal variation of the accuracies was observed for all products. It is particularly pronounced over high latitude areas. With respect to the long term, both in situ data, BESS, and CERES show insignificant trends, while CLARA and GLASS present dimming trend. Besides, CLARA and GLASS exhibit slight annual changes of 0.250 and -0.387 W/m(2) in the bias and 0.357 and 0.310 Wm(-2) in the RMSE in the past two decades. GLASS and MCD18 exhibit a superior performance over coastal regions but degrade over snow-covered areas. Potential refinements of current high-resolution DSR retrieval algorithms are suggested, which will improve the retrieval accuracy. Highly accurate products with a long-term stability, especially over high-latitude areas, are required for future climate change analyses.

TI  - Evaluation of Landsat 8-like Land Surface Temperature by Fusing Landsat 8 and MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatiotemporal-resolution land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in various environmental monitoring. However, due to the limitation of sensor trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions, such data are still unavailable. Therefore, the generation and verification of such data are of great value. The spatiotemporal fusion algorithm, which can be used to improve the spatiotemporal resolution, is widely used in Landsat and MODIS data to generate Landsat-like images, but there is less exploration of combining long-time series MODIS LST and Landsat 8 LST product to generate Landsat 8-like LST. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the long-time series Landsat 8 LST product and the Landsat 8-like LST generated by spatiotemporal fusion. In this study, based on the Landsat 8 LST product and MODIS LST product, Landsat 8-like LST is generated using Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM), and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) algorithm, and tested and verified in the research area located in Gansu Province, China. In this process, Landsat 8 LST product was verified based on ground measurements, and the fusion results were comprehensively evaluated based on ground measurements and actual Landsat 8 LST images. Ground measurements verification indicated that Landsat 8 LST product was highly consistent with ground measurements. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 2.862 K, and the coefficient of determination R-2 was 0.952 at All stations. Good fusion results can be obtained for the three spatiotemporal algorithms, and the ground measurements verified at All stations show that R-2 was more significant than 0.911. ESTARFM had the best fusion result (R-2 = 0.915, RMSE = 3.661 K), which was better than STARFM (R-2 = 0.911, RMSE = 3.746 K) and FSDAF (R-2 = 0.912, RMSE = 3.786 K). Based on the actual Landsat 8 LST images verification, the fusion images were highly consistent with actual Landsat 8 LST images. The average RMSE of fusion images about STARFM, ESTARFM, and FSDAF were 2.608 K, 2.245 K, and 2.565 K, respectively, and ESTARFM is better than STARFM and FSDAF in most cases. Combining the above verification, the fusion results of the three algorithms were reliable and ESTARFM had the highest fusion accuracy.

TI  - Uncertainty analysis of SVD-based spaceborne far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval using TanSat satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The singular value decomposition (SVD) method, a sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrieval approach, has been used widely in far-red SIF spaceborne retrievals on a global scale. However, due to its semiempirical nature, setting different parameter values may affect its retrieval accuracy, and ultimately have a large impact on its application. Hence, in this study, we evaluated the impact of parameter selection on the far-red SIF retrieval of this approach using TanSat satellite data. We first retrieved the far-red SIF within a narrow spectral window of 757.4-759.2 nm using the first four singular vectors (SVs) that were derived from the snow and soil spectra in a globally distributed training set. The retrievals are highly consistent with TanSat mission SIF (R-2 = 0.72), indicating the reliability of our retrieval results. Then, the uncertainty was executed based on the above SIF retrievals and evaluated from five metrics: the number of SVs, length of the fitting window, type of training set elements, proportion of training set elements, and spatial distribution of the training set. Results showed that an unwise selection of the number of SVs would result in large retrieval errors (R-2 = 0.03). Meanwhile, a fitting window that is too short or does not include a strong Fraunhofer line would cause severe errors and a large number of negative values (R-2 = 0.06). Further, failure to include training samples below the equatorial zone in the Southern Hemisphere, and high latitude samples in the Northern Hemisphere, leads to poorer outcomes (R-2 = 0.57). In contrast, the other global sampling metrics had little effect on the retrieval results (generally, R-2 > 0.97). Accordingly, the relevant suggestions for using this method in the future are listed in this study for reference, with the potential to improve the accuracy of SIF retrievals from ultra-high spectral resolution instruments in the far-red spectrum.

TI  - The potential of synthetic aperture radar interferometry for assessing meltwater lake dynamics on Antarctic ice shelves
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface meltwater drains on several Antarctic ice shelves, resulting in surface and sub-surface lakes that are potentially critical for the ice shelf collapse. Despite these phenomena, our understanding and assessment of the drainage and refreezing of these lakes is limited, mainly due to lack of field observations and to the limitations of optical satellite imagery during polar night and in cloudy conditions. This paper explores the potential of backscatter intensity and of interferometric coherence and phase from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery as an alternative to assess the dynamics of meltwater lakes. In four case study regions over Amery and Roi Baudouin ice shelves, East Antarctica, we examine spatial and temporal variations in SAR backscatter intensity and interferometric (InSAR) coherence and phase over several lakes derived from Sentinel-1A/B C-band SAR imagery. Throughout the year, the lakes are observed in a completely frozen state, in a partially frozen state with a floating ice lid and as open-water lakes. Our analysis reveals that the meltwater lake delineation is challenging during the melting period when the contrast between melting snow and lakes is indistinguishable. Despite this finding, we show using a combination of backscatter and InSAR observations that lake dynamics can be effectively captured during other non-summertime months. Moreover, our findings highlight the utility of InSAR-based observations for discriminating between refrozen ice and sub-surface meltwater and indicate the potential for phase-based detection and monitoring of rapid meltwater drainage events. The potential of this technique to monitor these meltwater change events is, however, strongly determined by the satellite revisit interval and potential changes in scattering properties due to snowfall or melt events.

TI  - Human and climatic drivers of land and water use from 1997 to 2019 in Tarim River basin, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and human activities change spatial and temporal distribution of water and land use. The Tarim River, the largest inland river in China, faced a long-term exploitation of land and water over a rapid economic development. We analyzed land and water use from 1997 to 2019 in Tarim River Basin by Landsat images, and data on hydrology, climate, population, economy and PM2.5 (air particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m). Agricultural land expanded the fastest (4-11%), followed by natural vegetation (15-16%) and water area (4-5%) with population and economic increase. Air quality (PM2.5 mu g m(-3)) improved in upper (62-27) and middle (48-17) reaches. The water area in lower increase 5% because of ecological water delivery since 2000. Land use in the lower reach was dominated by agriculture, where the downstream runoff consumption increased by 6.8 times. The average annual air temperature and precipitation gradually increased by 0.5 degrees C and 51 mm in source and 0.9 degrees C and 30 mm in main reaches. The average annual water consumption in upper and middle reaches was 4 x 10(9) m(3), accounting for 87% of input runoff in the main reach. Water consumption in middle reach increased by 33 times in 2009-2017. The industry structure was changing from primary to secondary and tertiary industry. To sum up, implementation of water saving strategies and ecological water delivery restored local ecology. Sustainable strategies should be applied facing industrialization. Furthermore, changing the industry structure and restoring the degraded farmlands to grasslands or forests would keep sustainability of Tarim River Basin.

TI  - Evaluation of Ecological Stability in Semi-Arid Open-Pit Coal Mining Area Based on Structure and Function Coupling during 2002-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-pit coal mining plays an important role in supporting national economic development; however, it has caused ecological problems and even seriously impacted regional ecological stability. Given the importance of maintaining ecological stability in semi-arid coal mining areas, this study used a coupling coordination degree approach based on the structural and functional state transition model (SFSTM) to evaluate the spatio-temporal variation of ecological stability from 2002 to 2017 by using MODIS and Landsat datasets in the semi-arid open-pit coal mining area. Besides, random points were created for different ecological stability levels (containing natural areas, coal mining areas, and reclamation areas) and segment linear regression was conducted to determine the structural change threshold for negative state transitions based on mining and positive state transitions based on reclamation. Furthermore, the impact factors of ecological stability were analyzed. Results showed that ecological stability fluctuated significantly over 16 years, showing a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. It was found that precipitation and temperature were the key natural factors affecting ecological stability, and mining activities constituted the dominant factor. The average perturbation distances to ecological stability from mining activities in the west, southwest, and east mining groups were 7500, 5500, and 8000 m, respectively. SFSTM is appliable to the coal mining ecosystem. Quantitative models of ecological stability response can help resolve ambiguity about management efficacy and the ecological stability results facilitate iterative updating of knowledge by using monitoring data from coal mining areas. Moreover, the proposed ecological structural threshold provides a useful early warning tool, which can aid in the reduction of ecosystem uncertainty and avoid reverse transformations of the positive state in the coal mining areas.

TI  - Mapping water bodies under cloud cover using remotely sensed optical images and a spatiotemporal dependence model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing imagery is commonly used to monitor the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of inland waters. Its usage, however, is limited by cloud contamination, which results in low-quality images or missing values. Selecting cloud-free scenes or combining multi-temporal images to produce a cloud-free composite image can partially overcome this problem at the cost of the monitoring frequency. Predicting the spectral values of cloudy areas based on the spectral characteristics is a possible solution; however, this is not appropriate for water because it changes rapidly. Reconstructing cloud-covered water areas using historical water-distribution data has good performance, but such methods are typically only suitable for lakes and reservoirs, not over vast and complex terrain. This paper proposes a category-based approach to reconstruct the water distribution in cloud-contaminated images using a spatiotemporal dependence model. The proposed method predicts the class label (water or land) of a cloudy pixel based on the neighboring pixel labels and those at the same position in images acquired on other dates according to historical spatiotemporal water-distribution data. The method was evaluated through eight experiments in different study regions using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could yield high-quality cloud-free classification maps and provide good water-extraction accuracy and consistency in most hydrological conditions, with an overall accuracy of up to 98%. The accuracy and practicality of the method render it promising for applications across a wide range of future research and monitoring efforts.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Time Interpolation of NDVI Composites on Phenology Trend Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate evaluation of shifts in vegetation phenology is essential for understanding of vegetation responses to climate change. Remote-sensing vegetation index (VI) products with multi-day scales have been widely used for phenology trend estimation. VI composites should be interpolated into a daily scale for extracting phenological metrics, which may not fully capture daily vegetation growth, and how this process affects phenology trend estimation remains unclear. In this study, we chose 120 sites over four vegetation types in the mid-high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, and then a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A4 daily surface reflectance data was used to generate a daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset in addition to an 8-day and a 16-day NDVI composite datasets from 2001 to 2019. Five different time interpolation methods (piecewise logistic function, asymmetric Gaussian function, polynomial curve function, linear interpolation, and spline interpolation) and three phenology extraction methods were applied to extract data from the start of the growing season and the end of the growing season. We compared the trends estimated from daily NDVI data with those from NDVI composites among (1) different interpolation methods; (2) different vegetation types; and (3) different combinations of time interpolation methods and phenology extraction methods. We also analyzed the differences between the trends estimated from the 8-day and 16-day composite datasets. Our results indicated that none of the interpolation methods had significant effects on trend estimation over all sites, but the discrepancies caused by time interpolation could not be ignored. Among vegetation types with apparent seasonal changes such as deciduous broadleaf forest, time interpolation had significant effects on phenology trend estimation but almost had no significant effects among vegetation types with weak seasonal changes such as evergreen needleleaf forests. In addition, trends that were estimated based on the same interpolation method but different extraction methods were not consistent in showing significant (insignificant) differences, implying that the selection of extraction methods also affected trend estimation. Compared with other vegetation types, there were generally fewer discrepancies between trends estimated from the 8-day and 16-day dataset in evergreen needleleaf forest and open shrubland, which indicated that the dataset with a lower temporal resolution (16-day) can be applied. These findings could be conducive for analyzing the uncertainties of monitoring vegetation phenology changes.

TI  - Evaluation of Six Satellite-Based Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux Products in the Vegetation Dominated Haihe River Basin of North China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, six satellite-based terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) products were evaluated in the vegetation dominated Haihe River basin of North China. These LE products include Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LE product, FLUXCOM LE product, Penman-Monteith-Leuning V2 (PML_V2) LE product, Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model datasets (GLEAM) LE product, Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) LE product, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (MOD16) LE product. Eddy covariance (EC) data collected from six flux tower sites and water balance method derived evapotranspiration (WBET) were used to evaluate these LE products at site and basin scales. The results indicated that all six LE products were able to capture the seasonal cycle of LE in comparison to EC observations. At site scale, GLASS LE product showed the highest coefficients of determination (R-2) (0.58, p < 0.01) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE) (28.2 W/m(2)), followed by FLUXCOM and PML products. At basin scale, the LE estimates from GLASS product provided comparable performance (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 18.8 mm) against WBET, compared with other LE products. Additionally, there was similar spatiotemporal variability of estimated LE from the six LE products. This study provides a vital basis for choosing LE datasets to assess regional water budget.

TI  - Fault Geometry and Mechanism of the Mw 5.7 Nakchu Earthquake in Tibet Inferred from InSAR Observations and Stress Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different types of focal mechanism solutions for the 19 March 2021 Mw 5.7 Nakchu earthquake, Tibet, limit our understanding of this earthquake's seismogenic mechanism and geodynamic process. In this study, the coseismic deformation field was determined and the geometric parameters of the seismogenic fault were inverted via Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing of Sentinel-1 data. The inversion results show that the focal mechanism solutions of the Nakchu earthquake are 237 degrees/69 degrees/-70 degrees (strike/dip/rake), indicating that the seismogenic fault is a NEE-trending, NW-dipping fault dominated by the normal faulting with minor sinistral strike-slip components. The regional tectonic stress field derived from the in-situ stress measurements shows that the orientation of maximum principal compressive stress around the epicenter of the Nakchu earthquake is NNE, subparallel to the fault strike, which controlled the dominant normal faulting. The occurrence of seven M >= 7.0 historical earthquakes since the M 7.0 Shenza earthquake in 1934 caused a stress increase of 1.16 x 10(5) Pa at the hypocenter, which significantly advanced the occurrence of the Nakchu earthquake. Based on a comprehensive analysis of stress fields and focal mechanisms of the Nakchu earthquake, we propose that the dominated normal faulting occurs to accommodate the NE-trending compression of the Indian Plate to the Eurasian Plate and the strong historical earthquakes hastened the process. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the geometry and mechanics of the seismogenic fault that produced the Nakchu earthquake.

TI  - Towards analysis ready data of optical CubeSat images: Demonstrating a hierarchical normalization framework at a wetland site
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical images of the Earth at very high spatial resolutions (VHR, typically < 5 m) are seeing rapid growth in volumes over the past 5 years, due in part to the fast-expanding constellations of CubeSats. Special preprocessing of these VHR images is required to ensure their geometric and radiometric consistency for quantitative analyses for a wide range of Earth and environmental sciences and applications. Here we describe a hierarchical normalization framework (HiNF) to achieve and evaluate geometric and radiometric normalization of these VHR images towards producing analysis ready data (ARD) of optical CubeSat images. We demonstrated HiNF at a spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic wetland site in northeastern Germany by generating a stack of temporally consistent -biweekly 5-m images over 8 years (2013-2020) at visible and near infrared bands (VNIR). The HiNF combined images from rigorously calibrated multispectral sensors onboard large satellites (Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2) and less well calibrated sensors onboard RapidEye (SmallSats) and PlanetScope (CubeSats). A two-stage radiometric normalization procedure produced two levels of image normalization and resulted in more normalized images that passed the quality control in time series compared to common one-stage procedures. The outcome of this novel procedure allows for downstream applications to balance between the quality and the quantity of available normalized CubeSat images in a time series. The HiNF provides a new approach to quantitative evaluations of radiometric normalizations using daily MODIS imagery as bridging benchmark data. The quantitative evaluations showed the HiNF resulted in greater normalization efficacy in the visible bands than in the NIR over the predominantly wetland area. The two normalization levels yielded sta-tistically similar efficacy for the NIR band and the widely-used normalized difference vegetation index according to the Chow test (at significance level of 0.05) but less so for the visible bands. The HiNF facilitates generating ARD of optical CubeSat images and assuring their qualities through its demonstrated efficacy and its quantitative evaluation approach. Such ARD-quality time series of VHR images from CubeSats allow for improved analyses and quantitative applications of this new stream of multispectral images at spatial scales that are better related to ground measurements and environmental management in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Classifying Individual Shrub Species in UAV Images-A Case Study of the Gobi Region of Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrublands are the main vegetation component in the Gobi region and contribute considerably to its ecosystem. Accurately classifying individual shrub vegetation species to understand their spatial distributions and to effectively monitor species diversity in the Gobi ecosystem is essential. High-resolution remote sensing data create vegetation type inventories over large areas. However, high spectral similarity between shrublands and surrounding areas remains a challenge. In this study, we provide a case study that integrates object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the random forest (RF) model to classify shrubland species automatically. The Gobi region on the southern slope of the Tian Shan Mountains in Northwest China was analyzed using readily available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB imagery (1.5 cm spatial resolution). Different spectral and texture index images were derived from UAV RGB images as variables for species classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted features from different types of variable sets (original bands, original bands + spectral indices, and original bands + spectral indices + texture indices). We tested the ability of several non-parametric decision tree models and different types of variable sets to classify shrub species. Moreover, we analyzed three main shrubland areas comprising different shrub species and compared the prediction accuracies of the optimal model in combination with different types of variable sets. We found that the RF model could generate higher accuracy compared with the other two models. The best results were obtained using a combination of the optimal variable set and the RF model with an 88.63% overall accuracy and 0.82 kappa coefficient. Integrating OBIA and RF in the species classification process provides a promising method for automatic mapping of individual shrub species in the Gobi region and can reduce the workload of individual shrub species classification.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperature Analysis for Fengyun-3C Data Using Oriented Elliptic Correlation Scales
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is critical for global climate change analysis and research. In this study, we used visible and infrared scanning radiometer (VIRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite for SST analysis, and applied the Kalman filtering methods with oriented elliptic correlation scales to construct SST fields. Firstly, the model for the oriented elliptic correlation scale was established for SST analysis. Secondly, observation errors from each type of SST data source were estimated using the optimal matched datasets, and background field errors were calculated using the model of oriented elliptic correlation scale. Finally, the blended SST analysis product was obtained using the Kalman filtering method, then the SST fields using the optimum interpolation (OI) method were chosen for comparison to validate results. The quality analysis for 2016 revealed that the Kalman analysis with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.3243 degrees C had better performance than did the OI analysis with a RMSE of 0.3911 degrees C, which was closer to the OISST product RMSE of 0.2897 degrees C. The results demonstrated that the Kalman filtering method with dynamic observation error and background error estimation was significantly superior to the OI method in SST analysis for FY-3C SST data.

TI  - Leveraging optical and SAR data with a UU-Net for large-scale road extraction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Road datasets are fundamental and imperative for traffic management and urban planning. Different high resolution optical remote sensing images are widely used for automatic road extraction but the results are usually limited to local scale and spectral confusions in barren and cropland, while accurate large-scale road extraction remains challenging. In this study, we incorporated medium resolution optical and SAR data, i.e., 10 meter resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, for road extraction at a large scale and evaluated the contribution of different data sources. We developed a United U-Net (UU-Net) to fuse optical and SAR data for road extraction, which was trained and evaluated on a large-scale multisource road extraction dataset. The UU-Net achieved better accuracy than traditional deep convolutional networks with optical or SAR data alone, which obtained an average F1 of 0.5502 and an average IoU of 0.4021, outperforming in 160 out of 200 (80%) 0.5-by-0.5 degree evaluation grids. The results indicated that SAR contributes more to road extraction in barren land, while optical data contributes more to large slope areas. The road accuracy is positively related to elevation and urban percentage, which distributes higher in eastern China and lower in western. The road centerline from 10 m road showed comparable results with that from Open Street Map (OSM), indicating its promising applications to support large-scale urban transportation studies.

TI  - Detecting 2020 Coral Bleaching Event in the Northwest Hainan Island Using CoralTemp SST and Sentinel-2B MSI Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, coral reef ecosystems have been affected by global climate change and human factors, resulting in frequent coral bleaching events. A severe coral bleaching event occurred in the northwest of Hainan Island, South China Sea, in 2020. In this study, we used the CoralTemp sea surface temperature (SST) and Sentinel-2B imagery to detect the coral bleaching event. From 31 May to 3 October, the average SST of the study area was 31.01 degrees C, which is higher than the local bleaching warning threshold value of 30.33 degrees C. In the difference images of 26 July and 4 September, a wide range of coral bleaching was found. According to the temporal variation in single band reflectance, the development process of bleaching is consistent with the changes in coral bleaching thermal alerts. The results show that the thermal stress level is an effective parameter for early warning of large-scale coral bleaching. High-resolution difference images can be used to detect the extent of coral bleaching. The combination of the two methods can provide better support for coral protection and research.

TI  - A Pixel-Based Vegetation Greenness Trend Analysis over the Russian Tundra with All Available Landsat Data from 1984 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As Arctic warming continues, its impact on vegetation greenness is complex, variable and inherently scale-dependent. Studies with multiple spatial resolution satellite observations, with 30 m resolution included, on tundra greenness have been implemented all over the North American tundra. However, finer resolution studies on the greenness trends in the Russian tundra have only been carried out at a limited local or regional scale and the spatial heterogeneity of the trend remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the fine spatial resolution dataset Landsat archive from 1984 to 2018 over the entire Russian tundra and produced pixel-by-pixel greenness trend maps with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The entire Russian tundra was divided into six geographical regions based on World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ecoregions. A Theil-Sen regression (TSR) was used for the trend identification and the changed pixels with a significance level p < 0.05 were retained in the final results for a subsequent greening/browning trend analysis. Our results indicated that: (1) the number of valid Landsat observations was spatially varied. The Western and Eastern European Tundras (WET and EET) had denser observations than other regions, which enabled a trend analysis during the whole study period from 1984 to 2018; (2) the most significant greening occurred in the Yamal-Gydan tundra (WET), Bering tundra and Chukchi Peninsula tundra (CT) during 1984-2018. The EET had a greening trend of 2.3% and 6.6% and the WET of 3.4% and 18% during 1984-1999 and 2000-2018, respectively. The area of browning trend was relatively low when we first masked the surface water bodies out before the trend analysis; and (3) the Landsat-based greenness trend was broadly similar to the AVHRR-based trend over the entire region but AVHRR retrieved more browning areas due to spectral mixing adjacent effects. Higher resolution images and field measurement studies are strongly needed to understand the vegetation trend over the Russian tundra ecosystem.

TI  - The detection rate of methylene blue combined with another tracer in sentinel lymph node biopsy of early-stage breast cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Methylene blue (MB) alone or combined with 99mtechnetium-labeled sulphur colloid (Tc99m) or indocyanine green (ICG) is widely used for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of early-stage breast cancer in developing countries and regions. However, studies investigating the effectiveness of MB combined with another tracer have produced heterogeneous results. The purpose of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to evaluate the detection rate of MB alone, MB + Tc99m, and MB + ICG, and to examine the differences between the 3 methods.Methods: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search on the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang Data databases from inception to October 2021. The meta-analysis included 7,498 patients in 49 studies. The risk of bias for each study was independently assessed as low, moderate, or high using criteria adapted from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Fixed- and random-effects models were used to calculate pooled estimates. Mixed-comparison analysis using random-effects models. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by I2 statistics and evaluated publication bias using Begg's test.Results: The identification rate (IR), false-negative rate (FNR), sensitivity (SEN), and accuracy rate (AR) using MB + Tc99m were 96%, 7%, 93%, and 96%, respectively; the IR, FNR, SEN, and AR using MB + ICG were 97%, 7%, 93%, and 97%, respectively. The NMA found that IR and AR between MB + ICG and MB + Tc99m was OR =1.37 (95% CI: 0.41-4.20) and OR = 1.33 (95% CI: 0.56-3.32), respectively.Discussion: Our results are similar to those of most previous studies, and meta-analysis showed that the MB + Tc99m or MB + ICG mapping methods can be used to obtain higher IR and lower FNR than MB alone. Our NMA showed no statistical significance between MB + Tc99m and MB + ICG with IR and AR. Both MB + Tc99m and MB + ICG can be used as effective mapping methods in SLNB of early-stage breast cancer to improve the detection rate.

TI  - The Applicability of Remote Sensing Models of Soil Salinization Based on Feature Space
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a major challenge for the sustainable use of land resources. An optimal remote sensing inversion model could monitor regional soil salinity across diverse geographical areas. In this study, the feature space method was used to study the applicability of the inversion model for typical salt-affected soils in China (Yanqi Basin (arid area) and Kenli County (coastal area)), and to obtain soil salinity grade distribution maps. The salinity index (SI) surface albedo (Albedo)model was the most accurate in both arid and coastal regions with overall accuracy reaching 93.3% and 88.8%, respectively. The sensitivity factors for the inversion of salinity in both regions were the same, indicating that the SI-Albedo model is applicable for monitoring salinity in arid and coastal areas of China. We combined Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager image data and field data to obtain the distribution pattern of soil salinity using the SI-Albedo model and proposed corresponding countermeasures for soil salinity in the Yanqi Basin and Kenli County according to the degree of salinity. This study on soil salinity in arid and coastal areas of China will provide a useful reference for future research on soil salinity both in China and globally.

TI  - Mapping Cropland Burned Area in Northeastern China by Integrating Landsat Time Series and Multi-Harmonic Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cropland burned area estimation is crucial for air quality modeling and cropland management. However, current global burned area products have been primarily derived from coarse spatial resolution images which cannot fulfill the spatial requirement for fire monitoring at local levels. In addition, there is an overall lack of accurate cropland straw burning identification approaches at high temporal and spatial resolution. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm to capture burned area in croplands using dense Landsat time series image stacks. Cropland burning shows a short-term seasonal variation and a long-term dynamic trend, so a multi-harmonic model is applied to characterize fire dynamics in cropland areas. By assessing a time series of the Burned Area Index (BAI), our algorithm detects all potential burned areas in croplands. A land cover mask is used on the primary burned area map to remove false detections, and the spatial information with a moving window based on a majority vote is employed to further reduce salt-and-pepper noise and improve the mapping accuracy. Compared with the accuracy of 67.3% of MODIS products and that of 68.5% of Global Annual Burned Area Map (GABAM) products, a superior overall accuracy of 92.9% was obtained by our algorithm using Landsat time series and multi-harmonic model. Our approach represents a flexible and robust way of detecting straw burning in complex agriculture landscapes. In future studies, the effectiveness of combining different spectral indices and satellite images can be further investigated.

TI  - High-Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimation Based on the Distributed Perception Deep Neural Network Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate measurement of the PM2.5 individual exposure level is a key issue in the study of health effects. However, the lack of historical data and the minute coverage of ground monitoring points are obstacles to the study of such issues. Based on the aerosol optical depth provided by NASA, combined with ground monitoring data and meteorological data, it is an effective method to estimate the near-ground concentration of PM2.5. With the deepening of related research, the models used have developed from univariate and multivariate linear models to nonlinear models such as support vector machine, random forest model, and deep learning neural network model. Among them, the depth neural network model has better performance. However, in the existing research, the variables used are input into the same neural network together, that is, the complex relationship caused by the lag effect of features and the correlation and partial correlation between features have not been considered. The above neural network framework can not be well applied to the complex situation of atmospheric systems and the estimation accuracy of the model needs to be improved. This is the first problem that we need to be overcome. Secondly, in the missing data value processing, the existing studies mostly use single interpolation methods such as linear fitting and Kriging interpolation. However, because the time and place of data missing are complex and changeable, a single method is difficult to deal with a large area of strip and block missing data. Moreover, the linear fitting method is easy to smooth out the special data in bad weather. This is the second problem that we need to overcome. Therefore, we construct a distributed perception deep neural network model (DP-DNN) and spatiotemporal multiview interpolation module to overcome problems 1 and 2. In empirical research, based on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-Shandong region in 2018, we introduce 50 features such as meteorology, NDVI, spatial-temporal feature to analyze the relationship between AOD and PM2.5, and test the performance of DP-DNN and spatiotemporal multiview interpolation module. The results show that after applying the spatiotemporal multiview interpolation module, the average proportion of missing data decreases from 52.1% to 4.84%, and the relative error of the results is 27.5%. Compared with the single interpolation method, this module has obvious advantages in accuracy and level of completion. The mean absolute error, relative error, mean square error, and root mean square error of DP-DNN in time prediction are 17.7 mu g/m(3), 46.8%, 766.2 g(2)/m(6), and 26.9 mu g/m(3), respectively, and in space prediction, they are 16.6 mu g/m(3), 41.8%, 691.5 mu g(2)/m(6), and 26.6 mu g/m(3). DP-DNN has higher accuracy and generalization ability. At the same time, the estimation method in this paper can estimate the PM2.5 of the selected longitude and latitude, which can effectively solve the problem of insufficient coverage of China's meteorological environmental quality monitoring stations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluates spatial and temporal characteristics of the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B)'s outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data based on NOAA OLR data and the GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project) precipitation data over the Asian-Australian region during 2011-2019. In terms of climatological distribution patterns and interannual standard deviation, FY-3B OLR are quite consistent with NOAA OLR, with annual and seasonal pattern correlation coefficients all exceeding 0.93. There are some discrepancies in the OLR magnitude between FY-3B and NOAA, especially for the OLR climatology; the climatological OLR from FY-3B are systematically larger than those from NOAA over the whole study region. In addition, examination of the temporal correlation coefficients between OLR and precipitation over the Asian-Australian monsoon (AAM) region reveals that both of the OLR datasets have captured the widespread negative correlation with precipitation, and FY-3B OLR exhibits a stronger relationship to precipitation over land. Moreover, FY-3B OLR exhibits better responses to the precipitation anomalies over India during the extreme El Nino and La Nina events. These results suggest that the FY-3B OLR dataset is of high quality and worthy of further global application.

TI  - Study on transfer learning ability for classifying marsh vegetation with multi-sensor images using DeepLabV3+and HRNet deep learning algorithms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The verification of the transfer learning ability of the convolutional neural network in the classification of natural vegetation is relatively lacking. In this paper, 16 combination scenarios of multispectral images in marsh vegetation were constructed. The influence of the combination with different spatial resolution gradients and spectral dimensions on the classification accuracy of marsh vegetation was systematically studied. Multi-sensor images were used to evaluate the transfer learning ability of DeepLabV3+ and HRNet algorithms in marsh vegetation, and analyse the transfer learning effect of two algorithms in different spatial resolution and spectral ranges. The majority voting method was used to fuse the classifications of high, medium and low spatial resolution images. Based on the largest area method, the fusion results were integrated with multi-scale segmentation to explore the classification ability of the integration of pixel-based classification and object-based classification. The average accuracies of different spatial resolutions to vegetation in multispectral images were statistically analysed in order to quantitatively study the classification ability of spatial resolution to marsh vegetation. The results indicated that: (1) image combination improved the classification accuracy of marsh vegetation in lowresolution images, and decreased the classification accuracy of vegetation in high- and medium-resolution images based on DeepLabV3+ and HRNet algorithms; (2) when GF-1 and Sentinel-2A images were used for combination, the spectral range increased by 1565-1655 nm and 2100-2280 nm from 450-900 nm, the classification accuracy of GF-1 image improved by 0.93-1.77%, and the classification accuracy of Sentinel-2A image decreased by 2.34-4.15%; (3) DeepLabV3+ and HRNet algorithms both have good transfer learning capabilities in the classification of marsh vegetation, but the transfer learning ability was better in images with different spatial resolutions in similar spectral ranges than in images with different spectral ranges; (4) the integration of object-based segmentation and pixel-based classifications (DeepLabV3+ and HRNet algorithms) improved the accuracy, and the growth rate of overall accuracy reached 4.45-5%; (5) the classification of water in images with different spatial resolution gradients had the largest difference, and the accuracy of deep-water marsh vegetation was lower than that of shrub and shallow-water marsh vegetation.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation on the ecological function of groundwater in the Shiyang River watershed
T2  - JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - With an arid climate and shortage of water resources, the groundwater dependent ecosystems in the oasis-desert ecotone of the Shiyang River Watershed has been extremely damaged, and the water crisis in the oasis has become a major concern in the social and the scientific community. In this study, the degeneration characteristics of the groundwater ecological function was identified and comprehensive evaluated, based on groundwater depth data, vegetation quadrat and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat program. The results showed that (1) the suitable groundwater depth for sustainable ecology in the Shiyang River Watershed is about 2-4 m; (2) the terms of degenerative, qualitative and disastrous stages of the groundwater ecological function are defined with the groundwater depths of about 5 m, 7 m and 10 m; (3) generally, the groundwater ecological function in the oasis-desert ecotone of the lower reaches of Shiyang River Watershed is weak with an area of 1 397.9 km(2) identified as the severe deterioration region, which accounted 74.7% of the total area. In the meantime, the percentages of the good, mild and moderate deterioration areas of groundwater ecological function are 3.5%, 5.5% and 16.3%, respectively, which were mainly distributed in the Qingtu lake area and the southeastern area of the Shoucheng town; (4) the degradation and shrinkage of natural oasis could be attributed to the dramatic groundwater decline, which is generally caused by irrational use of water and soil resources. This study could provide theoretical basis and scientific support for the decision-making in environmental management and ecological restoration of the Shiyang River Watershed.

TI  - PSGAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Remote Sensing Image Pan-Sharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the problem of remote sensing image pan-sharpening from the perspective of generative adversarial learning. We propose a novel deep neural network-based method named pansharpening GAN (PSGAN). To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts at producing high-quality pan-sharpened images with generative adversarial networks (GANs). The PSGAN consists of two components: a generative network (i.e., generator) and a discriminative network (i.e., discriminator). The generator is designed to accept panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images as inputs and maps them to the desired high-resolution (HR) MS images, and the discriminator implements the adversarial training strategy for generating higher fidelity pan-sharpened images. In this article, we evaluate several architectures and designs, namely, two-stream input, stacking input, batch normalization layer, and attention mechanism to find the optimal solution for pan-sharpening. Extensive experiments on QuickBird, GaoFen-2, and WorldView-2 satellite images demonstrate that the proposed PSGANs not only are effective in generating high-quality HR MS images and superior to state-of-the-art methods but also generalize well to full-scale images.

TI  - A novel Landsat-based automated mapping of marsh wetland in the headwaters of the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Indus Rivers, southwestern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands not only affect the local hydrology and ecosystems, but also regulate the conditions of humanenvironment. However, the availability of accurate wetland data remains a key challenge in wetland research. This study attempts to address this problem through a novel mapping framework that is based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), feature optimization, and the random forest (RF) model (GFORF). This framework was built to map high-accuracy wetland data on the headwaters of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus rivers (HBGIR) in the western Tibetan Plateau (TP). Four time periods were examined: 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017. Our results showed that the overall accuracy for the acquired wetland data was 82.73%, 83.16%, 82.47%, and 88.14% in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, the feature optimization results showed that the spectral indices feature was the main contributor to the accuracy of wetland mapping, with the highest value being 26.9%. The seasonal factors, surface reflectance, auxiliary data, and texture contributed 21.8%, 21.6%, 21.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. Combining the seasonal features and auxiliary data of distances to rivers significantly improved the mapping accuracy of the wetlands by approximately 14%, 24%, 11%, and 10% in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. In addition, our analysis showed that the wetland areas in the HBGIR amounted to 5177.39 km2, accounting for 5.82% of the total area. Over the 30-year observation period, the overall consolidation of the wetlands was characterized by a slight expansionary phase, with an average increase of 0.16% per year from 1990 to 2017. As a result of the improvement in the accuracy of wetland mapping in alpine areas, the change dynamics of wetlands was revealed, which provides justification for implementing ongoing wetland ecological services and protection measures.

TI  - Fitting of magnetic measurements of Swarm satellites based on 3D surface spline model
T2  - APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilizes the 62208000 Swarm satellite data to establish a high-precision main magnetic field at the height of the satellites in China and its adjacent regions. The CHAOS-6 model is used to remove the crustal and external fields and obtain 2788 main field grid data. We use the main field grid data to build a three-dimensional (3D) surface spline (3DSS) model of the satellite altitude in China. Other regional models (namely the 3D, two-dimensional (2D) Taylor, and 2D surface spline models) and the CHAOS-6 model are employed to model and analyze the same region. The results show that the 3DSS model can represent a good fitting for the northward (X) and eastward (Y) components and the total intensity (F). This model demonstrates the most stable results for the 20 points that did not take part in the modeling. Compared with the other three regional models, the root-mean-square error values and the average residuals of the new model are approximately 65% and 69% lower for each component, respectively. This study does not rely on ground station data to derive a more accurate regional main field model. The results further show that less data height difference and high-density data distributions greatly improve the regional model accuracy. The new model has a certain application value to related space geophysics, such as in spatial positioning and navigation, and to the study of regional magnetic anomalies.

TI  - Mapping standing dead trees in temperate montane forests using a pixel-and object-based image fusion method and stereo WorldView-3 imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the distribution of standing dead trees (SDT) is essential for forest biodiversity estimation, forest disturbances monitoring, and forest management strategy planning. Although remote sensing techniques offer unique capabilities to map SDT over large areas, three major hurdles exist: (1) the sporadic distribution of SDT in the study area; (2) often poor spectral separability between SDT and bare ground in forests; (3) the prominent spectral variability within SDT due to variations in background effect and canopy illumination. To address these problems, we proposed a pixel- and object-based image fusion (POBIF) approach using very high-resolution (VHR) stereo WorldView-3 (WV-3) data. The stereo WV-3 derived spectral bands, canopy height model (CHM), vegetation indices (VIs), and texture features were used as inputs in six classification scenarios with different variable combinations. A deep learning algorithm, deep neural network (DNN), and two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were utilized to process the pixel-based (PB) and object-based (OB) information. All PB and OB classifiers were then combined using a stacked generalization strategy to develop the POBIF model. Comparing the six scenarios we assessed the importance of the CHM, VIs, and textures for accurate SDT mapping. As a result, we found (1) the POBIF outperformed both PB and OB methods for SDT mapping, generating notably higher F1-score (p < 0.05); (2) Adding the CHM reduced the commission and omission errors caused by bare ground and artificial surfaces, and the highest classification accuracy was achieved when combing all the WV-3 derived variables; (3) SDT covered 0.89% of the forest areas in the study area and was particularly distributed on higher and steeper north-facing (northeast and northwest) slopes. Large tracts of SDT were found in the strictly protected forests. The study highlights the potential of VHR stereo WV-3 imagery and the POBIF for SDT mapping in a temperate montane forest area with high accuracy. The map created in this study could be used for guiding field investigations and for planning management measures.

TI  - Using remote sensing to monitor the spring phenology of Acadia National Park across elevational gradients
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenup dates and their responses to elevation and temperature variations across the mountains of Acadia National Park are monitored using remote sensing data, including Landsat 8 surface reflectances (at a 30-m spatial resolution) and VIIRS reflectances adjusted to a nadir view (gridded at a 500-m spatial resolution), during the 2013-2016 growing seasons. The 30-m resolution provides a better scale for studying the phenology variation across elevational gradients than the 500-m resolution, as greenup dates monitored at 30-m scale have better agreement with leaf-out dates recorded in the field alongside the north-south-oriented hiking trails on three of the park's tallest mountains (466 m, 418 m, and 380 m), and can provide landcover-specific analysis. The spring phenology responses to temperature and elevation vary among different spatial scales. Greenup dates of Acadia National Park monitored at 30-m scale show a weak advancing trend with higher spring temperature, while greenup dates monitored at 500 m show a weak delaying trend. The species mix within landcover at 30-m scale could weaken the advancing trend detected at field observation level. The landcover mix and elevation variation within 500-m scale could alter the spring phenology response to spring temperature variation. Greenup dates monitored at both 30-m and 500-m scales vary among different elevational zones, aspects, landcovers, and years. However, the relationship between greenup dates and elevation is rather weak.

TI  - Evaluation of FY-3/VIRR Sea Surface Temperature Data for Climate Applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the sea surface temperature (SST) products derived from the visible infrared radiometer on board the Fengyun-3 satellites (FY-3/VIRR) during 2016-2018 from the perspective of climate applications. The data had previously been reprocessed by the National Satellite Meteorological Center of China Meteorological Administration based on an updated SST retrieval algorithm. The overall consistency between the FY-3/VIRR SST data and the optimum interpolation SST version 2.1 (OIv2.1) was better for monthly means than for pentad means, and showed a clear dependence on the season and location. There was better consistency in winter than in summer, and in the tropical central-eastern Pacific than in the western Pacific warm pool, tropical North Indian Ocean, and tropical Atlantic Ocean. The monthly deviation of the global average SST anomaly was -0.03 +/- 0.07 degrees C and the average root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) presented clear seasonal fluctuations with a maximum of approximately 0.5 degrees C in summer. The poor consistency of the FY-3/VIRR SST in summer may be partially attributed to the bias of the OIv2.1 data in global oceans (especially the Indian Ocean) as a result of the spatially heterogeneous in situ measurements from ships, buoys, and Argo floats. Convective activities and clouds in the tropics may also influence the accuracy of the FY-3/VIRR SST retrievals. The Nino SST indices based on both FY-3/VIRR and OIv2.1 SST data displayed a generally similar evolution, including the start and end of El Nino and La Nina events and their amplitudes, although the deviations were slightly larger when the Pacific SST anomaly was in the neutral state of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The deviations varied greatly with season in the tropical Indian and Atlantic oceans, suggesting the need to perform further analyses and validation of the FY-3/VIRR SST products in these two basins.

TI  - An Efficient Group-Based Replica Placement Policy for Large-Scale Geospatial 3D Raster Data on Hadoop
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial three-dimensional (3D) raster data have been widely used for simple representations and analysis, such as geological models, spatio-temporal satellite data, hyperspectral images, and climate data. With the increasing requirements of resolution and accuracy, the amount of geospatial 3D raster data has grown exponentially. In recent years, the processing of large raster data using Hadoop has gained popularity. However, data uploaded to Hadoop are randomly distributed onto datanodes without consideration of the spatial characteristics. As a result, the direct processing of geospatial 3D raster data produces a massive network data exchange among the datanodes and degrades the performance of the cluster. To address this problem, we propose an efficient group-based replica placement policy for large-scale geospatial 3D raster data, aiming to optimize the locations of the replicas in the cluster to reduce the network overhead. An overlapped group scheme was designed for three replicas of each file. The data in each group were placed in the same datanode, and different colocation patterns for three replicas were implemented to further reduce the communication between groups. The experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces the network overhead during data acquisition for 3D raster data in the Hadoop cluster, and maintains the Hadoop replica placement requirements.

TI  - Toward the Estimation of All-Weather Daytime Downward Longwave Radiation over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward longwave radiation (DLR) is a critical parameter for radiation balance, energy budget, and water cycle studies at regional and global scales. Accurate estimation of the all-weather DLR with a high temporal resolution is important for the estimation of the surface net radiation and evapotranspiration. However, most DLR products involve instantaneous DLR estimates based on polar orbiting satellite data under clear-sky conditions. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the performances of different models in the estimation of DLR over the Tibetan Plateau, which is a focus area of climate change study, this study tests eight methods for clear-sky conditions and six methods for cloudy conditions based on ground-measured data. It is found that the Dilley and O'Brien model and the Lhomme model are most suitable for clear-sky conditions and cloudy conditions, respectively. For the Dilley and O'Brien model, the average root mean square error (RMSE) of DLR under clear-sky conditions is approximately 22.5 W/m(2) for nine ground sites; for the Lhomme model, the average RMSE is approximately 23.2 W/m(2). Based on the estimated cloud fraction and meteorological data provided by the China Land Surface Data Assimilation System (CLDAS), hourly all-weather daytime DLR with a 0.0625 degrees resolution over the Tibetan Plateau is estimated. Results demonstrate that the average RMSE of the estimated hourly all-weather DLR is approximately 26.4 W/m(2). With the combined all-weather DLR model, the hourly all-weather daytime DLR dataset with a 0.0625 degrees resolution from 2008 to 2016 over the Tibetan Plateau is generated. This dataset can contribute to studies associated with the radiation balance and energy budget, water cycle, and climate change over the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Using Machine Learning Algorithms on Google Earth Engine for Munneru River Basin, India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing human population accelerates alterations in land use and land cover (LULC) over time, putting tremendous strain on natural resources. Monitoring and assessing LULC change over large areas is critical in a variety of fields, including natural resource management and climate change research. LULC change has emerged as a critical concern for policymakers and environmentalists. As the need for the reliable estimation of LULC maps from remote sensing data grows, it is critical to comprehend how different machine learning classifiers perform. The primary goal of the present study was to classify LULC on the Google Earth Engine platform using three different machine learning algorithms-namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART)-and to compare their performance using accuracy assessments. The LULC of the study area was classified via supervised classification. For improved classification accuracy, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and NDWI (normalized difference water index) indices were also derived and included. For the years 2016, 2018, and 2020, multitemporal Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data with spatial resolutions of 10 m and 30 m were used for the LULC classification. 'Water bodies', 'forest', 'barren land', 'vegetation', and 'built-up' were the major land use classes. The average overall accuracy of SVM, RF, and CART classifiers for Landsat-8 images was 90.88%, 94.85%, and 82.88%, respectively, and 93.8%, 95.8%, and 86.4% for Sentinel-2 images. These results indicate that RF classifiers outperform both SVM and CART classifiers in terms of accuracy.

TI  - Evaluation of the Performance of Time-Series Sentinel-1 Data for Discriminating Rock Units
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential use of time-series Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for rock unit discrimination has never been explored in previous studies. Here, we employed time-series Sentinel-1 data to discriminate Dananhu formation, Xinjiang group, Granite, Wusu group, Xishanyao formation, and Diorite in Xinjiang, China. Firstly, the temporal variation of the backscatter metrics (backscatter coefficient and coherence) from April to October derived from Sentinel-1, was analyzed. Then, the significant differences of the time-series SAR metrics among different rock units were checked using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and Tukey's honest significant difference test. Finally, random forest models were used to discriminate rock units. As for the input features, there were four groups: (1) time-series backscatter metrics, (2) single-date backscatter metrics, (3) time-series backscatter metrics at VV, and (4) VH channel. In each feature group, there were three sub-groups: backscatter coefficient, coherence, and combined use of backscatter coefficient and coherence. Our results showed that time-series Sentinel-1 data could improve the discrimination accuracy by roughly 9% (from 55.4% to 64.4%), compared to single-date Sentinel-1 data. Both VV and VH polarization provided comparable results. Coherence complements the backscatter coefficient when discriminating rock units. Among the six rock units, the Granite and Xinjiang group can be better differentiated than the other four rock units. Though the result still leaves space for improvement, this study further demonstrates the great potential of time-series Sentinel-1 data for rock unit discrimination.

TI  - Application of red edge band in remote sensing extraction of surface water body: a case study based on GF-6 WFV data in arid area
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper mainly researches the application method of red edge band in water body remote sensing extraction. Gaofen-6 (GF-6) WFV data were chosen for the high spatial resolution, more bands, and wide width. Two new methods were proposed: the single-band threshold method based on the red edge 2 band and the decision tree model method based on the combined operation of the green band, red band, near infrared band, red edge 1 band, and red edge 2 band. Four traditional methods were used for comparing the extraction accuracy. Two study areas with different characteristics were chosen to analyze the reliability of the proposed method, one mountainous and one urban region, both located in Minqin, Gansu, China, which is a typical arid area. The results showed that the two red edge bands of the GF-6 WFV data can be utilized to extract water body information. Kappa coefficients extracted from the single-band threshold method based on the red edge 2 band in water bodies in mountainous and urban areas reached 96.18% and 93.21%, respectively. The decision tree method has the best extraction effect. Kappa coefficients of this method in mountain and urban water bodies were 97.73% and 94.41%, respectively.

TI  - Opportunity for GNSS Reflectometry in Sensing the Regional Climate and Soil Moisture Instabilities in Myanmar
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate crisis is happening globally, and the consequent process has revealed soil evolution and meteorological interactions. The GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique recently encompassed sea surface monitoring, land changes, and snow sensing in addition to position, navigation, and timing. After the launch of NASA's eight CYGNSS satellites, spaceborne soil moisture retrieval has become more opportune in a global and regional investigation. The research carried out by the CYGNSS DDM SNR with SMAP data to correlate diurnal mean soil moisture sensing was analyzed in the regional study of Myanmar, which is prone to climatic and weather conditions. The results showed that spaceborne GNSS-R soil moisture sensitivity was very useful during seasonal changes in regional observation. The DDM SNR surface reflectivity was strongly correlated with soil moisture according to surface temperature variations prepared from SMAP passive reflectometry. Sentinel SAR-1 data included the validation and verification of flood-prone areas affected by tropical storm surges or weather depressions in the monsoon season. The availability of surface reflectivity primarily relied on the surface roughness, surface temperature, and vegetation opacity for soil moisture retrieval.

TI  - Investigation of Vegetation Changes in Different Mining Areas in Liaoning Province, China, Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining can provide necessary mineral resources for humans. However, mining activities may cause damage to the surrounding ecology and environment. Vegetation change analysis is a key tool for evaluating damage to ecology and the environment. Liaoning is one of the major mining provinces in China, with rich mineral resources and long-term, high-intensity mining activities. Taking Liaoning Province as an example, vegetation change in six mining areas was investigated using multisource remote sensing data to evaluate ecological and environmental changes. Based on MODIS NDVI series data from 2000 to 2019, change trends of vegetation were evaluated using linear regression. According to the results, there are large highly degraded vegetation areas in the Anshan, Benxi, and Yingkou mining areas, which indicates that mining activities have seriously damaged the vegetation in these areas. In contrast, there are considerable areas with improved vegetation in the Anshan, Fushun, and Fuxin mining areas, which indicates that ecological reclamation has played a positive role in these areas. Based on Sentinel-2A data, leaf chlorophyll content was inferred by using the vegetation index MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) after measurement of leaf spectra and chlorophyll content were carried out on the ground to validate the performance of MTCI. According to the results, the leaf chlorophyll content in the mines is generally lower than in adjacent areas in these mining areas with individual differences. In the Yingkou mining area, the chlorophyll content in adjacent areas is close to the magnesite mines, which means the spillover effect of environmental pollution in mines should be considerable. In the Anshan, Benxi, and Diaobingshan mining areas, the environmental stress on adjacent areas is slight. All in all, iron and magnesite open-pit mines should be monitored closely for vegetation destruction and stress due to the high intensity of mining activities and serious pollution. In contrast, the disturbance to vegetation is limited in resource-exhausted open-pit coal mines and underground coal mines. It is suggested that land reclamation should be enhanced to improve the vegetation in active open-pit mining areas, such as the Anshan, Benxi, and Yingkou mining areas. Additionally, environmental protection measures should be enhanced to relieve vegetation stress in the Yingkou mining area.

TI  - Calibration and Data Quality Assurance Technical Advancements for Quantitative Remote Sensing in the DRAGON 4 Project
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust calibration and validation (Cal and Val) should guarantee the accuracy of the retrieved information, make the remote sensing data consistent and traceable, and maintain the sensor performance during the operational phase. The DRAGON program has set up many remote sensing research topics on various application domains. In order to promote the effectiveness of data modeling and interpretation, it is necessary to solve various challenges in Cal and Val for quantitative RS applications. This project in the DRAGON 4 program aims to promote the cooperation of the Cal and Val experts from European and Chinese institutes in Cal and Val activities, and several achievements have been obtained in the advanced on-orbit optical sensor calibration, as well as microwave remote sensor calibration and product generation. The outcomes of the project have benefited the related remote sensing modeling and product retrieval, and promoted the radiometric calibration network (RadCalNet) as an international operational network for calibration, intercalibration, and validation. Moreover, this project provided local governments with a more accurate OMI NO2 data in China, which were used to study the air quality control during APEC period, Parade period and G20 period. This will be of ongoing be value for monitoring atmospheric environmental quality and formulating pollution control strategies.

TI  - Tree Species Classification Based on Sentinel-2 Imagery and Random Forest Classifier in the Eastern Regions of the Qilian Mountains
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining accurate forest coverage of tree species is an important basis for the rational use and protection of existing forest resources. However, most current studies have mainly focused on broad tree classification, such as coniferous vs. broadleaf tree species, and a refined tree classification with tree species information is urgently needed. Although airborne LiDAR data or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can be used to acquire tree information even at the single tree level, this method will encounter great difficulties when applied to a large area. Therefore, this study takes the eastern regions of the Qilian Mountains as an example to explore the possibility of tree species classification with satellite-derived images. We used Sentinel-2 images to classify the study area's major vegetation types, particularly four tree species, i.e., Sabina przewalskii (S.P.), Picea crassifolia (P.C.), Betula spp. (Betula), and Populus spp. (Populus). In addition to the spectral features, we also considered terrain and texture features in this classification. The results show that adding texture features can significantly increase the separation between tree species. The final classification result of all categories achieved an accuracy of 86.49% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. For trees, the classification accuracy was 90.31%, and their producer's accuracy (PA) and user's (UA) were all higher than 84.97%. We found that altitude, slope, and aspect all affected the spatial distribution of these four tree species in our study area. This study confirms the potential of Sentinel-2 images for the fine classification of tree species. Moreover, this can help monitor ecosystem biological diversity and provide references for inventory estimation.

TI  - Acknowledging Animal Rights: A Thomistic Perspective
T2  - AMERICAN CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I show how it is possible, working from a Thomistic perspective, to affirm the existence of animal rights. To start, I show how it is possible to ascribe indirect rights to animals-in particular, the indirect right to not be treated cruelly by us. Then, I show how it is possible to ascribe some direct rights to animals using the same reasoning that Aquinas offers in defending the claim that animals have indirect rights. Next, I draw on elements of Aquinas's metaphysical worldview in order to buttress the claim that animals have direct rights. I then respond to an attempt to ground the ethical treatment of animals, but not direct rights for animals, in natural law. In conclusion, I affirm that it is permissible to use animals to further the human good so long as in doing so we respect the direct rights that they possess.

TI  - ICG-Based Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma-Results of a Prospective Study from a Single Tertiary Cancer Center of India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective Lymphadenectomy is the most accurate method of assessment of lymph node involvement in carcinoma endometrium. The benefit of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer is still unproven. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation is of growing importance because of less morbidity and good diagnostic accuracy. Identification rates, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of SLNB in comparison with standard pelvic with/without para-aortic lymph node dissection were analyzed in present study. Methodology Intraoperatively Indocyanine Green (ICG) tracer is injected into the cervix at 3'o clock and 9'o clock position at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Sentinel lymph nodes were traced with the help of near-infrared spectrum supported camera technology (SPIES Camera-Karl Storz/Stryker ICG 4 K camera) by laparoscopy. These SLNs were identified, dissected and evaluated separately for metastasis. Complete pelvic with/without para-aortic lymphadenectomy was done and compared with results of SLNB. Main Results Eighty-six patients of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma were analyzed from June 2017 to December 2020 at a single tertiary cancer center in India. 88.4% (76/86) had at least one sentinel lymph node traced. Nodal metastasis was found in 8.1% (7/86) patients. SLNB identified metastasis in 5/7 (71% sensitivity). The specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of SLNB were 100% (97/97) and 98.9% (97/98), respectively. False negative rate was < 1% (1/101). Conclusion Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with ICG is an acceptable method of staging of lymph nodes in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma with accuracy comparable to standard lymphadenectomy. It has a good specificity, NPV and acceptable false negative rate compared to standard lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Quality assessment of open sourced digital elevation models in southeast coast of India
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation model (DEM) provides elevation values of the terrain. At present several open source DEMs are available and its vertical accuracy varies from place to place. The present study assessed the vertical accuracy of 1 arc-sec data of Advanced Land Observing Satellite digital surface model (AW3D30) Version-3, Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM (V3), Carto DEM (V3R1) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global DEM (V2) using Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICESat/GLAS) and Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK GPS) data in Southeast coast of India. Root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for DEMs, showed the elevation accuracy as 2.48 m (AW3D30), 3.02 m (SRTM DEM), 3.88 m (Carto DEM) and 8.02 m (ASTER GDEM) in the Tamil Nadu state while it was 2.29 m (AW3D30), 3.10 m (SRTM DEM), 3.93 m (Carto DEM) and 8.98 m (ASTER GDEM) in the 10 km buffer zone of coastal region and the results are satisfactory than the official product's specifications. Landform analysis was carried out at selected RTK GPS surveyed sites where the elevation of different coastal landforms is validated with DEMs and it was found the AW3D30 showed least RMSE than others. This paper suggests that AW3D30 is best for representing terrain elevation values followed by SRTM and Carto DEMs which are apt choices for application studies.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Male breast cancer accounts for approximately 1% of the overall incidence of breast cancer. We report a rare case of intraductal papilloma(intracystic papilloma)in a 73-year-old man, which was suspected to be breast cancer as it presented as an approximately 6 cm mass below the left nipple in various imaging studies. The patient was aware of a mass measuring a few millimeters below the left nipple for 5 years, but had not sought treatment. He visited our department 3 months after redness and pain were noted around the nipple; the mass had enlarged. Palpation revealed a 6 cm smooth-surfaced mass as well as nipple retraction; diagnostic imaging showed a cystic tumor with a solid internal structure. Fine-needle aspiration cytology and core needle biopsy did not indicate a definitive diagnosis, and a left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed based on a preoperative diagnosis of breast cancer. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of intraductal papilloma, based on findings such as infarction-induced hemorrhagic necrosis, stromal and epithelial proliferation, apocrine metaplasia, and squamous epithelial metaplasia. Reports of a large-diameter intraductal papilloma(intracystic papilloma)suspicious for breast cancer in men are rare; therefore, surgical resection and detailed histopathological exploration of the whole tumor were required.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapidly changing land use from agriculture to aquaculture and its emerging adverse impact on various biophysical environments along the Rasulpur River bank, West Bengal, India have been quantified by using Landsat data from 2003 to 2017. The biophysical indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) as well as Land Surface Temperature (LST) were estimated to extract the changing relationship between each other's using Pearson's correlation coefficient, generalized multiple linear regression (GMLR) model and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. Results revealed the decreasing trend of NDVI and SAVI along with increasing trends of NDWI, MNDWI and NDBaI controlled land surface temperature (LST). Hence, both the regression models were well fitted at the significance level of p < 0.01. Moreover, spatial autocorrelation and Getis-Ord-Gi* were used to evaluate the environmental sensitive zone through hot spot analysis. Consequently, some environmental stewardship planning and people's participation programs were proposed to protect environmental biophysical health and ecosystem services.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - The Effects of a Megafire on Ecosystem Services and the Pace of Landscape Recovery
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Megafires have affected several regions in the world (e.g., Australia, California), including, in 2017, the central and south-central zones of Chile. These areas represent real laboratories to monitor the impacts on the sustainability of landscapes and their recovery after fires. The present research examines the modification of dynamics and the provision of ecosystem services by a megafire in a Mediterranean landscape in central Chile, combining remote sensing technologies and ecosystem service assessments. (2) Methods: Land cover and spectral indices (NBRI, BAIS-2, NDVI, and EVI) were measured using Sentinel-2 imagery, while the provision of ecosystem services was evaluated using an expert-based matrix. (3) Results: The megafire affected forest plantations, formerly the dominant land cover, as well as other ecosystems, e.g., native forests. After five years, the landscape is dominated by exotic shrublands and grasslands. (4) Conclusions: The megafire caused a loss of 50% of the landscape's capacity to supply ecosystem services. Given that native forests are the best provider of ecosystem services in this landscape, restoration is a key to recovering landscape sustainability.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Properties of Typical Areas of the World Based on CALIPSO Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution characteristics and seasonal attributes of aerosol optical properties in typical regions around the world are studied through the statistical analysis of multiple aerosol optical parameters using two-level aerosol layer products provided by the cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observation (CALIPSO) satellite remote sensing data from 2009 to 2018. Results show that the monthly averages of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Saudi Arabia and India are unimodal, reaching a peak from June to July; the monthly average changes of the AOD in China and Central Africa are bimodal, with the highest values appearing from April to June and from December to January. The regional difference between the particulate depolarization ratio (PDR) and color ratio (CR) is the degree of irregularity of particles, which is the largest in Brazil with a PDR value of 0.5-0.7. In China, India, and Indonesia, fine-mode particles are mainly encountered with a CR value of 0.1-0.2. During the DJF and MAM periods, the nonspherical trend of particles in Saudi Arabia was the strongest, and during the JJA and SON periods, the particles in Saudi Arabia and Central Africa had the largest particle size with a CR value ranging from 0.756 to 0.829. The irregularity of aerosol particles in each region shows an increasing trend, and the variation range of the trend coefficient is 0.01-0.025; the increasing trend is most obvious in Brazil, and the particle size shows a weak downward trend.

TI  - Crop Yield Estimation and Interpretability With Gaussian Processes
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work introduces the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) for the estimation and understanding of crop development and yield using multisensor satellite observations and meteorological data. The proposed methodology combines synergistic information on canopy greenness, biomass, soil, and plant water content from optical and microwave sensors with the atmospheric variables typically measured at meteorological stations. A composite covariance is used in the GP model to account for varying scales, nonstationary, and nonlinear processes. The GP model reports noticeable gains in terms of accuracy with respect to other machine learning approaches for the estimation of corn, wheat, and soybean yields consistently for four years of data across continental U.S. (CONUS). Sparse GPs allow obtaining fast and compact solutions up to a limit, where heavy sparsity compromises the credibility of confidence intervals. We further study the GP interpretability by sensitivity analysis, which reveals that remote sensing parameters accounting for soil moisture and greenness mainly drive the model predictions. GPs finally allow us to identify climate extremes and anomalies impacting crop productivity and their associated drivers.

TI  - Error Evaluation of L-Band <i>InSAR</i> Precipitable Water Vapor Measurements by Comparison with <i>GNSS</i> Observations in Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) enables us to obtain precipitable water vapor (PWV) maps with high spatial resolution through the phase difference caused by refraction in the atmosphere. Although previous studies have evaluated the error level of InSAR PWV observations, they validated it only with C-band InSAR PWV observations. Since ionospheric disturbance seriously contaminates the InSAR phase in the case of the lower-frequency SAR system, it is necessary for a PWV error level evaluation correcting the ionospheric effect appropriately if we use lower-frequency SAR systems, such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2). In this paper, we evaluated the error level of the L-band InSAR PWV observation obtained from ALOS-2 data covering four areas in Japan. We compared the InSAR observations with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) atmospheric observations and estimated the L-band InSAR PWV error value by utilizing the error propagation theory. As a result, the L-band InSAR PWV absolute error reached 2.83 mm, which was comparable to traditional PWV observations. Moreover, we investigated the impacts of the seasonality, the interferometric coherence, and the height dependence on the PWV observation accuracy in InSAR.

TI  - The Combined Use of Remote Sensing and Wireless Sensor Network to Estimate Soil Moisture in Golf Course
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In gardening, particularly in golf courses, soil moisture management is critical for maximizing water efficiency. Remote sensing has been used to estimate soil moisture in recent years with relatively low accuracies. In this paper, we aim to use remote sensing and wireless sensor networks to generate soil moisture indexes for a golf course. In the golf course, we identified three types of soil, and data was gathered for three months. Mathematical models were obtained using data from Sentinel-2, bands with a resolution of 10 and 20 m, and sensed soil moisture. Models with acceptable accuracy were obtained only for one out of three soil types, the natural soil in which natural vegetation is grown. Two multiple regression models are presented with an R-2 of 0.46 for bands at 10 m and 0.70 for bands at 20 m. Their mean absolute error was lower than 3% in both cases. For the modified soils, the greens, and the golf course fairway, it was not feasible to obtain regression models due to the temporal uniformity of the grass and the range of variation of soil moisture. The developed moisture indexes were compared with existing options. The attained accuracies improve the current models. The verification indicates that the model generated with band 4 and band 12 is the one with better accuracy.

T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The fundamental changes in the land use and condition of the land in Gujrat (Punjab province, Pakistan), which have occurred over the past several decades, have been studied. They have a long history and represent an important factor in global changes in urban landscape. An attempt was made to determine the spatio-temporal changes in land use and land areas caused by anthropogenic activities. The study was carried out on the basis of multi-temporal satellite images (for 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015) of the US Geological Survey, obtained from various Landsat satellites. Satellite image processing was carried out in the ERDAS Imagine 2014 and ArcGIS 10.3.1 programs. As a result, four maps were compiled that reflect the spatial and temporal dynamics of land. They are divided into five types: vegetation cover, bare soil, sand, water bodies and built-up areas. The results of the study indicate a significant decrease in the area of vegetation cover: from 85.1% in 1985 to 79.6% by 2015. There was also a significant increase in the built-up area, from 0.7 to 4.0% over a 30-year period. It has been established that unplanned changes in land use have an extremely negative impact on the ecological situation as well as on the human habitat. It has been concluded that it is necessary to conduct a reasonable policy aimed at correcting unplanned urbanization and the demographic situation in the province under consideration.

TI  - Effects of Long-Term Land Use and Land Cover Changes on Ecosystem Service Values: An Example from the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are the leading contributors to the decline and loss of ecosystem services in the world. The present study covered the Central Rift Valley lakes basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the valley floor and the East and West escarpments, to analyze changes in LULC and to estimate associated losses in ecosystem service values (ESVs). Covering both upstream and downstream areas in the basin, the study addressed major gaps in existing studies by connecting the sources and sinks of material (e.g., sediment and water) in source-to-lake systems. Additionally, the study facilitated the identification of critical areas for conserving natural resources and reversing the decline of associated ESVs in the Central Rift Valley. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1973 and 2020 using four Landsat images from 1973, 1990, 2005 and 2020. The value transfer valuation method was used to estimate the changes in ESVs due to LULC changes. Among the seven major identified LULC classes, farmlands, settlements, and bare lands showed positive changes, while forestlands, grasslands, shrublands and waterbodies showed negative changes over the last 47 years. The expansion of farmlands, for example, has occurred at the expense of grasslands, forestlands and shrublands. The changes in LULC over a period of 47 years resulted in a total loss of US $62,110.4 x 10(6) in ESVs. The contributors to the overall loss of ESVs in decreasing order are provisioning services (US $33,795.1 x 10(6)), cultural services (US $28,981.5 x 10(6)) and regulating services (US $652.9 x 10(6)). The results imply that addressing the degradation of land and water resources is crucial to reversing the loss of ecosystem services and achieving the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food and water security (SDGs 2 and 6) and life on land (SDG 15).

TI  - Multi-Source Hydrological Data Products to Monitor High Asian River Basins and Regional Water Security
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This project explored the integrated use of satellite, ground observations and hydrological distributed models to support water resources assessment and monitoring in High Mountain Asia (HMA). Hydrological data products were generated taking advantage of the synergies of European and Chinese data assets and space-borne observation systems. Energy-budget-based glacier mass balance and hydrological models driven by satellite observations were developed. These models can be applied to describe glacier-melt contribution to river flow. Satellite hydrological data products were used for forcing, calibration, validation and data assimilation in distributed river basin models. A pilot study was carried out on the Red River basin. Multiple hydrological data products were generated using the data collected by Chinese satellites. A new Evapo-Transpiration (ET) dataset from 2000 to 2018 was generated, including plant transpiration, soil evaporation, rainfall interception loss, snow/ice sublimation and open water evaporation. Higher resolution data were used to characterize glaciers and their response to environmental forcing. These studies focused on the Parlung Zangbo Basin, where glacier facies were mapped with GaoFeng (GF), Sentinal-2/Multi-Spectral Imager (S2/MSI) and Landsat8/Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) data. The geodetic mass balance was estimated between 2000 and 2017 with Zi-Yuan (ZY)-3 Stereo Images and the SRTM DEM. Surface velocity was studied with Landsat5/Thematic Mapper (L5/TM), L8/OLI and S2/MSI data over the period 2013-2019. An updated method was developed to improve the retrieval of glacier albedo by correcting glacier reflectance for anisotropy, and a new dataset on glacier albedo was generated for the period 2001-2020. A detailed glacier energy and mass balance model was developed with the support of field experiments at the Parlung No. 4 Glacier and the 24 K Glacier, both in the Tibetan Plateau. Besides meteorological measurements, the field experiments included glaciological and hydrological measurements. The energy balance model was formulated in terms of enthalpy for easier treatment of water phase transitions. The model was applied to assess the spatial variability in glacier melt. In the Parlung No. 4 Glacier, the accumulated glacier melt was between 1.5 and 2.5 m w.e. in the accumulation zone and between 4.5 and 6.0 m w.e. in the ablation zone, reaching 6.5 m w.e. at the terminus. The seasonality in the glacier mass balance was observed by combining intensive field campaigns with continuous automatic observations. The linkage of the glacier and snowpack mass balance with water resources in a river basin was analyzed in the Chiese (Italy) and Heihe (China) basins by developing and applying integrated hydrological models using satellite retrievals in multiple ways. The model FEST-WEB was calibrated using retrievals of Land Surface Temperature (LST) to map soil hydrological properties. A watershed model was developed by coupling ecohydrological and socioeconomic systems. Integrated modeling is supported by an updated and parallelized data assimilation system. The latter exploits retrievals of brightness temperature (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer, AMSR), LST (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS), precipitation (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and FengYun (FY)-2D) and in-situ measurements.In the case study on the Red River Basin, a new algorithm has been applied to disaggregate the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture retrievals by making use of the correlation between evaporative fraction and soil moisture.

TI  - Vegetation Recovery Patterns in Burned Areas Assessed with Landsat 8 OLI Imagery and Environmental Biophysical Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation recovery after the large wildfires that occurred in central Portugal in 2017 is assessed in the present study. These wildfires had catastrophic consequences, among which were human losses and a vast extent of forest devastation. Landsat 8 OLI images were used to obtain the land use and cover (LUC) classification and to determine the Normalized Burned Ratio index (NBR) for different times. NBR results were used to determine the difference between the NBR (dNBR) before the fire (pre-fire) and after the fire (post-fire), and the results obtained were cross-checked with the LUC. The dNBR results were cross-referenced with biophysical data to identify the characteristics of the most important burned areas in need of vegetative recovery. The results showed the spatial differentiation in vegetation recovery, highlighting different factors in this process, in particular the type of vegetation (the predominant species and bank of seeds available), the biophysical characteristics of burned areas (for example, the soil type in burned areas), the continentality gradient, and the climate conditions. The vegetation recovery was differentiated by time according to the species present in the burned areas pre-fire. In general, shrubland recovery was faster than that of tree species, and the recovery was more marked for species that were regenerated by the rhizomes after fire. The recovery process was also influenced by the season in the study area. It was more efficient in the spring and at the beginning of the summer, highlighting the importance of optimal conditions needed for vegetation regeneration, such as the temperature and precipitation (soil humidity and water availability for growing plants). The results of this research are important to forest planning: the definition of the strategies for the ecosystems' recovery, the adoption of preventive measures to avoid the occurrence of large wildfires, the modification of anthropogenic practices, etc.

T2  - JOURNAL OF UNMANNED VEHICLE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geotechnologies have significant potential for application in socio-environmental analysis coupled to disaster risk reduction. Equipment and applications are available that are supported by scientific computing, promoting advances in the acquisition and processing of remote sensing data. Among these are two types: (i) the associated equipment to technology LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and (ii) remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) with platforms of remote sensors. Recently, an growing number of studies has been observed that have the potential for applications in the sensors equipped in RPAS for environmental studies, especially those that evaluate the impacts of natural disasters. In this context, the aim of this research is to demonstrate the possibilities of RPAS applications in the collection of data of interest in the management of natural disasters. Also associated with this task is the prospect of implementing some techniques of scientific computing necessary for the implementation of applications. With these activities, we seek to contribute to the advancement of the employment of RPAS in managing and preventing the risk of natural disasters.

TI  - Continuous Detection of Forest Loss in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we demonstrate the ability of a new operational system to detect forest loss at a large scale accurately and in a timely manner. We produced forest loss maps every week over Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos (>750,000 km(2) in total) using Sentinel-1 data. To do so, we used the forest loss detection method based on shadow detection. The main advantage of this method is the ability to avoid false alarms, which is relevant in Southeast Asia where the areas of forest disturbance may be very small and scattered and detection is used for alert purposes. The estimated user accuracy of the forest loss map was 0.95 for forest disturbances and 0.99 for intact forest, and the estimated producer's accuracy was 0.90 for forest disturbances and 0.99 for intact forest, with a minimum mapping unit of 0.1 ha. This represents an important step forward compared to the values achieved by previous studies. We also found that approximately half of forest disturbances in Cambodia from 2018 to 2020 occurred in protected areas, which emphasizes the lack of efficiency in the protection and conservation of natural resources in protected areas. On an annual basis, the forest loss areas detected using our method are found to be similar to the estimations from Global Forest Watch. These results highlight the fact that this method provides not only quick alerts but also reliable detections that can be used to calculate weekly, monthly, or annual forest loss statistics at a national scale.

TI  - High-resolution three-dimensional imaging for precise staging in melanoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Many cancer guidelines include sentinel lymph node (SLN) staging to identify microscopic metastatic disease. Current SLN analysis of melanoma patients is effective but has the substantial drawback that only a small representative portion of the node is sampled, whereas most of the tissue is discarded. This might explain the high clinical falsenegative rate of current SLN diagnosis in melanoma. Furthermore, the quantitative assessment of metastatic load and microanatomical localisation might yield prognosis with higher precision. Thus, methods to analyse entire SLNs with cellular resolution apart from tedious sequential physical sectioning are required.Patients and methods: Eleven melanoma patients eligible to undergo SLN biopsy were included in this prospective study. SLNs were fixed, optically cleared, whole-mount stained and imaged using light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM). Subsequently, compatible and unbiased gold standard histopathological assessment allowed regular patient staging. This enabled intrasample comparison of LSFM and histological findings. In addition, the development of an algorithm, RAYhance, enabled easy-to-handle display of LSFM data in a browsable histologic slide-like fashion.Results: We comprehensively quantify total tumour volume while simultaneously visualising cellular and anatomical hallmarks of the associated SLN architecture. In a first- in-human study of 21 SLN of melanoma patients, LSFM not only confirmed all metastases identified by routine histopathological assessment but also additionally revealed metastases not detected by routine histology alone. This already led to additional therapeutic options for one patient.Conclusion: Our three-dimensional digital pathology approach can increase sensitivity and accuracy of SLN metastasis detection and potentially alleviate the need for conventional histopathological assessment in the future.

TI  - Lineaments analysis of Bafoussam (West-Cameroon) using remote sensing and vertical electrical sounding: Hydrogeological implication
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study proposes to map the tectonic accidents existing in Bafoussam locality using the remote sensing and vertical electrical sounding methods. The principal component analysis and directional filtering applied respectively to Landsat8 and SRTM images allowed to extract remote sensing lineament map. The interpretative rose diagram shows a distribution of lineaments following four directions: NE-SW, NW-SE, N-S and E-W. The main directions are from N30 degrees E to N80 degrees E; these are those of large strike-slip of the Central Pan-African Fold Belt (CAFB) in Cameroon and from the extension of the Central Cameroonian Shear Zone (CCSZ) in the studied area. The superimposition of these lineaments on the hydrographic network map enabled establishing genetic links because rivers flow following the main N30 degrees E and the secondary N120 degrees E lineament directions. The superimposition of the iso-resistivity maps resulting allowed to extract the geophysical lineament map which has been confirmed by achieving resis-tivity sections in depth. These lineaments are N40 degrees E to N60 degrees E directed comparable to the network frac-ture and foliation direction on orthogneiss flagstones within the area. These lineaments superimposed on those automatically extracted by remote sensing show a good correlation following the two methods used. The both mapping methods therefore allowed to extract the fracturing map zone. As groundwater is generally stored in the fracture network of hard rocks, the results of this study will thus provide pro-gress in the course of wells and boreholes implantation. The second generation of fractures with a N140 degrees E striking direction is the most appropriate for the hydrogeological studies in Bafoussam.

TI  - A New Material-Oriented TES for Land Surface Temperature and SUHI Retrieval in Urban Areas: Case Study over Madrid in the Framework of the Future TRISHNA Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of the Land Surface Temperature (LST) by remote sensing in urban areas is of great interest to study the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect. Thus, it is one of the goals of the future spaceborne mission TRISHNA, which will carry a thermal radiometer onboard with four bands at a 60-m spatial resolution, acquiring daytime and nighttime. In this study, TRISHNA-like data are simulated from Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) data over the Madrid urban area at 4-m resolution. To retrieve the LST, the Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm is applied with four spectral bands considering two main original approaches compared with the classical TES algorithm. First, calibration and validation datasets with a large number of artificial materials are considered (called urban-oriented database), contrary to most of the previous studies that do not use a large number of artificial material spectra during the calibration step, thus impacting the LST retrieval over these materials. This approach produces one TES algorithm with one empirical relationship, called 1MMD TES. Second, two empirical relationships are used, one for the artificial materials and the other for the natural ones. These relationships are defined thanks to two calibration datasets (artificial-surface-oriented database and natural-surface-oriented database, respectively), one containing mainly artificial materials and the other mainly natural ones. Finally, in order to use two empirical relationships, a ground cover classification map is given to the TES algorithm to separate artificial pixels from natural ones. This approach produces one material-oriented TES algorithm with two empirical relationships, called 2MMD TES. In order to perform a complete comparison of these two addenda in the TES algorithm and their impact on the LST retrieval, both AHS and TRISHNA spatial resolutions are studied, i.e., 4-m and 60-m resolutions, respectively. Relative to the calibration of the TES algorithm, we conclude that (1) the urban-oriented database is more representative of the urban areas than previous databases from the state-of-the-art, and (2) using two databases (artificial-surface-oriented and natural-surface-oriented) instead of one prevents the overestimation of the LST over natural materials and the underestimation over artificial ones. Thus, for both studied spatial resolutions (AHS and TRISHNA), we find that the 2MMD TES outperforms the 1MMD TES. This difference is especially important for artificial materials, corroborating the above conclusion. Furthermore, the comparison with ground measurements shows that, on 4-m spatial resolution images, the 2MMD TES outperforms both the 1MMD TES and the TES from the state-of-the-art used in this study. Finally, we conclude that the 2MMD TES method, with only four spectral bands, better retrieves the LST over artificial and natural materials and that the future TRISHNA sensor is suited for the monitoring of the LST over urban areas and the SUHI effect.

TI  - Assessment of Remote Sensing Techniques Applicability for Beach Morphology Mapping: A Case Study of Hvar Island, Central Adriatic, Croatia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the quality and accuracy of remote sensing data in beach surveys based on three different data sources covering a 10-year period (2011-2021). Orthophotos from State Geodetic Administration Geoportal and satellite imagery from Google Earth were compared with orthophotos generated from UAV using ArcGIS Pro and Drone2Map. The beach area and length of 20 beaches on the island of Hvar were measured using each data source from different years. The average deviation for beach area (-2.3 to 5.6%) and length (-1 to 2.7%) was determined (without outliers). This study confirms that linear feature measurement is more accurate than polygon-based measurement. Hence, smaller beach areas were associated with higher errors. Furthermore, it was observed that morphological complexity of the beach may also affect the measurement accuracy. This work showed that different remote sensing sources could be used for relatively accurate beach surveys, as there is no statistically significant difference between the calculated errors. However, special care should always be addressed to the definition of errors.

TI  - Modeling the distribution of heavy metals in lands irrigated by wastewater using satellite images of Sentinel-2
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The pollution of heavy metals is considered as one of the main problems of using wastewater for irrigation purposes. Frequent experimental measurements, time, and cost are essential for evaluating the pollution of heavy metals in a large area. Thus, using satellite images and establishing a relationship between the images and concentration of heavy metals can be regarded as a solution for estimating the polluted area. In this study, the image of the Sentinel-2 satellite was used to evaluate the heavy metals pollution of the area irrigated with wastewater in south of Tehran. For this aim, 30 soil-surface samples irrigated with raw wastewater were collected in the area. After preparing the samples, the concentration of Pb, Cu, and Ni was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Then, the relationship between the heavy metal concentration, reflection on the bands or rating of the bands at the corresponding sampling points was determined by applying the stepwise regression method. In addition, the developed models were applied to the satellite image for zoning the heavy metal concentrations in the studied area. Finally, the accuracy of the developed models was examined by Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficients. The results indicated that the amounts of RMSE for the equations of Pb, Cu, and Ni were 1.90, 2.54, and 1.59 respectively, while the amounts of R were 0.81, 0.75, and 0.73 for these metals representing a promising match between the predicted and measured results of the models.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - RICA: A rice crop calendar for Asia based on MODIS multi year data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on when and where rice is planted and harvested is important for crop management under a changing climate and for monitoring crop production for early warning and market information systems. The diversity of plant genetic, crop management, and environmental conditions leads to a wide variation in the number of rice crops per year and the dates of crop establishment and harvesting across Asia. Asia-wide rice crop calendars exist (e.g., RiceAtlas) but are based on heterogeneous data sources with varying levels of detail and are challenging to update. Earth observations can contribute to consistent and replicable crop calendars. Here we demonstrate and validate a method for generating a rice crop calendar across Asia. Our analysis at administrative unit-level is based on pixel-level analysis with the PhenoRice algorithm using MODIS imagery (2003-16) to estimate start of season (SoS) and end of season (EoS) dates. PhenoRice outputs were post-processed to generate representative statistics on the number of rice crop seasons per year and their SoS/EoS dates per administrative unit across Asia, called RICA (a RIce crop Calendar for Asia). RICA SoS and EoS dates across all seasons correlated strongly with RiceAtlas crop establishment and harvesting dates (R2 of 0.88 and 0.82 respectively, n = 1,186). The mean absolute errors were around 26 and 33 days for SoS and EoS, respectively. A detailed assessment in the Philippines where data in RiceAtlas are particularly accurate had even better results (R2 of 0.93 and 0.85 respectively, n = 131). Comparisons to other published rice calendars also suggested that RICA captured rice cropping season dates well. Our study results in a unique and validated method to estimate rice crop calendar information on continental scale from remote sensing data.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation loss and shoreline change due to tropical cyclone Fani using Landsat imageries in Balukhand-Konark Wildlife Sanctuary, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The study analyzes the coastline oscillations and land use and land cover (LULC) change due to the impact of the cyclone Fani in Balukhand-Konark Wildlife Sanctuary (BKWS), located in East India. In this study, two Landsat 8 images in the pre- and post-cyclone periods in 2019 were used. The transition zone discriminating land and water was calculated using normalized difference water index (NDWI) and desktop digitization. The digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS), an extension of ArcGIS, was used to model changes in the shorelines, and the net shoreline movement (NSM) was used to extract the change statistics. The vegetation damage was analyzed using the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the LULC changes were assessed using geospatial techniques. Then, LULC degradation maps were produced. The results highlight the dynamic character of the studied coastline with erosion in the flat sandy forests, and show that some areas had accretion in the northern portion. The results show that SAVI has decreased along with patches close to critical erosion points, regardless of climate trends. It was observed that the severe cyclonic storm Fani had created both ecological and physical disturbances in the sandy flat BKWS area. In the future, this study can provide important information on ecological and physical changes induced by cyclonic storms and be beneficial for restoring the biodiversity niche of this unique fragile coastal forest on the east coast of India.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine carcinoma. The cellular origin of MCC may include Merkel cell precursors. The incidence of MCC has increased significantly however trends may have been confounded by evolving diagnostic criteria. The two key aetiologies of MCC are ultraviolet radiation and Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCPyV). Both have unique mechanisms of carcinogenesis. MCC presents non-specifically as a rapidly growing, red-to-violet nodule on sun-exposed areas. Diagnostic accuracy has improved through immunohistochemical markers such as CK-20. Lymph nodes should be evaluated in MCC through examination and sentinel biopsy. USS, CT, MRI and CT-PET may be useful in staging. Management depends on tumour location, stage and comorbidities. MCPyV status may guide treatment strategy in the future. Treatment for the primary MCC is commonly wide local excision followed by radiotherapy, guided by anatomical constraints. There is uncertainty about surgical margins. Treatments for nodal disease have not been determined through trials. They include nodal dissection or radiotherapy for clinically or radiologically apparent disease, and adjuvant nodal irradiation for negative nodes, microscopic disease or following nodal dissection for definite disease. Patients with loco-regional advanced inoperable disease should be considered for combination therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy for advanced disease includes immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Avelumab can improve survival in metastatic MCC. Immunotherapy may result in longer disease control. Various other immunotherapeutic and molecular agents are undergoing trials. MCC continues to have a high mortality characterized by high recurrence and early metastases.

TI  - Seeing through the clouds - Mapping desert fog oasis ecosystems using 20 years of MODIS imagery over Peru and Chile
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The desert fog oasis ecosystem of Peru and Chile comprises numerous oases along 3000 km of the Pacific coastal belt, it hosts a highly endemic flora, providing vital ecosystem services and genetic resources. However, due to their marked seasonality and fog cover they are poorly mapped, greatly compromising their conservation. Here we redress this using 479 images from the MODIS (MOD13Q1 V6 product) data/algorithm for the period 2000-2020, permitting the mapping of ephemeral vegetation, herbaceous and woody fog oases vegetation. In addition, we examine the main drivers of productivity in this unique ecosystem using generalised linear models, assess human pressures, conservation efforts, and summarise present plant diversity knowledge.The resultant map (https://gistin.users.earthengine.app/view/fogoasis) extends existing mapped areas by more than four-fold to over 17,000 km(2), revealing extensive little-known vegetation habitats with few or no collection records. Tillandsia ('air plants') fog oases were mapped manually due to poor spectral discrimination and were found to cover an area of approximately 1,900 km(2) the majority of which is in Peru (96%). Fog oasis productivity is significantly related to aridity and distance to the coast, as well as elevation and slope angle. Most fog oases peak in productivity during August-September, although productivity is highly variable between August and December with different oases reacting to inter-annual and annual climate fluxes.Only 4% of fog oases are protected, most are threatened by mining, urban development, air pollution and off-road 4 x 4 driving. Urgent action is needed to protect these areas, which we estimate support around 1200 ecosystem-specific flowering plant species with approximately 30% endemism in Peru and 67% in Chile. By presenting a comprehensive map and catalogue of Peruvian and Chilean fog oases, we hope to catalyse increased conservation and research towards a better understanding of these exceptional ecosystems within South America.

M3  - Article
AB  - Damietta Promontory in the Nile Delta experienced great changes and reformation in the last few years as it is a promised area for the socio-economic development under the umbrella of the Egyptian sustainable development strategy 2030. This study aims to monitor shoreline changes and anthropogenic intervention from 2000 to 2015 to address impact(s) of the coastal erosion on the future economic development and land management. Monitoring shoreline changes was carried out using SCAP model (Shoreline Changes And Prediction) developed by the author to compute shoreline changes. Land cover changes were also analyzed using supervised classification based on Landsat satellite images.Rates of erosion obtained from the model differ from 12.17 to and-5.56 m/yr generally. The study also revealed the significant land accretion towards the sea due to means of shore protection, sand feeding and the rapid urbanization on agricultural, reclaimed and vacant lands. The overall accuracies of images' classification ranged between 85 and 95 indicating high credibility of the classification process.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Land use change optimization using a new ensemble model in Ramian County, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change resulting from human activity affects human health and ecosystems, and globally, natural resource degradation and conversion from natural land cover to urban, agricultural, and industrial land uses is accelerating. Simulation of and use changes is a very helpful tool for managing current and future land use. In the north of Iran, in the part of Ramian County, land use change is very intensive because of favorable soil and climatic conditions for various human activities on the landscape. The rapid development of urbanization and farming throughout the region is an important threat to natural resources. The aim of this research is land use change optimization using an ensemble of the CLUE_s model and the analytical hierarchy process. Images of Landsat 7 were applied for land use classification for the years 1990 and 2015. The analytical hierarchy process was applied instead of the logistic regression approach in in the simulation process using CLUE-s model. The results indicate that the new ensemble model is an acceptable and accurate tool for land use classification. Land use change detection showed that deforestation, rangeland degradation, and the conversion of natural resources (forest and rangeland land uses) to residential and agricultural land uses accounts for most of the land use changes in the Ramian County. Land use map of year 2040 was simulated using the new ensemble model. This new model is a useful tool for policymakers and land use managers.

TI  - THE WORK OF FRANS MASEREEL AND ITS ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THE GRAPHIC ART IN ARGENTINE MODERNISM
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze the work of the Belgian artist Frans Masereel in the light of anarchist ideology, as well as its relevance for the creativity of Argentine modernist artists Antonio Ballester and Victor Rebuffo in the context of anarchist magazine culture in Buenos Aires in the early twentieth century. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the proposing of a new perspective to study the work of F. Masereel, which has been considered exclusively in the context of communist ideology. Besides, this article enhances the discussion on the origins and development of Argentine graphic art in the first half of the twentieth century. The relevance of the research topic is the consideration of a paramount though little-discussed phenomenon in the context of Russian and international historiography, namely the multi-faceted relation between the artistic avant-garde and anarchism at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The significance of the article lies in the historical restoration of the persistent dialogue between the work and the biography of F. Masereel and the social and aesthetic tendencies of anarchism. Moreover, this article sheds light, for the first time in Russian historiography, on the study of such a vivid and distinctive phenomenon as the Argentine graphics of the first half of the twentieth century.The sources for this analysis are journals and magazines, among which stand out: La Feuille, Les Tablettes, Clarte, Les Cahiers d'aujourd'hui (In Europe), La Protesta, Contra: la revista de los franco-tiradores, Accion de arte, La Campana de palo, and Accion libertaria ( In Argentina), which contains previously unexplored graphic works. The conclusions of the research elucidate not only the contribution of F. Masereel to the formation of the xylography as a paramount language in Argentine graphic art, but also to the consolidation, in the revolutionary Argentine art, of such themes and motifs, as the urban landscape, the jail, the worker, the martyr, and the Christ, which appear in the work of local modernist graphic artist A. Ballester and V. Rebuffo. Besides, F. Masereel's influence was discussed as an impulse for the formation of new genre tendencies in Argentine graphics. This is the case of the wordless novel, which was assimilated by the local anarchist magazine culture throughout the first decades of the twentieth century, and further by V. Rebuffo in his wordless novel "Contraluz". Thus, Masereel was considered not only as a carrier of the revolutionary anarchist worldview, but also as a stimulus for artistic innovations in European and Argentine graphic art.In the study, we relied on the methods of formal-artistic, iconographic analysis, iconological method, cultural-historical and sociological, as well as comparative methods.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to determine and classify the land cover and assess the impact of agriculture expansion on the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in El-Beheira Governorate, Egypt. To achieve these objectives, the multi-temporal Landsat 5 and 8 satellites images for nine different dates were obtained every five years during 1985-2020. Four land cover categorize of agriculture, urban, desert and water lands were distinguished and mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification technique in ArcGIS Desktop 10.6. The created land cover maps illustrate a significant expansion in agriculture from 4212 to 7523 km2 (nearly 473 km2 every five years). The desert area decreased from 5417 to 1817 km2 (about 514 km2 every five years) during 1985-2020. The latitudinal variation for LST and NDVI demonstrated that they have a strong negative correlation (R < -95% and R2 > 91%) across all selected dates. The highest positive values for NDVI corresponded to the lowest values for LST over agricultural lands and reversed over desert areas. Where, the relative impacts of agriculture, desert, urban and water on LST (45.1, 50, 4.8 and 0.1% respectively) reveals that the vegetation and desert represents the most significant land cover categorize that determinantes the spatial and temporal distributions of NDVI and LST.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Monitoring spatiotemporal variation of groundwater level and salinity under land use change using integrated field measurements, GIS, geostatistical, and remote-sensing approach: case study of the Feija aquifer, Middle Draa watershed, Moroccan Sahara
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The cultivation of watermelons has been a fast growing agriculture industry in the arid, desert regions of Morocco, relying on groundwater pumping and transformation of rangelands to farms due to growing demand for the fruit in national and international markets. This study aims to measure the impact of watermelon expansion on groundwater resources in the Feija Basin, which is one of the largest watermelon cultivation areas in Southern Morocco. Field measurements, statistics, Kriging interpolation, and regression methods were used to measure the temporal variations in the groundwater level (GL) and salinity between 2013 and 2018 to determine the correlation between different parameters. Remote sensing data was also used to monitor the watermelon cultivation expansion. Results show a rapid expansion of agricultural areas from just 185.11 ha in 2007 to 2560.1 ha in 2018. The groundwater level declined rapidly by about 10 m below ground level during the 5 years of the study period. Additionally, the decline was accompanied by a significant increase in electrical conductivity (salinity) values over the same time interval from 1077.55 to 1211.9 mu S/cm. As a consequence of the continuous overexploitation and unsustainable management, a lot of wells have run dry and there have been drinking water shortages in the city of Zagora, the closest city nearby. Results can help target efforts to improve the implementation of conservation strategies to ensure the sustainability of water use and food production in this region of Morocco.

TI  - Mapping of potential rare earth deposits in the Schiel alkaline complex using sentinel-2B multispectral sensor
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the images of Sentinel-2B multispectral sensor are used to map minerals associated with rare earth elements (REE) in an attempt to discover new potential targets for REE deposits in the Schiel Alkaline Complex of South Africa. Spectral Information Divergence (SID) classification was applied to Sentinel-2B images to map areas containing potential monazite and hematite. Generally, the accuracy of SID classification is warranted by selecting appropriate threshold values, which are normally userdefined. In this study, a simple thresholding approach is proposed; this approach requires at least one area, with a confirmed existence of a mineral being sought, to be used as a reference point for selecting optimum threshold value. The aim of this approach is to determine the lowest threshold value at which mineral classification in a reference point starts. The smaller the threshold value, the more likely the classified pixels represent minerals in question in the ground. Following this approach, a value of 0.02 and 0.03 was used as the maximum acceptable threshold value for mapping REE-bearing mineral (monazite) and iron-rich mineral (hematite), respectively. The proposed approach was validated through field sampling and geochemical analysis of samples collected at potential REE deposit targets, including one rock sample (S3) collected in the area void of minerals of interest, based on SID classification. The analytical results show that the samples collected at anomalous mineral clusters have relatively high REE contents that are well beyond the average crustal abundance and S3, thus suggesting the viability of the proposed approach.

TI  - Identification of Debris-Flow Channels Using High-Resolution Topographic Data: A Case Study in the Quebrada del Toro, NW Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Resolving Earth's surface at the meter scale is essential for an improved understanding of the dynamics of mass-movement processes. In this study, we explore the applicability and potential of digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from stereophotogrammetry to detect debris-flow channels in the Quebrada del Toro in the northwestern Argentine Andes. Our analysis relies on a high-resolution (3 m) DEM created from SPOT-7 tri-stereo satellite data. We carefully validated DEM quality with similar to 6,000 differential GPS points and identified optimal parameters for DEM generation in high-relief terrain. After multiple processing steps, we achieved an accuracy of 0.051 1.915 m (1 sigma) using n = 3,139 control points with cm precision. Previous studies have used the drainage area and slope framework to identify topographic signatures of debris flows within a catchment. We built upon this and investigated individual river-channel segments using connected-component (CC) analysis on meter-scale topographic data. We define CC as segments of similar slope along the channel profile. Based on seven manually identified debris-flow catchments, we developed a debris-flow similarity index using component length and mean channel-segment slope and identified channel segments that have likely been shaped by debris flows. The presented approach has the potential to resolve intra-catchment variability of transport processes, allows to constrain the extent of debris-flow channels more precisely than slope-area analysis, and highlights the versatility of combined space- and field-based observations for natural-hazard assessments.Plain Language Summary Debris flows are potentially destructive mass movements that involve a mixture of water and sediment. They regularly disrupt infrastructure and threaten local populations in mountainous regions worldwide. For hazard assessment, it is important to locate areas where debris flows occur. Debris flows carve into bedrock, forming continuously steep channels for long distances of several hundred meters. This research locates channels that were shaped by debris flows using gridded elevation models of the Earth's surface. These models are generated using overlapping satellite-image pairs that show the study area from different viewing angles. Similar to what the human brain does by merging two images from our eyes to produce depth perception, we use algorithms to turn pairs of satellite images into height information. From the surface model, we can derive individual river channels and dissect these into segments that have a common channel slope. In a following step, we compare all channel segments to known debris-flow channels in the landscape and evaluate how similar they are. We detect the signature of debris flows primarily in regions near geologic faults where sufficient loose material is available to fuel a debris flow and steep hillsides provide enough gravitational energy to transport this material downstream.Key PointsSPOT-7 tri-stereo imagery may be used to retrieve high-quality, 3 m digital elevation models for geomorphic and hazard analysesWe derive a new metric for debris-flow mapping using connected components of channel-slope segmentsWe develop a debris-flow similarity index to classify channel pixels and distinguish between debris-flow and fluvial sections

TI  - Antimicrobial Resistance Situational Analysis 2019-2020: Design and Performance for Human Health Surveillance in Uganda
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antibiotic resistance and its mechanisms have been known for over six decades, but global efforts to characterize its routine drivers have only gained momentum in the recent past. Drivers of clinical and community resistance go beyond just clinical practice, which is why one-health approaches offer the most realistic option for controlling antibiotic resistance. It is noteworthy that the emergence of resistance occurs naturally in the environment, but akin to climate change, the current accelerated emergence and spread bears hallmarks of anthropomorphic influence. If left unchecked, this can undo the medical and agricultural advancements of the last century. The WHO recommends that nations develop, adopt, and implement strategies that track the changing trends in antibiotic resistance levels to tackle this problem. This article examines efforts and progress in developing and implementing a human health antimicrobial resistance surveillance strategy in Uganda. We do so within the context of the National Action Plan for tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR-NAP) launched in 2018. We discuss the technical milestones and progress in implementing surveillance of GLASS priority pathogens under this framework. The preliminary output of the framework examines the performance and compares AMR and AMU surveillance data to explain observed trends. We conclude that Uganda is making progress in developing and implementing a functional AMR surveillance strategy for human health.

TI  - Optimising site-specific potato seeding rates for maximum yield and profitability
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current site-specific seeding (SSS) recommendations are based on two approaches, whose comparative performance for maximising yield and profit is unknown. These are: the Kings and Robin Hood approaches recommending the highest seed density for the highest and poorest fertility zones, respectively. This study compared the agronomic and economic performance of these two SSS recommendations for potato in comparison with uniform rate seeding (URS). Soil pH, organic carbon, available P, K, Mg, Ca, Na, moisture content and cation exchange capacity predicted with an on-line visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and crop normalised difference vegetation index retrieved from Sentinel-2 images were used for delineating management zones (MZ) using K-means clustering for four agricultural fields in Belgium. Soil and crop attributes together with geo-referenced yield observations were used to delineate MZ maps, whose classes were ranked according to the MZ-specific average yield. A strip experiment with five seed-to-seed spacings was implemented, comparing two SSS recommendation approaches. Results showed the highest yield was obtained for the Kings SSS (59.33-14.50 t ha(-1)) in all fields, whereas the Robin Hood approach provided higher yield than URS in two of four fields [e.g., field 1 (43.69 t ha(-1)) and field 4 (31.10 t ha(-1))]. Compared to the URS gross margin (735.0-5806.75 (sic) ha(-1)), the Kings approach led to higher relative gross margin (147.50-596.88 (sic) ha(-1)) than the Robin Hood (- 113.30 to 205.16 (sic) ha(-1)) treatment. Therefore, it is suggested to adopt the Kings as the profitable recommendation approach for map-based SSS of potato production. (C) 2021 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We assessed FEWSs with three river states, No-alert, Pre-alert and Alert for flooding, for lead times between 1 to 12 h using the most common ML techniques, such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), and random forest (RF). The Tomebamba catchment in the tropical Andes of Ecuador was selected as a case study. For all lead times, MLP models achieve the highest performance followed by LR, with f1-macro (log-loss) scores of 0.82 (0.09) and 0.46 (0.20) for the 1 h and 12 h cases, respectively. The ranking was highly variable for the remaining ML techniques. According to the g-mean, LR models correctly forecast and show more stability at all states, while the MLP models perform better in the Pre-alert and Alert states. The proposed methodology for selecting the optimal ML technique for a FEWS can be extrapolated to other case studies. Future efforts are recommended to enhance the input data representation and develop communication applications to boost the awareness of society of floods.

TI  - ENTOMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION FOLLOWING A ZIKA OUTBREAK IN BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In November and December 2016, an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika occurred in Brownsville, TX. The Texas Department of State Health Services requested for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Epi Aid, and as part of that Epi Aid a team of CDC entomologists was deployed in January 2017. The mission was to improve mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance and evaluate the possibility of continuing local Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission in the city. The mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance program was expanded from 4 to 40 BG-Sentinel traps evenly distributed throughout the city. Over a 2-wk period, 15 mosquito species were detected; the most abundant species were Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Ae. albopictus, which accounted for 66.7%, 16.2%, and 5.7% of the total mosquito collection, respectively. The relative abundance of Ae. aegypti (1.0 mosquitoes/trap/day) and Ae. albopictus (0.4 mosquitoes/trap/day) was very low and unlikely to initiate and/or sustain ZIKV transmission. Zika virus was not detected in the mosquitoes collected, suggesting no or extremely low ZIKV transmission at that time.

TI  - Ground Observations and Environmental Covariates Integration for Mapping of Soil Salinity: A Machine Learning-Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a severe danger to agricultural activity in arid and semi-arid areas, reducing crop production and contributing to land destruction. This investigation aimed to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict spatial soil salinity (dS m(-1)) by combining environmental covariates derived from remotely sensed (RS) data, a digital elevation model (DEM), and proximal sensing (PS). The study is located in an arid region, southern Iran (52 degrees 51 '-53 degrees 02 ' E; 28 degrees 16 '-28 degrees 29 ' N), in which we collected 300 surface soil samples and acquired the spectral data with RS (Sentinel-2) and PS (electromagnetic induction instrument (EMI) and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF)). Afterward, we analyzed the data using five machine learning methods as follows: random forest-RF, k-nearest neighbors-kNN, support vector machines-SVM, partial least squares regression-PLSR, artificial neural networks-ANN, and the ensemble of individual models. To estimate the electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract (ECe), we built three scenarios, including Scenario (1): Synthetic Soil Image (SySI) bands and salinity indices derived from it; Scenario (2): RS data, PS data, topographic attributes, and geology and geomorphology maps; and Scenario (3): the combination of Scenarios (1) and (2). The best prediction accuracy was obtained for the RF model in Scenario (3) (R-2 = 0.48 and RMSE = 2.49), followed by Scenario (2) (RF model, R-2 = 0.47 and RMSE = 2.50) and Scenario (1) for the SVM model (R-2 = 0.26 and RMSE = 2.97). According to ensemble modeling, a combined strategy with the five models exceeded the performance of all the single ones and predicted soil salinity in all scenarios. The results revealed that the ensemble modeling method had higher reliability and more accurate predictive soil salinity than the individual approach. Relative improvement (RI%) showed that the R-2 index in the ensemble model improved compared to the most precise prediction for the Scenarios (1), (2), and (3) with 120.95%, 56.82%, and 66.71%, respectively. We applied the best model in each scenario for mapping the soil salinity in the selected area, which indicated that ECe tended to increase from the northwestern to south and southeastern regions. The area with high ECe was located in the regions that mainly had low elevations and playa. The areas with low ECe were located in the higher elevations with steeper slopes and alluvial fans, and thus, relief had great importance. This study provides a precise, cost-effective, and scientific base prediction for decision-making purposes to map soil salinity in arid regions.

TI  - An operational Sentinel-2 based monitoring system for the management and control of direct aids to the farmers in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): A case study in mainland Portugal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Union (EU) member states are expected to develop new procedures, based on automatic earth observation data analysis, for the management and control of direct aids to the farmers, as part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform of 2020. Here, we propose an operational monitoring system based on Sentinel 2 surface reflectance (SR) data and machine learning (ML) algorithms, consisting of a hierarchical approach triggering 3 color-coded warning alerts to distinguish among compliant (green), non-compliant (red), and inconclusive (yellow) parcels comparatively to the farmer's declaration. A Random Forest (RF) model is applied to a 5-day interpolated SR time series to generate a preliminary crop map, where all the parcels whose predicted and declared crop type match are flagged as compliant. Next, a refinement procedure is adopted to improve the discrimination between temporary and permanent crops. At this stage, VI temporal metrics and texture are used as input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using only the previous compliant parcels. Through a set of decision rules, SVM crop class predictions are flagged as compliant, non-compliant and inconclusive. The system was tested for a significant area in mainland Portugal, using the 2019 Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) data. The system returned 96.5%, 2.5% and 1% of the parcels as compliant, inconclusive, and noncompliant, respectively. Comparison with field inspections for the subsidy control of 2019 revealed that only 1.1% of the correct declarations were classified by the system as non-compliant (5% as admissible value), while less than 5% of the real non-compliant declarations passed through the system (10-20%).

TI  - Joint Use of in-Scene Background Radiance Estimation and Optimal Estimation Methods for Quantifying Methane Emissions Using PRISMA Hyperspectral Satellite Data: Application to the Korpezhe Industrial Site
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) is one of the most contributing anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) in terms of global warming. Industry is one of the largest anthropogenic sources of methane, which are currently only roughly estimated. New satellite hyperspectral imagers, such as PRISMA, open up daily temporal monitoring of industrial methane sources at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Here, we developed the Characterization of Effluents Leakages in Industrial Environment (CELINE) code to inverse images of the Korpezhe industrial site. In this code, the in-Scene Background Radiance (ISBR) method was combined with a standard Optimal Estimation (OE) approach. The ISBR-OE method avoids the use of a complete and time-consuming radiative transfer model. The ISBR-OEM developed here overcomes the underestimation issues of the linear method (LM) used in the literature for high concentration plumes and controls a posteriori uncertainty. For the Korpezhe site, using the ISBR-OEM instead of the LM -retrieved CH4 concentration map led to a bias correction on CH4 mass from 4 to 16% depending on the source strength. The most important CH4 source has an estimated flow rate ranging from 0.36 +/- 0.3 kg.s(-1) to 4 +/- 1.76 kg.s(-1) on nine dates. These local and variable sources contribute to the CH4 budget and can better constrain climate change models.

M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of paleoearthquakes in the territory under study has been estimated by two methods: from the maximum displacement of Quaternary rocks induced by ruptures and from the parameters of clastic dikes of seismic genesis. Based on the use of archival materials from space surveys and Google Earth images, a method for searching for paleoseismic dislocations is substantiated. Searches for seismic manifestations within the Yukki-Toksovo fault zone have been carried out and forty seismogenic scarps have been discovered, some of which are opened by ditches. The study of the scarps makes it possible to estimate the intensity of earthquakes of the late and middle Holocene in this area, respectively, at 7.2 and 6.8 magnitudes. The deep structure of the area of concentration of paleoseismic dislocations has been studied by the spectral-seismic profiling method.

TI  - A comparison of BG Sentinel and CDC trap attractants for mosquito surveillance in urban and suburban areas of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, Maryland, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring mosquito populations is crucial for vector-borne disease surveillance. Routine mosquito surveillance in many regions of the United States is performed either by vector abatement districts or public health departments. These surveillance programs often use multiple trap types and attractants to target key mosquito species, however setting different traps with varying attractants can be expensive and labor intensive. Because funding for mosquito control is highly variable throughout the U.S., some programs may be limited in their surveillance capabilities. To determine whether a single trap-attractant combination could provide specificity for key vector and nuisance species, as well as sensitivity for rare species, we compared the BG-Sentinel 2 and CDC miniature light traps paired with CO2, UV-LED, BG Lure, BG Sweetscent, octenol, or chicken feathers. Trapping was conducted biweekly from June/July-October 2019 and 2020 in Montgomery and Prince George's County, MD. BG traps collected significantly more Aedes albopictus than CDC traps when paired with BG Lure, Sweetscent, or octenol. BG/CO2 traps collected both the greatest number of total mosquitoes and Culex pipiens. BG/CO2, CDC/CO2, and CDC/UV traps provided the most diverse collections. Trapping with the CO2-baited BG-Sentinel is recommended as an effective strategy for general mosquito surveillance when resources are limited.

TI  - Assessment of Wildfire Activity Development Trends for Eastern Australia Using Multi-Sensor Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased fire activity across the Amazon, Australia, and even the Arctic regions has received wide recognition in the global media in recent years. Large-scale, long-term analyses are required to postulate if these incidents are merely peaks within the natural oscillation, or rather the consequence of a linearly rising trend. While extensive datasets are available to facilitate the investigation of the extent and frequency of wildfires, no means has been available to also study the severity of the burnings on a comparable scale. This is now possible through a dataset recently published by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This study exploits the possibilities of this new dataset by exemplarily analyzing fire severity trends on the Australian East coast for the past 20 years. The analyzed data is based on 3503 tiles of the ESA Sentinel-3 OLCI instrument, extended by 9612 granules of the NASA MODIS MOD09/MYD09 product. Rising trends in fire severity could be found for the states of New South Wales and Victoria, which could be attributed mainly to developments in the temperate climate zone featuring hot summers without a dry season (Cfa). Within this climate zone, the ecological units featuring needleleaf and evergreen forest are found to be mainly responsible for the increasing trend development. The results show a general, statistically significant shift of fire activity towards the affection of more woody, ecologically valuable vegetation.

TI  - Methods of Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Auricular Melanoma
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is used to evaluate for micrometastasis in auricular melanoma. However, lymphatic drainage patterns of the ear are not well defined and predicting the location of sentinel nodes can be difficult. The goal of this study was to define the lymphatic drainage patterns of the ear and to compare multiple modalities of sentinel node identification.Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database evaluated 80 patients with auricular melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy by comparing preoperative imaging with intraoperative identification of sentinel nodes. Patients were placed into two cohorts, based on the modality of preoperative imaging: (1) planar lymphoscintigraphy only (n = 63) and (2) single-photon emission computerized tomography combined with computerized tomography (SPECT-CT) only (n = 17). Sites of preoperative mapping and sites of intraoperative identification were recorded as parotid/preauricular, mastoid/postauricular, and/or cervical.Results: In patients that underwent planar lymphoscintigraphy preoperatively (n = 63), significantly more sentinel nodes were identified intraoperatively than were mapped preoperatively in both the parotid/preauricular (P = 0.0017) and mastoid/postauricular (P = 0.0047) regions. Thirty-two nodes were identified intraoperatively that were not mapped preoperatively in the planar lymphoscintigraphy group (n = 63), two of which were positive for micrometastatic disease. In contrast, there were no discrepancies between preoperative mapping and intraoperative identification of sentinel nodes in the SPECT-CT group (n = 17).Conclusions: SPECT-CT is more accurate than planar lymphoscintigraphy for the preoperative identification of draining sentinel lymph nodes in auricular melanoma. If SPECT-CT is not available, planar lymphoscintigraphy can also be used safely, but careful intraoperative evaluation, even in basins not mapped by lymphoscintigraphy, must be performed to avoid missed sentinel nodes.

TI  - Why do large-scale agricultural investments induce different socio-economic, food security, and environmental impacts? Evidence from Kenya, Madagascar, and Mozambique
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale agricultural investments (LAIs) transform land use systems worldwide. There is, however, limited understanding about how the common global drivers of land use change induce different forms of agricultural investment and produce different impacts on the ground. This article provides a cross-country comparative analysis of how differences in business models, land use changes, and governance systems explain differences in socio-economic, food security, and environmental impacts of LAIs in Kenya, Madagascar, and Mozambique. It brings together results on these aspects generated in the AFGROLAND project that collected data in a multi-method approach via household surveys, business model surveys, semi-structured household interviews, life-cycle assessments of farm production, analysis of remote-sensing data, key informant interviews, and document analysis. For the present project synthesis, we combined a collaborative expert workshop with a comparative analysis of 16 LAIs. The results show that the LAIs follow four distinctive impact patterns, ranging from widespread adverse impacts to moderate impacts. Results demonstrate how the following conditions influence how the global drivers of land use change translate into different LAIs and different impacts on the ground: labor intensity, prior land use, utilization of land, farm size, type of production, experience in local agriculture, land tenure security, accountability of state and local elites, the mobilization capacity of civil society, expansion of resource frontiers, agricultural intensification, and indirect land use change. The results indicate that commercial agriculture can be a component in sustainable development strategies under certain conditions, but that these strategies will fail without substantial, sustained increases in the economic viability and inclusiveness of smallholder agriculture, land tenure security, agro-ecological land management, and support for broader patterns of endogenous agrarian transformation.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The use of neural network (NN) models for remote sensing (RS) retrieval of landscape biophysical and biochemical properties has become popular in the last decade. Recently, the emergence of "big data" that can be generated from remotely sensed data and innovative machine learning (ML) approaches have provided a platform for novel analytical approaches. Specifically, the advent of deep learning (DL) frameworks developed from traditional neural networks (TNN) offer unprecedented opportunities to improve the accuracy of SOC retrievals from remotely sensed imagery. This review highlights the use of TNN models and their evolution into DL architectures in remote sensing of SOC estimation. The review also highlights the application of DL, with a specific focus on its development and adoption in remote sensing of SOC mapping. The review concludes by highlighting future opportunities for the use of DL frameworks for the retrieval of SOC from remotely sensed data.

TI  - Ocean Front Detection with Glider and Satellite-Derived SST Data in the Southern California Current System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a method to detect ocean fronts from in situ temperature and density glider measurements. This method is applied to data collected along the CalCOFI Line 90, south of the California Current System (CCS), over the 2006-2013 period. It is based on image-processing techniques commonly applied to sea surface temperature (SST) satellite data. Front detection results using glider data are consistent with those obtained in other studies carried out in the CCS. SST images of the Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) dataset were also used to compare the probability of occurrence or front frequency (FF) obtained with the two datasets. Glider and MUR temperatures are highly correlated. Along Line 90, frontal frequency exhibited the same maxima near the transition zone (~130 km offshore) as derived from MUR and glider datasets. However, marked differences were found in the bimonthly FF probability with high (low) front frequency in spring-summer for glider (MUR) data. Methodological differences explaining these contrasting results are investigated. Thermohaline-compensated fronts are more abundant towards the oceanic zone, although most fronts are detected using both temperature and density criteria, indicating a significant contribution of temperature to density in this region.

TI  - A New Method (MINDED-BA) for Automatic Detection of Burned Areas Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a change detection method (MINDED-BA) for determining burned extents from multispectral remote sensing imagery. It consists of a development of a previous model (MINDED), originally created to estimate flood extents, combining a multi-index image-differencing approach and the analysis of magnitudes of the image-differencing statistics. The method was implemented, using Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, to estimate yearly burn extents within a study area located in northwest central Portugal, from 2000-2019. The modelling workflow includes several innovations, such as preprocessing steps to address some of the most important sources of error mentioned in the literature, and an optimal bin number selection procedure, the latter being the basis for the threshold selection for the classification of burn-related changes. The results of the model have been compared to an official yearly-burn-extent database and allow verifying the significant improvements introduced by both the pre-processing procedures and the multi-index approach. The high overall accuracies of the model (ca. 97%) and its levels of automatization (through open-source software) indicate potential for being a reliable method for systematic unsupervised classification of burned areas.

TI  - Written propaganda and popular education as weapons of the Ossewa-Brandwag's Afrikaner nationalist pursuit, 1939-1952
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ossewa-Brandwag (Ox-wagon sentinel) (OB); was a unique Afrikaner organisation with a national-socialist ideology influenced by the atmosphere of prevailing ideologies of the late 1930s and 1940s. Historiography contains little to no focus on propaganda as a weapon of the organisation's Afrikaner nationalist pursuits. The purpose of this study is to describe the OB's use of the written word as a method of propaganda. The official propaganda policy is described, and its implementation examined within the organisation's endeavour to advance its nationalist ideology. The author consulted primary material to analyse the OB against the organisation's official propaganda policy. This was done to gain a broader perspective on OB propaganda, evaluate the written word as propaganda in the organisation, and describe its success. It was found that the movement's propaganda was only partially successful because the organisation could not keep up with changing local and global conditions and failed to adjust internal policy following external change.

TI  - Contributions of Human Activities and Climatic Variability to Changes in River Rwizi Flows in Uganda, East Africa
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study employed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to analyze the impacts of climate variability and human activities on River Rwizi flows. Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) types from 1997 to 2019 were characterized using remotely sensed images retrieved from Landsat ETM/TM satellites. SWAT was calibrated and validated over the periods 2002-2008 and 2009-2013, respectively. Correlation between rainfall and river flow was analyzed. By keeping the optimal values of model parameters fixed while varying the LULC maps, differences in the modeled flows were taken to reflect the impacts of LULC changes on rainfall-runoff generation. Impacts due to human activities included contributions from changes in LULC types and the rates of water abstracted from the river as a percentage of the observed flow. Climate variability was considered in terms of changes in climatic variables such as rainfall and evapotranspiration, among others. Variability of rainfall was analyzed with respect to changes in large-scale ocean-atmosphere conditions. From 2000 to 2014, the portion of River Rwizi catchment area covered by cropland increased from 23.0% to 51.6%, grassland reduced from 63.3% to 37.8%, and wetland decreased from 8.1% to 4.7%. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values for calibration and validation were 0.60 and 0.71, respectively. Contributions of human activities to monthly river flow changes varied from 2.3% to 23.5%. Impacts of human activities on the river flow were on average found to be larger during the dry (14.7%) than wet (5.8%) season. Using rainfall, 20.9% of the total river flow variance was explained. However, climate variability contributed 73% of the river flow changes. Rainfall was positively and negatively correlated with Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Nino 3, respectively. The largest percentages of the total rainfall variance explained by IOD and Nino 3 were 12.7% and 9.8%, respectively. The magnitude of the correlation between rainfall and IOD decreased with increasing lag in time. These findings are relevant for developing River Rwizi catchment management plans.

TI  - Analysis of Trends in the FireCCI Global Long Term Burned Area Product (1982-2018)
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an analysis of the spatio-temporal trends derived from long-term burned area (BA) data series. Two global BA products were included in our analysis, the FireCCI51 (2001-2019) and the FireCCILT11 (1982-2018) datasets. The former was generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m reflectance data, guided by 1 km active fires. The FireCCILT11 dataset was generated from Land Long-Term Data Record data (0.05 degrees), which provides a consistent time series for Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer images, acquired from the NOAA satellite series. FireCCILT11 is the longest time series of a BA product currently available, making it possible to carry out temporal analysis of long-term trends. Both products were developed under the FireCCI project of the European Space Agency. The two datasets were pre-processed to correct for temporal autocorrelation. Unburnable areas were removed and the lack of the FireCCILT11 data in 1994 was examined to evaluate the impact of this gap on the BA trends. An analysis and comparison between the two BA products was performed using a contextual approach. Results of the contextual Mann-Kendall analysis identified significant trends in both datasets, with very different regional values. The long-term series presented larger clusters than the short-term ones. Africa displayed significant decreasing trends in the short-term, and increasing trends in the long-term data series, except in the east. In the long-term series, Eastern Africa, boreal regions, Central Asia and South Australia showed large BA decrease clusters, and Western and Central Africa, South America, USA and North Australia presented BA increase clusters.

TI  - Development of a consistent global long-term burned area product (1982-2018) based on AVHRR-LTDR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the generation of a global long-term Burned Area (BA) product based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images. The BA product was derived from the Land Long Term Data Record (LTDR), which provides a continuous dataset of geometrically and radiometrically corrected AVHRR images at 0.05 degrees resolution (approximate to 5 km). The BA algorithm improves a Beta version of this dataset (named FireCCILT10) previously released. The new version incorporates an enhanced Random Forest (RF) classification process based on two models, one using a global sample and another one using only Boreal regions. Solar zenith angle (SZA) corrections were introduced to mitigate the impact of satellite orbital drift. Binary classifications were obtained applying probability thresholds, and BA proportions were assigned to each burned pixel. The final product includes the date of detection at 0.05 degrees resolution and the total burned area at 0.05 degrees and 0.25 degrees resolution, both covering the period from 1982 to 2018 (excluding 1994). The resulting product, called FireCCILT11, estimated that 165.26 Mkm2 were globally burned between 1982 and 2018, with an annual average of 4.59 Mkm2. The largest BA was found in 2011 with 5.18 Mkm2 and the lowest was observed in 1991 with 4.09 Mkm2. The month with the highest mean BA was August, with 0.63 Mkm2, and the one with the lowest was March with 0.15 Mkm2. Africa included 66% of total BA. Inter-comparison showed high correlation values with MODIS BA products for annual BA of the common years (r 14%). Comparison with national fire statistics of Australia, Canada and Alaska showed also high correlation values (r 0.8, %MAE < 42%).

TI  - Landsat-Derived Annual Maps of Agricultural Greenhouse in Shandong Province, China from 1989 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural greenhouse (AG), one of the fastest-growing technology-based approaches worldwide in terms of controlling the environmental conditions of crops, plays an essential role in food production, resource conservation and the rural economy, but has also caused environmental and socio-economic problems due to policy promotion and market demand. Therefore, long-term monitoring of AG is of utmost importance for the sustainable management of protected agriculture, and previous efforts have verified the effectiveness of remote sensing-based techniques for mono-temporal AG mapping in a relatively small area. However, currently, a continuous annual AG remote sensing-based dataset at large-scale is generally unavailable. In this study, an annual AG mapping method oriented to the provincial area and long-term period was developed to produce the first Landsat-derived annual AG dataset in Shandong province, China from 1989 to 2018 on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The mapping window for each year was selected based on the vegetation growth and the phenological information, which was critical in distinguishing AG from other misclassified categories. Classification for each year was carried out initially based on the random forest classifier after the feature optimization. A temporal consistency correction algorithm based on classification probability was then proposed to the classified AG maps for further improvement. Finally, the average User's Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy and F1-score of AG based on visually-interpreted samples over 30 years reached 96.56%, 86.64% and 0.911, respectively. Furthermore, we also found that the ranked features via calculating the importance of each tested feature resulted in the highest accuracy and the strongest stability in the initial classification stage, and the proposed temporal consistency correction algorithm improved the final products by approximately five percent on average. In general, the resultant AG sequence dataset from our study has revealed the expansion of this typical object of "Human-Nature" interaction in agriculture and has a potential application in use of greenhouse-related technology and the scientific planning of protected agriculture.

TI  - A Slight Temperature Warming Trend Occurred over Lake Ontario from 2001 to 2018
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived lake surface water temperature (LSWT) measurements can be used for monitoring purposes. However, analyses based on the LSWT of Lake Ontario and the surrounding land surface temperature (LST) are scarce in the current literature. First, we provide an evaluation of the commonly used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived LSWT/LST (MOD11A1 and MYD11A1) using in situ measurements near the area of where Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence River and the Rideau Canal meet. The MODIS datasets agreed well with ground sites measurements from 2015-2017, with an R-2 consistently over 0.90. Among the different ground measurement sites, the best results were achieved for Hill Island, with a correlation of 0.99 and centered root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.73 K for Aqua/MYD nighttime. The validated MODIS datasets were used to analyze the temperature trend over the study area from 2001 to 2018, through a linear regression method with a Mann-Kendall test. A slight warming trend was found, with 95% confidence over the ground sites from 2003 to 2012 for the MYD11A1-Night datasets. The warming trend for the whole region, including both the lake and the land, was about 0.17 K year(-1) for the MYD11A1 datasets during 2003-2012, whereas it was about 0.06 K year(-1) during 2003-2018. There was also a spatial pattern of warming, but the trend for the lake region was not obviously different from that of the land region. For the monthly trends, the warming trends for September and October from 2013 to 2018 are much more apparent than those of other months.

TI  - Second round statewide sentinel-based population survey for estimation of the burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population of Karnataka, India, during January-February 2021.
T2  - IJID regions
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Demonstrate the feasibility of using the existing sentinel surveillance infrastructure to conduct the second round of the serial cross-sectional sentinel-based population survey. Assess active infection, seroprevalence, and their evolution in the general population across Karnataka. Identify local variations for locally appropriate actions. Additionally, assess the clinical sensitivity of the testing kit used on account of variability of antibody levels in the population.Methods: The cross-sectional study of 41,228 participants across 290 healthcare facilities in all 30 districts of Karnataka was done among three groups of participants (low, moderate, and high-risk). The geographical spread was sufficient to capture local variations. Consenting participants were subjected to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and antibody (IgG) testing. Clinical sensitivity was assessed by conducting a longitudinal study among participants identified as COVID-19 positive in the first survey round.Results: Overall weighted adjusted seroprevalence of IgG was 15.6% (95% CI: 14.9-16.3), crude IgG prevalence was 15.0% and crude active infection was 0.5%. Statewide infection fatality rate (IFR) was estimated as 0.11%, and COVID-19 burden estimated between 26.1 to 37.7% (at 90% confidence). Further, Cases-to-infections ratio (CIR) varied 3-35 across units and IFR varied 0.04-0.50% across units. Clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA test kit was estimated as ≥38.9%.Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility and simplicity of sentinel-based population survey in measuring variations in subnational and local data, useful for locally appropriate actions in different locations. The sentinel-based population survey thus helped identify districts that needed better testing, reporting, and clinical management. The state was far from attaining natural immunity during the survey and hence must step up vaccination coverage and enforce public health measures to prevent the spread of COVD-19.

TI  - Promoting a Pro-Ecological View: The Effects of Art on Engineering Students' Perceptions of the Environment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In an effort to suggest an extended role that art could play in promoting a pro-ecological worldview, this study reviews a two-week artist-led workshop, organized as part of an undergraduate art course offered by a university specializing in engineering and the natural sciences. To explore the potential impact of studio work on engineering student perceptions, we collected data from multiple sources, including field notes, participant observations, outcomes of the group projects, and participants' responses to studio work during the workshop. In particular, to provide educational implications, our review focused on the findings from post-project surveys collected through online questionnaires and in-person interviews. In order to make suggestions on art courses that are specifically designed to cultivate engineering students' perceptions of the environment, we carried out online surveys based on the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale. The results of the NEP-based surveys indicated that engineering students' anti-anthropocentrism, rejection of human exceptionalism, and acknowledgement of the possibility of an eco-crisis were significantly correlated with a belief in public welfare. By comparison, respondents' stronger public welfare beliefs were not associated with beliefs in limits to growth and the fragility of nature's balance. This study responds to today's complex socio-environmental issues by contributing to the discussion about the need to integrate interdisciplinary approaches into engineering education on environmental sustainability.

TI  - Transformer-Based Decoder Designs for Semantic Segmentation on Remotely Sensed Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformers have demonstrated remarkable accomplishments in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks as well as image processing tasks. Herein, we present a deep-learning (DL) model that is capable of improving the semantic segmentation network in two ways. First, utilizing the pre-training Swin Transformer (SwinTF) under Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone, the model weights downstream tasks by joining task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Secondly, decoder designs are applied to our DL network with three decoder designs, U-Net, pyramid scene parsing (PSP) network, and feature pyramid network (FPN), to perform pixel-level segmentation. The results are compared with other image labeling state of the art (SOTA) methods, such as global convolutional network (GCN) and ViT. Extensive experiments show that our Swin Transformer (SwinTF) with decoder designs reached a new state of the art on the Thailand Isan Landsat-8 corpus (89.8% F1 score), Thailand North Landsat-8 corpus (63.12% F1 score), and competitive results on ISPRS Vaihingen. Moreover, both our best-proposed methods (SwinTF-PSP and SwinTF-FPN) even outperformed SwinTF with supervised pre-training ViT on the ImageNet-1K in the Thailand, Landsat-8, and ISPRS Vaihingen corpora.

TI  - Unprecedented acceleration of winter discharge of Upper Yenisei River inferred from tree rings
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yenisei River is the largest contributor of freshwater and energy fluxes among all rivers draining to the Arctic Ocean. Modeling long-term variability of Eurasian runoff to the Arctic Ocean is complicated by the considerable variability of river discharge in time and space, and the monitoring constraints imposed by a sparse gauged-flow network and paucity of satellite data. We quantify tree growth response to river discharge at the upper reaches of the Yenisei River in Tuva, South Siberia. Two regression models built from eight tree-ring width chronologies of Larix sibirica are applied to reconstruct winter (Nov-Apr) discharge for the period 1784-1997 (214 years), and annual (Oct-Sept) discharge for the period 1701-2000 (300 years). The Nov-Apr model explains 52% of the discharge variance whereas Oct-Sept explains 26% for the calibration intervals 1927-1997 and 1927-2000, respectively. This new hydrological archive doubles the length of the instrumental discharge record at the Kyzyl gauge and resets the temporal background of discharge variability back to 1784. The reconstruction finds a remarkable 80% upsurge in winter flow over the last 25 years, which is unprecedented in the last 214 years. In contrast, annual discharge fluctuated normally for this system, with only a 7% increase over the last 25 years. Water balance modeling with CRU data manifests a significant discrepancy between decadal variability of the gauged flow and climate data after 1960. We discuss the impact on the baseflow rate change of both the accelerating permafrost warming in the discontinuous zone of South Siberia and widespread forest fires. The winter discharge accounts for only one third of the annual flow, yet the persistent 25 year upsurge is alarming. This trend is likely caused by Arctic Amplification, which can be further magnified by increased winter flow delivering significantly more fresh water to the Kara Sea during the cold season.

TI  - A Dual-Surgeon Approach to Breast Cancer Surgery in a Transmale
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing numbers of gender-affirming chest surgery, new questions regarding breast cancer management and surgical practice arise. Guided by our case report, we present a comprehensive review of breast cancer surgery in a transman to educate both plastic and breast surgeons on various factors to consider when caring for these patients. Our case involves a 31-year-old transmale patient who presented for plastic surgery consultation for gender-affirming mastectomy but was subsequently found to have a right breast mass. This is the first case in the literature of a transmale on hormone therapy with breast cancer interested in gender-affirming surgery, thus requiring a dual-surgeon approach for oncologic and gender-affirming mastectomy. With a multidisciplinary patient-centered approach involving breast surgery, plastic surgery, medical oncology, and radiology, we devised a surgical plan to safely remove his breast tissue with consideration for his gender-affirming goals. He underwent a right skin-sparing mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy and left prophylactic skin-sparing mastectomy through skin markings by the plastic surgeon, with bilateral free nipple grafts. Final pathology confirmed estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive and androgen receptor-positive invasive ductal carcinoma with clear margins and negative sentinel node. The patient did not require adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation but was started on adjuvant hormone therapy targeting his hormone receptor positive cancer. He elected to stay on low-dose masculinizing hormone therapy with continued surveillance examinations. We follow our case with a review of the current literature involving breast cancer in transmales to explore current screening practices, surgical recommendations, adjuvant therapies, continuation of masculinizing hormone therapy, and postoperative surveillance guidelines in the hopes of informing plastic surgeons in having these discussions with their transmale patients and thus improving informed cancer care for this population.

TI  - Flood Hazard Mapping Using Fuzzy Logic, Analytical Hierarchy Process, and Multi-Source Geospatial Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Iran is among the driest countries in the world, where many natural hazards, such as floods, frequently occur. This study introduces a straightforward flood hazard assessment approach using remote sensing datasets and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment in an area located in the western part of Iran. Multiple GIS and remote sensing datasets, including Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, rainfall, distance from the main rivers, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps, soil type map, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and erosion rate were initially produced. Then, all datasets were converted into fuzzy values using a linear fuzzy membership function. Subsequently, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was applied to determine the weight of each dataset, and the relevant weight values were then multiplied to fuzzy values. Finally, all the processed parameters were integrated using a fuzzy analysis to produce the flood hazard map with five classes of susceptible zones. The bi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, acquired before and on the day of the flood event, were used to evaluate the accuracy of the produced flood hazard map. The results indicated that 95.16% of the actual flooded areas were classified as very high and high flood hazard classes, demonstrating the high potential of this approach for flood hazard mapping.

TI  - Glacier area changes and its relation to climatological trends over Western Himalaya between 1971 and 2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the climatic complexity and its consequences on glacier health are of critical importance for the health of the Himalayan glacier and its contribution to the water budget. In this study, satellite datasets are used to estimate the glacier area loss, snow cover variability, and reanalysis data for climatic trends for four glacierised basins (Chandra, Bhaga, Miyar, and Parvati) of the Western Himalaya. In total, 257 glaciers covering a glacierised area of 1306 km(2), having a mean altitude of 5200 m asl, and an average slope of 18 degrees, were analyzed using Corona (1971) and Sentinel (2018) satellite data. These glaciers have experienced a significant glacier area loss rate (0.2 km(2)a(-1)) and an increase in the number of glaciers on account of fragmentation. Snow cover estimate during 2000-2019 using MODIS data showed no significant change or a slight decrease in snow cover area during the last two decades. However, the ERA-Interim reanalysis data revealed a systematic decrease in precipitation, an increase in temperature and an increase in liquid precipitation over the region during 1979-2018. The increased liquid precipitation possibly contributed to the faster melting of the snow and ice and consequently affected the glaciers' health. The observed glacier fragmentation and glacier mass loss over the five decades and enhanced rainfall activity revealed a significant influence of climatic changes over the glacierised region in Western Himalaya.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation in land use/land cover pattern and channel migration in Majuli River Island, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise land use and land cover (LULC) change information of a land surface is significant for sustainable development programs as the earth's surface is undergoing rapid changes. Majuli Island is located in the upper reach of the Brahmaputra River in India. It is continuously changing its shape by the action of erosion of the Brahmaputra River, incurring both tangible and intangible losses. This study aims to find out the changes that occurred in the island by analyzing the land use/land cover along with channel migration in the Brahmaputra River that occurred in that area over the period 1973 to 2019. This paper assesses the changes and present status of Majuli River Island from 1973 to 2019 using Landsat MSS (1973), TM (1985, 1995), ETM + (2009), and OLI (2019) satellite imageries. Here, the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) technique for LULC analysis and their temporal changes and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) technique for the vegetation characteristics have been processed and analyzed with the help of the geospatial information system (GIS). From the results, it is found that area of vegetation has gradually decreased from 365.59 (26.85%) in 1973 to 262.79 km(2) (19.29%) in 2019. In contrast, the barren land had increased from 4.82 (0.35%) in 1973 to 31.88 km(2) (2.34%) in 2019. Other LULC categories like agricultural lands, built-up areas, water bodies, and sand deposition also have changed significantly. The NDVI values are also changed due to channel shifting, soil erosion, and deforestation. The accuracy assessment for the supervised classification of LULC classes for all years showed excellent results in all six classes.

TI  - The Battle Within and the Battle Without: The Posthuman Worldview of Ken MacLeod's <i>The Corporation Wars</i> Trilogy
T2  - AMERICAN, BRITISH AND CANADIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present essay seeks to analyze Scottish science fiction writer Ken MacLeod's The Corporation Wars trilogy (2016-2017) as an amalgam of politico-philosophical ideas set against the background of posthumanism. MacLeod's far-future posthuman world-building relies on the conventional tropes of science fiction (man-machine hybrids, brain uploading, digital resurrection, and the agency of sentient machines) to engage with pressing ideologies (the master-slave dialectics, the historical perpetuation of age-old conflict between progressive and reactionary forces, the ethics of machinic consciousness). MacLeod's novels project a postbinarist worldview where outmoded binary oppositions between life and death, the real and the virtual, the human and the machinic are constantly abolished, but which still preserves persistent ideological divisions.

TI  - THE APPLICATION OF SENTINEL-2 DATA FOR AUTOMATIC FOREST COVER CHANGES ASSESSMENT - BIALOWIEZA PRIMEVAL FOREST CASE STUDY
T2  - CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 mission, as a part of European Space Agency Earth Observation Program Copernicus, designed specifically for Earth surface observations provides images in 13 bands. That imaging is used to analyse many subject areas as Land monitoring, Emergency management, Security and Climate change. In the presented paper the application of Sentinel-2 data for automatic forest cover changes detection has been analysed. As input data, B02, B03, B04 and B08 bands have been used to compute Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI). To track changes in the forest cover over the years, for each pixel the difference in the value of vegetation indices between consecutive years have been calculated. Then the threshold was set at the level of 0.15. The values of differences above the threshold mean a significant decrease in the quality of vegetation and may be considered areas of deforestation.

TI  - The Morphological Evolution of a Step-Pool Stream after an Exceptional Flood and Subsequent Ordinary Flow Conditions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain streams are frequently characterized by step-pool morphology that provides stability and energy dissipation to the channel network. Large flooding events can overturn the equilibrium of the step-pool condition by altering the entire configuration. This work focuses on the impact of the "Vaia" storm (27-30 October 2018) on a step-pool mountain stream (Rio Cordon, Northeast Italy) and on its evolution after two years of ordinary flow conditions. To achieve the aims, this work uses both remote sensing data (LiDAR and UAV) and direct field measurements (i.e., longitudinal profiles and grain sizes distributions) performed pre-event, post-event, and 2 years later (current conditions). The results show a significant widening (width +81%, area +68%) and the creation of a new avulsion after the storm and a substantial change between the number of units (51 in the pre-event, 22 post-event, and 51 in the current conditions) and characteristics of step-pool sequences between pre- and post-conditions. Furthermore, it proves the ongoing processes of morphological stabilization since the current step-pool sequences parameters are heading back to the pre-event values. Such results suggest clear susceptibility of step-pool to exceptional events and fast recovery of such setting during barely two years of ordinary flow conditions.

TI  - A Near-Real-Time Method for Estimating Volcanic Ash Emissions Using Satellite Retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a Bayesian inversion method for estimating volcanic ash emissions using satellite retrievals of ash column load and an atmospheric dispersion model. An a priori description of the emissions is used based on observations of the rise height of the volcanic plume and a stochastic model of the possible emissions. Satellite data are processed to give column loads where ash is detected and to give information on where we have high confidence that there is negligible ash. An atmospheric dispersion model is used to relate emissions and column loads. Gaussian distributions are assumed for the a priori emissions and for the errors in the satellite retrievals. The optimal emissions estimate is obtained by finding the peak of the a posteriori probability density under the constraint that the emissions are non-negative. We apply this inversion method within a framework designed for use during an eruption with the emission estimates (for any given emission time) being revised over time as more information becomes available. We demonstrate the approach for the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull and 2011 Grimsvotn eruptions. We apply the approach in two ways, using only the ash retrievals and using both the ash and clear sky retrievals. For Eyjafjallajokull we have compared with an independent dataset not used in the inversion and have found that the inversion-derived emissions lead to improved predictions.

TI  - SPATIAL CLASSIFICATION OF URBAN LAND BY SPECULATIVE LAND VALUE AND MSI SATELLITE IMAGERY USING K-MEANS, IN HUANCAYO, PERU
T2  - URBANO
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Huancayo. like other intermediate cities in Latin America, faces problems of poorly planned land-use changes and a rapid dynamic of the urban land market. The scarce and outdated information on the urban territory impedes the adequate classification of urban areas, limiting the form of its intervention. The purpose of this research was the adoption of unassisted and mixed methods for the spatial classification of urban areas, considering the speculative land value, the proportion of urbanized land, and other geospatial variables. Among the data collection media. Multi-Spectral Imagery (MSI) from the Sentinel-2 satellite. the primary road system, and a sample of direct observation points, were used. The processed data were incorporated into georeferenced maps, to which urban limits and official slopes were added. During data processing, the K-Means algorithm was used. together with other machine learning and assisted judgment methods. As a result, an objective classification of urban areas was obtained, which differs from the existing planning.

TI  - Continuous Change Mapping to Understand Wetland Quantity and Quality Evolution and Driving Forces: A Case Study in the Liao River Estuary from 1986 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland ecosystems, one of the most important ecosystems in the world, play an important role in regulating climate, sequestering blue carbon, and maintaining sustainable development of coastal zones. Wetland landscapes are notoriously difficult to map with satellite data, particularly in highly complex, dynamic coastal regions. The Liao River Estuary (LRE) wetland in Liaoning Province, China, has attracted major attention due to its status as Asia's largest coastal wetland, with extensive Phragmites australis (reeds), Suaeda heteroptera (seepweed, red beach), and other natural resources that have been continuously encroached upon by anthropogenic land-use activities. Using the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm and all available Landsat images, we mapped the spatial-temporal changes of LRE coastal wetlands (e.g., seepweed, reed, tidal flats, and shallow marine water) annually from 1986 to 2018 and analyzed the changes and driving forces. Results showed that the total area of coastal wetlands in the LRE shrank by 14.8% during the study period. The tidal flats were the most seriously affected type, with 45.7% of its total area lost. One of the main characteristics of wetland change was the concurrent disappearance and emergence of wetlands in different parts of the LRE, creating drastically different mixtures of wetland quality (e.g., wetland age composition) in addition to area change. The reduction and replacement/translocation of coastal wetlands were mainly caused by human activities related to urbanization, tourism, land reclamation, and expansion of aquaculture ponds. Our efforts in mapping annual changes of wetlands provide direct, specific, and spatially explicit information on rates, patterns, and causes of coastal wetland change, both in coverage and quality, so as to contribute to the effective plans and policies for coastal management, preservation, and restoration of coastal ecosystem services.

TI  - Monitoring Small Water Bodies Using High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Analysis Ready Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Basemap and Planet Fusion-derived from PlanetScope imagery-represent the next generation of analysis ready datasets that minimize the effects of the presence of clouds. These datasets have high spatial (3 m) and temporal (daily) resolution, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve the monitoring of on-farm reservoirs (OFRs)-small water bodies that store freshwater and play important role in surface hydrology and global irrigation activities. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of both datasets to monitor sub-weekly surface area changes of 340 OFRs in eastern Arkansas, USA, and we evaluated the datasets main differences when used to monitor OFRs. When comparing the OFRs surface area derived from Basemap and Planet Fusion to an independent validation dataset, both datasets had high agreement (r(2) >= 0.87), and small uncertainties, with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) between 7.05% and 10.08%. Pairwise surface area comparisons between the two datasets and the PlanetScope imagery showed that 61% of the OFRs had r(2) >= 0.55, and 70% of the OFRs had MAPE <5%. In general, both datasets can be employed to monitor OFRs sub-weekly surface area changes, and Basemap had higher surface area variability and was more susceptible to the presence of cloud shadows and haze when compared to Planet Fusion, which had a smoother time series with less variability and fewer abrupt changes throughout the year. The uncertainties in surface area classification decreased as the OFRs increased in size. In addition, the surface area time series can have high variability, depending on the OFR environmental conditions (e.g., presence of vegetation inside the OFR). Our findings suggest that both datasets can be used to monitor OFRs sub-weekly, seasonal, and inter-annual surface area changes; therefore, these datasets can help improve freshwater management by allowing better assessment and management of the OFRs.

TI  - Information Content of Spectral Vegetation Indices for Assessing the Weed Infestation of Crops Using Ground-Based and Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study assessing the degree of weed infestation of wheat crops. They are obtained using optical ground-based and satellite spectral data with a 3-m spatial resolution from PlanetScope Dove satellites for 2019. The vegetation indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the relative chlorophyll index (Chlorophyll Index Green-ClGreen or GCI), the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2), and the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) are used in the interpretation of ground-based spectrometric and space images. This paper indicates the possibility of assessing the degree of weed infestation of agricultural fields. The higher the weed infestation, the lower the index values. The dynamics of VARI is found to be different from the dynamics of NDVI, ClGreen, and MSAVI2 during the growing season. The strong correlation between NDVI, ClGreen, and MSAVI2 and the weak correlation between VARI and other indices are observed. The possibility of identifying weedy sites in the agricultural fields is shown using the spatial distribution map of ClGreen dated August 2, 2019.

TI  - On Rehumanizing Pleistocene People of the Western Hemisphere
T2  - AMERICAN ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the emergence of the niche in Folsom, New Mexico, in the late 1920s, peopling archaeology has sought to understand the earliest human occupants of the Western Hemisphere. Three generations of practitioners have made great strides in the techno-environmental arena. However, we have largely failed to tap into PaleoIndigenous intellectual, emotional, and social lives-the very domains that made Ice Age people as fully human as we are. As a result, our interpretations of those pioneering populations could often apply as readily to a colony of ants or a herd of wildebeest as they do to living, breathing, thinking, dreaming, loving, striving human ancestors. This article first explores the reasons for our failure to fully actualize First Peoples, identifying and implicating a feedback loop that includes practitioner homogeneity (we have always been and continue to be disproportionately white men of European descent); our predominantly positivist worldview; our language, training, and practice; and even the limited nature of the material record we study. This article also, however, highlights the ways that an important minority of peopling scholars have sought to access the humanity of PaleoIndigenous people. By more consistently mobilizing our own human capacity to creatively interrogate the deep past, we will produce scholarship that more consistently recognizes the capacity of the people who lived it and, just as importantly, respects those living today.

TI  - Features of the long-term transformation of the Krasnodar reservoir, near the mouth of the Kuban River, Russia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the long-term (1941-2018) transformation of the Krasnodar valley reservoir, the largest in the North Caucasus. The main functions of the Krasnodar reservoir are irrigation of rice systems and flood protection of land in the Krasnodar reservoir region and the Republic of Adygea. According to topographic maps, Landsat satellite images (1974-2018) and field observations (2016-2018), four stages of transformation of the flood-plain reservoir are identified. The selected stages are characterized by both natural causes (the transformation of the filling deltas into the extended deltas, etc.) and man-made causes (runoff diversions in the delta areas, etc.). The key factor of transformation is the formation of deltas of rivers flowing into the reservoir. Each of the selected stages, against the background of a gradual reduction in the area and volume of the reservoir, is characterized by the peculiarities of the formation of river deltas with the formation of genetically homogeneous sections of delta regions. During the period of operation of the reservoir, the delta of the main Kuban River moved up to 32.4 km and took away an area of 35.4 km(2) of the reservoir. During the formation of the deltas of the Kuban and Belaya rivers, a bridge was formed on the Krasnodar reservoir. The evolution of the delta regions led to the division of the reservoir into two autonomous reservoirs. The total area of the delta regions was 85.9 km(2) by 2018, i.e., 21% of the initial area of the reservoir. The transformation of the Krasnodar reservoir leads to a decrease in its regulated volume and gradual degradation.

TI  - Challenging Visualization of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the possibility of detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and to perform analysis of lymphatic outflow in patients with suspicion of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) with the use of a radioisotope-based technique. Methods: During 2018-2021, a prospective study was conducted on 19 patients with the suspicion of UTUC and for whom diagnostic ureterorenoscopy (URS) was planned. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) nanocolloid radioactive tracer injection and a tumor biopsy were performed for staging procedures. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and fusion of images were performed for better localization of lymph nodes (LNs). Detection of SLNs and the analysis of the radiotracer outflow was conducted with the use of single-photon emission-computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) lymphangiography. Results: The mean age of the patients was 73.4 years; 7 (36%) were male. Pathological staging from the biopsy was T0-8 (42%), Ta-7 (36%), T1-4 (21%). SLNs were detected in two of 19 cases (10%). In one patient a single SLN (5.3%) was visualized, and in another case (5.3%), multiple (double) radioactive lymph nodes were visualized. In 17 out of the 19 (89.5%) cases, no lymphatic outflow was observed, and out of these five cases (26.3%) of gravitational leakage of injected radiotracer to the retroperitoneal space was noted. Conclusions: We demonstrated that detection of SLNs in the upper urinary tract is possible yet challenging. Radiotracer injection in the upper urinary tract during ureterorenoscopy is difficult to perform, and the expected result of injection is unsatisfactory. Lymphatic outflow from the tumor site to the first LNs in our studied group of patients is visible in 10.5% of cases. SPECT/CT lymphangiography in cases of UTUC may provide valuable information about a patient's individual anatomy of the lymphatic system and the position of the first lymph nodes draining lymph with potential metastatic cells from the tumor.

TI  - Long-Term Tendencies of Intensity of Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems Assessed from Different Satellite Data. Part 1: Atlantic Upwellings
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparative estimation of long-term trends in the variability of the largest Atlantic upwellings (Canary and Benguela) has been carried out in this paper. Satellite data on the sea surface temperature and three surface wind datasets prepared by different scientific groups have been used. The difference in the calculated absolute vertical velocities due to alongshore wind drift and horizontal wind-field nonuniformity reach tens of percent. All time series demonstrate the common tendency for the intensification of the upwellings from the 1980s to the early 1990s. This confirms published materials concerning the intensification of Canary and Benguela upwellings under global warming. However, since the late 1990s, the intensification of the upwellings has nearly ceased. This proves the highly important role of the natural interdecadal climate variations in the variability of intensity of generation of upwellings during the period of regular satellite measurements.

TI  - Long-Term Tendencies of Intensity of Eastern-Boundary Upwelling Systems Assessed from Different Satellite Data. Part 2: Pacific Upwellings
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparative estimation of long-term trends in the intensity of the largest Pacific upwellings (California, Peru, and Chile) has been performed based on sea-surface-temperature satellite data and three surface-wind datasets prepared by different research groups. The methodology for estimating such trends is similar to that used in the first part of the study, which was dedicated to Atlantic upwellings. Just as in the case of the Atlantic upwellings, the differences in absolute vertical velocities calculated from different data and caused by the rundown effect and horizontal wind-field inhomogeneity reach tens of percent and even one hundred percent. At the same time, the identified trends demonstrate a general intensification of upwellings since the 1980s, which is confirmed by the published data on the intensification of the California, Peru, and Chile upwellings during the period of global warming. However, not all Pacific upwellings show monotonic intensification throughout the period under study. This indicates the highly important role that is played by natural interdecadal climatic variations in the generation of the variability of the upwellings' intensity during the period of regular satellite measurements.

TI  - Proletarian Allegorism On the relationship between Poetry, Religion and Labor at Simone Weil and Charles Baudelaire
T2  - DEUTSCHE VIERTELJAHRSSCHRIFT FUR LITERATURWISSENSCHAFT UND GEISTESGESCHICHTE
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of two texts by Simone Weil and Charles Baudelaire, the article examines the religious signature of literary and political modernity in the 19th and 20th centuries. This signature manifests itself in a genuinely allegorical understanding of language and the world, which is directed against the bad infinity of a techno-scientifically reified worldview insulating itself against any experience of alterity. In literary modernity, religious concepts and figures are not to be categorized a priori as inauthentic speech, but demand an unprejudiced reading that does not exclude theological questions. Walter Benjamin's reading of Baudelaire bears witness to this.

TI  - Satellite Data Applications for Site-Specific Air Quality Regulation in the UK: Pilot Study and Prospects
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric composition data from satellite platforms offers great potential for improving current understanding of anthropogenic emissions. Whilst this data has been used extensively in research, its use by governments to regulate and assess site-specific legislation compliance is minimal. Here, we outline the regulatory context for air quality regulation in the UK, and present a pilot study highlighting the potential of current instruments. The pilot study demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for detecting and isolating emissions of NO2 from regulated UK point sources. This study successfully isolated NO2 emissions from a cluster of three closely situated regulated sites in the north east of England, despite their proximity to large urban sources. This is the first time these sites have been resolved from satellite-based observations, and serves as a clear demonstration of the potential of current and future Earth observation data products for site-specific monitoring and investigation within the UK.

TI  - Racial disparities in pediatric otolaryngology: current state and future hope
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY & HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review The current article reviews the current literature and selected sentinel papers on health disparities particularly relevant to the field of pediatric otolaryngology. The discussion will explore racial disparities in otologic and airway intervention areas, as well as general adenotonsillar disease management. Access to and quality of care will be examined, and disparate outcomes discussed. Recent findings Growing published data demonstrate children from nonwhite backgrounds receive disparate specialty care in representative fields of pediatric otolaryngology. Racial disparities exist in specialty care pediatric otolaryngology. Such disparities should be viewed in the light of generational inequalities in the United States and the foundational inequities that perpetuate them. Parity in the delivery of such specialty care depends on recognizing our current state and intentional efforts to modulate the impact of such effectual factors.

TI  - Suspended sediments concentration on shoreline change using satellite images for southern Kerala coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline is a dynamic system where erosion/accretion patterns and sea-level rise takes place due to the natural marine processes and anthropogenic activities. The movement of suspended sediment along the coastal water is an indicator of erosion and deposition of the coastal landforms. This study aims to analyse the shoreline changes and the corresponding spatio-temporal pattern of suspended sediment concentration of the southern Kerala coast using Sentinel 2 MSI satellite images for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. Single band at 645 nm shows good correlation with better regression co-efficient in a closed or semi-enclosed lake that shows less complexity of water quality. Hence red band of Sentinel 2 MSI has been used to estimate the suspended sediments in this study. Total suspended sediment along the south Kerala coast ranging from 0-10 mg/l has been estimated from the satellite images. The seasonal pattern of suspended sediment concentration has been estimated from the satellite images (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The suspended sediments derived from the satellite image have been compared with the corresponding field data. The suspended sediment concentration derived from the satellite images shows a correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.85 with the field data. Similarly, the shoreline erosion and accretion have been analysed from the shoreline change analysis methods. In this study, monthly and seasonal shoreline changes have been estimated along the southern Kerala coast using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the corresponding available dates of the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The shoreline from the satellite image has been validated with the shoreline derived from the field collected beach profile data. The shoreline erosion and accretion have been compared with the sediment concentration map derived from the satellite images along the south Kerala coast. It is inferred that, with the use of satellite images, the relation between the erosion/accretion pattern and the suspended sediment pattern along the coast can be visualised and qualitatively studied.

TI  - The Moral Problems of Economism in an Age of Eco-Crisis
T2  - JOURNAL FOR CRITICAL EDUCATION POLICY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - To make a convincing argument, people are nowadays expected to speak the language of economics. Neoliberalism has become notorious for making an economic worldview dominate politics, yet it offers only a partial and ideologically inclined explanation for the zeitgeist of today. This paper expands upon the term, or ideology, of economism as a critical means for understanding educational politics and the contemporary formation of moral subjectivity. Economism helps clarify the the ideological features of mainstream economics that can influence education. Rather than describe the influence of markets and competition as an 'invisible hand', this paper envisages it less favourably as an 'invisible foot'. Philosophers such as Samuel Bowles, Michael Sandel and Robin Hahnel claim that seeing the world through a purely economic lens crowds out certain important features of the human character such as moral obligation. Based on my earlier research I show how competitive ways of thinking are hampering the learning of ecological virtues, such as empathy. The ideology of economism is thus examined as a concept from a primarily moral or virtue-ethical perspective. Rather than examining moral rules or moral obligations as such, virtue-ethics asks what character traits we should adopt to live a morally fulfilling or ecologically viable life. This philosophical paper therefore has two main research questions: (1) What is economism? (2) How does economism affect our moral character? The main conclusion is that economism and competition have a detrimental impact that hardens our moral subjectivity.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring and Restoration Evaluation of Ecological Environment in Shennongjia Area
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] To monitor and evaluate the change of ecological environment by using vegetation coverage change information in Shennongjia Forest Region, Shennongjia Nature Reserve and outside the reserve in the past two decades, combined with forest management activities and governance methods in different periods. [Method] Taking Shennongjia Forest Region, Shennongjia Nature Reserve and outside the reserve as the research area, using the three phases of Landsat remote sensing images in 1999, 2007 and 2019 to estimate the vegetation coverage of the study area based on dimidiate pixel model, and the method of difference analysis was used to calculate the vegetation coverage changes in each region. The results were evaluated and analyzed in conjunction with the changes in national policies and business activities in different period. [Result] From 1999 to 2019, the mean forest vegetation coverage (FVC) of Shennongjia Forest Region increased by 8.25%, the area with high FVC accounted for 97.50%. The vegetation coverage in protection zone has been better than that out of protection zone in the early stage, but in the late stage, the difference of vegetation coverage in and outside the protected zone is smaller. [Conclusion] In recent 20 years, the vegetation coverage of Shennongjia Forest Region has been on the trend of increasing, and the ecological environment has gradually become balanced, which indicates that the establishment of nature reserves, the natural forest protection project and the conversion of farmland to forest project are effective for the restoration of the regional ecological environment.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass in Karst Areas Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data and the K-DBN Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest biomass is the basis for monitoring forest productivity and carbon sink function, which is of great significance for the formulation of forest carbon neutralization strategy and forest quality improvement measures. Taking Guizhou, a typical karst region in China, as the research area, this study used Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-1A, and China national forest resources continuous inventory data (NFCI) in 2015 to build a deep belief network (DBN) model for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation. Based on the introduction of forest canopy density (FCD), we improved the DBN model to design the K-DBN model with the highest estimation accuracy is selected for AGB inversion and spatial mapping. The results showed that: (1) The determination coefficients R-2 of DBN is 0.602, which are 0.208, 0.101 higher than that of linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) model. (2) The K-DBN algorithm was designed based on FCD to optimize the DBN model, which can alleviate the common problems of low-value overestimation and high-value underestimation in AGB estimation to a certain extent to improve the estimation accuracy. The maximum R-2 of the model reached 0.848, and we mapped the forest AGB using the K-DBN model in the study area in 2015. The conclusion of this study: Based on multi-source optical and radar data, the retrieval accuracy of forest AGB can be improved by considering the FCD, and the deep learning algorithm K-DBN is excellent in forest AGB remote sensing estimation. These research results provide a new method and data support for the spatio-temporal dynamic remote sensing monitoring of forest AGB in karst areas.

TI  - Multimodal Data and Multiscale Kernel-Based Multistream CNN for Fine Classification of a Complex Surface-Mined Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine land cover classification (FLCC) of complex landscapes is a popular and challenging task in the remote sensing community. In complex surface-mined areas (CSMAs), researchers have conducted FLCC using traditional machine learning methods and deep learning algorithms. However, convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms that may be useful for FLCC of CSMAs have not been fully investigated. This study proposes a multimodal remote sensing data and multiscale kernel-based multistream CNN (3M-CNN) model. Experiments based on two ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite imageries of different times and seasons were conducted in Wuhan, China. The 3M-CNN model had three main features: (1) multimodal data-based multistream CNNs, i.e., using ZY-3 imagery-derived true color, false color, and digital elevation model data to form three CNNs; (2) multisize neighbors, i.e., using different neighbors of optical and topographic data as inputs; and (3) multiscale convolution flows revised from an inception module for optical and topographic data. Results showed that the proposed 3M-CNN model achieved excellent overall accuracies on two different images, and outperformed other comparative models. In particular, the 3M-CNN model yielded obvious better visual performances. In general, the proposed process was beneficial for the FLCC of complex landscape areas.

TI  - Superpixel-Oriented Classification of PolSAR Images Using Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network Driven by Hybrid Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully developed and used in the classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. However, they often suffer from some problems, such as time-consuming, unsatisfactory detail-preservation, and bad effectiveness given limited training samples. Focusing on these problems, we propose a complex-valued CNN (CV-CNN)-based algorithm for PolSAR image classification in this article. On the one hand, a superpixel-oriented (SPO) scheme is employed to reduce the computational cost of the algorithm and preserve image details simultaneously, which takes superpixels instead of single pixels as classification units. In particular, to meet the input requirement of CV-CNN, three alternative methods of superpixel regularization are designed and compared. On the other hand, considering that both measured data (MD) and manually designed polarimetric features (PFs) have their own advantages, the hybrid data (HD) combining them is employed to drive CV-CNN, which is helpful to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm. We perform experiments on three actual PolSAR image data sets acquired by AIRSAR and Radarsat-2 systems as well as a semisimulated data set. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to conventional pixel-oriented methods, the proposed SPO scheme is much more time-efficient and is also beneficial to detail preservation. Moreover, the CV-CNN driven by HD generally obtains consistently better classification results than that driven by pure MD or manually designed PFs.

TI  - A structure knowledge-synthetic aperture radar interferometry integration method for high-precision deformation monitoring and risk identification of sea-crossing bridges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deformation monitoring and risk identification of sea-crossing bridges are essential to mitigate hazards and prevent loss of human life and property. Satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) technology can detect millimeter-scale deformation, showing unique advantages in the safety monitoring of seacrossing bridges. However, the existing InSAR methods only extract point-like targets (PTs) based on the coherent index, but ignores the analysis of multiple SAR incoherent information and the foreground-background scattering characteristics differences of bridges, leading to low-density and low-accuracy of PTs on sea-crossing bridges. Moreover, most InSAR-based studies identified structural risks according to deformation measurements without fully considering the various safe deformation ranges of different structural components, resulting in high false-alarm/miss-detection rates in structural risk identification of sea-crossing bridges. To address these issues, a structure knowledge-InSAR integration approach is developed for high-precision deformation monitoring and reliable risk identification of sea-crossing bridges. Firstly, the SAR incoherent information and foreground-background scattering characteristics of the bridge structure are analyzed and applied to improve the density of extractable PTs and remove the incorrect noise signals. Then, the bridge structural mechanics model is combined with the InSAR time-series displacements to analyze the mechanical property degradation of different bridge components, improving the reliability of InSAR-based structural risk identification. This approach is applied to the Stonecutters Bridge and Tsing Ma Bridge using the TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed images from 2011 to 2012 and the Sentinel-1A images from 2015 to 2017. The results indicate that the densities of PTs extracted on the two bridges increased by about 40% using the new approach, and incorrect noise signals are removed. Moreover, the mechanical properties of different bridge components can be evaluated through the analysis of their structural stress and time-series displacements, helping to decrease the false-alarm/missdetection rates of InSAR-based structural risk identification. The bridge deformation is correlated with the temperature variation when the temperature difference is large (>= 10 degrees C), but no longer dominated by thermal dilation when the temperature difference is less than 10 degrees C due to the influence of environmental effects.

TI  - Can Landsat 7 preserve its science capability with a drifting orbit?
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2017, the orbit of Landsat 7 has drifted outside its nominal mission requirement toward an earlier acquisition time because of limited onboard fuel resources. This makes quantitative analyses from Landsat 7 data potentially unreliable for many scientific studies. To comprehensively understand the effect of ongoing (2018-2020) orbit drift on Landsat 7 data, we compared surface reflectance and Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance of growing season observations (July 1 & PLUSMN; 30 days) from Landsat 7 with orbit drift and Landsat 8 with nominal orbit using a total of 10,000 randomly selected Northern Hemisphere (0-750 N) terrestrial pixels. To evaluate the future (2021-2023) effect of Landsat 7's orbit drift, we analyzed the historical Northern Hemisphere terrestrial growing season Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) TOA reflectance images, which shared a similar orbit drift as Landsat 7 but occurred much earlier. Results suggest that Landsat 7's orbit drift has already led to a general decrease in surface reflectance and TOA reflectance in 2019 and 2020, with a limited impact (overall reflectance changes less than 0.007). The influence of orbit drift is more substantial for the two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands and the near infrared (NIR) band, but less for the three visible bands (i.e., Red, Green, and Blue). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from either surface reflectance or TOA reflectance, increased less than 0.003 in 2020. According to the historical EO-1 TOA reflectance data, we estimate that the effect of Landsat 7's orbit drift will be much more dramatic in the future (e.g., the NIR and SWIR bands will decrease more than 0.015 since July 1, 2021), and for different land cover types, the effects of orbit drift are also quite different. To reduce this influence, we examined the c-factor Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) normalization approach to correct the orbit drift impact for Landsat 7 surface reflectance data collected between 2019 and 2020. We found that the c-factor BRDF can reduce the data difference substantially, but how this approach works after Landsat 7's orbit drifts further still requires more investigation. Therefore, we determined that Landsat 7 can preserve its science capability until 2020, but will be less reliable for remote sensing applications that need accurate absolute radiometric values after 2020. Correction methods such as c-factor BRDF could be a potential viable approach to maintain its science capability going forward.

TI  - Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Urogenital and Extragenital <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> Isolates Among Men Who Have Sex With Men: Strengthening the US Response to Resistant Gonorrhea and Enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project, 2018 to 2019
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We investigated differences in gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility by anatomic site among cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) using specimens collected through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project and Strengthening the US Response to Resistant Gonorrhea. Methods During the period January 1, 2018-December 31, 2019, 12 enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project and 8 Strengthening the US Response to Resistant Gonorrhea sites collected urogenital, pharyngeal, and rectal isolates from cisgender MSM in sexually transmitted disease clinics. Gonococcal isolates were sent to regional laboratories for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution. To account for correlated observations, linear mixed-effects models were used to calculate geometric mean minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to calculate the proportion of isolates with elevated or resistant MICs; comparisons were made across anatomic sites. Results Participating clinics collected 3974 urethral, 1553 rectal, and 1049 pharyngeal isolates from 5456 unique cisgender MSM. There were no significant differences in the geometric mean MICs for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline by anatomic site. For cefixime and ceftriaxone, geometric mean MICs for pharyngeal isolates were higher compared with anogenital isolates (P < 0.05). The proportion of isolates with elevated ceftriaxone MICs (>= 0.125 mu g/mL) at the pharynx (0.67%) was higher than at rectal (0.13%) and urethral (0.18%) sites (P < 0.05). Conclusions Based on data collected from multijurisdictional sentinel surveillance projects, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates may differ among MSM at extragenital sites, particularly at the pharynx. Continued investigation into gonococcal susceptibility patterns by anatomic site may be an important strategy to monitor and detect the emergence of antimicrobial resistant gonorrhea over time.

TI  - The association of sex with pain scores and perioperative opioid administration following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: We investigated whether sex is associated with pain scores and opioid administration after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Materials & methods: We performed a single-center, retrospective analysis of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients from December 2016-July 2018. Multivariable linear regressions were performed to investigate the association of sex with pain scores and opioid administration. Results: Baseline pain scores were similar between women and men (n = 266; 78% women). Men reported lower pain scores in all phases of care and received more opioids during their hospitalization (B = 25.48; 95% CI: 5.77-45.20; p = 0.01), compared with women. Conclusion: Our data suggest that women self-report greater postoperative pain scores, while men received more opioids during their hospitalization. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons for such differences in postoperative pain management.Lay abstract: Men are at higher risk for long-term opioid use compared with women, but it remains unclear whether perioperative management is a sentinel event for such outcomes. Since patients who receive higher amounts of postoperative opioids are more likely to remain on long term narcotics, we investigated whether sex is associated with pain scores and opioid administration after bariatric surgery. We demonstrate that men self-report lower pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit, surgical floor and at discharge, compared with women. We also show that while men and women received comparable doses of opioids in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit, men received more opioids on the surgical floor. Our findings suggest that strategies to reduce opioid administration after bariatric surgery should largely focus on care after the immediate postoperative period.

TI  - Assessing Tree Coverage and the Direct and Mediation Effect of Tree Diversity on Carbon Storage through Stand Structure in Homegardens of Southwestern Bangladesh
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dealing with two major challenges, climate change mitigation and biodiversity loss, under the same management program, is more noteworthy than addressing these two separately. Homegardens, a sustainable agroforestry system and a home of diverse species, can be a possible choice to address these two issues. In this study, we assessed tree coverage, and the direct and indirect effects of tree diversity on carbon storage in different carbon pools through stand structure in homegardens of southwestern Bangladesh, using Sentinel 2 and field inventory data from 40 homesteads in eight villages. An unsupervised classification method was followed to assess homegardens' tree coverage. We found a high tree coverage (24.34% of total area of Dighalia) in homesteads, with a high overall accuracy of 96.52%. The biomass and soil organic carbon (p < 0.05) varied significantly among the eight villages, while total carbon stock did not vary significantly (p > 0.05). Shannon diversity had both direct and indirect effects on biomass carbon, upper layer soil organic carbon and total carbon storage, while basal area mediated the indirect effect. Both basal area and tree height had positive effects on biomass carbon and total carbon storage, with basal area having the strongest effect. These findings suggest that we must maintain higher diversity and tree height in order to maximize and sustain carbon storage, where tree diversity increases stand basal area and improves total carbon storage (including soil organic) in homegardens. Therefore, privately managed homegardens could be a potential nature-based solution for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation in Bangladesh.

TI  - Morphological changes in alluvial and coastal plains of Kandaleru river, Andhra Pradesh using RS and GIS
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological changes attributed to anthropogenic activities is one of the fundamental drivers of local, regional and global environmental changes. Studies of morphology has become vital in enhancing the understanding and monitoring of environmental changes. On this aspect, the present study details the spatiotemporal status of the alluvial and coastal plains of the Kandaleru river of Nellore district using Landsat, LISS III and Sentinel 2A satellite images for the years 1973, 1988 and 2020. The study utilized Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information System (GIS) and Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) capabilities to identify the morphological changes and their impacts. Interpretation of morphological features from temporal satellite images were carried out using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) technique of remote sensing and the impacts were studied using spatial analyst tools of ArcGIS and river bank dynamics was assessed and quantified using DSAS model. The study indicated a decrease in the spa-tial extent of both alluvial and coastal plains of the Kandaleru river during the study period. The alluvial plain decreased from 106.98 km(2) in 1973 to 64.34 km(2) in 2020 predominantly due to growth of aqua-ponds and other anthropogenic human interventions such as the growth of commercial and habitation areas. The coastal plain decreased by 13% during the study period due to the development of port and its related activities. The study revealed the regional stress of morphological features around the river which is one of the vital data to allude restrictions in such fertile landforms.

TI  - Performance auditing and neoliberal governmentality: future research directions
T2  - MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to interpret the role and professional issues of public sector performance auditing (PA) as a mechanism of neoliberal governmentality in the New Public Management (NPM) era by drawing on a Foucauldian conceptual lens to chart directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the Foucauldian concepts of visibility and identity to interpret PA against the background of neoliberal imperatives of public sector management. Findings As the growing emphasis on PA in recent decades can be understood as driven by the concurrent development of neoliberal and NPM rationalities, the relatively underexploited concepts of visibility and identity allow further inquiry into important PA issues. This paper identifies avenues for future research under the following three themes: the issue of visibility in neoliberal governmentality and potential for auditors-general to expand the domain of influence of National Audit Offices through the PA role; the potential for PA as a unified distinct specialisation; and the neoliberal idea of professional identity as the individual expert and its interplay with the potential emergence of PA as a distinct function within the accounting profession. Research limitations/implications This conceptual paper is anticipated to stimulate future PA research. Key areas in this respect include the position and authority afforded to PA and the possibility of transformation in auditors' conception of their professional worldview. Originality/value This paper charts direction for future research by interpreting PA using Foucauldian concepts of visibility and identity that remain to be exploited in PA research.

TI  - Effects of improved land-cover mapping on predicted ecosystem service outcomes in a lowland river catchment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable quantification of ecosystem service (ES) provision in agricultural landscapes depends on accurate mapping of the spatial configuration of land-use and land cover (LULC). In this paper we explore the benefits of enhanced spatial and thematic resolution in LULC mapping in terms of predicting ecosystem services and associated natural capital-based land-use policies. Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images were processed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate a LULC map at 10 m resolution, which was compared to existing datasets at 20 m, 25 m, and 100 m resolution in the River Welland catchment (Eastern England). Spatial resolution had a significant effect on the abundance and spatial configuration of land cover types. For example, detected woodland cover in the finest resolution dataset was 2x that in the coarsest data. Finer spatial resolution also allowed small, fragmented patches of woodland and grassland to be identified. ES provision (crop yield, carbon storage and pollinator abundance) was estimated from each map using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The finest resolution map resulted in 21% lower predicted wheat production (due to lower estimates of cultivated land cover), 7% higher predicted carbon stocks and 43% higher predicted wild bee abundance compared to the coarsest resolution map. The estimated monetary value of ES provision increased by 23.2% between the 10 and 100 m dataset. We recommend that a LULC resolution of at least 10 m should be employed in agricultural landscapes to accurately capture ES provision. This can be achieved using GEE and could be used as a basis for the development of future natural capital policy.

TI  - Comparison of Long Short-Term Memory Networks and Random Forest for Sentinel-1 Time Series Based Large Scale Crop Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To ensure future food security, improved agricultural management approaches are required. For many of those applications, precise knowledge of the distribution of crop types is essential. Various machine and deep learning models have been used for automated crop classification using microwave remote sensing time series. However, the application of these approaches on a large spatial and temporal scale is barely investigated. In this study, the performance of two frequently used algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF), for crop classification based on Sentinel-1 time series and meteorological data on a large spatial and temporal scale is assessed. For data from Austria, the Netherlands, and France and the years 2015-2019, scenarios with different spatial and temporal scales were defined. To quantify the complexity of these scenarios, the Fisher Discriminant measurement F1 (FDR1) was used. The results demonstrate that both classifiers achieve similar results for simple classification tasks with low FDR1 values. With increasing FDR1 values, however, LSTM networks outperform RF. This suggests that the ability of LSTM networks to learn long-term dependencies and identify the relation between radar time series and meteorological data becomes increasingly important for more complex applications. Thus, the study underlines the importance of deep learning models, including LSTM networks, for large-scale applications.

TI  - Ecological potential fractional component cover based on Long-Term satellite observations across the western United States
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands have immense inherent spatial and temporal variability, yet land condition and trends are often assessed at a limited number of spatially "representative" points. Spatially comprehensive, and quantitative, Ecological Potential (EP) data provide a baseline for comparison to current rangeland vegetation conditions and trends. Here, we define EP as potential fractional cover (bare ground, herbaceous, litter, shrub, and sagebrush) represented in the least disturbed areas and most productive years of the Landsat satellite archive (1985-present) for each 30-m pixel. We produce EP maps across rangelands in the western United States by training regression tree models using Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection (RCMAP) time-series fractional cover maps in ecologically intact sites (with limited annual herbaceous cover, no recent disturbance or vegetation treatment, and less bare ground cover than expected). As independent predictor variables in these models, we use digital soils and topography data and six bimonthly composites of the 90th percentile of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and associated spectral bands from the 1985-2020 Landsat archive. EP predictions were successful in capturing biophysical gradients present in the independent variables and depicting potential cover in the absence of disturbance; we found no influence of fires or land treatments in the data. Next, we compared EP to contemporary (2018) cover, to create departure maps that can be used as a screening tool indicating degradation and providing an early warning of vegetation state change. Finally, we used a dichotomous key to convert the 1985 and 2018 RCMAP cover and EP cover into vegetation states important to land management decisions (invaded sagebrush steppe, annual grasslands, etc.). We found that in 1985, 21.2% of the study area had a different vegetation state than EP, and this percentage increased to 24.2% by 2018. More than 50% of the EP native sagebrush steppe was converted to an annual grassland, perennial grassland, or nonsagebrush shrub by 2018, and an additional 7% was classified as invaded sagebrush steppe, at risk of transition to another state. EP products provide a spatio-temporal reference of vegetation conditions from the last three decades across rangelands in the western United States. Use of the EP reference can improve adaptive management practice by providing monitoring and control data, which are often lacking, and assist in differentiating treatment effect from confounding factors.

TI  - Twelve Principles to Guide a Long-Overdue Paradigm Shift
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SPIRITUALITY & RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - If human behaviors are associated with climate change, it relates to how we consume, entertain, travel, do business, relate to "natural resources", to ourselves and to each other. The authors posit that human behaviors are but the visible tip of the iceberg, sustained underwater by a voluminous mass comprised of our values, beliefs, assumptions, the anchors of our identity and shared paradigms. They trace back the history of a shared paradigm that has become dysfunctional and introduce the Sustainability Mindset Principles - a scaffolding to address the complexity of the paradigm. This paper describes how the dysfunctional paradigm can be brought back into balance by developing neglected aspects of a Western-Northern worldview that has been shaping our behaviors for centuries. By naming these aspects, the authors propose a language to incite the readers' imagination of what is possible. Naming creates reality.

TI  - Building Consensus for Ambitious Climate Action Through the <i>World Climate</i> Simulation
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sociopolitical values are an important driver of climate change beliefs, attitudes, and policy preferences. People with "individualist-hierarchical" values favor individual freedom, competition, and clearly defined social hierarchies, while "communitarian-egalitarians" value interdependence and equality across gender, age, heritage, and ethnicity. In the US, individualist-hierarchs generally perceive less risk from climate change and express lower support for actions to mitigate it than communitarian-egalitarians. Exposure to scientific information does little to change these views. Here, we ask if a widely used experiential simulation, World Climate, can help overcome these barriers. World Climate combines an engaging role-play with an interactive computer model of the climate system. We examine pre- and post-World Climate survey responses from 2,080 participants in the US and use a general linear mixed model approach to analyze interactions among participants' sociopolitical values and gains in climate change knowledge, affect, and intent to take action. As expected, prior to the simulation, participants holding individualist-hierarchical values had lower levels of climate change knowledge, felt less urgency, and expressed lower intent to act than those holding communitarian-egalitarian values. However, individualist-hierarchs made significantly larger gains across all constructs, particularly urgency, than communitarian-egalitarians. Participants' sociopolitical values also shifted: those with individualistic-hierarchical values before the simulation showed a substantial, statistically significant shift toward a communitarian-egalitarian worldview. Simulation-based experiences like World Climate may help reduce polarization and build consensus towards science-based climate action.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil organic carbon stocks in an arid rangeland using machine learning algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the role of machine learning (ML) models concerning environmental predictors on spatial variation of soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) in arid rangelands is very necessary. This study was conducted to explore the variability of surface SOCS in rangeland in the west of Iran using ML approaches. A number of 33 environmental predictors derived from Sentinel-2B and DEM were used. The optimal soil sampling (n = 80) position was determined by Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) method. Robust and popular random Forest (RF), cubist (CB) along with random forest-ordinary kriging (RF-OK), and cubist-ordinary kriging (CB-OK) hybrid ML models were applied to the prediction of SOCS. Ten-fold CV was implemented for modeling performance and uncertainty map. According to data analysis, the maximum, minimum, and average values of SOCS are 44.50, 10.50, and 20.50 (ton. ha(-1)) at the surface depth (0-30 cm), respectively. In general, normalized and standardized height covariates had a higher effect related to other predictors. On the other hand, two remote sensing (RS) indices, including salinity ratio (salinity) and GNDVI index, had a better impact on SOCS variability. The external validation of model performance indicated that RF-OK with (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 6.33 ton. ha(-1)) with the high and low uncertainty range (3.33-9.50 ton. ha(-1)) was the outperformed ML model in compare with other models as RF (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 7.38 ton. ha(-1)), CB-OK (R-2 = 0.56, RMSE = 9.22 ton. ha(-1)), and CB (R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 10.42 ton. ha(-1)). In general, the hybrid models improved the accuracy of RF and CB with increased 0.11 until 0.23 of R-2, and 1.05 to 1.2 (ton. ha(-1)) decreased RMSE of model's prediction. Hence, we conclude that the topographic attributes (especially normalized and standardized height) were the most critical factors in controlling surface SOCS in arid rangelands when combining with robust RF ML model, and optimized soil sampling methods like RF-cLHS can prepare acceptable soil properties maps.

TI  - Atmospheric Pollution Retrieval Using Path Radiance Derived from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing pollution and its effects on human life, its monitoring and mitigation have become a vital problem. While an air quality ground monitoring station has limited coverage, remote-sensing-based monitoring of air pollution offers the advantage of large area coverage and a synoptic view of pollution dispersion. This study demonstrates the retrieval of particulate matter 10 (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) using the multitemporal Landsat ETM+ remote sensing imagery of the study area of Vadodara, India. Atmospheric correction is generally applied on satellite images as a part of the preprocessing task in remote sensing applications. In this study, the atmospheric path radiance derived from the atmospheric correction task was experimented with for estimating the amount of PM10 and SO2 using prediction modeling. The traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) and the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling were applied on the processed remote sensing data, and the results thus obtained were assessed using independent test data. The correlation coefficient (R) for the prediction modeling of PM10 was 0.78 for the MLR and 0.72 for ANN algorithms, respectively. For the SO2 estimation, the correlation coefficient (R) was 0.77 and 0.69 for MLR and ANN models, respectively. The test data were evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), which was 36.90 and 24.54 using MLR and ANN modeling, respectively for PM10 and SO2 modeling. During the estimation modeling for SO2, the RMSE was 2.70 and 4.19 for MLR and ANN, respectively. The results confirmed the feasibility of the atmospheric-correction-based prediction modeling of PM10 and SO2. Comparison of the prediction outcomes of MLR and ANN modeling showed that ANN provides better results than the classical regression-based prediction model. Using MLP, the test data prediction error (RMSE) was reduced by 33.50% for PM10 and 34.93% for SO2 over the RMSE reported by MLR estimation.

TI  - Estimation of Byram's Fire Intensity and Rate of Spread from Spaceborne Remote Sensing Data in a Savanna Landscape
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire behavior is well described by a fire's direction, rate of spread, and its energy release rate. Fire intensity as defined by Byram (1959) is the most commonly used term describing fire behavior in the wildfire community. It is, however, difficult to observe from space. Here, we assess fire spread and fire radiative power using infrared sensors with different spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. The sensors used offer either high spatial resolution (Sentinel-2) for fire detection, but a low temporal resolution, moderate spatial resolution and daily observations (VIIRS), and high temporal resolution with low spatial resolution and fire radiative power retrievals (Meteosat SEVIRI). We extracted fire fronts from Sentinel-2 (using the shortwave infrared bands) and use the available fire products for S-NPP VIIRS and Meteosat SEVIRI. Rate of spread was analyzed by measuring the displacement of fire fronts between the mid-morning Sentinel-2 overpasses and the early afternoon VIIRS overpasses. We retrieved FRP from 15-min Meteosat SEVIRI observations and estimated total fire radiative energy release over the observed fire fronts. This was then converted to total fuel consumption, and, by making use of Sentinel-2-derived burned area, to fuel consumption per unit area. Using rate of spread and fuel consumption per unit area, Byram's fire intensity could be derived. We tested this approach on a small number of fires in a frequently burning West African savanna landscape. Comparison to field experiments in the area showed similar numbers between field observations and remote-sensing-derived estimates. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct estimate of Byram's fire intensity from spaceborne remote sensing data. Shortcomings of the presented approach, foundations of an error budget, and potential further development, also considering upcoming sensor systems, are discussed.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the approach Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis and Object-Based Image Analysis (LSMA + OBIA) and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique and Object-Based Image Analysis (ISODATA + OBIA) are evaluated, for optimizing land cover mapping in high mountain areas from Landsat-8 multispectral images. Both approaches are applied to generate in a semiautomatic and unsu-pervised way a land cover map of the Santurban-Berlin moorland, located in Colombia as a case study to carry out the evaluation. It has been found that LSMA + OBIA allows the generation of a land cover clas-sification with a maximum global reliability of 88% compared to a reliability of 79% with ISODATA + OBIA.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Detectability of the Critically Endangered <i>Araucaria angustifolia</i> Tree Using Worldview-2 Images, Google Earth Engine and UAV-LiDAR
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a global biodiversity hotspot and has been extensively mapped using satellite remote sensing. However, past mapping focused on overall forest cover without consideration of keystone plant resources such as Araucaria angustifolia. A. angustifolia is a critically endangered coniferous tree that is essential for supporting overall biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest. A. angustifolia's distribution has declined dramatically because of overexploitation and land-use changes. Accurate detection and rapid assessments of the distribution and abundance of this species are urgently needed. We compared two approaches for mapping Araucaria angustifolia across two scales (stand vs. individual tree) at three study sites in Brazil. The first approach used Worldview-2 images and Random Forest in Google Earth Engine to detect A. angustifolia at the stand level, with an accuracy of >90% across all three study sites. The second approach relied on object identification using UAV-LiDAR and successfully mapped individual trees (producer's/user's accuracy = 94%/64%) at one study site. Both approaches can be employed in tandem to map remaining stands and to determine the exact location of A. angustifolia trees. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we discuss their adoptability by managers to inform conservation of A. angustifolia.

TI  - Evaluating change detection techniques using remote sensing data: Case study New Administrative Capital Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research is to evaluate change detection techniques to monitoring land-cover changes that occurred between 2016 and 2017 in the study area located in new administrative capital region in Cairo Governorate, Egypt. The Study area is 77.350 km2. Image data is two Satellite images covering the study area, both are by Landsat_8 OLI/TIRS satellite with a low spatial resolution 30 m * 30 m. Reference data is two Satellite images covering the study area, both are by Nanosat satellite with a high spatial resolution 3 m * 3 m. The Study area was classified into roads, sand, rocks, bare soil, routes and buildings using Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Three change detection techniques namely; postclassification, independent component analysis and principal component analysis were applied. Quantitative evaluations for the results of these techniques were performed to determine the most appropriate change detection technique which will provide the highest accuracy for identifying the nature and extent of land-cover changes in New capital. The results indicated that the post classification change detection technique provided the highest accuracy while the principal component analysis technique gave the least accuracy. And the results show that the post classification change detection technique is straightforward because it is direct and its accuracy is mainly dependent upon the accuracy of the initial classifications of the two images. In the other two change detection techniques, more processing stages are required such as transformation stage (c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-area and multi-faceted remote sensing (SAR) datasets are widely used due to the increasing demand for accurate and up-to-date information on resources and the environment for regional and global monitoring. In general, the processing of RS data involves a complex multi-step processing sequence that includes several independent processing steps depending on the type of RS application. The processing of RS data for regional disaster and environmental monitoring is recognized as computationally and data demanding.Recently, by combining cloud computing and HPC technology, we propose a method to efficiently solve these problems by searching for a large-scale RS data processing system suitable for various applications. Real-time on-demand service. The ubiquitous, elastic, and high-level transparency of the cloud computing model makes it possible to run massive RS data management and data processing monitoring dynamic environments in any cloud. via the web interface. Hilbert-based data indexing methods are used to optimally query and access RS images, RS data products, and intermediate data. The core of the cloud service provides a parallel file system of large RS data and an interface for accessing RS data from time to time to improve localization of the data. It collects data and optimizes I/O performance. Our experimental analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of our method platform

TI  - Integrated Use of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and Geostatistics in Spatial Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon Content
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of spatial variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) content is important for agricultural management and environmental studies. In this study, geo-spatial prediction of SOC content was conducted to evaluate and compare geostatistical techniques of ordinary kriging (OK) and cokriging (CK) with hyperspectral satellite data (Hyperion) as an auxiliary variable. The study area located in western Uttar Pradesh, India. Hyperspectral satellite-derived spectral colour indices and spectral band reflectance used as auxiliary variables in CK. Spectral colour indices, viz. brightness index, coloration index, hue index and saturation index, were computed using atmospherically corrected Hyperion spectral bands reflectance data. Results of correlation analysis revealed that the spectral reflectance of Hyperion band 57 (1033.88 nm wavelength) has the highest correlation coefficient (r) with the SOC content (- 0.86) followed by brightness index (- 0.79), coloration index (- 0.78), hue index (- 0.77) and saturation index (- 0.66). Both spherical and exponential models best fitted the semivariograms with SOC and spectral reflectance of Hyperion band 57 and also with SOC and soil coloration index as auxiliary variables. Cross-validation results indicated that among the kriging methods, CK performed best using exponential semivariogram model and soil coloration index as auxiliary variable for spatial prediction of SOC content with highest R-2 (0.653) and lowest RMSE (0.136%) values. In general, CK methods were superior to OK in spatial prediction of SOC content. A combination of cokriging geostatistical technique and remotely sensed hyperspectral data as auxiliary variables is very useful for improved and reliable spatial prediction of SOC content.

T2  - OCHSNER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Isosulfan blue dye, or Lymphazurin, is commonly used for sentinel lymph node biopsy during operative procedures for patients with breast cancer. Allergic reactions to Lymphazurin have been reported, ranging from mild dermatologic reactions to severe anaphylaxis.Case Series: We report 2 patients who experienced allergic reaction to Lymphazurin while admitted to our service. We also conducted a literature search for similar cases using national databases. Included studies were limited to retrospective studies, case series, or case reports. Patient characteristics, reaction observed, and hospital course were extracted. Of the patients we report, both had grade 3 anaphylactic reactions requiring vasopressors to achieve hemodynamic stability. One patient required intensive care unit monitoring for 18 hours, and the other required overnight monitoring in the postanesthesia care unit. The literature revealed 29 studies reporting 108 patients with confirmed allergic reactions to Lymphazurin. Including the 2 patients in this series (total study n=110), most reactions were grade 3 (57/110, 51.8%), followed by grade 1 (40/110, 36.4%) and grade 2 (13/110, 11.8%). Among the patients who had individual hospital course reported (n=34), 23 patients required admission to the surgical intensive care unit. Of studies that reported cancellation or progression of surgery after the reaction, the surgical procedure was canceled for 12 of 26 patients (46.1%).Conclusion: Although severe anaphylactic reactions are more commonly reported, mild reactions occur more frequently but are likely underreported. Although no fatalities were reported in the cases included in this review, anaphylactic reactions to Lymphazurin pose significant risks. Operating room personnel should be familiar with potential reactions to recognize and treat them early.

TI  - Land Cover Changes after the Massive Rohingya Refugee Influx in Bangladesh: Neo-Classic Unsupervised Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rohingya refugee influx to Bangladesh in 2017 was a historical incident; the number of refugees was so massive that significant impacts to local communities was inevitable. The Bangladesh government provided land in a preserved area for constructing makeshift camps for the refugees. Previous studies have revealed the land cover changes and impacts of the refugee influx around campsites, especially with regard to local forest resources. Our aim is to establish a convenient approach of providing up-to-date information to monitor holistic local situations. We employed a classic unsupervised technique-a combination of k-means clustering and maximum likelihood estimation-with the latest rich time-series satellite images of Sentinal-1 and Sentinal-2. A combination of VV and normalized difference water index (NDWI) images was successful in identifying built-up/disturbed areas, and a combination of VH and NDWI images was successful in differentiating wetland/saltpan, agriculture /open field, degraded forest/bush, and forest areas. By doing this, we provided annual land cover classification maps for the entire Teknaf peninsula for the pre- and post-influx periods with both fair quality and without prior training data. Our analyses revealed that on-going impacts were still observed by May 2021. As a simple estimation of the intervention consequence, the built-up/disturbed areas increased 6825 ha (compared with the 2015-17 period). However, while the impacts on the original forest were not found to be significant, the degraded forest/bush areas were largely degraded by 4606 ha. These cultivated lands would be used for agricultural activities. This is in line with the reported farmers' increased income, despite local people with other occupations that are all equally facing the decreases in income. The convenience of our unsupervised classification approach would help keep accumulating a time-series land cover classification, which is important in monitoring impacts on local communities.

TI  - Single-Image Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Low Resolution Bands with Residual Dense Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellites have become one of the main resources for Earth observation images because they are free of charge, have a great spatial coverage and high temporal revisit. Sentinel-2 senses the same location providing different spatial resolutions as well as generating a multi-spectral image with 13 bands of 10, 20, and 60 m/pixel. In this work, we propose a single-image super-resolution model based on convolutional neural networks that enhances the low-resolution bands (20 m and 60 m) to reach the maximal resolution sensed (10 m) at the same time, whereas other approaches provide two independent models for each group of LR bands. Our proposed model, named Sen2-RDSR, is made up of Residual in Residual blocks that produce two final outputs at maximal resolution, one for 20 m/pixel bands and the other for 60 m/pixel bands. The training is done in two stages, first focusing on 20 m bands and then on the 60 m bands. Experimental results using six quality metrics (RMSE, SRE, SAM, PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS) show that our model has superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and it is very effective and suitable as a preliminary step for land and coastal applications, as studies involving pixel-based classification for Land-Use-Land-Cover or the generation of vegetation indices.

TI  - The Land Snail, <i>Eobania vermiculata</i>, as a Bioindicator of the Heavy Metal Pollution in the Urban Areas of Sulaimani, Iraq
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land snails are crucial consumers in the terrestrial environment and beneficial significant bioindicators to evaluate the chemical impact in the ecosystem, especially on urban lands. The present study aimed to investigate the concentration of heavy metals such as As, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn in urban soil and study whether Eobania vermiculata acts as a bioindicator for heavy metal contamination in an urban area. Thirty soil and snail samples in triplicate from each sampling site were taken from the urban areas of Suliamani. After a microwave-assisted digestion procedure, every sample was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Results showed that the concentration of chromium (Cr) in each snail sample was significantly high. The maximum Cr concentration (15.87 mg kg(-1)) was recorded in the snail sample collected from Ali Kamal Park, which was adjacent to a very crowded traffic road. The As concentration in snail samples ranged from 0.08 to 1.004 mg kg(-1), and it was below the permissible limits. However, the concentrations of heavy metals in urban soil locations were below their background measurements, except for nickel (Ni) which was above the permissible limits. The safest site in the study area was Chaviland 1, while the most contaminated site was the Ha-wary Shar Park. The snails bioaccumulated metals in their tissues in the following order, Cr > Zn > Ni, and this bioaccumulation occurred more on the main road locations, which represented potentially contaminated places due to anthropogenic activities. Moreover, there was no correlation among the heavy metals within the soil samples when compared to the similar metals in the snail samples, due to the low concentration of heavy metals in soil, excluding Ni, from where the snail samples were collected. Consequently, the land snail, E. vermiculata, is an appropriate sentinel organism for some metals, mainly for Cr, and the bioindicator monitoring with this snail should be extended to mixtures of heavy metals, since such relationships frequently occur in soil.

TI  - Assessment and Attribution of Mangrove Forest Changes in the Indian Sundarbans from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indian Sundarbans, together with Bangladesh, comprise the largest mangrove forest in the world. Reclamation of the mangroves in this region ceased in the 1930s. However, they are still subject to adverse environmental influences, such as sediment starvation due to migration of the main river channels in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta over the last few centuries, cyclone landfall, wave action from the Bay of Bengal-changing hydrology due to upstream water diversion-and the pervasive effects of relative sea-level rise. This study builds on earlier work to assess changes from 2000 to 2020 in mangrove extent, genus composition, and mangrove 'health' indicators, using various vegetation indices derived from Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery by performing maximum likelihood supervised classification. We show that about 110 km(2) of mangroves disappeared within the reserve forest due to erosion, and 81 km(2) were gained within the inhabited part of Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) through plantation and regeneration. The gains are all outside the contiguous mangroves. However, they partially compensate for the losses of the contiguous mangroves in terms of carbon. Genus composition, analyzed by amalgamating data from published literature and ground-truthing surveys, shows change towards more salt-tolerant genus accompanied by a reduction in the prevalence of freshwater-loving Heiritiera, Nypa, and Sonneratia assemblages. Health indicators, such as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), show a monotonic trend of deterioration over the last two decades, which is more pronounced in the sea-facing parts of the mangrove forests. An increase in salinity, a temperature rise, and rainfall reduction in the pre-monsoon and the post-monsoon periods appear to have led to such degradation. Collectively, these results show a decline in mangrove area and health, which poses an existential threat to the Indian Sundarbans in the long term, especially under scenarios of climate change and sea-level rise. Given its unique values, the policy process should acknowledge and address these threats.

TI  - Population and Nesting Behaviour of Weaver Ants,<i> Oecophylla</i><i> smaragdina</i> from Meghalaya, India
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Weaver ants are known for their unique nest-building skills using leaves and larval-silk as a binding agent. The weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, are present in large numbers in the Ri-Bhoi district, Meghalaya. This study is the first from this region on the nesting behavior and the population dynamics of these ants. It was noted that Oecophylla smaragdina build nests more abundantly in needlewood trees (Schima wallichi), locally known as 'diengngan'. The nests of O. smaragdina are somewhat round-oval using the leaves of different sizes ranging from 8-32 cm2, and the average nest size is about 9,483 cm3. The nearest distance of the nest from the central tree trunk of S. wallichi is about 0.7 m, and the farthest is up to 3.4 m. The nests are made at a height ranging from 4-25m. They utilize about twenty leaves with a specific number of chambers to keep their broods, the queen, and food. The number of worker ants, pupae, and larvae are variable in nests of different sizes. The study shows that the active period for foraging and nest building of O. smaragdina is at 20-25 degrees C and significantly declines with the rise in temperature at 30 degrees C and above. This finding on the presence of an enormous population and familiarity with the nesting behavior of weaver ants O. smaragdina could be useful as an alternative source of nutrition and traditional medicine for the people in this region.

TI  - Evolution of river course and morphometric features of the River Ganga: A case study of up and downstream of Farakka Barrage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - River channel shifting in the deltaic regime is an unabated occurrence. Channel shifting has become one of the concerns as it influences land use/land cover along the riverbank in various ways. For the management of the river, it is indispensable to study the pattern of river course change both in qualitative and quantitative methods. This study is an attempt to understand the pattern of shifting and to quantify erosion and deposition of the river Ganga at upstream and downstream of Farakka Barrage during 1794-2017. The study has been carried out by using various historical maps, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and remote sensing and GIS technique to understand the dynamic of the river. Over 223 years period shifting of the river accentuates the remarkable oscillation of the river. Perimeter of the river is determined to understand the area covered by the river course in the study area. To evaluate the meandering of the river sinuosity of the river has been computed in this study. The amount of erosion and deposition was calculated in this study by using ArcGIS 10.6. The study found a higher amount of erosion at the east bank where Manikchak, Kaliachak II and Kaliachak III blocks are situated between 1965 and 2017. At the west bank of the river, especially the Rajmahal block, the occurrence of deposition was remarkable during the same period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The importance of genetic counseling has been noted for hereditary breast cancer. We report the cases of two 32-year-old woman, unmarried, BRCA mutation-positive patients.CASES: In Case 1, the chief complaint was awareness of a right breast mass. There was a family history of breast cancer(3 previous cases in the family). The BRCA2 mutation was positive during the BRACAnalysis test. Right breast mastectomy and axillary dissection were performed. Genetic counseling was performed postoperatively, and her eggs were cryopreserved. In Case 2, the chief complaint was calcification of the right breast. She also had a family history of breast cancer(3 previous cases in the family). The BRCA1 mutation was positive during the BRACAnalysis test. Nipple-sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed, and the pathological diagnosis was DCIS. After genetic counseling, she did not desire the cryopreservation of her eggs.DISCUSSION: In these cases, the histological type, stage, subtype, BRCA mutation site, etc., were different from each other, and detailed support by genetic counseling was taken according to each medical condition such as surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Large Plaque-type Blue Nevus with GNAQ Q209P Mutation, Involving Mammary Gland Tissue: Under-Recognized Mammary Condition as an Origin of Primary Mammary Melanocytic Tumors
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plaque-type blue nevus is a rare variant of blue nevi that was first described in 1954. This article presents clinical, macroscopic, histopathological, and genetic findings for a case of large plaque-type blue nevus expanding into the mammary gland tissue as well as the skin of the right breast. A 63-year-old woman presented with a congenital, large, blue-colored macule limited to the hypochondriac area of the right breast. A nodule 8 mm in diameter was also present in the mammary gland tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging was unable to detect diffuse melanin deposition in the mammary gland tissue, but pigmentation in the whole mammary parenchyma was observed in the cut surfaces of the mastectomy specimen. Histopathology revealed a sparse distribution of dendritic melanocytes in whole sections of the mammary fibrous tissue and partial sections of the dermis. The histopathological criteria for atypical cellular blue nevus were fulfilled for the mammary tumor. Nodal blue nevus was diagnosed in the sentinel lymph node. Sanger sequencing confirmed the GNAQ Q209P mutation, which was also identified in all 4 literature cases of plaque-type blue nevus, but rarely in conventional blue nevi and uveal melanoma. It should be noted that plaque-type blue nevus can expand into the mammary gland tissue, even if the pigmented lesion does not exist on the overlying breast skin. The mammary condition can be the origin of primary mammary melanocytic tumors. Mosaicism of the GNAQ Q209P mutation can be a characteristic genetic alteration to extensive blue nevi, including plaque-type blue nevus.

TI  - ADAPTATION PRACTICES AND FORMS OF STRUGGLE IN JEWISH COMMUNITIES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF RELIGIOUS WORLDVIEW IN SOVIET UKRAINE (1920S - 1930S)
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the reconstruction of the ways of adaptation of the Jews to the Soviet anti-religious experiments and the definition of forms of counteraction to these attacks during the 1920s and 1930s. There is insufficient research in the historiography of the struggle of Jews for the preservation of their religious worldview. The development of historiography shows a certain imbalance in the studies of the methods and extent of antichurch policy while ignoring the reaction of believers to the Bolshevik experiments. Based on archival documents of the Soviet secret services (not previously introduced into scientific circulation) and memoirs, it is shown that the interweaving of religious norms and the daily life of the Jews contributed to the preservation of the religious worldview and was an important internal motivation to oppose anti-religious values. In the 1920s, in the absence of total control, communities boldly dared to resist, opposing the idea of a day off on Sunday, sabotaging community registration, engaging in bureaucratic red tape that accompanied community interaction with the authorities on construction, renovation, or closure of synagogues. Attempts to resist control over the religious life of believers were responded by repressive actions of authorities and could not be long-lasting and large-scale. However, even the documents of the second half of the 1920s convey such resistance. In the 1930s, the closure of synagogues forced communities to adapt to new realities. In-home prayer meetings, which contributed to the preservation of religiosity, were held clandestinely in the 1930s. The so-called "migration" of synagogues began when the authorities closed a synagogue in one place, and the believers, renting a house, opened it in another place. The counteraction of the processes of secularization was the activity of Jewish preachers- maggids, who visited synagogues and delivered speeches about the need to preserve the religious worldview. Despite continuous control, authorities were unable to stop these actions in the 1930s. The system of spiritual education has undergone significant changes. Jewish worshippers were forced to adapt their religious rites to the realities of life. Adaptation practices and forms of struggle for the preservation of Judaism contributed to the preservation of the religious identity of the Jews in Soviet Ukraine in the 1930s.

TI  - Parametric Definition of Slow Tourism Itineraries for Experiencing Seasonal Landscapes. Application of Sentinel-2 Imagery to the Rural Paddy-Rice Landscape in Northern Italy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow tourism is a growing phenomenon in Italy; it is assuming a key role in the definition of new strategies for sustainable tourism for the enhancement of landscape and cultural heritage, but also as a driver for the revitalization of marginalized and inner areas of the country. In this framework, the aesthetical phenomena related to seasonal landscape changes (e.g., autumn coloring foliage, spring blooming, controlled paddy-rice fields flooding) that occur in specific environments are emerging as new tourist destinations and are of major interest for the experiential tourism sector. This research shows a GIS-based method to draw up parametric slow tourism itineraries, which are defined according to seasonal landscape changes, by exploiting the high frequency of Sentinel-2 data acquisition. The algorithm defines parametric itineraries within the network of existing local roads by detecting the current landscape conditions through NDVI. The algorithm has been tested in the study area, within the historical agricultural landscape of paddy-rice fields in between Turin and Milan, where high scenic conditions related to the flooding occur over the spring season. This tool can support a range of end users' decisions for the creation of a widespread tourist destination offer year-round, with the aim to promote more sustainable and balanced use of the places and reduce overpressures in the most frequented places.

TI  - Monitoring Forest Health Using Hyperspectral Imagery: Does Feature Selection Improve the Performance of Machine-Learning Techniques?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed highly correlated, feature-rich datasets from hyperspectral remote sensing data using multiple statistical and machine-learning methods. The effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance was compared. In addition, the effect of multiple expert-based and data-driven feature sets, derived from the reflectance data, was investigated. Defoliation of trees (%), derived from in situ measurements from fall 2016, was modeled as a function of reflectance. Variable importance was assessed using permutation-based feature importance. Overall, the support vector machine (SVM) outperformed other algorithms, such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions by at least three percentage points. The combination of certain feature sets showed small increases in predictive performance, while no substantial differences between individual feature sets were observed. For some combinations of learners and feature sets, filter methods achieved better predictive performances than using no feature selection. Ensemble filters did not have a substantial impact on performance. The most important features were located around the red edge. Additional features in the near-infrared region (800-1000 nm) were also essential to achieve the overall best performances. Filter methods have the potential to be helpful in high-dimensional situations and are able to improve the interpretation of feature effects in fitted models, which is an essential constraint in environmental modeling studies. Nevertheless, more training data and replication in similar benchmarking studies are needed to be able to generalize the results.

TI  - Historical and Continued Colonial Impacts on Heart Health of Indigenous Peoples in Canada: What's Reconciliation Got to Do With It?
T2  - CJC OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Colonization and enforced genocidal strategies have collectively fractured and changed Indigenous people by attempting to erase and dismiss their voices and knowledge. Nearly a decade ago, we were reminded by Dr Ku Young of the cardiovascular health disparities, in evidence among Indigenous people in Canada. compared with White people. He went on to say that beyond a biomedical understanding of this health status is the ongoing impact of long-standing marginalization and oppression faced by Indigenous people. Limited attention has been afforded to advance our understanding of these colonial impacts on Indigenous people and their heart health. This article contributes to our collective understanding of Indigenous people and their cardiac health by covering the following topics: layers of foundational truths of relevance to healthcare contexts and Indigenous people; a critical reflection of Western (biomedical) perspectives concerning cardiac health among Indigenous people; and materials from 2 studies, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, in which Indigenous voices and experiences were privileged concerning the heart and caring for the heart. In the final section, 3 topics are offered as starting points for self-reflection and acts of reconciliation within healthcare practice, decision-making, and research: reflections on self and one's worldview; anti-racist healthcare practice; and 2-eyed seeing approaches to work within healthcare contexts. A common thread is the imperative for "un-silencing" Indigenous people's voices, experiences, and knowledge, which is a requirement if addressing the identified cardiovascular health disparities is truly a health priority.

T2  - BRAIN-BROAD RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Political, social, economic, and civilization changes trigger a number of issues that require the development of personal characteristics sufficient for survival and adaptation to life in a society stricken by a crisis. In general, we can talk about a neurotic personality, the signs of which manifest themselves in anxiety, the actualization of specific negative defenses, suspicion, feelings of resentment and guilt, loss of sense in life. To prevent or counteract these disrupting behaviors, one needs to seek meanings and ideas of self-actualization, to grow spiritually, acquire "psychological culture" while learning to build their life experience in the form of the worldview of reality, so-called semantic picture. of the world. The development and reinforcement of this worldview are made possible due to spiritual values, reflective thinking, conscience, intuition, achieving integrity and the highest cognitive and aesthetic human needs, which are respect and self-actualization. Such type of individual is open-minded and inquisitive, ready to push the boundaries, which is also a sign of the capability for transcendence.

TI  - DSMNN-Net: A Deep Siamese Morphological Neural Network Model for Burned Area Mapping Using Multispectral Sentinel-2 and Hyperspectral PRISMA Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are one of the most destructive natural disasters that can affect our environment, with significant effects also on wildlife. Recently, climate change and human activities have resulted in higher frequencies of wildfires throughout the world. Timely and accurate detection of the burned areas can help to make decisions for their management. Remote sensing satellite imagery can have a key role in mapping burned areas due to its wide coverage, high-resolution data collection, and low capture times. However, although many studies have reported on burned area mapping based on remote sensing imagery in recent decades, accurate burned area mapping remains a major challenge due to the complexity of the background and the diversity of the burned areas. This paper presents a novel framework for burned area mapping based on Deep Siamese Morphological Neural Network (DSMNN-Net) and heterogeneous datasets. The DSMNN-Net framework is based on change detection through proposing a pre/post-fire method that is compatible with heterogeneous remote sensing datasets. The proposed network combines multiscale convolution layers and morphological layers (erosion and dilation) to generate deep features. To evaluate the performance of the method proposed here, two case study areas in Australian forests were selected. The framework used can better detect burned areas compared to other state-of-the-art burned area mapping procedures, with a performance of >98% for overall accuracy index, and a kappa coefficient of >0.9, using multispectral Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral PRISMA image datasets. The analyses of the two datasets illustrate that the DSMNN-Net is sufficiently valid and robust for burned area mapping, and especially for complex areas.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of Different Open-Source Digital Elevation Model Through Morphometric Analysis for a Semi-arid River Basin in the Western Part of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate watershed delineation and drainage system extraction are critical aspects for the hydrological and geomorphological models. However, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are often not accessible without cost. This reason leads to assessing low-resolution open-source products that are freely accessible. Watershed morphology evaluation is very important for flood control and recovery planning and understanding basin hydrology. In this study, the Rel River Basin has been selected as the study area in northern Gujarat, India. DEM reliability is a significant element of such a study. The accuracy of DEM highly affects the accuracy of mapping the catchment area. This analysis has been therefore directed to compare various morphological watershed parameters depicted by the open-source DEMs, i.e., Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Cartosat and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). A new approach has been introduced in this study to combine four DEMs (ALOS, SRTM, Cartosat, and ASTER) by averaging the pixels to enhance the accuracy of the calculated topography known as Average DEM. This study compares various open-source DEMs and newly generated Average DEM with digitized topographic data using morphometric parameters. Percentage error is used to compute the accuracy of the open-source DEMs and the Average DEM for every morphometric parameter. While comparing the open-source DEMs and Average DEM with the Survey of India (SOI) toposheet using mean percentage error (MPE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Average DEM exhibited the least error. Hence, Average DEM has been considered more appropriate to derive the morphological characteristics for the Rel River Basin.

TI  - Anthropometric Indices of Giardia-Infected Under-Five Children Presenting with Moderate-to-Severe Diarrhea and Their Healthy Community Controls: Data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Among all intestinal parasitosis, giardiasis has been reported to be associated with delayed growth in malnourished children under 5 living in low- and middle-income countries. Relevant data on the nutritional status of children aged 0-59 months presenting with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and giardia infection were collected from sentinel health facilities of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study's (GEMS) seven field settings, placed in diverse countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia between, December 2007 and February 2011. Then, this study analyzed a robust dataset of study participants (n = 22,569). Children having giardiasis with MSD constituted as cases (n = 1786), and those without MSD constituted as controls (n = 3470). Among the seven field sites, symptomatic giardiasis was 15% and 22% in Asian and African sites, respectively, whereas asymptomatic giardia infection (healthy without MSD) in Asian and African sites was 21.7% and 30.7%, respectively. Wasting and underweight were more frequently associated and stunting less often associated with symptomatic giardiasis (for all, p < 0.001). Symptomatic giardiasis had a significant association with worsening of nutritional status in under-five children. Improved socio-economic profile along with proper sanitation and hygienic practices are imperative to enhance child nutritional status, particularly in resource limited settings.

TI  - Significance of Satellite Data on Convective Clouds for Flight Accident Analysis and Prevention
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conditions are discussed of three well-known flight accidents in which deep convection has been observed (the crash of aircraft getting into the cloud system of a mesoscale convective complex; another crash in attempt to land in an area of embedded convection at the atmospheric front; ice-crystal icing of engines in an anvil cloud). In all the cases, convective clouds were clearly seen at the satellite images. The accidents could have been possibly avoided if this information, or the nowcasting results which take into account the satellite data, had been available in time to flight controllers and pilots. The state-of-art is analyzed of deep convection forecasting basing on satellite data assimilation into numerical models. A significant advancement is noted in nowcasting and very-short-range forecasting, along with some special problems of model result verification by means of their comparison against the satellite data.

TI  - Cross-Comparison of Global Surface Albedo Operational Products-MODIS, GLASS, and CGLS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo, as an important parameter for land surface geo-biophysical and geo-biochemical processes, has been widely used in the research communities involved in surface energy balance, weather forecasting, atmospheric circulation, and land surface process models. In recent years, operational products using satellite-based surface albedo have, from time to time, been rapidly developed, contributing significantly to the estimation of energy balance at regional or global scales. The increasing number of research topics on dynamic monitoring at a decades-long scale requires a combination of albedo products generated from various sensors or programs, while the quantitative assessment of agreement or divergence among different surface albedo products still needs further understanding. In this paper, we investigated the consistency of three classical operational surface albedo products that have been frequently used by researchers globally via the official issued datasets-MODIS, GLASS (Global LAnd Surface Satellite), and CGLS (Copernicus Global Land Service). The cross-comparison was performed on all the identical dates available during 2000-2017 to represent four season-phases. We investigated the pixel-based validity of each product, consistency of global annual mean, spatial distribution and different temporal dynamics among the discussed products in white-sky (WSA) and black-sky (BSA) albedo at visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave (SW) regimes. Further, varying features along with the change of seasons was also examined. In addition, the variation in accuracy of shortwave albedo magnitude was explored using ground measurements collected by the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SUFRAD). Results show that: (1) All three products can provide valid long-term albedo for dominant land surface, while GLASS can provide additional estimation over sea surfaces, with the highest percentage of valid land surface pixels, at up to 93% in 24 October. The invalid pixels mainly existed in the 50 degrees N-60 degrees N latitude belt in December for GLASS, Central Africa in April and August for MODIS, and northern high latitudes for CGLS. (2) The global mean albedo of CGLS at the investigated bands has significantly higher values than those of MODIS and GLASS, with a relative difference of ~20% among the three products. The global mean albedo of MODIS and GLASS show a generally increasing trend from April to December, with an abrupt rise at NIR and SW of CGLS in June of 2014. Compared with SW and VIS bands, the linear temporal trend of the NIR global albedo mean in three products continues to increase, but the slope of CGLS is 10-100 times greater than that of the other two products. (3) The differences in albedo, which are higher in April, October, and December than in August, exhibit a small variation over the main global land surface regions, except for Central Eurasia, North Africa, and middle North America. The magnitude of global absolute difference among the three products usually varies within 0.02-0.06, but with the largest value occasionally exceeding 0.1. The relative difference is mainly within 10-20%, and can deviate more than 40% away from the baseline. In addition, CGLS has a greater opportunity to achieve the largest difference compared with MODIS and GLASS. (4) The comparison with ground measurements indicates that MODIS generally performs better than GLASS and CGLS at the sites discussed.This study demonstrates that apparent differences exist among the three investigated albedo products due to the ingested source data, algorithm, atmosphere correction etc., and also points at caution regarding data fusion when multiple albedo products were organized to serve the following applications.

TI  - Comparison of Field and SAR-Derived Descriptors in the Retrieval of Soil Moisture from Oil Palm Crops Using PALSAR-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic-aperture radar's (SAR's) capacity to resolve the cloud cover concerns encountered while gathering optical data has tremendous potential for soil moisture data retrieval using SAR data. It is possible to use SAR data to recover soil moisture because the backscatter coefficient is sensitive to both soil and vegetation by penetrating through the vegetation layer. This study investigated the feasibility of employing a SAR-derived radar vegetation index (RVI), the ratios of the backscatter coefficients using polarizations of HH/HV (R-HH/HV) and HV/HH (R-HH/HV) to an oil palm crops as vegetation indicators in the water cloud model (WCM) using phased-array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2). These data were compared to the manual leaf area index (LAI) and a physical soil sampling method for computing soil moisture. The field data included the LAI input parameters and, more importantly, physical soil samples from which to calculate the soil moisture. The fieldwork was carried out in Chuping District, Perlis State, Malaysia. Corresponding PALSAR-2 data were collected on three observation dates in 2019: 17 January, 16 April, and 9 July. The results showed that the WCM modeled using the LAI under HV polarization demonstrated promising accuracy, with the root mean square error recorded as 0.033 m(3)/m(3). This was comparable to the RVI and R-HH/HV under HV polarization, which had accuracies of 0.031 and 0.049 m(3)/m(3), respectively. The findings of this study suggest that SAR-based indicators, R-HH/HV and RVI using PALSAR-2, can be used to reduce field-related input in the retrieval of soil moisture data using the WCM for oil palm crop.

AB  - Ukraine is an associate member of the European Union, and in the coming years, it is expected that all the data and services already used by European Union countries will become available for Ukraine. An important program, which is the basis for building European monitoring services for smart cities, is the Copernicus program. The two most important services of this program are the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). CLMS provides important information on land use in Europe. In the context of smart cities, the most valuable tool is the Urban Atlas service, which is related to local CLMS services and provides a detailed digital city plan in vector form, which is segmented into small functional areas classified by Coordinate Information on the Environment (CORINE) nomenclature. The Urban Atlas is a geospatial layer with high resolution, built for all European cities with a population of more than 100,000. It combines high-resolution satellite data, city segmentation by blocks and functional urban areas (FUAs), important city infrastructure, etc. This product is used as a basis for city planning and obtaining analytics on the most important indicators of city development, including air quality monitoring. For Ukraine, such geospatial products are not provided under the Copernicus program. In this article, FUAs are developed for Ukrainian cities using European technology. It is important to start work on this program's implementation as early as possible so that when the first city atlas appears, Ukraine will be ready to work with it together with the European community. This requires preparing the basis for national research and training national stakeholders and consumers to use this product. To make this happen, it is necessary to have a national geospatial product that can be used as an analogue of the city atlas. In this article, the authors analyzed the existing methods of air quality assessment and the Global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.6.2, "Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)", achieved for European cities. Based on this, indicator 11.6.2 was then evaluated for the first time in Ukraine, considering the next 5 years. For the correct use of global products for Ukraine, CAMS global satellite data and population data (Global Human Settlement Layer and NASA population data) for Ukrainian cities were validated. These studies showed a statistically significant result and, therefore, demonstrated that global products can be used to monitor air quality both at the city level and for Ukraine as a whole. The obtained results were analyzed, and the values of indicator 11.6.2 for Ukraine were compared with those for other European countries.

TI  - Changes in the Distribution Pattern of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Pollution over Central China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of PM2.5 pollution has reduced in traditional polluted regions such as the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Sichuan Basin (SB), and Pearl River Delta (PRD) over China in recent years. Despite this, the Twain-Hu Basin (THB), which covers the lower flatlands in Hubei and Hunan provinces in central China, was found to be a high PM2.5 pollution region, with annual mean PM2.5 concentrations of 41-63 mu g center dot m(-3), which is larger than the values in YRD, SB, and PRD during 2014-2019, and high aerosol optical depth values (>0.8) averaged over 2000-2019 from the MODIS products. Heavy pollution events (HPEs) are frequently observed in the THB, with HPE-averaged concentrations of PM2.5 reaching up to 183-191 mu g center dot m(-3), which exceeds their counterparts in YRD, SB, and PRD for 2014-2019, highlighting the THB as a center of heavy PM2.5 pollution in central China. During 2014-2019, approximately 65.2% of the total regional HPEs over the THB were triggered by the regional transport of PM2.5 over Central and Eastern China (CEC). This occurred in view of the co-existing HPEs in the NCP and the THB, with a lag of almost two days in the THB-PM2.5 peak, which is governed by the strong northerlies of the East Asian monsoon (EAM) over CEC. Such PM2.5 transport from upstream source regions in CEC contributes 60.3% of the surface PM2.5 pollution over the THB receptor region. Hence, a key PM2.5 receptor of the THB in regional pollutant transport alters the distribution patterns of PM2.5 pollution over China, which is attributable to the climate change of EAMs. This study indicates a complex relationship between sources and receptors of atmospheric aerosols for air quality applications.

TI  - Development of an Algorithm to Retrieve Aerosol Optical Properties Over Water Using an Artificial Neural Network Radiative Transfer Scheme: First Result From GOSAT-2/CAI-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we developed a fast yet flexible remote sensing algorithm to estimate the aerosol optical properties over water for the Cloud and Aerosol Imager-2 (CAI-2) onboard the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite-2 (GOSAT-2) launched in October 2018. The CAI-2 is the successor of GOSAT/CAI by providing more spectral and finer spatial data. The algorithm uses the optimal estimation approach to simultaneously retrieve aerosol and water substances (SIRAW), combined with an artificial neural network (ANN) solver to perform the radiative transfer (RT) calculation. The ANN was well constructed based on an improved learning scheme and educated from a coupled atmosphere-ocean vector RT model over both open and coastal water. To investigate the availability of SIRAW, the retrieval was conducted using the real CAI-2 data and preliminarily validated via the ground-based observation of aerosol robotic network and maritime aerosol network over different ocean regions from March to November in 2019. Results demonstrated that the retrieved aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 550 nm from CAI-2 had a good consistency to the in situ measurement, of which about 70.37% of CAI-2 AOT fell within a +/-(0.05 + 10%) envelope. The algorithm developed by this study performed generally well for the AOTs and oceanic suspended particles over the global ocean through the intercomparison to those of MODIS products. Moreover, the ultraviolet channel of CAI2, which produces the first application with 500-m spatial resolution, shows a promising skill in the monitoring of the smoke plume.

TI  - A Satellite Data Based Detailed Study of the Aerosol Emitted from Open Biomass Burning in Northeast China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its unique natural conditions and agricultural tradition, northeast China (NEC) has formed a distinctive open biomass burning habit with local-specific biomass burning aerosol features. In this research, with the help of a newly optimized biomass burning aerosol identification method, which combines satellite aerosol and fire observational products with the HYSPLIT model forward trajectories, a systematic and quantitative analysis of aerosol emitted from open biomass burning in the NEC region are conducted to determine in detail its local-specific features, such as influence region, aging characteristics, and seasonal variation. During the 72-h aging process after biomass burning emission, aerosol particle size growth found with the Angstrom exponent declines from 1.6 to 1.54. Additionally, the volume fraction of black carbon decreases from 4.5% to 3.1%, leading to the Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) increasing from the fresh state of 0.84 to the aged state of 0.89. The cooling effect at TOA, due to the existence of aerosol, is enhanced by more than 70%, indicating its severe and dynamic influence on climate change. The average AOD in spring is 0.63, which is higher than autumn's value of 0.52, indicating that biomass burning is more intensive in spring. Compared to autumn, aerosols emitted from spring biomass burning in the NEC region have lower sphere fraction, smaller particle size, higher volume fraction of black carbon, higher absorbability, and weaker cooling effect at TOA, which can be partly explained by the drier ambient environment and lower water content of the burned crop straw in spring.

TI  - Improving Estimation of Woody Aboveground Biomass of Sparse Mixed Forest over Dryland Ecosystem by Combining Landsat-8, GaoFen-2, and UAV Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse mixed forest with trees, shrubs, and green herbaceous vegetation is a typical landscape in the afforestation areas in northwestern China. It is a great challenge to accurately estimate the woody aboveground biomass (AGB) of a sparse mixed forest with heterogeneous woody vegetation types and background types. In this study, a novel woody AGB estimation methodology (VI-AGB model stratified based on herbaceous vegetation coverage) using a combination of Landsat-8, GaoFen-2, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images was developed. The results show the following: (1) the woody and herbaceous canopy can be accurately identified using the object-based support vector machine (SVM) classification method based on UAV red-green-blue (RGB) images, with an average overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 93.44% and 0.91, respectively; (2) compared with the estimation uncertainties of the woody coverage-AGB models without considering the woody vegetation types (RMSE = 14.98 t center dot ha(-1) and rRMSE = 96.31%), the woody coverage-AGB models stratified based on five woody species (RMSE = 5.82 t center dot ha(-1) and rRMSE = 37.46%) were 61.1% lower; (3) of the six VIs used in this study, the near-infrared reflectance of pure vegetation (NIRv)-AGB model performed best (RMSE = 7.91 t center dot ha(-1) and rRMSE = 50.89%), but its performance was still seriously affected by the heterogeneity of the green herbaceous coverage. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI)-AGB model was the least sensitive to the background. The stratification-based VI-AGB models considering the herbaceous vegetation coverage derived from GaoFen-2 and UAV images can significantly improve the accuracy of the woody AGB estimated using only Landsat VIs, with the RMSE and rRMSE of 6.6 t center dot ha(-1) and 42.43% for the stratification-based NIRv-AGB models. High spatial resolution information derived from UAV and satellite images has a great potential for improving the woody AGB estimated using only Landsat images in sparsely vegetated areas. This study presents a practical method of estimating woody AGB in sparse mixed forest in dryland areas.

TI  - Vegetation mapping and its spatial accuracy based on drone multispectral images of secondary vegetation in southwestern Japan
T2  - Hikobia
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the type and coverage of vegetation using remote sensing data is important for ecological management and research. In this study, we used drone multispectral imagery to produce a fine-scale vegetation map of secondary vegetation within part of the campus of Hiroshima University, Japan. We examined the spatial accuracy of the vegetation map through comparison with ground-based survey data in which the vegetation was classified into six physiognomic units: secondary grassland, bamboo, and woodland dominated by broadleaved deciduous, broadleaved evergreen, pine, and coniferous trees. The drone images were acquired in June, September, October, and November 2020. We analyzed the improvement in vegetation classification accuracy achieved using a composite seasonal image instead of the single season images. We also analyzed the improvement regarding the spatial accuracy of vegetation mapping obtained using various vegetation indices instead of the raw multispectral images. The overall accuracy of the seasonal composite data was 90 %, i.e., significantly higher than that of the single season images (70 %; two-way ANOVA, p < 0.01). In contrast, none of the vegetation indices produced significant improvement in terms of spatial accuracy for any of the vegetation units (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.01). The findings of the present study revealed that the advantage of capturing phenological change in multiseasonal drone data is essential for accurate vegetation mapping.

TI  - The Relationship between the Seasonal Dynamics of Surface Temperature and NDVI in Urbanized Areas of an Arid Zone. The Case of the Volgograd Agglomeration
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperatures and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were determined throughout the Volgograd agglomeration using data of MODIS products. Landscape zoning of the agglomeration was performed on the basis of Sentinel-2 images: five land categories differing in the ratio between sealed surfaces, green spaces, and reservoirs (including those within the boundaries of administrative and territorial units) have been distinguished. A map showing the spatial distribution of landscape zones within the Volgograd agglomeration was produced, and areas occupied by each land category were determined. Correlation coefficients have been computed for relationships between daytime, nighttime, and daily mean temperatures, on the one hand, and NDVI values, on the other hand, and their seasonal variations were identified. Specific features of relationships between the NDVI and surface temperature were established for various land categories and individual municipalities. Analysis shows that the weakest relationships between the surface temperature and NDVI are observed in municipalities with the predomination of nonirrigated arable lands and wastelands, while the strongest relationships are found in the greenest areas. It is established that, in areas with a predominance of buildings, the urban-heat-island effect is manifested at nighttime regardless of the state of vegetation cover. In areas with a predominance of green spaces, the relationship between the NDVI and surface temperature is virtually not expressed, with a cooling effect of vegetation being registered only in summer.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Ocean Eddy Detection and Identification by L-Band Compact Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic detection and analysis of ocean eddies has become a popular research topic in physical oceanography during the last few decades. Compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (CP SAR), an emerging polarimetric SAR system, can simultaneously acquire richer polarization information of the target and achieve large bandwidth observations. It has inherent advantages in ocean observation and is bound to become an ideal data source for ocean eddy observation and research. In this study, we simulated the CP data with L-band ALOS PALSAR fully polarimetric data. We assessed the detection and classification potential of ocean eddies from CP SAR by analyzing 50 CP features for 2 types of ocean eddies ( "black "and "white ") based on the Euclidean distance and further carried out eddy detection and eddy information extraction experiments. The results showed that among the 50 CP features, the dihedral component power (Pd), shannon entropy (SEI), double bounce (Dbl), Stokes parameters (g0 and g3), eigenvalue (l1), lambda, RVoG parameter (ms), shannon entropy (SE), surface scattering component (Ps), and sigma HH all performed better for detecting "white " eddies. Moreover, the H-A combination parameter (1mHA), entropy, shannon entropy (SEP, SEI, and SE), probability (p2), polarization degree (m), anisotropy, probability (p1), double bounce (Dbl), H-A combination parameter (H1mA), circular polarization ratio (CPR), and sigma VV were better CP features for detecting "black " eddies.

AB  - This paper highlights studies of the possibilities of using radar data from the Sentinel-1 to address forest-inventory targets. Experiments were conducted in pine woods in the Altai pine-forest territory. Growing stock, density, height, and radar-survey parameter interactions were identified on the basis of the experiment findings. According to the found interrelationships of radar survey indicators with the growing stock and density of stands in the winter period, the zoning of the territory of the study area was carried out. Taking into account the stability of the radar data in the winter period, the research results may make it possible to create automated services for determining the growing stock and density of stands with a predominance of pine for forest conditions that are similar to the research area.

TI  - Robustness of SAR Sea Ice Type Classification Across Incidence Angles and Seasons at L-Band
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry has become a valuable tool for sea ice type retrieval. L-band SAR has proven to be sensitive toward deformed sea ice and is complementary compared with operationally used C-band SAR for sea ice type classification during the early and advanced melt seasons. Here, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN)-based sea ice type classification algorithm on a comprehensive data set of ALOS-2 PALSAR2 fully polarimetric images acquired with a range of incidence angles and during different environmental conditions. The variability within the data set means that it is ideal for making a novel assessment of the robustness of the sea ice classification, investigating the intraclass variability, the seasonal variations, and the incidence angle effect on the sea ice classification results. The images coincide with two different Arctic campaigns in 2015: the Norwegian Young Sea Ice Cruise 2015 (N-ICE2015) and the Polarstern's (PS92) Transitions in the Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone (TRANSSIZ). We find that it is essential to take into account seasonality and intraclass variability when establishing training data for machine learning-based algorithms though moderate differences in incidence angle are possible to accommodate by the classifier during the dry and cold winter season. We also conclude that the incidence angle dependence of backscatter for a given ice type is consistent for different Arctic regions.

TI  - Mapping Flood Extent and Frequency from Sentinel-1 Imagery during the Extremely Warm Winter of 2020 in Boreal Floodplains and Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study presents a methodology for water mapping from Sentinel-1 (S1) data and a flood extent analysis of the three largest floodplains in Estonia. The automatic processing scheme of S1 data was set up for the mapping of open-water flooding (OWF) and flooding under vegetation (FUV). The extremely mild winter of 2019/2020 resulted in several large floods at floodplains that were detected from S1 imagery with a maximal OWF extent up to 5000 ha and maximal FUV extent up to 4500 ha. A significant correlation (r(2) > 0.6) between the OWF extent and the closest gauge data was obtained for inland riverbank floodplains. The outcome enabled us to define the water level at which the water exceeds the shoreline and flooding starts. However, for a coastal river delta floodplain, a lower correlation (r(2) < 0.34) with gauge data was obtained, and the excess of river coastline could not be related to a certain water level. At inland riverbank floodplains, the extent of FUV was three times larger compared to that of OWF. The correlation between the water level and FUV was <0.51, indicating that the river water level at these test sites can be used as a proxy for forest floods. Relating conventional gauge data to S1 time series data contributes to flood risk mitigation.

TI  - Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Are Toxic for the Freshwater Mussel <i>Unio ravoisieri</i>: Evidence from a Multimarker Approach
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The current work investigated the ecotoxicological effects induced by Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs), used at three different concentrations (C1 = 10 mu g center dot L-1, C2 = 100 mu g center dot L-1 and C3 = 1000 mu g center dot L-1) in a laboratory experiment, on the freshwater mussel Unio ravoisieri. Biochemical analyses of gills and digestive glands revealed a stress-related disruption of the antioxidant system. The catalase activity and the rates of malonedialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide production were significantly higher in both organs following the exposure to TiO2 NPs and was concentration-dependent. In addition, based on the observed changes in acetylcholinesterase activity, it can be concluded that the disturbance threshold for the cholinergic system was less than 1 mg center dot L-1 of TiO2. Overall, the results suggest that the mussel Unio ravoisieri could be used as a sentinel species in monitoring surveys assessing the environmental impact of metallic nanoparticles in freshwater systems.

TI  - Ethics and ego dissolution: the case of psilocybin
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the fact that psychedelics were proscribed from medical research half a century ago, recent, early-phase trials on psychedelics have suggested that they bring novel benefits to patients in the treatment of several mental and substance use disorders. When beneficial, the psychedelic experience is characterized by features unlike those of other psychiatric and medical treatments. These include senses of losing self-importance, ineffable knowledge, feelings of unity and connection with others and encountering 'deep' reality or God. In addition to symptom relief, psychedelic experiences often lead to significant changes in a patient's personality and worldview. Focusing on the case of psilocybin, we argue that the peculiar features of psychedelics pose certain novel risks, which warrant an enhanced informed consent process-one that is more comprehensive than what may be typical for other psychiatric medications. We highlight key issues that should be focused on during the consent process and suggest discussion prompts for enhanced consent in psychedelic psychiatry. Finally, we respond to potential objections before concluding with a discussion of ethical considerations that will arise as psychedelics proceed from highly controlled research environments into mainstream clinical psychiatry.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Time Series Analysis for Identification of Underutilized Land in Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass and bioenergy play a central role in Europe's Green Transition. Currently, biomass is representing half of the renewable energy sources used. While the role of renewables in the energy mix is undisputed, there have been many controversial discussions on the use of biomass for energy due to the "food versus fuel" debate. Using previously underutilized lands for bioenergy is one possibility to prevent this discussion. This study supports the attempts to increase biomass for bioenergy through the provision of improved methods to identify underutilized lands in Europe. We employ advanced analysis methods based on time series modelling using Sentinel-2 (S2) data from 2017 to 2019 in order to distinguish utilized from underutilized land in twelve study areas in different bio-geographical regions (BGR) across Europe. The calculated parameters of the computed model function combined with temporal statistics were used to train a random forest classifier (RF). The achieved overall accuracies (OA) per study area vary between 80.25 and 96.76%, with confidence intervals (CI) ranging between 1.77% and 6.28% at a 95% confidence level. All in all, nearly 500,000 ha of underutilized land potentially available for agricultural bioenergy production were identified in this study, with the greatest amount mapped in Eastern Europe.

TI  - Reproduction of the Marine Debris Distribution in the Seto Inland Sea Immediately after the July 2018 Heavy Rains in Western Japan Using Multidate Landsat-8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal environment of the ocean after a heavy rain disaster is critical for satellite remote sensing research and disaster prevention. We attempted to reproduce changes in marine debris distributions using multidate data of Landsat-8 spectral reflectance acquired immediately after a heavy rain disaster in western Japan in July 2018. Data from cleaning ships were used for screening the marine debris area. As most of the target marine debris consisted of plant fragments, a method based on the corrected floating algae index (cFAI) was applied to Landsat-8 data. Data from cleaning ships clarify that most of the marine debris accumulated in the waters in the northern part of Aki Nada, a part of the Seto Inland Sea. The spectral characteristics of the corresponding marine debris spectral reflectance obtained from the Landsat-8 data were explained by the FAI with band 5 (central wavelength: 865 nm) as the maximum value. Unlike traditional FAI, cFAI eliminated the effect of background water turbidity. The Otsu method was effective for the automatic threshold determination for cFAI. Although Landsat-8 data have limited spatial resolution and observation frequency, these data were useful for understanding marine debris distribution after a heavy rain disaster.

TI  - Land Cover Dynamics on the Lower Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta: Agriculture-Aquaculture Transitions, 1972-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture in tropical and subtropical developing countries has expanded in recent years. This practice is controversial due to its potential for serious economic, food security, and environmental impacts-especially for intensive operations in and near mangrove ecosystems, where many shrimp species spawn. While considerable effort has been directed toward understanding aquaculture impacts, maps of spatial extent and multi-decade spatiotemporal dynamics remain sparse. This is in part because aquaculture ponds (ghers) can be challenging to distinguish from other shallow water targets on the basis of water-leaving radiance alone. Here, we focus on the Lower Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD), one of the most expansive areas of recent aquaculture growth on Earth and adjacent to the Sundarbans mangrove forest, a biodiversity hotspot. We use a combination of MODIS 16-day EVI composites and 45 years (1972-2017) of Landsat observations to characterize dominant spatiotemporal patterns in the vegetation phenology of the area, identify consistent seasonal optical differences between flooded ghers and other land uses, and quantify the multi-decade expansion of standing water bodies. Considerable non-uniqueness exists in the spectral signature of ghers on the GBD, propagating into uncertainty in estimates of spatial extent. We implement three progressive decision boundaries to explicitly quantify this uncertainty and provide liberal, moderate, and conservative estimates of flooded gher extent on three different spatial scales. Using multiple extents and multiple thresholds, we quantify the size distribution of contiguous regions of flooded gher extent at ten-year intervals. The moderate threshold shows standing water area within Bangladeshi polders to have expanded from less than 300 km(2) in 1990 to over 1400 km(2) in 2015. At all three scales investigated, the size distribution of standing water bodies is increasingly dominated by larger, more interconnected networks of flooded areas associated with aquaculture. Much of this expansion has occurred in immediate proximity to the Bangladeshi Sundarbans.

TI  - On a Data-Driven Approach for Detecting Disturbance in the Brazilian Savannas Using Time Series of Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of disturbance in the savannas from Brazil is challenging, especially due to confounding effects of the vegetation phenology and natural soil exposure on the detection of clearing and fire events. In this study, we investigated the detection of disturbance over this global hotspot of biodiversity using seven vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from the Landsat time series (2017-2019) and the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. The selected VIs represented distinct biophysical characteristics of the savannas. We evaluated the effects of disturbance on these VIs and assessed the accuracy of CCDC-detection in 2019, considering individual VIs, ensemble VIs, and the type of disturbance (savanna clearing and fire). Finally, we analyzed the possible existence of seasonal patterns of disturbance in a study area located at the new agricultural frontier of the Cerrado biome. The results showed that the overall accuracy of CCDC detection of total disturbance ranged from 51.2% for the Green-Red Normalized Difference (GRND) to 65.9% for the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2). It increased to 71.2% for ensemble VIs, whose multivariate approach reduced the omission errors in the analysis when compared to the use of single VIs. For detecting events of savanna clearing and fire, the most important VIs used near-infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance bands on their formulations (NBR2, NBR, and Moisture Stress Index-MSI). The CCDC accuracy was generally higher for detecting clearing than for mapping burned areas. In contrast, the recorded date of disturbance occurrence was less precise for detecting clearing than for recording events caused by fire, especially due to the existence of some gradual processes of vegetation degradation until complete clearing. Our findings showed also the existence of a seasonal pattern of disturbance occurrence. Savanna clearing predominated in the transition from the rainy to the dry season (April to July) to open new areas for agriculture. It preceded most events of fire disturbance between August and October that occurred near the consolidated areas of agriculture and extended into the native vegetation areas. Results reinforce the importance of data-driven approaches for generating early warning alerts of disturbance in the Cerrado to be further checked in the field.

M3  - Article
AB  - To understand a religious tradition, it is very important to know the socio-cultural accumulation of the community, which has that religious tradition, such as folklore, mythology, literature, and art. This is because ethnological data are used to understand and interpret the actions, mutual relations, belief systems, religious societies and institutions, rituals and customs of religious people or people with a religious tradition. In the light of these data, literary works that mirror the society in particular reflect the human understanding and worldview of their civilizations in a sense by revealing the quality of their relations with their individuals, society, culture and Creator. In this study, it is aimed to make a historical phenomenological comparison of two different worlds, namely the worldviews and cultures hidden behind these two literary texts by evaluating the perspectives of eastern and western cultures on human, society and socio-cultural life, which are revealed within the framework of Hayy and Robinson models.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface melting on Amery Ice Shelf (AIS), East Antarctica, produces an extensive supraglacial drainage system consisting of hundreds of lakes connected by surface channels. This drainage system forms most summers on the southern portion of AIS, transporting meltwater large distances northward, toward the ice front and terminating in lakes. Here we use satellite imagery, Landsat (1, 4 and 8), MODIS multispectral and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar to examine the seasonal and interannual evolution of the drainage system over nearly five decades (1972-2019). We estimate seasonal meltwater input to one lake by integrating output from the regional climate model [Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO 2.3p2)] over its catchment defined using the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica. We find only weak positive relationships between modeled seasonal meltwater input and lake area and between meltwater input and lake volume. Consecutive years of extensive melting lead to year-on-year expansion of the drainage system, potentially through a link between melt production, refreezing in firn and the maximum extent of the lakes at the downstream termini of drainage. These mechanisms are important when evaluating the potential of drainage systems to grow in response to increased melting, delivering meltwater to areas of ice shelves vulnerable to hydrofracture.

TI  - Forest Structural Estimates Derived Using a Practical, Open-Source Lidar-Processing Workflow
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lidar data is increasingly available over large spatial extents and can also be combined with satellite imagery to provide detailed vegetation structural metrics. To fully realize the benefits of lidar data, practical and scalable processing workflows are needed. In this study, we used the lidR R software package, a custom forest metrics function in R, and a distributed cloud computing environment to process 11 TB of airborne lidar data covering ~22,900 km(2) into 28 height, cover, and density metrics. We combined these lidar outputs with field plot data to model basal area, trees per acre, and quadratic mean diameter. We compared lidar-only models with models informed by spectral imagery only, and lidar and spectral imagery together. We found that lidar models outperformed spectral imagery models for all three metrics, and combination models performed slightly better than lidar models in two of the three metrics. One lidar variable, the relative density of low midstory canopy, was selected in all lidar and combination models, demonstrating the importance of midstory forest structure in the study area. In general, this open-source lidar-processing workflow provides a practical, scalable option for estimating structure over large, forested landscapes. The methodology and systems used for this study offered us the capability to process large quantities of lidar data into useful forest structure metrics in compressed timeframes.

TI  - Trends in HIV prevalence by self-report among MSM diagnosed and reported with gonorrhea in six United States jurisdictions from 2010 to 2019
T2  - AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: HIV co-infection among persons diagnosed with gonorrhea is not well characterized. Trends in HIV prevalence among persons diagnosed with gonorrhea may have significant implications for HIV prevention interventions, especially for MSM. MSM are increasingly and disproportionately represented among incident gonorrhea cases reported in a multistate sentinel surveillance network. Using data from this network, we estimated HIV prevalence among MSM by self-report and explored trends in co-infection by key demographics. Design: Observational study using enhanced surveillance data. Methods: Six geographically diverse jurisdictions in the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) 2010-2019 randomly sampled laboratory-confirmed gonorrhea cases. Enhanced investigations on sampled cases included patient interviews eliciting demographic, behavioral and HIV testing history. These data were weighted to adjust for study design and nonresponse to estimate trends in HIV prevalence. Results: Of 653 522 reported cases, 28 979 were sampled and investigated. The proportion of cases reporting living with diagnosed HIV at the time of their gonorrhea diagnosis increased 61% across the study period from 6.6% in 2010 to 10.8% in 2019. The observed increase in HIV prevalence is concurrent with an increase in the proportion of gonorrhea cases attributable to MSM. HIV prevalence among MSM decreased in two jurisdictions and increasing trends were observed among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic MSM. HIV prevalence decreased among non-Hispanic white MSM, MSM under 20 and those 40 years of age or older. Conclusion: Diagnosis with gonorrhea, especially among MSM, should be a sentinel event triggering screening for HIV, referral to high-impact HIV prevention interventions or to HIV primary care.

TI  - Application of Sentinel 2 Satellite Imagery for Sustainable Groundwater Management in Agricultural Areas-Chtouka Aquifer, Morocco
T2  - QUATERNARY
M3  - Article
AB  - In semi-arid regions that are characterized by large agricultural activities, a high volume of water is needed to cover the water requirements for agricultural production. Due to low precipitation and the associated limited availability of surface water, aquifers often represent the main source of irrigation water in these regions. Especially in coastal aquifers, high groundwater abstraction rates may change the flow dynamics of the aquifer and may lead to saltwater intrusion. In this study, within the framework of German-Moroccan international cooperation, the agricultural areas for the summer period 2019 of the Chtouka coastal aquifer in southern Morocco are classified using optical and multi-spectral Sentinel 2 data. Based on the developed land use maps, the groundwater abstraction for irrigation is then quantified by referring to local farmers' irrigation practices. Following this approach, the total amount of groundwater abstraction is estimated at 157 million m(3) for the summer period 2019 in the Chtouka aquifer.

TI  - Comprehensive comparison of airborne and spaceborne SAR and LiDAR estimates of forest structure in the tallest mangrove forest on earth
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent suite of new global-scale satellite sensors and regional-scale airborne campaigns are providing a wealth of remote sensing data capable of dramatically advancing our current understanding of the spatial distribution of forest structure and carbon stocks. However, a baseline for forest stature and biomass estimates has yet to be established for the wide array of available remote sensing products. At present, it remains unclear how the estimates from these sensors compare to one another in terrestrial forests, with a clear dearth of studies in high carbon density mangrove ecosystems. In the tallest mangrove forest on Earth (Pongara National Park, Gabon), we leverage the data collected during the AfriSAR campaign to evaluate 17 state-of-the-art sensor data products across the full range of height and biomass known to exist globally in mangrove forest ecosystems, providing a much-needed baseline for sensor performance. Our major findings are: (Houghton, Hall, Goetz) height estimates are not consistent across products, with opposing trends in relative and absolute errors, highlighting the need for an adaptive approach to constraining height estimates (Panet al., 2011); radar height estimates had the lowest calibration error and bias, with further improvements using LiDAR fusion (Bonan, 2008); biomass variability and uncertainty strongly depends on forest stature, with variation across products increasing with canopy height, while relative biomass variation was highest in low-stature stands (Le Que & PRIME;re & PRIME;et al., 2017); a remote sensing product's sensitivity to variations in canopy structure is more important than the absolute accuracy of height estimates (Mitchardet al., 2014); locally-calibrated area-wide totals are more representative than generalized global biomass models for high-precision biomass estimates. The findings presented here provide critical baseline expectations for height and biomass predictions across the full range of mangrove forest stature, which can be directly applied to current (TanDEM-X, GEDI, ICESat-2) and future (NISAR, BIOMASS) global-scale forest monitoring missions.

AB  - The joint use of satellite and ground-based data for monitoring the major grain crops during the autumn and spring-summer vegetation periods is considered. The developed method for quantifying winter grain crop conditions at the end of the autumn vegetation (the area of winter crops in poor condition) is described. Satellite data are used to calculate average long-term dynamics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the major grain crops in the spring-summer period. Taking into account meteorological observations, this allows assessing crop conditions as compared with those in the previous year or with the multiyear mean, in particular, in the years with droughts. Based on the revealed relationships of the NDVI with the crop yield in the regions of the European part of Russia, the periods of the most effective agrometeorological forecasting of the yield are found for the major grain crops. The developed methods for forecasting the yield of winter and all grain crops in the main grain-growing regions of the Russian Federation are presented.

TI  - The Austrian Semantic EO Data Cube Infrastructure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Big optical Earth observation (EO) data analytics usually start from numerical, sub-symbolic reflectance values that lack inherent semantic information (meaning) and require interpretation. However, interpretation is an ill-posed problem that is difficult for many users to solve. Our semantic EO data cube architecture aims to implement computer vision in EO data cubes as an explainable artificial intelligence approach. Automatic semantic enrichment provides semi-symbolic spectral categories for all observations as an initial interpretation of color information. Users graphically create knowledge-based semantic models in a convergence-of-evidence approach, where color information is modelled a-priori as one property of semantic concepts, such as land cover entities. This differs from other approaches that do not use a-priori knowledge and assume a direct 1:1 relationship between reflectance values and land cover. The semantic models are explainable, transferable, reusable, and users can share them in a knowledgebase. We provide insights into our web-based architecture, called Sen2Cube.at, including semantic enrichment, data models, knowledge engineering, semantic querying, and the graphical user interface. Our implemented prototype uses all Sentinel-2 MSI images covering Austria; however, the approach is transferable to other geographical regions and sensors. We demonstrate that explainable, knowledge-based big EO data analysis is possible via graphical semantic querying in EO data cubes.

AB  - This article explores the interconnections between mobility and identity as portrayed in Kiran Desai's The Inheritance of Loss (2006). In the past, mobility, especially forced or diasporic, was perceived as enveloping the migrant's identity with a sense of alienation and nostalgia. In the present, however, it is often viewed as facilitating flexibility and a pluralistic worldview entailing intermingled cultures. While examining the interrelation between mobility and identity, this article evaluates the way in which Desai portrays conflicts and tension between two worlds, inhabited by legal natives and illegal migrants, as well as illegal natives and legal migrants.

TI  - The City and the Intellectual Class: Socio-Political Interconditionality in North Kazakhstani Region on the cusp of the XIX - XX c
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - City and urban environment as a multifunctional space play an important role in creation of social processes. Since it's formation the city has become the focal point for innovations and a place where ideas are generated that change not only the landscape, but also the worldview in general. Kazakhstani cities at the turn of XIX-XX centuries during a long time has played a role of administrative and trade units. Integration of marginal cities into the system of socio-economical relations of empire brought to a formation of conditions where citizens become active not only in economic, but also in social aspect. Political segment of the city developed in the context of all-Russian situation. Systematic crisis of the XIX-XX c. required new formats of fighting for their rights. National intellectual class became one of the main subjects of urban environment and develops their own style of struggle which was expressed through cultural enlightenment and political activity.Complex study of the city environment through the historical lens allows to gasp the nature of changes occurring with the society and the state and identify possible scenarios of their interaction and development perspectives. The article made an attempt to throw light interconditionality of cityscape and intellectual class in the context of local processes. These processes are related to the formation of political space in the colonial city and the influence of city on social activity of national intellectual class. The article uses the materials of Kazakhstani and Russian archives, document of regional archives, such as the archive of Kostanay city and North-Kazakhstan region. The methodological basis of the research are institutional and frontier approach, which allow to identify the degree of urban environment and city space influence on formation of national intellectual class. Also, it allows to study the evolution and development of political ideas and focus of Kazakh intellectual class in the end of XIX beginning XX c. in the conditions of building relationship system between the empire and national borders. Historical and genetical method is also applied in the present study, which allows to consider the challenges of the development and identify patterns.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential parameter in the climate system whose dynamics indicate climate change. This study aimed to assess the impact of multitemporal land use and land cover (LULC) change on LST due to urbanization in Hefei City, Anhui Province, China. The research methodology consisted of four main components: Landsat data collection and preparation; multitemporal LULC classification; time-series LST dataset reconstruction; and impact of multitemporal LULC change on LST. The results revealed that urban and built-up land continuously increased from 2.05% in 2001 to 13.25% in 2020. Regarding the impact of LULC change on LST, the spatial analysis demonstrated that the LST difference between urban and non-urban areas had been 1.52 K, 3.38 K, 2.88 K and 3.57 K in 2001, 2006, 2014 and 2020, respectively. Meanwhile, according to decomposition analysis, regarding the influence of LULC change on LST, the urban and built-up land had an intra-annual amplitude of 20.42 K higher than other types. Thus, it can be reconfirmed that land use and land cover changes due to urbanization in Hefei City impact the land surface temperature.

TI  - Long-Term Consistent Recalibration of VIRR Solar Reflectance Data Record for Fengyun Polar-Orbiting Satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible infrared radiometer (VIRR) is the first instrument with longest measurements equipped on the Fengyun (FY) polar-orbiting satellites. Through re-processing of the historic VIRR measurements, long-term (over 20 yr) global data can be integrated from multiple participating VIRRs on a consistent radiometric scale, which are valuable to climate and climate change studies. Due to lack of an onboard calibration system for VIRR, the reflective solar bands must be vicariously calibrated. This study applied the multi-site vicarious approach for consistent calibration of the VIRR visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) data, and produced calibration coefficients for five VIRRs on FY-1C/D and FY-3A/B/C. The data quality was then evaluated with observations. The reflectance predicted by using the radiative transfer model over multiple invariant desert and ocean targets was used to derive the calibration slope via a weighted fitting scheme, in which the weights are the inverse of the variance from a radiative transfer simulation evaluated with reference to Aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The sensor-specific calibration coefficients were derived on a daily basis by using piecewise polynomials. The calibration reference of the VIRR solar band record was further traced to the Aqua MODIS Collection 6.1 reference calibration with a systematic correction derived from the Libya4 desert. The VIRR record was compared with the Aqua MODIS C6.1 calibration over the polar region based on simultaneous nadir overpass observations. The lifetime relative difference for each sensor are within 3.3% and 4.5% for channels 1 and 2. Invariant deserts were also employed to evaluate the stability and consistency of the VIRR record. In general, the means of the directional and spectral corrected reflectance for each sensor are within 1% of the 20-yr average, implying that the VIRR reflectance of the invariant targets is consistent to within 1% among the sensors for channels 1 and 2. The VIRR data thus derived are reliable.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation in net primary productivity and factor detection in Yunnan Province based on geodetector
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the spatiotemporal variation and driving factors of net primary productiv. ity (NPP) in Yunnan Province, using trend analysis, correlation analysis, and geodetector method based on NPP data from 2000 to 2015, as well as meteorological, DEM, land use, NDVI and population density data. The interannual variation of NPP in Yunnan Province showed a fluc. tuating increasing trend with a mean annual growth rate of 2.13 g C.m(-2).a(-1). The average annual NPP had large spatial variations, and generally increased from the northeast to southwest. The NPP in 88.5% of the total areas remained basically unchanged or increased from 2000 to 2015. In terms of each individual factor, the dominant factor for NPP changed from vegetation coverage to precipitation in 2010 and the influence of human interference increased. In terms of two-factor interaction, the interaction of two factors enhanced the explanatory power of spatial dif. ferentiation of NPP in Yunnan Province. Therefore, the synergistic effects of multiple factors on NPP should be emphasized in future ecological environment planning to understand the status of ecosystem health in Yunnan Province.

TI  - UAVs as remote sensing platforms in plant ecology: review of applications and challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, have recently emerged as cost-effective and flexible tools for acquiring remote sensing data with fine spatial and temporal resolution. It provides a new method and opportunity for plant ecologists to study issues from individual to regional scales. However, as a new method, UAVs remote sensing applications in plant ecology are still challenged. The needs of plant ecology research and the application development of UAVs remote sensing should be better integrated. Methods This report provides a comprehensive review of UAV-based remote sensing applications in plant ecology to synthesize prospects of applying drones to advance plant ecology research. Important Findings Of the 400 references, 59% were published in remote sensing journals rather than in plant ecology journals, reflecting a substantial gap between the interests of remote sensing experts and plant ecologists. Most of the studies focused on UAV remote sensing's technical aspects, such as data processing and remote sensing inversion, with little attention on answering ecological questions. There were 61% of studies involved community-scale research. RGB and multispectral cameras were the most used sensors (75%). More ecologically meaningful parameters can be extracted from UAV data to better understand the canopy surface irregularity and community heterogeneity, identify geometrical characteristics of canopy gaps and construct canopy chemical assemblies from living vegetation volumes. More cooperation between plant ecologists and remote sensing experts is needed to promote UAV remote sensing in advancing plant ecology research.

TI  - Savanna plant communities in the wetter parts of the Indonesian archipelago
T2  - FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Savanna occurs in specific locations throughout the Indonesian archipelago, including some high rainfall regions. Little is known about its defining characteristics, such as structure, composition or diversity, and what these characteristics reveal about the origin and age of these savannas. At four locations in eastern Java (Baluran National Park & Alas Purwo National Park), Bali (Bali Barat National Park) and Lombok (Rinjani National Park), we used plots to record the abundance and cover of plant species and to measure local environmental parameters. MODIS burned-area product and field observations were used to obtain information on recent fires. We compared each savanna in terms of dominant species, species diversity and species richness. We also used ANOSIM to analyse the variation in community composition and canonical correspondence analysis to explore relationships between floristic and measured environmental factors. Our results showed there were distinct gradients in elevation (along with related climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation) and fire regime linked to floristic composition across the savannas of Java, Bali and Lombok Islands. Each savanna was characterized by a different set of woody and grass species, with invasive alien species, such as Acacia nilotica (syn. Vachellia nilotica), Lantana camara and Chromolaena odorata, being particularly important in differentiating between savannas. Characteristics of the Baluran savanna suggest that this ecosystem may be of considerable age, whereas the other savannas are likely to be maintained by regular fire. This study is the first study to describe more thoroughly the savanna plant community in the wetter parts of Indonesian archipelago and should serve as a valuable foundation for further studies on the Indonesian savannas and those of other parts of Southeast Asia.

AB  - We present the case of a 31-year-old woman with a chief complaint of a left breast mass. The patient visited our department for an evaluation of this left breast mass. Left breast cancer(cT1cN0M0, cStage Ⅰ, triple negative type)was diagnosed, and left partial mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy were performed. Although the pStage was the same prior to surgery, a BRCA1 mutation was identified on genetic testing. After administration of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel), consorted mastectomy, tissue expander insertion, and breast reconstruction with silicone implant were performed. Spontaneous pregnancy occurred 1 year and 10 months after the first operation. She had an uneventful delivery with a normal course of labor 2 years and 6 months after the surgery. Two years and 11 months after the first operation, she visited our institution with complaints of headache, dizziness, and difficulty eating. Upon assessment, brain, lung, liver, and bone metastases were identified on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Concentrated glycerin and fructose, steroid administration, and whole-brain irradiation improved the symptoms due to cerebral edema. Thereafter, olaparib was started, and treatment was continued while maintaining partial response(PR).

TI  - Lateral Flow and Contributing Area Control Vegetation Cover in a Semiarid Environment
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiarid ecosystems attract attention, because they support the life of large human populations, while functioning under growing threats of degradation due to global climate change that may lead to reduced productivity and possibly irreversible desertification. Empirical support is consequently highly sought after to validate the soil-moisture-biomass relationship at the local scale in these ecosystems. Combining physically based models and a database of 32 years of field and remotely sensed data, we examined the effect of soil-moisture content (SMC) on vegetation cover and patch size distribution in the heterogenous semiarid Lehavim LTER in the Negev Desert, Israel. Results from numerical solutions of flow equations in the shallow soil layer allowed predictions of distributions of SMC as the outcome of vertical and lateral water fluxes. The association of vertical fluxes with patch size distribution and vegetation cover did not support the notion that direct rainfall is sufficient for the shrubs' survival in drought conditions. However, re-infiltration of downslope runoff, generated in sealed bare intershrub soil area, significantly contributed to the water available to supporting shrub patches. Accordingly, our approach determines potential vegetation cover in semiarid areas, due to the dependency on contributing area and rainfall-infiltration-runoff processes. This underscores the fact that, additionally to infiltration from direct rainfall, run-on contribution controls vegetation cover in semiarid environments. We therefore suggest that estimations of shrub resilience to water stress should consider scenarios involving surface sealing, rainfall duration and intensity, and contributing area size-each in accordance with the contribution of lateral flows to the water available to shrubs.

TI  - Beaver-Driven Peatland Ecotone Dynamics: Impoundment Detection Using Lidar and Geomorphon Analysis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This investigation focused on remotely detecting beaver impoundments and dams along the boreal-like peatland ecotones enmeshing Cranberry Glades Botanical Area, a National Natural Landmark in mountainous West Virginia, USA. Beaver (Castor spp.) are renowned for their role as ecosystem engineers. They can alter local hydrology, change the ratios of meadow to woodland, act as buffers against drought and wildfire, and influence important climate parameters such as carbon retention and methanogenesis. The Cranberry Glades (~1000 m a.s.l.) occupy ~300 ha, including ~40 ha of regionally rare, open peatlands. Given the likely historical role of beaver activity in the formation and maintenance of peatland conditions at Cranberry Glades, monitoring of recent activity may be useful in predicting future changes. We analyzed remotely sensed data to identify and reconstruct shifting patterns of surface hydrology associated with beaver ponds and dams and developed a novel application of geomorphons to detect them, aided by exploitation of absences and errors in Lidar data. We also quantified decadal-timescale dynamics of beaver activity by tallying detectable active impoundments between 1990-2020, revealing active/fallow cycles and changing numbers of impoundments per unit area of suitable riparian habitat. This research presents both a practical approach to monitoring beaver activity through analysis of publicly available data and a spatiotemporal reconstruction of three decades of beaver activity at this rare and imperiled "Arctic Island" of the southern High Alleghenies.

TI  - The Possibility of COVID-19 Pandemic in Eliminating Burning Activities: A Case Study at Ogan Komering Ilir Regency, South Sumatera
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest and land fires occur almost every year in South Sumatera Province, including at Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) Regency, mainly due to uncontrolled burning activities. This region has the largest peatland responsible for the adverse haze impacts. The advent of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020 has triggered massive consequences across the global communities, including Indonesia. Therefore, large-scale regulations on social restrictions were enacted. The purpose of this study is to analyze the variations in hotspots as forest and land fire indicators before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in OKI as well as to determine the rainfall effects. Daily Terra/Aqua MODIS satellite feeds and rainfall data between January 2018 and December 2020 served as the research materials. Subsequently, the paired t-test and correlation assessment were used to examine the hotspot variations in both datasets, respectively. The results showed significant statistical differences before and during the pandemic. Consequently, social restrictions were assumed to instigate the decline in burning activities. Furthermore, the rainfall demonstrated a vulnerable correlation to the hotspots, indicating that human factor was more pronounced as afire trigger.

TI  - Management of Clitoral Melanoma Presenting as an Exophytic Clitoral Mass: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary mucosal melanomas of the female genital tract account for one percent or less of all cases of melanoma with even fewer originating in the clitoris. Given the rarity of diagnosis of clitoral melanoma, there is a paucity of data guiding management. There is no supporting evidence that radical vulvectomy (with or without inguinal lymphadenopathy) is associated with improved disease-free or overall survival compared to partial vulvectomy or wide local excision. Additionally, there is no data to evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy or extensive lymphadenectomy in clitoral melanoma, however previous evidence demonstrates the utility of regional lymph node sampling in predicting survival in women with female genital tract mucosal melanoma. Adjuvant therapy considerations are often extrapolated from their use in treating cutaneous melanomas, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapy agents. Adjuvant radiation therapy has limited utility except in cases of bulky, unresectable disease, or when inguinal lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. The 52 year-old patient presented in this review was diagnosed with locally invasive advanced stage clitoral melanoma presenting as an exophytic clitoral mass. She underwent diagnostic primary tumor resection, which demonstrated ulcerative melanoma with spindle cell features extending to a Breslow depth of at least 28 mm. She subsequently underwent secondary wide local excision with groin sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab. This article also emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary team involving gynecologic oncology, medical oncology, radiology, and pathology for management of this rare type of primary mucosal melanoma of the female genital tract.

TI  - Contaminant concentrations and risks associated with the Pacific oyster in the highly urbanized San Diego Bay
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Contaminant concentrations in filter-feeding shellfish may indicate the health of coastal waters and consumption risks. Widespread expansion of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and its popularity as food make it a useful sentinel. We surveyed intertidal Pacific oysters in San Diego Bay, California for contaminants during summer 2018 and winter 2019. We compared contaminants in Pacific oyster to California mussel from California's State Mussel Watch Program (1993-2003) and human consumption thresholds. Contaminants such as neonicotinoid and chlorinated pesticides, selenium, and several metals were higher in Pacific oysters in summer, while PBDEs, benzylbutyl phthalate, and plastics were higher in winter. Contaminant levels were generally lower in Pacific oyster than mussel except for copper and zinc. Bay-wide PCB concentrations in oysters exceeded thresholds but individual samples (locations) also met or surpassed chlordane, PCB and PAH thresholds. Monitoring and risk assessments that consider species' biology, season, location, effects of multiple contaminants, and human consumption patterns will contribute to more effective consumption guidelines.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Remote Sensing Technology Based on a SEBAL Model in the Upper Reaches of the Huaihe River Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal variations of evapotranspiration (ET) is vital for water resources planning and management and drought monitoring. The development of a satellite remote sensing technique is described to provide insight into the estimation of ET at a regional scale. In this study, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to calculate the actual ET on a daily scale from Landsat-8 data and daily ground-based meteorological data in the upper reaches of Huaihe River on 20 November 2013, 16 April 2015 and 23 March 2018. In order to evaluate the performance of the SEBAL model, the daily SEBAL ET (ETSEBAL) was compared against the daily reference ET (ET0) from four theoretical methods: the Penman-Monteith (P-M), Irmak-Allen (I-A), the Turc, and Jensen-Haise (J-H) method, the ETMOD16 product from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) and the ETVIC from Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (VIC). A linear regression equation and statistical indices were used to model performance evaluation. The results showed that the daily ETSEBAL correlated very well with the ET0, ETMOD16, and ETVIC, and bias between the ETSEBAL with them was less than 1.5%. In general, the SEBAL model could provide good estimations in daily ET over the study region. In addition, the spatial-temporal distribution of ETSEBAL was explored. The variation of ETSEBAL was significant in seasons with high values during the growth period of vegetation in March and April and low values in November. Spatially, the daily ETSEBAL values in the mountain area were much higher than those in the plain areas over the study region. The variability of ETSEBAL in this study area was positively correlated with elevation and negatively correlated with surface reflectance, which implies that elevation and surface reflectance are the important factors for predicting ET in this study area.

TI  - Disentangling the roles of land-use-related drivers on vegetation greenness across China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the drivers of terrestrial vegetation dynamics is critical for monitoring ecosystem carbon sequestration and bioenergy production. Large scale vegetation dynamics can be observed using the leaf area index (LAI) derived from satellite data as a measure of 'greenness'. Previous studies have quantified the effects of climate change and carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization on vegetation greenness. In contrast, the specific roles of land-use-related drivers (LURDs) on vegetation greenness have not been characterized. Here, we combined the Interior-Point Method-optimized ecosystem model and the Bayesian model averaging statistical method to disentangle the roles of LURDs on vegetation greenness in China from 2000 to 2014. Results showed a significant increase in growing season LAI (greening) over 35% of the land area of China, whereas less than 6% of it exhibited a significantly decreasing trend (browning). The overall impact of LURDs on vegetation greenness over the whole country was comparatively low. However, the local effects of LURDs on the greenness trends of some specified areas were considerable due to afforestation and urbanization. Southern Coastal China had the greatest area fractions (35.82% of its corresponding area) of the LURDs effects on greening, following by Southwest China. It was because of these economic regions with great afforestation programs. Afforestation effects could explain 27% of the observed greening trends in the forest area. In contrast, the browning impact caused by urbanization was approximately three times of the greening effects of both climate change and CO2 fertilization on the urban area. And they made the urban area had a 50% decrease in LAI. The effects of residual LURDs only accounted for less than 8% of the corresponding observed greenness changes. Such divergent roles would be valuable for understanding changes in local ecosystem functions and services under global environmental changes.

TI  - Dynamics of Mid-Channel Bar during Different Impoundment Periods of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area in China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of the mid-channel bars (MCBs) in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) were substantially impacted by the large water-level changes due to the impoundments of the TGR. However, it is still not clear how the morphology of the MCBs changed under the influence of water level and hydrological regime changes induced by the impoundments and operation of the TGR. In this work, the MCBs in the TGR were retrieved using Landsat remote sensing images from 1989 to 2019, and the spatio-temporal variations in the number, area, morphology and location of the MCBs during different impoundment periods were investigated. The results showed that the number and area of MCBs changed dramatically with water-level changes, and the changes were dominated by MCBs with an area less than 0.03 km(2) and larger than 1 km(2). The area of MCBs decreased progressively with the rising water level, and the number generally showed a decreasing trend, with the minimum number occurring at the third stage when the water level reached 139 m, resulting in the maximum average area at this period. The ratio of length to width of the MCBs generally decreased with the changes in hydrological and sediment regimes, leading to a shape adjustment from narrow-long to relatively short-round with the rising of the water level. The water impoundments of the TGR led to the migration of the dominant area from the upper section to the middle section of the TGR and resulted in a more even distribution of MCBs in the TGR. The results improve our understanding of the mechanisms of the development of MCBs in the TGR under the influence of water impoundment coupled with the annually cyclic hydrological regime and longer periods of inundation and exposure.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Assisted Basin-Scale Water Resources Management Considering Climate Change and Human Activities Impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human interventions and climate change have caused significant alterations in the hydrologic response of several highly managed basins in Iran. One of these alterations is a considerable reduction in streamflow quantity, resulting in severe water supply insecurity. This paper presents an integrated modeling approach combining remote sensing, water balance analysis, reservoir operations, and water allocation policy evaluations. The approach helps in understanding of the relative contribution of anthropogenic factors in places where a major challenge is the lack of measured data for the historical time series of water withdrawals for agricultural development and water lost from the system through actual evapotranspiration (AET). Calibrated moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data of monthly AET (MOD16), modified Thornthwaite-Mather (M-TWM) water balance model, annual MODIS Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) products (MCQD12Q1), mass curve analyses, and periodic analysis of water balance parameters were used to evaluate the contribution of anthropogenic factors and the effect of climatic impacts on the inflow time series for the Talvar Reservoir. The procedure led to an estimation of the naturalized series of the streamflow free of anthropogenic impacts; based on this, more plausible estimates of the basin's future water availability were determined, which were then used in a water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model for Talvar Reservoir operations and water allocations. The study yielded four main results. First, it was seen that there were two abrupt change points in the analyzed mass curves, in the years 1998 and 2007, dividing the study period (1988-2012) into three periods. Periodic analysis of water balance parameters showed that while climate change caused streamflow changes in postimpact period A (1998-2007), intensified human activities brought about streamflow changes in postimpact period B (2008-2012). Secondly, it was found that the naturalized series of the Talvar streamflow had a better correlation coefficient with precipitation than the observed series for river flow. Thirdly, despite the proposed approach lacking the use of some water balance components such as soil moisture and snow water equivalent, the percentage of unaccounted water content was between 5% and 10%, indicating good accuracy of the proposed approach as a tool for sustainable water resources management. Fourth, the WEAP model simulation results demonstrated that the unfavorable condition of the aquifer can be ameliorated by applying proper management policies. The results also showed that to increase water supply security and facilitate sustainability, a certain amount of reduction in ground-water withdrawals and agricultural areas is inevitable.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Aerosol Optical Depth in the Atmosphere over Baikal Region Based on MODIS Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers spatiotemporal distribution and seasonal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the atmosphere at the 0.55 mu m wavelength in the atmosphere over the Baikal region of Russia based on long-term data (2005-2019) from satellite observations (MODIS/AQUA). A comparison of satellite AOD values with the AERONET record at the Geophysical Observatory of Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of Siberian Brunch of Russian Academy of Science was performed. The results show that interannual AOD variability is mainly due to forest fires. The highest atmospheric transparency was in 2010, 2013 and 2016, and the lowest was in 2008, 2012 and 2014. It is noted that AOD decreased with latitude with a gradient Delta AOD = 0.002 divided by 0.001 per degree of latitude. The mean seasonal variations in AOD at the six satellite overpass points were characterized by spring (April) and summer (July) highs and low AOD values in autumn. From June to November, the drop in AOD monthly means was more than 60%.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy vs. Observation in Thin Melanoma: A Multicenter Propensity Score Matching Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The therapeutic value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in thin melanoma remains controversial. The aim of this study is to determine the role of SLNB in the survival of thin melanomas (<= 1 mm). A multicenter retrospective observational study was designed. A propensity score matching was performed to compare patients who underwent SLNB vs. observation. A multivariate Cox regression was used. A total of 1438 patients were matched by propensity score. There were no significant differences in melanoma-specific survival (MSS) between the SLNB and observation groups. Predictors of MSS in the multivariate model were age, tumor thickness, ulceration, and interferon treatment. Results were similar for disease-free survival and overall survival. The 5- and 10-year MSS rates for SLN-negative and -positive patients were 98.5% vs. 77.3% (p < 0.001) and 97.3% vs. 68.7% (p < 0.001), respectively. SLNB does not improve MSS in patients with thin melanoma. It also had no impact on DSF or OS. However, a considerable difference in MSS, DFS, and OS between SLN-positive and -negative patients exists, confirming its value as a prognostic procedure and therefore we recommend discussing the option of SLNB with patients.

TI  - Modeling the Habitat Distribution of <i>Acanthopagrus schlegelii</i> in the Coastal Waters of the Eastern Taiwan Strait Using MAXENT with Fishery and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Black sea bream, Acanthopagrus schlegelii, is among the most commercially valuable species in the coastal fishery industry and marine ecosystems. Catch data comprising capture locations for the gillnet fisheries, remotely sensed environmental data (i.e., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, and current velocity), and topography (bathymetry) from 2015 to 2018 were used to construct a spatial habitat distribution of black sea bream. This species is concentrated in coastal waters (<3 nm) from December to April (spawning season). The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method and corresponding habitat suitability index among seasons were used to clarify the species' spatial distribution and identify the seasonal variations in habitat selection. The patterns corresponded closely to the changes in oceanographic conditions, and the species exhibited synchronous trends with the marine environment's seasonal dynamics. Chlorophyll-a concentration and bathymetry substantially influenced (80.1-92.9%) black sea bream's habitat selection. By applying the MaxEnt model, the optimal habitats were identified with four variables including depth and satellite-derived temperature, current velocity and chlorophyll-a concentration, which provides a foundation for the scientific assessment and management of black sea bream in coastal waters of the Eastern Taiwan Strait.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Spectral-Response Assessment of the Forest Cover of Small Dry Valleys in the Central Russian Forest-Steppe
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results of assessment are presented for the relationship between the forest cover of small dry valleys and their spectral response through analysis of object data in the forest-steppe natural zone of the Central Chernozem region of Russia. The SWIR reflectance of small dry valleys is shown to be tightly correlated with the percentage of forest cover. The greater the forest cover, the lower the SWIR reflectance. A logistical dependence can be used to obtain spectral-response estimates for forest cover in the SWIR range. Spectral-response estimates are found for the forest cover of small dry valleys in the Central Russian forest steppe from Landsat data in the mid-1980s, early 2000s, and late 2010s. Recent decades have seen an increase in the forest-cover percentage of small dry valleys throughout most of the region. From the mid-1980s to 2018, the forest cover increased from 16 to 45%. During the study period, an increase is observed in intraregional differences in the forest cover of ravines. Currently, this indicator varies more significantly within the region than in the mid-1980s.

TI  - Mapping Land Use Land Cover Changes and Their Determinants in the Context of a Massive Free Labour Mobilisation Campaign: Evidence from South Wollo, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern Ethiopia is characterised by fragile mountain eco-systems that are highly susceptible to land degradation, impacting food security and livelihoods. This study appraises Land Use Land Cover Changes (LULCC) and their determinants from 2000 to 2020 in Dessie Zuria and Kutaber Woredas. It explores the LULCC and the key anthropogenic drivers of the change over the past 20 years through a mix of satellite imagery and a survey of local understandings. Six land use types (agriculture, forest, area closure, grazing, settlement and bare land) were mapped from satellite imagery that was acquired from Landsat 7 for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010, and Landsat 8 and OLI multispectral imageries for the years 2015 and 2020 with a spectral resolution of 30-m obtained from USGS. The results showed that agricultural land increased from 29.68% in 2000 to 35.77% in 2020.Furthermore, settlement and grazing lands enlarged from 5.95% and 6.04%, respectively, to 8.31% and 6.35% during the same period, while bare land increased from 9.89% to 10.92% in 2020. On the contrary, forest and area closure decreased from 18.45% and 29.99% to 17.8% and 17.38%, respectively. Meanwhile, population growth, unrestricted grazing, losing a sense of ownership of protected area closures and forests, lack of cooperation, using the free labour mobilisation schemes for government-induced agendas, weak enforcement of laws and bylaws, and engaging farmers for extended days on the campaign were prominent determinants of the changes. This research has implications for development actors across land management and food security towards implementing sustainable land management in the area and beyond.

TI  - Lymphadenectomy in Endometrial Cancers-A Review
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Most endometrial cancers are diagnosed in an early stage, and nearly three-fourths do not require any lymph node clearance. Surgical staging is considered the gold standard, but the role of lymphadenectomy is unclear. Most patients with endometrial cancers have other medical co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, obesity and remain high risk for prolonged procedures. The reported risk of lymphedema according to published literature could be as high as 30% vis-a-vis a 10% risk of upstaging with lymph node clearance. The confounding factors in endometrial cancers are the depth of myometrial invasion, tumor size, histology, tumor grade and variable lymphatic pathways. Visual inspection/palpation of the nodes or berry-picking enlarged nodes remain poor predictors of nodal involvement. The extent of clearance by convention ranges from bilateral pelvic only or addition of a formal retroperitoneal clearance upto the left renal vein. Adjuvant treatment for patients diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer after a comprehensive lymphadenectomy is not uniform. The path forward appears to revolve around sentinel mapping. Lymphadenectomy can be omitted in the low-risk group, while a cervical injection-based pelvic sentinel mapping can be performed in the intermediate-risk group. However, in the high-risk/ultrahigh-risk subgroups, para-aortic sentinel node mapping is needed. If there are no SLNs identified with a cervical injection, an additional corporeal ICG injection may be needed. This approach needs to be based on an institutional algorithm with the incorporation of ultrastaging. An additional benefit of the sentinel approach is a focused histopathological analysis of the most relevant nodes. Various dyes have been evaluated for sentinel mapping, methylene blue being the cheapest though studies show indocyanine green to be the safer alternative with better results.

TI  - Improving MODIS Aerosol Estimates Over Land With the Surface BRDF Reflectances Using the 3-D Discrete Cosine Transform and RossThick-LiSparse Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of aerosol properties over land from satellite sensors has always been a challenge. At present, several different algorithms for retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been developed from different satellite sensors. While each algorithm has its own advantages, the accuracy of AOD retrieval still needs to be further improved. To improve the retrieval accuracy of aerosol algorithms, it is necessary to provide a better method to describe the surface properties. In the current study, a new aerosol retrieval algorithm for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at a high spatial resolution of 500 m is proposed based on a priori bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) shape parameters database, which is reconstructed via the 3-D discrete cosine transform (DCT-PLS) method. Then, the surface reflectances are calculated from BRDF model (i.e., RossThick-LiSparse), and a non-Lambertian forward model used to describe the surface anisotropy. The new algorithm is used for processing the MODIS over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei of China, and Southeastern United States of America regions, and results are validated against AERONET AOD measurements as well as compared with the MODIS AOD products. The comparison showed that the estimation scheme of surface reflectance in this new algorithm significantly improved the AOD retrievals accuracy, with average correlation coefficient similar to 0.965 and root-mean-square error similar to 0.125; the number of AOD retrievals falling within expected error has increased to similar to 80.1%, and the overestimation uncertainty has been reduced compared with MODIS products. Due to the high spatial resolution and continuous spatial distributions of the AOD retrievals by the new algorithm, therefore, it can well-captured aerosol details over mixed surfaces and better useful for air pollution studies than the MODIS products at local and urban scales.

TI  - Clinical significance of internal mammary lymph node incidentally detected during free-flap breast reconstruction: Case report and systematic review of the literature
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CANCER: CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - The internal mammary lymph node (IMN) chain, along with the axillary lymph node (ALN) chain, is the first echelon nodal drainage site in breast cancer (BC). ALN with/without IMN nodal involvement is known to have a prognostic value for loco-regional and distant recurrences in BC patients. Yet, IMN sampling is not routine in clinical practice, although its invasion by tumor cells may lead to an abrupt shift in the management of BC patients. We report a case of a patient presenting with early invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) BC treated with modified radical mastectomy and axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) without evidence of pathologic involvement. Several months later, during free-flap breast reconstruction using IM vessels, an accidental IMN was harvested and sent for histopathological analysis, which confirmed IMN metastasis. This unexpected finding totally modified the patient's ultimate management. We also conducted a systematic review of the literature on the implications of IMN sampling during recipient site preparation in free-flap breast reconstruction (FFBR) on the prognosis and treatment of patients in the modern "personalized-medicine " era.

TI  - Metastasis of breast cancer to liver through direct lymphatic drainage: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer liver metastasis (BCLM) is considered to occur by hematogenous spread of primary breast cancer cells. We herein present a case of lymphatic BCLM that was confirmed by preoperative imaging for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). A woman in her early 70s was diagnosed with clinical stage T2N0M0 invasive lobular cancer of the left breast. She underwent mastectomy with SLNB. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy showed intense accumulation of isotope in the upper abdomen, corresponding to segment IV of the liver on single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). However, no abnormalities were detected on magnetic resonance imaging. At 2.5 years postoperatively, the patient's serum CA15-3 concentration was elevated, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed a solitary liver metastasis. The PET/CT findings were similar to the SPECT/CT findings obtained 2.5 years earlier, indicating that the BCLM had developed lymphatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of lymphatic BCLM proven by imaging examination.

TI  - Intertextuality as an Integral Component of the Modern Ukrainian Discourse (on the Example of Literary and Journalistic Styles)
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article highlights the impact of globalization processes on formation of dominant worldviews and guidelines, as well as ways and means of representing the latter. The state and prospects of studying intertextuality as an important element of modern world discourses in the projection on the national cultural background are studied. Attention is drawn to the high degree of development of both theoretical and applied aspects of intertextuality of discourses by representatives of academic communities of different countries and fields of knowledge, which gave grounds to establish the polydiscursive and interdiscursive nature of the object of analysis. Orientation of domestic experts on parameterization of mainly specific manifestations of intertextuality within certain discourses at the level of isolated intertexts and presence of gaps in the theoretical description of the phenomenon in the context of national specificity is stated. Emphasis is placed on the definite variability of the terminology due to the interdisciplinary nature of discursiveness and, accordingly, intertextuality. A complementary link has been established between postmodernism as the dominant philosophical worldview and the intertextuality of discourses. The specifics of the intertextuality of contemporary Ukrainian literary discourse with regard to various scientific studies are clarified. The concept of "intertextual memory" is introduced and justification of its use is given. The need to apply the term "postmodern intertextuality" in relation to contemporary literary discourse is considered. The common and distinctive features of the manifestation of intertextuality in literary and journalistic discourses are traced. The specifics of intertextuality of Ukrainian journalistic discourse are described. It is established that the precedent character of the communicative act is of exceptional importance for realization of intertextuality in journalistic discourse.

TI  - Deforestation Detection with Fully Convolutional Networks in the Amazon Forest from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of remote-sensing multisource data from optical-based satellite sensors has created new opportunities and challenges for forest monitoring in the Amazon Biome. In particular, change-detection analysis has emerged in recent decades to monitor forest-change dynamics, supporting some Brazilian governmental initiatives such as PRODES and DETER projects for biodiversity preservation in threatened areas. In recent years fully convolutional network architectures have witnessed numerous proposals adapted for the change-detection task. This paper comprehensively explores state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks such as U-Net, ResU-Net, SegNet, FC-DenseNet, and two DeepLabv3+ variants on monitoring deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The networks' performance is evaluated experimentally in terms of Precision, Recall, F1-score, and computational load using satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution: Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. We also include the results of an unprecedented auditing process performed by senior specialists to visually evaluate each deforestation polygon derived from the network with the highest accuracy results for both satellites. This assessment allowed estimation of the accuracy of these networks simulating a process "in nature " and faithful to the PRODES methodology. We conclude that the high resolution of Sentinel-2 images improves the segmentation of deforestation polygons both quantitatively (in terms of F1-score) and qualitatively. Moreover, the study also points to the potential of the operational use of Deep Learning (DL) mapping as products to be consumed in PRODES.

TI  - A new generation of sensors and monitoring tools to support climate-smart forestry practices
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate-smart forestry (CSF) is an emerging branch of sustainable adaptive forest management aimed at enhancing the potential of forests to adapt to and mitigate climate change. It relies on much higher data requirements than traditional forestry. These data requirements can be met by new devices that support continuous, in situ monitoring of forest conditions in real time. We propose a comprehensive network of sensors, i.e., a wireless sensor network (WSN), that can be part of a worldwide network of interconnected uniquely addressable objects, an Internet of Things (IoT), which can make data available in near real time to multiple stakeholders, including scientists, foresters, and forest managers, and may partially motivate citizens to participate in big data collection. The use of in situ sources of monitoring data as ground-truthed training data for remotely sensed data can boost forest monitoring by increasing the spatial and temporal scales of the monitoring, leading to a better understanding of forest processes and potential threats. Here, some of the key developments and applications of these sensors are outlined, together with guidelines for data management. Examples are given of their deployment to detect early warning signals (EWS) of ecosystem regime shifts in terms of forest productivity, health, and biodiversity. Analysis of the strategic use of these tools highlights the opportunities for engaging citizens and forest in this new of forest

TI  - Surface Water Dynamics and Rapid Lake Drainage in the Western Canadian Subarctic (1985-2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The area and distribution of surface water are shifting rapidly in many regions across the circumpolar Arctic. In this study, we explore the effects of climate and terrain factors on the area of lakes in the Northwest Territories, Canada. We used the Landsat satellite archive to map interannual changes in 5,328 lakes and ponds in the Lower Mackenzie Plain between 1985 and 2020. The high temporal resolution of our dataset allowed us to classify gradual and abrupt changes in the lake area and identify rapid drainage events. We used Generalized Additive Models and Random Forests to test the effects of climate and terrain factors on changes in the lake area. Despite increases in the area of smaller lakes driven by increasing precipitation, we found that the total lake area has decreased by approximately 1%. Overall, 29% of lakes exhibited an increasing trend in the area, while 11% exhibited a decreasing trend, and the majority of these changes (65%) were non-linear in nature. Lakes located in fire scars were also 3.8 times more likely to show a decreasing trend in area. Analysis of a large fire indicates that lakes within the burned region exhibited declines in an area that persisted until the end of the study period 20 years after the fire. These declines are likely related to the impact of fire on thaw depth, groundwater connectivity, and the development of new drainage pathways. Our results highlight the importance of rapid drainage and wildfire as drivers of declines in the lake area.

TI  - The Science of Life and Wellbeing: Integrating the New Science of Consciousness with the Ancient Science of Consciousness
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SPIRITUALITY & RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanity is in the midst of a major shift. To tackle the many challenges that face us, we will need a collective shift in consciousness - a shift from a worldview of separateness to a worldview of interconnectedness. This essay explores the interweaving of quantum science and ancient Chinese culture and examines how these two paradigms provide us a sense of how we are collectively evolving to higher levels of consciousness. A vision of this new era is described in detail, including how culture, models, values, economic structures, the systems of environmental restoration, education, healthcare, and food production will all change, creating a new way of living. The leaders who can help manifest this vision are called Quantum Leaders, and they must first experience their own shift in consciousness in order to lead this societal transformation.

TI  - Assessing Post-Fire Effects on Soil Loss Combining Burn Severity and Advanced Erosion Modeling in Malesina, Central Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth's ecosystems are extremely valuable to humanity, playing a key role ecologically, economically, and socially. Wildfires constitute a significant threat to the environment, especially in vulnerable ecosystems, such as those that are commonly found in the Mediterranean. Due to their strong impact on the environment, they provide a crucial factor in managing ecosystems behavior, causing dramatic modifications to land surface processes dynamics leading to land degradation. The soil erosion phenomenon downgrades soil quality in ecosystems and reduces land productivity. Thus, it is imperative to implement advanced erosion prediction models to assess fire effects on soil characteristics. This study focuses on examining the wildfire case that burned 30 km(2) in Malesina of Central Greece in 2014. The added value of remote sensing today, such as the high accuracy of satellite data, has contributed to visualizing the burned area concerning the severity of the event. Additional data from local weather stations were used to quantify soil loss on a seasonal basis using RUSLE modeling before and after the wildfire. Results of this study revealed that there is a remarkable variety of high soil loss values, especially in winter periods. More particularly, there was a 30% soil loss rise one year after the wildfire, while five years after the event, an almost double reduction was observed. In specific areas with high soil erosion values, infrastructure works were carried out validating the applied methodology. The approach adopted in this study underlines the significance of using remote sensing and geoinformation techniques to assess the post-fire effects of identifying vulnerable areas based on soil erosion parameters on a local scale.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work continues studies assessing the possibility of using remote-sensing data of the chlorophyll-a concentration for estimating the biological productivity of the water area of the Sakhalin-Kuril region. In situ data of chlorophyll-a concentration are obtained during expeditions onboard R/V Professor Kaganovskii in the Sea of Okhotsk in 2004-2011. Vertical profiles of pigment concentration are described for different regions of the Sea of Okhotsk; the thickness of photosynthetic layer and the depth of the maximum chlorophyll-a concentration are determined. Seasonal and interannual variations of the chlorophyll-a concentration along the water column are analyzed and the coefficients of the ratio between the average pigment concentration on the surface and in the upper 100-m water layer are determined. This makes it possible to use satellite information to reconstruct a typical vertical pattern of pigment distribution for different seasons and areas of the Sea of Okhotsk and estimate its total content in the layer of pronounced photosynthesis.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations of Aerosol Optical Thickness over the China Seas from Himawari-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Six years of hourly aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data retrieved from Himawari-8 were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variations, especially diurnal variations, of aerosols over the China Seas. First, the Himawari-8 AOT data were consistent with the AERONET measurements over most of the China Seas, except for some coastal regions. The spatial feature showed that AOT over high latitude seas was generally larger than over low latitude seas, and it is distributed in strips along the coastline and decreases gradually with increasing distance from the coastline. AOT undergoes diurnal variation as it decreases from 9:00 a.m. local time, reaching a minimum at noon, and then begins to increase in the afternoon. The percentage daily departure of AOT over the East China Seas generally ranged +/- 20%, increasing sharply in the afternoon; however, over the northern part of the South China Sea, daily departure reached a maximum of >40% at 4:00 p.m. The monthly variation in AOT showed a pronounced annual cycle. Seasonal variations of the spatial pattern showed that the largest AOT was usually observed in spring and varies in other seasons for different seas.

TI  - Long-Term Trends in Chesapeake Bay Remote Sensing Reflectance: Implications for Water Clarity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - While ecosystem health is improving in many estuaries worldwide following nutrient reductions, inconsistent trends in water clarity often remain. The Chesapeake Bay, a eutrophic estuary with a highly populated watershed, is a crucial testbed for these concerns. Improved efforts are needed to understand why some measurements of downstream estuarine water clarity appear to be uncorrelated with watershed management actions, and multiple metrics of clarity are needed to address this issue. To complement in situ measurements, satellite remote sensing provides an additional tool with which to assess long-term change in water clarity. In this study, remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on satellite Aqua was evaluated from 2003 to 2020 at multiple wavelengths for surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Trends show an overall long-term decrease in Rrs in the upper estuary for all wavelengths, yet an increase in Rrs in the lower estuary for green wavelengths. Trends in band ratios show long-term decreasing red-to-green and red-to-blue ratios, yet long-term increasing green-to-blue ratios. Seasonally, trends in band ratios were relatively consistent throughout the year and along-estuary, whereas single band reflectance trends varied seasonally and along-estuary. In the lower Bay, Septembers showed the strongest decreasing trends in red reflectance, while early spring and summer had the most pronounced increasing trends in green reflectance. These trends suggest that the system has experienced a long-term reduction in suspended solids concentration and light attenuation without a systematic reduction in chlorophyll-a concentration.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 Images for Soil Organic Carbon Content Mapping in Croplands of Southwestern France. The Usefulness of Sentinel-1/2 Derived Moisture Maps and Mismatches between Sentinel Images and Sampling Dates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In agronomy, soil organic carbon (SOC) content is important for the development and growth of crops. From an environmental monitoring viewpoint, SOC sequestration is essential for mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. SOC dynamics in cropland soils should be further studied through various approaches including remote sensing. In order to predict SOC content over croplands in southwestern France (area of 22,177 km(2)), this study addresses (i) the influence of the dates on which Sentinel-2 (S2) images were acquired in the springs of 2017-2018 as well as the influence of the soil sampling period of a set of samples collected between 2005 and 2018, (ii) the use of soil moisture products (SMPs) derived from Sentinel-1/2 satellites to analyze the influence of surface soil moisture on model performance when included as a covariate, and (iii) whether the spatial distribution of SOC as mapped using S2 is related to terrain-derived attributes. The influences of S2 image dates and soil sampling periods were analyzed for bare topsoil. The dates of the S2 images with the best performance (RPD >= 1.7) were 6 April and 26 May 2017, using soil samples collected between 2016 and 2018. The soil sampling dates were also analyzed using SMP values. Soil moisture values were extracted for each sample and integrated into partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. The use of soil moisture as a covariate had no effect on the prediction performance of the models; however, SMP values were used to select the driest dates, effectively mapping topsoil organic carbon. S2 was able to predict high SOC contents in the specific soil types located on the old terraces (mesas) shaped by rivers flowing from the southwestern Pyrenees.

TI  - Improving Operational Short- to Medium-Range (SR2MR) Streamflow Forecasts in the Upper Zambezi Basin and Its Sub-Basins Using Variational Ensemble Forecasting
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of Hydrological Models and high-resolution Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs) or regional Climatological Models (RCMs), has provided the means to establish baselines for the quantification, propagation, and reduction in hydrological uncertainty when generating streamflow forecasts. This study aimed to improve operational real-time streamflow forecasts for the Upper Zambezi River Basin (UZRB), in Africa, utilizing the novel Variational Ensemble Forecasting (VEF) approach. In this regard, we describe and discuss the main steps required to implement, calibrate, and validate an operational hydrologic forecasting system (HFS) using VEF and Hydrologic Processing Strategies (HPS). The operational HFS was constructed to monitor daily streamflow and forecast them up to eight days in the future. The forecasting process called short- to medium-range (SR2MR) streamflow forecasting was implemented using real-time rainfall data from three Satellite Precipitation Products or SPPs (The real-time TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis TMPA-RT, the NOAA CPC Morphing Technique CMORPH, and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed data using Artificial Neural Networks, PERSIANN) and rainfall forecasts from the Global Forecasting System (GFS). The hydrologic preprocessing (HPR) strategy considered using all raw and bias corrected rainfall estimates to calibrate three distributed hydrological models (HYMOD_DS, HBV_DS, and VIC 4.2.b). The hydrologic processing (HP) strategy considered using all optimal parameter sets estimated during the calibration process to increase the number of ensembles available for operational forecasting. Finally, inference-based approaches were evaluated during the application of a hydrological postprocessing (HPP) strategy. The final evaluation and reduction in uncertainty from multiple sources, i.e., multiple precipitation products, hydrologic models, and optimal parameter sets, was significantly achieved through a fully operational implementation of VEF combined with several HPS. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities associated with operational SR2MR streamflow forecasting using VEF are evaluated and discussed.

TI  - Synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery for Early Seasonal Agricultural Crop Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of the unprecedented capacity of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data offers new opportunities for crop mapping. In the framework of the SenSAgri project, this work studies the synergy of very high-resolution Sentinel time series to produce accurate early seasonal binary cropland mask and crop type map products. A crop classification processing chain is proposed to address the following: (1) high dimensionality challenges arising from the explosive growth in available satellite observations and (2) the scarcity of training data. The two-fold methodology is based on an S1-S2 classification system combining the so-called soft output predictions of two individually trained classifiers. The performances of the SenSAgri processing chain were assessed over three European test sites characterized by different agricultural systems. A large number of highly diverse and independent data sets were used for validation experiments. The agreement between independent classification algorithms of the Sentinel data was confirmed through different experiments. The presented results assess the interest of decision-level fusion strategies, such as the product of experts. Accurate crop map products were obtained over different countries in the early season with limited training data. The results highlight the benefit of fusion for early crop mapping and the interest of detecting cropland areas before the identification of crop types.

TI  - Comparison between In Situ and Satellite Multiscale Temperature Data for Russian Arctic Cities for Winter Conditions
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares three approaches to microclimate research by the example of Russian Arctic cities in winter conditions: (1) using high-resolution thermal images by the Landsat 8 satellite, (2) using low-resolution images of the MODIS imaging system, and (3) using direct measurements of the surface air temperature. The latter involves observations of automatic weather stations and temperature sensors of the Urban Heat Island Arctic Research Campaign (UHIARC) network and Roshydromet weather stations. Two methods for calculating the land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 satellite images have been considered: the first method is based on the atmospheric correction of images using the MODTRAN radiation transfer model and tabulated emissivity values for different land cover types, and the second method uses no atmospheric correction. The study was performed for the cities of Apatity, Vorkuta, Salekhard, Nadym, and Novy Urengoy. The land surface temperatures calculated from Landsat 8 images without atmospheric correction have been shown to agree with MODIS data and observations better than the results obtained with atmospheric correction. This indicates an inaccuracy in the value of surface emissivity. For a number of cases, the spatial variation patterns of the land surface and air temperatures are closely related; here, both types of data are indicative of the effect of urban heat island with urban-rural temperature differences up to 4 degrees C in the daytime. These results are fundamentally different from those obtained previously for lower latitudes, which indicates the prospects of using high-resolution satellite temperature data for mapping and further studies of the microclimate of Arctic cities in winter conditions.

T2  - Iranian Journal of Applied Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding effects of environment on the distribution of economic fish is a fundamental step in the ecosystem-based management and ultimately a standard approach in management policies. Bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) is one of the most important aquatic species harvested in the Indian Ocean. The present study investigated the association of different variables effecting the rate of catch and distribution of bigeye tune, using generalized additive model (GAM) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and satellite derived environmental variables in the Indian Ocean. Results highlighted the importance of temporal and spatial variables along with the eddy kinetic energy, sea level height, depth of 20[degree]C isotherm and sea surface temperature on the distribution of the species. The most suitable habitat predicted by MaxEnt model was observed around the latitudes of 0 to 5 degrees of north and south, mainly in the western part of the Indian Ocean and longitude of 45 to 70 degrees east. Using satellite data, the present study determinied the important factors and suitable habitats for the species, which can be useful for Iranian fisheries managers to increase the fishing efficiency and implementing of ecosystem-based fisheries management in the shared exploited stocks of the Indian Ocean.

TI  - Microbiological attributes of the soil under eucalyptus areas and seasonal forests
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are capable of sequestering and storing large amounts of carbon (C) in biomass and, over time, this carbon is cycled and incorporated into the soil. Cultivation of forest species, such as of eucalypts are beneficial for incorporating C, however, these are poor in diverse systems when compared to native Cerrado forests. Based on the premise that microbiological activity should be higher in native areas due to less human interference, the objective of this study was to verify the effect of eucalyptus forests on soil quality bioindicators when compared to semi-deciduous seasonal forests. The study was conducted in two different forest systems: semideciduous seasonal forest (FES) of the Cerrado and forest of Eucalyptus spp. located in the southeastern region of Goias. For each forest system, three fragments were analyzed, totaling six fragments. In each fragment, three transects were demarcated and subdivided into ten 10 m x 10 m subplots. A randomized block design with subdivided plots was used, where each plot was considered a block. In each subplot, soil samples were collected and used to determine microbial biomass carbon (MBOC), microbial respiration (MR), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), microbial quotient (qMIC), total organic carbon (TOC) and organic matter (OM). The results show that only qCO(2) did not differ statistically between FES and eucalypts, with the other variables showing higher values of microbial activity and incorporation of C when compared to eucalyptus. This is also confirmed by the analysis of variance and PCA, where the FES fragments were statistically different and superior to the three eucalypt forest fragments. When looking at FES fragments, especially regarding the sequestration of C, these present more microbiological activity and greater storage of C. The values of BOD of the native area showed an average of 568.84 mg C.kg-1 of soil, more than double than the incorporation of the planted area; where the incorporation was 227.30 mg C.kg-1 of soil, which alos the case in TOC and MO. The results of the research contribute to the initial construction of a concrete database for the environmental regularization of the preservation of forest areas, when we associate the FES with microbiological activity of C storage.
