TI  - An Overview of Remote Sensing Data Applications in Peatland Research Based on Works from the Period 2010-2021
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 21st century, remote sensing (RS) has become increasingly employed in many environmental studies. This paper constitutes an overview of works utilising RS methods in studies on peatlands and investigates publications from the period 2010-2021. Based on fifty-nine case studies from different climatic zones (from subarctic to subtropical), we can indicate an increase in the use of RS methods in peatland research during the last decade, which is likely a result of the greater availability of new remote sensing data sets (Sentinel 1 and 2; Landsat 8; SPOT 6 and 7) paired with the rapid development of open-source software (ESA SNAP; QGIS and SAGA GIS). In the studied works, satellite data analyses typically encompassed the following elements: land classification/identification of peatlands, changes in water conditions in peatlands, monitoring of peatland state, peatland vegetation mapping, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and the estimation of carbon resources in peatlands. The most frequently employed research methods, on the other hand, included: vegetation indices, soil moisture indices, water indices, supervised classification and machine learning. Remote sensing data combined with field research is deemed helpful for peatland monitoring and multi-proxy studies, and they may offer new perspectives on research at a regional level.

TI  - The University of Arizona's Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS): lessons learned after 10 years in operation at Railroad Valley, Nevada
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) was developed by the Remote Sensing Group of the Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona in the early 2000s. During the prototyping phase, RadCaTS was used to supplement the in situ data that were routinely collected by on-site personnel using the traditional reflectance-based approach. A data processing methodology was developed, tested, and compared to the reflectance-based results during this stage. The experience gained in this process resulted in the development of radiometrically-stable, all-weather, groundviewing radiometers (GVRs), the first of which were deployed in 2012. Additional upgrades over the past ten years have included a satellite uplink station, upgraded Cimel CE-318T solar-lunar photometer, and a GVR with linear motion. This work provides an overview of RadCaTS, describes the lessons learned during the past ten years of operation, and also a summary of the radiometric calibration and validation results for such sensors as Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 and 9 OLI, Terra and Aqua MODIS, SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS, Sentinel-2A and -2B MSI, and GOES-16 and -17 ABI.

TI  - Occurrence of Histamine Toxicity and Metal and Mineral Contaminants in Invasive Lionfish <i>(Pterois volitans)</i> in Grenada, West Indies
T2  - CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Targeted fishing of invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) in the Caribbean creates an opportunity to monitor lionfish for food safety and to examine their utility as environmental sentinel species. The goals of this study were to assess P. volitans for histamine toxicity (scombroid poisoning) and to quantify mineral and heavy metal contaminants in lionfish in Grenada, West Indies. Histamine concentrations in lionfish muscle significantly increased after heat stress but remained below maximum allowable concentrations for consumption. Mineral and heavy metal concentrations were tested in muscle and liver from lionfish from two separate reef systems using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Total arsenic levels in liver were significantly higher in fish sampled from Boss's Reef than those from Halifax Harbor, but they were not interpreted as clinically significant. Lead, mercury, cadmium, copper, molybdenum, and cobalt were below the detectable limit of the analyzer. Thallium, selenium, iron, zinc, and manganese were detected in muscle and/or liver tissue at expected concentrations. Lionfish represent a low risk for histamine toxicity and have not bioaccumulated significant heavy metals in Grenada to pose a food safety risk. The higher arsenic concentrations in Boss's Reef suggest that the location should be monitored and studied in the future. The potential for lionfish to act as bioindicators for heavy metals is uncertain and needs further validation.

TI  - On the Efficacy of Compact Radar Transponders for InSAR Geodesy: Results of Multiyear Field Tests
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact and low-cost radar transponders are an attractive alternative to corner reflectors (CRs) for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation monitoring, datum connection, and geodetic data integration. Recently, such transponders have become commercially available for C-band sensors, which poses relevant questions on their characteristics in terms of radiometric, geometric, and phase stability. Especially for extended time series and for high-precision geodetic applications, the impact of secular or seasonal effects, such as variations in temperature and humidity, has yet to be proven. In this article, we address these challenges using a multitude of short baseline experiments with four transponders and six CRs deployed at test sites in The Netherlands and Slovakia. Combined together, we analyzed 980 transponder measurements in Sentinel-1 time series to a maximum extent of 21 months. We find an average radar cross section (RCS) of over 42 dBm(2) within a range of up to 15 degrees of elevation misalignment, which is comparable to a triangular trihedral CR with a leg length of 2.0 m. Its RCS shows the temporal variations of 0.3-0.7 dBm(2) (standard deviation), which is partially correlated with surface temperature changes. The precision of the InSAR phase double differences over short baselines between a transponder and a stable reference CRs is found to be 0.5-1.2 mm (one sigma). We observe a correlation with surface temperature, leading to seasonal variations of up to +/- 3 mm, which should be modeled and corrected for in high-precision InSAR applications. For precise SAR positioning, we observe antenna-specific constant internal electronic delays of 1.2-2.1 m in slant range, i.e., within the range resolution of the Sentinel-1 interferometric wide (IW) product, with a temporal variability of less than 20 cm. Comparing similar transponders from the same series, we observe distinct differences in performance. Our main conclusion is that these characteristics are favorable for a wide range of geodetic applications. For particular demanding applications, individual calibration of single devices is strongly recommended.

TI  - Urban Change Detection from VHR Images via Deep-Features Exploitation

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th International Congress on Information and Communication Technology (ICICT)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Land cover change detection from remote sensing data is a crucial step not only in the periodic environmental monitoring but also in the management of emergencies. In particular, the availability of Very High Resolution (VHR) images enables a detailed monitoring on urban, regional or larger scale. Together with data, new methodologies able to extract useful information from them are needed. In the present work, a transfer learning technique is presented to produce change detection maps from VHR images. It is based on the exploitation of opportune deep-features computed by using some pre-trained convolutional layers of AlexNet. The proposed methodology has been tested on a data set composed of two VHR images, acquired on the same urban area in July 2015 and July 2017, respectively. The experimental results show that it is able to efficiently detect changes due to the construction of new buildings, to variation in roof materials or to vegetation cut that has made visible the underlying non-vegetated areas. Moreover, it is robust with respect to false positive because changes due to different occupation of parking areas or due to building shadows are not detected.

AB  - Telecommunications (TLC), Navigation (NAV) and Earth Observation (EO) represent the space sectors with the strongest growth, outstanding to the important spread of applications and services associated to them.Space borne data generate information with unique added value in the context of Earth's surveillance, geohazards mapping and infrastructure monitoring. Furthermore, the integrated implementation of satellite based services with other multi-source and multi-resolution technologies, including ground-based, aerial and non-destructive sensors, appears to become a crucial step for public and managing bodies in developing tools to assess actual state of civil engineering structures. Therefore, the Italian Space Agency has recently planned specific investments aimed at guaranteeing and improving real-time services, contributing to economic, scientific, technological and sustainable growth of our country.In this context, this work summarizes first outcomes of an ASI's initiative focused on opportunities for the community operating in the sector of national infrastructures, offered by current supply chain of space systems, services and applications. Scope of this work is to present the main outputs and analyze them, to identify several potential R&D topics related to EO/NAV/TLC applications able to trigger a significant advance to support plan, design, construct and manage civil infrastructures at the network-scale level.In the framework of ASI's initiative, administrative authorities and national managers of transport infrastructures were called to present needs and requirements, as well as several on-going research activities and business existing services were considered. Status-of-the-art and gaps are useful to identify requirements of future space infrastructures and services, aimed to effectively support critical infrastructure assets management.

TI  - Assessing and managing the rotating shiftwork risk in 24-hours hospital wards: An empirical multicenter study
T2  - WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of literature has showed the need to minimize the impact of rotating shiftwork (RS) on health of shift-healthcare workers (HCWs).OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were: 1) assessing the occupational risk associated with RS program in HCWs employed in 24 hours hospital wards 2) testing the feasibility of the questionnaire used.METHODS: The Rotating Shiftwork Questionnaire (RSQ) was implemented to assess the RS risk (RSR); the analysis was addressed to: 1) Sentinel events (SE) and 2) Risk factors (RF). The RSQ was administered to the specialist nursing coordinators in eighteen hospitals in Italy with the aim to evaluate the RSR index among nurses in 24 hours hospital wards.RESULTS: Eighteen structures participated in the multicenter study, of which 12 (66.7%) were public. Concerning the Rotating Shiftwork Risk index, there are the 78.8% of observations in the intermediate zone, with RSR scores ranging from 14.1 and 16 and in the high score area (RSR > 26) in which there are 4 observations equal to the 21.2% of the total. The multivariate analysis showed that the only significant variable associated with RF score was the macro-area (for Northern regionsbeta = -0.651; p = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: RSQ has been shown a feasible and applicable tool to analyze the RSR in healthcare sector through the detection of quantitative data involving indicators of the risk. The questionnaire allowed to identify improvement actions targeted at minimizing specific critical issues through strategic interventions focused on organizational environment.

AB  - The EO-TIME project (https://eotime.it/), funded by the ERANETMED program, addresses the efficient and sustainable use of water for food production in water-scarce environments by integrating Earth Observation, crop and soil water models and Information Technologies. EO data have already shown great potential in many irrigation pilot applications by recently EU-founded projects, providing key information to water managers such as maps of irrigated areas, maps of irrigation water requirements and evapotranspiration. The information on crop development and evapotranspiration can be used in conjunction with crop growth models such as AquaCrop by FAO, to estimate the water productivity. EO-TIME will implement and adapt existing tools in water-scarce conditions, by exploiting the full spectral capabilities of the Sentinel-2 platforms. Analyses will be carried out for distinct irrigation districts in Italy, Spain Lebanon and Jordan and results compared with ground measurements of delivered volumes for water accounting.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of aquatic macrophyte cover in a reservoir using Landsat images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of large amounts of aquatic macrophytes in reservoirs can trigger several impacts on the local ecosystem and conventional methodologies used for their monitoring only returns information from the present moment. With that in mind, this study aimed to map spatio-temporal variation of macrophyte cover using Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images between 1984-2021 at Jupia reservoir, in south east of Brazil, besides determining curves and maps of macrophyte cover permanence. The identification of these organisms in the images, and their distinction from other vegetations, was made through spectral indices (NDVI, GNDVI and GSAVI) and the determination of the characteristic range of each of these classes, which was given by probability distributions. Interannual variations were observed in the spatial arrangement of macrophytes and the area's growth trend, possibly being caused by the implantation of an upstream reservoir. Although the number of images without interference was a limitation, the construction of a historical series of macrophytes occupation and the determination of permanence curves and maps proved to be satisfactory and could help on the decision-making processes for the management of these organisms.

TI  - Understanding 34 Years of Forest Cover Dynamics across the Paraguayan Chaco: Characterizing Annual Changes and Forest Fragmentation Levels between 1987 and 2020
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 40 years, Paraguay has lost the majority of its natural forest cover, thus becoming one of the countries with the highest deforestation rates in the world. The rapid expansion of the agricultural frontier, cattle ranching, and illegal logging between 1987 and 2012 resulted in the loss of 27% of original forest cover, equivalent to almost 44,000 km(2). Within this context, the present research provides the first yearly analysis of forest cover change in the Paraguayan Chaco between the years 1987 and 2020. Remote sensing data obtained from Landsat images were applied to derive annual forest cover masks and deforestation rates over 34 years. Part of this study is a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of protected areas, as well as an analysis of the degree of fragmentation of the forest. All classification results obtained accuracies above 80% and revealed a total forest cover loss of approximately 64,700 km(2). Forest clearing within protected areas was not frequent; however, some natural reserves presented losses of up to 25% of their forest cover. Through the consideration of several landscape metrics, this study reveals an onward fragmentation of forest cover, which endangers the natural habitat of numerous species.

AB  - Feature extraction techniques play an essential role in classifying and recognizing targets in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This article proposes a hybrid feature extraction technique based on convolutional neural networks and principal component analysis. The proposed method is used to extract features of oil rigs and ships in C-band synthetic aperture radar polarimetric images obtained with the Sentinel-1 satellite system. The extracted features are used as input in the logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) classification algorithms. Furthermore, the statistical tests of Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were considered to show that the proposed extraction algorithm has a significant impact on the performance of the classifiers.

AB  - This article presents a land use and land cover (LULC) classification map using Random Forest algorithm in the Sao Paulo State (Brazil), and an assessment of burned areas using two products (MCD64A1 and MapBiomas Fire). The method uses Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) time series images from January to December of 2020. We performed the classification class by class considering: water, urban area, forest formation, sugarcane, agriculture, forest plantation and pasture. For each class, we used different spectral bands and image fraction according to the best response for the class. For 2020, the top three areas mapped in Sao Paulo State were pasture (40.49%), sugarcane (24.74%) and forest formation (20.60%). Comparing the two burned area products, MCD64A1 mapped more burned areas as it uses MODIS images combined with 1 km active fire observations with higher temporal resolution than MapBiomas Fire. About 60% of the burned areas mapped in 2020 occurred in the sugarcane class. The results show the importance of land use and land cover classification for better understanding fire-prone classes given the spatial distribution. It turns as an environmental tool for environmental strategies of planning and monitoring burned area assessment over regional scales.

AB  - The Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) has passed its early operation phase, with the current performance evaluation. In this study, we provide results update on RCM performance for selected SAR applications. The RCM was designed to address three core applications-disaster management, maritime surveillance, and ecosystem monitoring. Our study shows a promising level of agreement between RCM and RADARSAT-2 performance in flood mapping using dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data over Red River, Manitoba. Visual analysis of coincident RCM compact polarimetric and RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized HH-HV SAR imagery over the Resolute Passage, Canadian Central Arctic, highlighted an improved contrast between sea ice classes in dry ice winter conditions. Object-oriented classification of a wetland area in Newfoundland and Labrador by fusion of RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery revealed promising classification results, with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) has passed its early operation phase with the performance evaluation being currently active. This evaluation aims to confirm that the innovative design of the mission's synthetic aperture radar (SAR) meets the expectations of intended users. In this study, we provide an overview of initial results obtained for three high-priority applications; flood mapping, sea ice analysis, and wetland classification. In our study, the focus is on results obtained using not only linear polarization, but also the adopted Compact Polarimetric (CP) architecture in RCM. Our study shows a promising level of agreement between RCM and RADARSAT-2 performance in flood mapping using dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data over Red River, Manitoba, suggesting smooth continuity between the two satellite missions for operational flood mapping. Visual analysis of coincident RCM CP and RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized HH-HV SAR imagery over the Resolute Passage, Canadian Central Arctic, highlighted an improved contrast between sea ice classes in dry ice winter conditions. A statistical analysis using selected sea ice samples confirmed the increased contrast between thin and both rough and deformed ice in CP SAR. This finding is expected to enhance Canadian Ice Service's (CIS) operational visual analysis of sea ice in RCM SAR imagery for ice chart production. Object-oriented classification of a wetland area in Newfoundland and Labrador by fusion of RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery revealed promising classification results, with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87. Marsh presented the highest user's and producer's accuracies (87.77% and 82.08%, respectively) compared to fog, fen, and swamp.

AB  - This article explores the perception of Joseon in Chinese novels in the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, China and Joseon could not escape from the exchange centered on poetry and literature despite the continuous exchange of literary figures. Also, because cultural exchanges were centered on the ruling class, the creative classes of Chinese novels did not have an accurate understanding of Joseon. For this reason, they had no choice but to build an image of Joseon by using the limited known superficial information about Joseon. On the other hand, the Hwa-I theoretic worldview, which can be said to be the frame of China's traditional external perception, has been positioned as a primary tool for depicting the image of Joseon in the novel.Among the four works reviewed in this article, the Joseon Dynasty appears in <Museong-hi>, <Yeoseon-oisa>, and <Yeolmichodangpilgi>. From a ceremonial point of view, these works show China's sense of superiority over Joseon, and, like Balhae, which appeared in <I-jeokseon chuicho hyukmanseo>, places Joseon amid a gang of I, the outlanders. By limiting the reality of Joseon as a tribute state and presenting an exclusive perspective on Koreans in the narrative, we can see the limits of the cultural circumstance of the 17∼18c Chinese novel, which rejected cultural heterogeneity.This novel tendency in 17∼18c placed Joseon in the worldview of Hwa-I theory, independent of the exchange relationship between the Qing Dynasty and Joseon of the time, and created Joseon as a fantastic space. Despite the cultural exchanges between the Joseon and Qing dynasties, it seems that these exchanges did not develop into a social discourse that led to solidarity in East Asia.

TI  - wri/carbon-budget: Annual tree cover loss update 2001-2021
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - This version of the model is updated to run through 2021 (2001-20201. Updates involved in this are: new tree cover loss (TCL) data from the GLAD Lab at the University of Maryland (2001-2021), an updated drivers of tree cover loss model (same methods as Curtis et al. 2018 Science, but with TCL through 2021), and updated burned area data from MODIS collection 6. Beyond these updated inputs, the model is almost identical. A few other improvements that do not affect the model methods or results are included in this release: Memory tracking has been added. Added a script in analyses that will download all tiles for a certain location and build pyramids for them (e.g., all 00N_000E, all 10S_100E). This can help with QC. Docker is more able to do the plantation processing step, although I still haven't tried fully processing plantations in Docker. Updated readme. Copyright: Open Access

TI  - Detection and Interpretation of Change in Registered Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - IMAGE PROCESSING ON LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of satellite images are now massively available thanks to the existence of several constellations of recurrent satellites. We propose a method for detecting and measuring the duration of changes on such series. This approach is intended to be generic and independent of the type of satellite used, whether band limited or multispectral. It is based on a global analysis of the sequence. The statistical detection method is applied to a residual sequence computed from backward and forward novelty filters applied to all images in the series. Significant changes are computed with a guarantee on their number of false alarms (NFA). To establish the efficiency of the method, we have created an open database of 28 sequences of 20 images acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellite, in different regions of the world. We obtain satisfactory results, which are consistent with the visual observations.

TI  - RANDOM FOREST FOR CLASSIFYING AND MONITORING 50 YEARS OF VEGETATION DYNAMICS IN THREE DESERT CITIES OF THE UAE
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - The United Arab Emirates (UAE), a dryland country, has since its independence, emphasized on giant greening projects. Monitoring the trend of greening progress in the UAE has gained importance for environmental management and carbon footprint monitoring. Hence, this study created and analysed a time-series (TS) vegetation map to track and analyse vegetation dynamics over an extended period of fifty years. Study area included three selected desert cities of the UAE, Abu Dhabi (AD) capital city, Dubai city and Al Ain city. Random Forest algorithm was applied on Landsat multi-temporal images from 1972 until 2021 for classifying and monitoring the vegetation dynamics and change trajectories. Four vegetation subclasses (coastal/wetland vegetation, urban vegetation, farms/crop fields, and natural/artificial forests), were assessed then grouped and mapped as one vegetation class. With the adopted approach, we achieved overall classification accuracy ranging from 86% to 94%, with kappa coefficients ranging from 0.7200 to 0.8800. Current study showed that the vegetation cover extent in the UAE was at a constant growth for the past five decades from only 1,231.1 ha in 1972 to 23,176.46 ha in 2021, 19 times folds. Furthermore, it showed that desert cities tend to increase their vegetation cover while continuing their steady urban growth. The other drivers found include demographic increase and governmental policies (granting farms to locals and environmental protection laws). Finally, the approach implemented in this research can effectively and reliably be used in other urban centres for future monitoring and management of the vegetation cover status in the country.

TI  - Seasonal Changes of Glacier Lakes in Tibetan Plateau Revealed by Multipolarization SAR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, monitoring glacial lakes is of great significance for revealing climate change and mitigating glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Multitemporal mapping of glacier lakes through optical satellite remote-sensing imageries can only provide us comparative analysis of glacier lake changes during long time intervals. In recent years, the rapid development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has made it possible to observe seasonal changes of glacial lakes. This letter proposed a polarization enhancement-based maximum interclass variance (PE-MIV) method to accurately and automatically mapping the seasonal cycles of glacial lakes based on multipolarization SAR data. Taking the Gongcuo and Langcuo glacial lakes in Laigu village, Tibetan Plateau, as examples, based on 113 Sentinel-1 SAR imageries covering 2017 to 2020 with a 12-day revisiting time, the seasonal boundary changes of both lakes were extracted automatically with a relative accuracy of 93.59%. The seasonal variations of glacial lake area are closely related to temperature and precipitation. This letter demonstrated that the satellite SAR (short revisiting time, multipolarization, etc.) is an effective tool to monitor areal changes of glacier lakes, which can be widely applied in detecting glacier lakes, GLOFs, and their response to climate change.

TI  - Applicability Analysis of Potential Landslide Identification by InSAR in Alpine-Canyon Terrain-Case Study on Yalong River
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides occur frequently in the western mountainous areas of China, causing huge losses every year. InSAR technology can efficiently and accurately identify potential landslides and is a powerful tool for landslide hazards mitigation. However, the successful application of InSAR technology is limited by several factors, such as geometric distortion and dense vegetation, especially in the area with alpine-canyon terrain. This study investigates the applicability of InSAR observations in identifying potential landslides of the middle section of the Yalong River, which is a typical alpine-canyon terrain area. Using time-series InSAR Sentinel-1 datasets, we detect six potential landslides, which are verified and analyzed by using optical remote sensing images. Then, the applicability analysis is performed considering geometric distortion and band suitability. The results reveal that combining ascending and descending data can increase the detectable area (not in the geometric distortion) from 70% to 92.9%. The comparison of the performance of C-band and L-band data in identifying potential landslides shows that the latter is able to detect potential landslides with high vegetation coverage but it may miss the area with slight displacement. This study demonstrates the use of InSAR for potential landslide identification in alpine-canyon terrain areas and reveals its applicability, which provides a deep understanding of SAR data selection and would play an important role in the InSAR-based landslide geohazard mitigation application.

TI  - MSTCGAN: Multiscale Time Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Long-Term Satellite Image Sequence Prediction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image sequence prediction is a crucial and challenging task. Previous studies leverage optical flow methods or existing deep learning methods on spatial-temporal sequence models for the task. However, they suffer from either oversimplified model assumptions or blurry predictions and sequential error accumulation issue, for a long-term forecast requirement. In this article, we propose a novel multiscale time conditional generative adversarial network (MSTCGAN). To address the sequential error accumulation issue, MSTCGAN adopts a parallel prediction framework to produce the future image sequences by a one-hot time condition input. In addition, a powerful multiscale generator is designed with the multihead axial attention, which helps to carefully preserve the fine-grained details for appearance consistency. Moreover, we develop a temporal discriminator to address the blurry issue and maintain the motion consistency in prediction. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the FengYun-4A satellite dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - DISCOVERING NOVEL CATEGORIES IN SAR IMAGES IN OPEN SET CONDITIONS

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - In this paper, we deal with the issue of discovering data of novel categories for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images under open-set conditions. The traditional SAR image classification methods are trained under the closed-set setting where all categories in testing data are seen in training data. It does not always meet the requirements of the real SAR imagery interpretation applications. With a labelled SAR image dataset, we propose a multi-stage approach to effectively pick out images belonging to new classes in another unlabelled dataset and then cluster them into correct number of novel categories. To do so, our pipeline is composed of three major steps: (1) train a powerful feature extractor leveraging both the labelled and unlabelled dataset by semi-supervised inference; (2) identify the unknown data by openset detection; (3) cluster these unknown data based on the features generated by the extractor to discover novel categories. The proposed method is validated on a Sentinel-1 SAR image dataset OpenSARUrban [1].

AB  - Daichi Wada draws on Russian, Chinese, and Japanese sources to analyse the Thirteenth Dalai Lama's diplomatic activities during his sojourn in Khalkha, Qinghai, and Mount Wutai (1904-1909). Daichi demonstrates how the Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts manifested both traditional and modern aspects that were deployed as appropriate, and how his worldview was enhanced by his travels. The author particularly focuses on the Thirteenth Dalai Lama's relationship with the Buryat Buddhist community, which in some aspects represented Russian interests but also held traditional ties with the Tibetan Buddhist centre. The support he gained among the Buryats helped him survive in a dangerous situation as not only a ruler of Tibet but also as the highest authority over Tibetan Buddhists.

CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Forest plantations play an important role ecologically, contribute to carbon sequestration and support billions of dollars of economic activity each year through sustainable forest management and forest sector value chains. As the global demand for forest products and services increases, the marketplace is seeking more reliable data on forest plantations. Remote sensing technologies allied with machine learning, and most recently deep learning techniques, provide valuable data for inventorying forest plantations and related valuation products. In this work, deep semantic segmentation with U-net architecture was used to detect forest plantation areas using Sentinel-2 and CBERS-4A images of different areas of Brazil. First, the U-net models were built from an area of the Centre-East of Parana State, and then the best models were tested in 3 new areas that present different characteristics. The U-net models built with Sentinel-2 images achieved promising results for areas similar to the ones used in the training set, with F1-score ranging from 0.9171 to 0.9499 and with Kappa values between 0.8712 to 0.9272, demonstrating the feasibility of deep semantic segmentation to detect forest plantations.

T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal reemission affects satellite orbits when a recoil force results from the emission of radiation from the satellite surface. In this study, the analysis of the thermal reemission force on the satellite is made separately, that is, when the satellite (CBERS 04A's main body and the solar panels) are hit by the sunlight and when the satellite is into the shadow. Thus, it is presented an expression in an exponential form in order to explain the behavior of the perturbation due to thermal reemission on the panels when they are inside the Earth's shadow. Both the time spent into the shadow and the relaxation time of the solar panels allowed an analysis of the behavior of the disturbing acceleration and of the orbital elements, during cooling and heating processes. The results presented in this study are promising in terms of practical applications.

TI  - Farmers' perceptions and spatial statistical modeling of most systematic LULC transitions: Drivers and livelihood implications in Awash Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - LULC studies have produced many methodological approaches that quantify and describe LULC change patterns and drivers. This study was conducted to quantify the major LULC transition and its drivers through the combination of a spatial statistical model with surveying the local understanding of possible drivers of LULC changes driving forces in the Awash-Awash River Sub Basin. Landsat data from 1986 to 2018 were analyzed to understand the various magnitudes of LULC transitions. The study revealed that the LULC in the sub-basin is under a considerable change in pattern, structure, and extent. The amount of LULC that experienced loss and gains over the period indicates that the gains throughout a sub-basin's bare land, cultivated land, and water bodies are related to the loss in shrub and bushland, forest, and woodland. The study revealed that about 52% of the area experienced different forms of LULC transition and the remaining 48% of the area was persistent. The transition from shrub and bushland to cultivated land was identified as one of the strong signals of LULC transition in the sub-basin. The spatial explicit regression model result indicated that drivers such as elevation, the cosine of aspect, and distance to major river were significantly and positively associated with the transition from shrub and bushland to cultivated land. While, variables like slope, sine of aspect, distance to town center, major road were negatively associated with this particular LULC transition. The socio-economic survey result showed that growth in population, cultivated land expansion, deforestation and overgrazing, urbanization, infrastructure expansion, and government laws and regulations were perceived as drivers of LULC change in the study area. Therefore, it would be vital to implement cohesive and viable land use planning, that can considerably contribute to the country's broad economic development.

TI  - Surface ruptures and land deformation from the 21 June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2022 Afghanistan earthquake occurred at the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan at 20:54:36 (UTC) on June 21, 2022. According to the USGS, the earthquake caused vibrations with a magnitude of 5.9, a hypocenter located at a depth of 10 km, and an epicenter at 33,092 degrees N, 69,514 degrees E. According to European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, this event resulted in disaster for human beings 1039 people died, 2949 people were injured, and damaged to homes and infrastructures of 4500 houses were partially or fully destroyed across Paktika and Khost provinces. It is necessary to improve the knowledge of this phenomenon. On the one hand, it is essential to quickly determine the extent of the affected area to provide timely relief services.On the other hand, it is necessary to determine the deformation characteristics of the fractured zone caused by earthquakes to minimize future damages. Conventional DInSAR technique applied to two images captured on June 18, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively, before and after the earthquake event shows the fractured zone with a maximum displacement of 78.4 cm, which locates on the west side of the previously identified northeast-southwest fault. The location of this zone is 15 km in the southward direction of the earthquake epicenter. The interferometric fringes show that a large area to the East of the study area is displaced in comparison to the original position. However, its Northwest region, which corresponds to the Paleogene formations, is much less affected by earthquakes. The earthquake occurred along a left lateral strike-slip fault in the plate boundary between India and Eurasia plates at the Northwestern margin of the collision.

AB  - Satellite imagery enables spatially-temporally continuous monitoring and understanding of global environmental factors for a range of applications. This data, however, often suffers from gaps in retrieval from sensor malfunction or atmospheric interference, particularly dense clouds that obscure parts or all of an area. For dynamic datasets such as the MCD19A2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) dataset, gap filling is especially challenging. The difficulty lies in the often large, continuous blocks of cloudy pixels with missing data that limit the ability of spatial filling and the daily fluctuation in features such as AOD that incur high difficulty in gap filling from temporal trends. In this study, we propose a spatio-temporal long short-term memory (LSTM) convolutional autoencoder method that effectively reconstructs missing data resulting from thick cloud interference for MODIS AOD data. The proposed method outperforms previous methods of reconstructing data lost to thick cloud interference in AOD retrievals with a generalized network achieving a weighted average PSNR, SSIM, and R-2 of 47.2, 0.992, and 0.941, respectively, between original, cloud-free days and those same days masked with simulated thick cloud interference without the need for additional covariates.

TI  - Movement as a Constant? Envisioning a Migration-Centered Worldview of Human History
T2  - HOMO MIGRANS: Modeling Mobility and Migration in Human History
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Migration is, paradoxically, one of the great constants throughout human history: our story is one of continuous movement and exchange, despite our attempts to draw neat geographical and conceptual boundaries around particular groups and regions past and present. This emerging axiom has come about via several means: fast developing methodologies such as aDNA and isotope analyses have truly changed the very questions that we can ask about our data. Combined with new sociohistorical models of the ancient world, these integrated approaches push for a migration-centered view of human history, one that sees mobility and migration as fundamental, constant features of human development and adaptation over the long term. This model, while releasing us from past paradigms that used migration almost solely as an explanation for cultural change, presents new challenges to archaeologists, historians, anthropologists, and geneticists, not least those that involve teasing out the entangled causes, processes, and consequences of human movement to build broader theoretical paradigms. This introductory paper will present the objectives of the volume against archaeology's fraught history with migration as an analytical concept as well as our modern entanglements with migration. It lays the groundwork for the subsequent papers in this volume by highlighting the opportunities and challenges of a migration-centered paradigm of human history, and the promises of integrative, interdisciplinary, theoretically informed, and multiscalar research.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer to reduce surgical morbidity: always, sometimes, or never
T2  - MENOPAUSE REVIEW-PRZEGLAD MENOPAUZALNY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Surgical staging of nodal status is of utmost significance to determine the stage of endo-metrial cancer and construct a targeted treatment plan. Systematic lymphadenectomy has for years been the procedure of choice for staging purposes, enabling thorough assessment of lymph nodes. Nevertheless, it is associated with increased morbidity and severe postoperative complications. In an attempt to avoid the disadvantages of lymphadenectomy, the use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been examined as an alternative staging procedure.The purpose of the present review is to summarize and provide up-to-date evidence about the role of SLN biopsy in the staging and management of endometrial cancer cases in the terms of optimal technique, efficacy, safety, and postoperative morbidity, as an alternative approach to regional lymphadenectomy.Material and methods: A thorough literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and SCOPUS to identify recent primary research and previous review articles that explore the use of SLN mapping as a staging procedure in patients with endometrial cancer.Results: There is increasing evidence that SLN mapping is efficient in identifying metastatic nodal dis-ease without compromising oncological safety, achieving comparable or even superior detection rates to those of lymphadenectomy, when optimal technique and careful intraoperative nodal assessment are applied.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node mapping can safely replace lymphadenectomy as an acceptable alternative staging method for endometrial cancer; however, future research might further strengthen this suggestion by resolving potential areas of doubt and debate, especially for high-risk endometrial cancer cases.

TI  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OF TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING BASED ON REMOTE SENSING DATA br
T2  - RADIO ELECTRONICS COMPUTER SCIENCE CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. In the light of current road network monitoring practices, this study aims to explore the capability of remote sensing technologies to solve the problems of increasing the objectivity of preliminary evaluations of the condition of the infrastructure as a whole. The object of the study was to process the monitoring of transport infrastructure (TI) to find ways to improve it in the imple-mentation of development projects. Objective. The goal of the work is to increase objectivity of decision-making on the evaluation, reconstruction, development of the transport network structure due to the visual presentation and disclosure of open data for monitoring the transport value.Method. Existing approaches to TI monitoring and evaluating its condition are analyzed. The identified shortcomings, as well as the development of remote sensing technologies, open up prospects for the use of remote sensing data in the TI monitoring process. A set-theoretic model of the monitoring process information flows is proposed, the consistent refinement of the elements of which made it possible to develop information technology (IT). Formation of a set of input and output parameters of IT, the set of its opera-tions, their representation with IDEFX-models set explains how a set of heterogeneous (graphic, text, digital, cartographic, etc.) data about TI elements coming from different sources are processed and presented to support decision-making on the survey of existing infrastructure and its improvement. The developed IT makes it possible to obtain complex indicators for analyzing the TI of a par-ticular area, to solve the problems of inventorying objects, TI and its elements modeling, taking into account the physical and geo-graphical location, which makes it possible to consider it as an auxiliary tool that complements existing methods of TI monitoring. Results. The developed IT was studied in solving the problem of monitoring the TI section of the Kharkiv region using satellite imagery of medium (Sentinel-2) and high (SuperView-1) resolution and the results of laser survey of the road bridge across the river Mzha (as an element of infrastructure). Conclusions. The conducted experiments confirmed the operability of the proposed information technology and showed expedi-ency of its practical use in solving the problems of obtaining generalizing characteristics of the infrastructure, inventory of TI objects and their modeling. This opens up opportunities for substantiating project decisions for the reconstruction of the transport network and planning procedures for examining its condition. Prospects for further research may include: creating reference models of TI objects, expanding the table of decryption signs of road transport infrastructure objects, integrating remote data, survey results of TI sections and engineering surveys of objects to obtain evaluations of the condition of TI in general

TI  - THE ANTI-RELIGIOUS POLICY OF THE SOVIET STATE IN TRANSCARPATHIA IN 1953
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to analyze the religious policy of the Soviet authorities in Transcarpathia concerning confessions in the region during the final stage of Stalinism and trace the beginnings of the intensification of the anti-religious campaign in 1953. To analyze the activities of the republican and regional commissioners (in the affairs of religious cults and in the affairs of the Ruska Orthodox Church) in implementing the religious policy of the Soviet Union center, the reaction of certain denominations leaders to the authorities actions, (non)reception of atheistic propaganda and agitation by the population. The research methodology is based on the principles of historicism, systematicity, scientificity, verification, authorial objectivity, as well as the use of general scientific (analysis, synthesis, generalization), special and historical (historical and typological, historical and systemic) methods. The scientific novelty consists in the attempt to analyze one of the most difficult stages of the state-church relations of the Soviet period in the multi-confessional Transcarpathia. The Conclusions. The religious situation in Transcarpathia was difficult during the final period of Stalinism. In 1949, the Greek Catholic Church, one of the largest denominations in the region, was liquidated by the Soviet state by force. Part of the Greek-Catholic priesthood "reunited" with the Orthodox Church, part officially switched to civilian work, continuing to perform religious rites confidentially. More than a hundred priests were sentenced to long prison terms. Having resolved the issue with the Greek Catholic Church, the authorities tried to establish a complete control over the remaining denominations. At that time, in particular, the largest was the Orthodox denomination, which in 1945 left the Serbian Orthodox Church and came under the jurisdiction of the Ruska Orthodox Church. The Roman Catholic Church also maintained a fairly strong position. At that time the main task of the communist government was to "reduce the religiosity of the population". Already at the end of 1952 and at the beginning of 1953, the authorities took active actions. At the regional, district, and local levels, lecturers conducted hundreds of lectures on natural and scientific, anti-religious topics, showed films, and held explanatory talks. The first anti-religious publications appeared in the regional press. It should be noted that there was some progress in anti-religious work (going to work during religious holidays, 100% school attendance), however, this campaign did not achieve the predicted results. The Bolsheviks never succeeded in transforming the worldview of the population of Transcarpathia into a purely atheistic one.

TI  - THE GENRE OF THE STORY-PARABLES IN PROSE BY V.I. DAL
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article substantiates the definition of the genre of Dal's stories and novellas as a story-parable that carries a lesson about the laws of human life. In Dal's prose emphasis is not so much on the exact external "physiognomy" of human types, but on the deep moral and existential content that is revealed to the reader with their help. The genre specificity of Dal's prose reflects his Christian worldview, which is similar to the popular one and enriched with reflection and a special artistic gift of the writer. The author of the article demonstrates the reason for the inadequate perception of Dal's prose in N. Chernyshevsky's critical assessments. In addition, he refutes the frequent statement that Dal's "Pictures from Russian Life," which were to allegedly cover the entire national life, were scattered into fragmented sketches and were not permeated with a single thought. In fact, these "pictures," although extremely diverse in their subject matter due to the diversity of life itself, are internally clearly united in their general meaning. Dal selected bright stories, generally reflecting the general moral life of the Russian people from the most positive side. Each of these stories carries a deep Christian meaning: in each of them there is a person overcoming or paying his sin, as well as repentance and a general transfiguration and renewal of the soul. Sometimes he shows also the heroic features of the national character. In Dal's stories-parables an indication of the inner complexity, the dialectic of life, always full of internal contradictions and incomprehensibility, often appears. Dal was the author who accepted the need for updating the genre of the parable. This need was due to the fact that the reader wanted to preserve the genres of traditional culture (fairy tales and parables), but in a new literary form.

AB  - Onboard navigation is an essential task to ensure satellite autonomy. Especially for real-time operations, highaccuracy satellite positioning is required. In this context, the Sentinel-6A (S6A) dual-constellation GPS and Galileo measurements are exploited to assess the Precise Onboard Orbit Determination (P2OD) performance achievable using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm with a reduced-dynamics approach. Commonly, high-accuracy GNSS orbits and clocks are needed to obtain a high-quality Precise Orbit Determination (POD) solution. However, such products are not available onboard, where only broadcast navigation data can be retrieved. Here, the results employing different qualities of GNSS orbits and clocks are presented, considering five consecutive days of S6A GNSS measurements. Furthermore, the impact of using broadcast ephemerides is investigated along with adopting either a single- or dual-constellation configuration. Results indicate that the use of Galileo dual-frequency measurements and broadcast ephemerides leads to decimeter-level orbital accuracy, showing, in a dual-constellation configuration, a 11 cm 3D RMS position difference w.r.t. precise reference orbits. This marks an improvement of a factor larger than two w.r.t. using GPS-only broadcast ephemerides, and enables a new level of accuracy for P2OD.

TI  - hr Popular superstitious beliefs of the Tuvans: Typology and features
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines such a small genre of Tuvan folklore as superstitious beliefs (demdek) and provides insight into their linguistic and culturological role for revealing universal and ethnic components in the language worldview of the Tuvans. We used information recorded from elderly Tuvans and translated it into Russian as the source data for the research. We also turned to the publication by M. B. Kenin-Lopsan. It was published in Russian, so we made a reverse translation of the given folk beliefs into the Tuvan language. Relying on classifications developed in Russian folklore studies, the authors have divided the folk superstitious beliefs of the Tuvans into the following types: predictive, day-to-day, relating to dreams, aesthetic, hygienic superstitions, as well as examples of omens associated with celestial bodies. Each of these types of folk beliefs is presented in the examples (with translations). There is also a division into three main groups: predictive, day-to-day, and those related to dreams. The most common group is predictive superstitions. Popular beliefs are constructed according to the formula "forecast - prediction" and relate to certain unambiguous facts.

TI  - A Multilayered Adaptive Recurrent Incremental Network Model for Heterogeneity-Aware Prediction of Derived Remote Sensing Image Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - <italic>Catastrophic forgetting</italic> of previously acquired knowledge is a major setback suffered by the neural networks (NNs) when these are trained on tasks in sequential fashion. The NN variants, including the deep network models, as commonly used in remote sensing data prediction are also not free from this limitation. The issue becomes more prominent when the prediction is performed over data collected from spatial zones with a large degree of subregional variations or heterogeneity. In order to tackle this problem, in this article, we propose a multilayered adaptive recurrent incremental network (MARINE) model, offering a spatial heterogeneity-aware self-adaptation scheme that resolves the catastrophic forgetting issue in an autonomous manner. Typically, the proposed MARINE is equipped with an intrinsic mechanism of clustering the spatial subregions as per their heterogeneity levels and auto-constructing the recurrent network layers in an ensemble fashion so that the knowledge acquired about one group of heterogeneity level does not overwrite that acquired about other groups. With respect to spatio-temporal prediction of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series, as derived from MODIS Terra satellite remote sensing imagery, we demonstrate that our proposed MARINE achieves competitive results when compared with the state-of-the-arts. More significantly, in the presence of higher degree of spatial heterogeneity, MARINE outperforms others by better <italic>avoiding the catastrophic forgetting issue</italic>.

TI  - A Combined Approach for Monitoring Monthly Surface Water/Ice Dynamics of Lesser Slave Lake Via Earth Observation Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water/ice dynamic monitoring is crucial for many purposes, such as water resource management, agriculture, climate change, drought, and flood forecasting. New advances in remote sensing satellite data have made it possible to monitor the surface water/ice dynamics both spatially and temporally. However, there are many challenges when using these data, such as the availability of valid imagery, cloud contamination issues for Landsat-8, and sensitivity of Sentinel-1 C-band to wind speed, topography, and others. A combined methodology using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was proposed to create monthly change maps at 30-m spatial resolution for the Lesser Slave Lake in Alberta, Canada, for the period 2017-2020. The potentials of multispectral indices for Landsat-8, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and modified NDWI (MNDWI) as well as the Sentinel-1 SAR backscattering coefficients (VV-VH) and normalized difference polarized index (NDPI) for separating water/ice from the land were investigated. The results obtained from satellite data with historical discharge and water level measurements for the lake were compared. Furthermore, the results show that the MNDWI and VH are the most effective indices for creating the change maps. The overall accuracies achieved for MNDWI and VH are 92.10% and 68.86% for cold months and 99.88% and 98.49% for warm months, respectively.

T2  - FOURTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE VISION (ICMV 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Conference on Machine Vision (ICMV)
CL  - Rome, ITALY
AB  - Monitoring airport runways in panchromatic remote sensing images is helpful for both civil and strategic communities in effective utilization of the large-area acquisitions. This paper proposes a novel multimodal semantic segmentation approach for effective delineation of the runways in panchromatic remote sensing images. The proposed approach aims to learn complementary information from two modalities, namely, panchromatic image and digital elevation model (DEM) to obtain discriminative features of the runway. The fusion of image features and the corresponding terrain information is performed by stacking the image and DEM by leveraging the merits of both Transformers and U-Net architecture. We perform the experiments on Cartosat-1 panchromatic satellite images with the corresponding Cartosat-1 DEM scenes. The experimental results demonstrate a significant contribution of terrain information to the segmentation process in achieving the contours of airport runways effectively.

T2  - NOVEISHAYA ISTORIYA ROSSII-MODERN HISTORY OF RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the problem of creation and functioning in 1921-1938 of a higher education institution for immigrants from the East countries and for Eastern national minorities of the USSR: the Stalin Communist University of the Toilers of the East. Within the 100-year anniversary, the appeal to the history of the KUTV, called the "forge of personnel", becomes particularly relevant. Under the conditions of socio-economic, political, and cultural transformations in the USSR in 1920s-1930s, the issue of attracting the natives familiar with traditions and everyday life to the authorities, administration, and courts demanded an urgent solution. Based on the analysis of the latest literature and materials of the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI), the article considers the conditions of opening this educational institution. The authors pay special attention to university reorganization that happened under the influence of domestic and foreign political circumstances. The authors considered the conditions of admission to the university, the faculty, defined by the international nature of the KUTV and having the Soviet and foreign sectors. In both sectors, significant attention was paid to the disciplines forming the Marxist revolutionary worldview. Because of the problem in teaching cadets native languages at the university, the main emphasis was placed on Russian. An integral part of the curriculum was industrial practice at enterprises in Moscow and then in the regions. The foreign sector opening was prompted not only to export the revolution, but also to create, with future leaders' help, a loyal environment of the world's first socialist state. During the country's development, the emergence of new state's tasks, changes in national policy, in the system of party education led to a revision of the necessity for the KUTV. Due to the recognition of the inexpediency of its existence, the university was liquidated in 1938.

In the next two decades, the family of SAR instruments under the Copernicus umbrella will feature additional wavelength diversity, with the ROSE-L mission providing operational illumination in L-band, and will introduce with the next generation Sentinel-1 (Sentinel-1 NG) a significant step ahead in terms of imaging quality and coverage performance, while carefully guaranteeing data and service continuity with the current generation. The massive volumes of data in space, time, polarizations and frequencies are expected on one hand to significantly enhance the applications and services already in place and on the other to open the way to new mapping and monitoring solutions in land, water and cryosphere domains. This paper will address such new perspectives.

TI  - Soviet Administrator N. I. Ivanov: Tragedy of the Economic Leader of the 1920s - 1930s
T2  - NOVEISHAYA ISTORIYA ROSSII-MODERN HISTORY OF RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Using previously unpublished archival documents, this article provides one of the first studies on the biography of prominent Leningrad political and economic figure N. I. Ivanov. During War Communism and NEP he served as labor commissar for the Union of Communes of the Northern Region, headed the Department of municipal economy of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd/Leningrad Soviet, was was the second deputy chairman of the.xecutive.ommittee of the Leningrad City Soviet. In the conditions of NEP he had to make compromises with businessmen and specialists from "former people". In the "year of the great turning point", he was fired from all posts and sent to work as a mechanic at a factory. During industrialization he was forgiven and became a director of the Lenmetallurgstroy plant. In 1937 Ivanov fell victim to the "Great Terror", and was arrested and died. The article provides reasons for the repression of responsible Soviet business executives: it was found that effective administrators of the "ideologically vicious" NEP deviated from the strictly class line by necessity and were punished for this during Stalin's "revolution form above". At the same time, the factors of the deployment of massive repressive campaigns against factory directors influenced the processes of the formation of the socialist subjectivity of the builders of the new world. The article traces how in the 1930s, when propaganda extolled labor collectives as true creators of a perfect civilization, Ivanov had to deviate from the imperative principle of the collectivist worldview, and was forced to rely on the professional core of factory specialists, sometimes opposing himself to the bulk of the factory workers. This is the tragedy of the economic leader of Stalin's time.

TI  - CLASS DOMINATION IN THE ERA OF POST-CAPITALISM: Part 1. The Ethos of the Personaliat
T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the prospects for the transformation of the class structure in the era of post-capitalism. The class structure of modern Western society, so the author, ceases to correspond to Marx' ideas about the unquestioning domination of the bourgeoisie and the presence of the main antagonism between the capitalists and the working class. On the upper floors of the social hierarchy there is already the personaliat - a class consisting of people whose main resource is popularity and attention. The first part of the article explores the discursive aspect of the hegemony of the personaliat. Like any leading class, the personaliat has its own class ideology, consisting of a cult of self-expression, as well as "progressive" post-materialist values that form the core of identity politics and the basis of ecological discourses. This ideology comes into direct conflict with the realities of the "leaving" classes. In these conditions, a growing proportion of representatives of the working class and the bourgeoisie are united by conservative values and a "materialistic" worldview.

AB  - Panoptic segmentation combines instance and semantic segmentation, enabling the classification of objects and backgrounds. It is still a method little explored in the remote sensing field, mostly due to the difficulty of generating the data. Moreover, the beach areas have great interest due to many objects and elements that may guide public policies. In this regard, we propose the first study on beach areas using panoptic segmentation and the first panoptic segmentation study using multispectral data. We used the Gram-Schmidt pan-sharpening method for the multispectral bands and created a dataset with 850 samples with 128x128 dimensions in the COCO panoptic annotation format. To evaluate the dataset, the Panoptic-FPN was used with modifications in the input (changing from three to eight channels). Results show 59.43 Panoptic Quality (PQ), 77.96 Segmentation Quality (SQ), and 75.07 Recognition Quality (RQ).

AB  - Fire fighting in the Amazon region faces a wide range of challenges, such as scarce information, limited resources and access difficulty. The knowledge of spatial and temporal distributions of fires is crucial to understand their severity. To improve the efficiency of firefighting dispatching, this work developed a near real-time fire severity-level indicator using remote sensing data. It uses information from NOAA-20 and Suomi NPP satellites to monitor fire events according to the level of attention they require based on four criteria: total size, duration, expansion and intensity. The spatial scope of the indicator covers the Brazilian Amazon and Pantanal biomes. The indicator application is demonstrated in a real case study of an overflight with firefighters in the southeast of Porto Velho.

AB  - The use of as-built Building Information Models (BIM) has become increasingly commonplace. This process of creating a BIM model from point cloud data, also referred to as Scan-to-BIM, is a mostly manual task. Due to the large amount of manual work, the entire Scan-to-BIM process is time-consuming and error prone. Current research focuses on the automation of the Scan-to-BIM pipeline by applying state-of-the-art techniques on its consecutive steps including the data acquisition, data processing, data interpretation and modelling. By automating the matching and modelling of window and door objects, a considerable amount of time can be saved in the Scan-to-BIM process. This is so because each window and door instance needs to be examined by the modeller and must be adapted to the actual on-site situation. Large object libraries containing predefined window and door objects exists but the matching to the bestfit predefined object remains time consuming. The aim of this research is to examine the possibilities to speed up the modelling of window and door objects. First, a literature review discussing existing methods for window and door detection and matching is presented. Second, the acquired data is examined to explore the capabilities of capturing window and door information for different remote sensing devices. Followed by tests of some commonplace features in the use for window and door occurrence matching and clustering.

TI  - Open-Source Analysis of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Cover in Complex Waters Using High-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing: An Adaptable Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite being recognized as a key component of shallow-water ecosystems, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) remains difficult to monitor over large spatial scales. Because of SAV's structuring capabilities, high-resolution monitoring of submerged landscapes could generate highly valuable ecological data. Until now, high-resolution remote sensing of SAV has been largely limited to applications within costly image analysis software. In this paper, we propose an example of an adaptable open-sourced object-based image analysis (OBIA) workflow to generate SAV cover maps in complex aquatic environments. Using the R software, QGIS and Orfeo Toolbox, we apply radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, a de-striping correction, and a hierarchical iterative OBIA random forest classification to generate SAV cover maps based on raw DigitalGlobe multispectral imagery. The workflow is applied to images taken over two spatially complex fluvial lakes in Quebec, Canada, using Quickbird-02 and Worldview-03 satellites. Classification performance based on training sets reveals conservative SAV cover estimates with less than 10% error across all classes except for lower SAV growth forms in the most turbid waters. In light of these results, we conclude that it is possible to monitor SAV distribution using high-resolution remote sensing within an open-sourced environment with a flexible and functional workflow.

AB  - Introduction: There are ancestral care during the puerperium that remain in force, but they are opposed to those indicated by the health personnel. Objective: Understand the cultural meaning of the body, feeling and traditional care in the puerperium from the Nahuaworldview. Methods: Qualitative ethnographic research carried out in the Axtla de Terrazas indigenous community in San Luis de Potosi, Mexico, from March to July 2019. The sample was non-probabilistic for convenience, 14 postpartum women from the community participated. To collect the data, the field diary, the participant observation and the ethnographic interview with prior informed consent were used, which were then manually processed according to the thematic analysis. Results: Three cultural themes emerged: a) Affections that the "hot" body of the puerperal woman can cause, b) The feeling of the woman in the puerperium: Between pain and joy, c) Traditional care to avoid complications during the puerperium. Conclusions: There are meanings about the body, feelings and traditional care during the puerperium in the Nahua worldview. For this reason, health care must be intercultural, considering the customs of postpartum women, to avoid care that may be considered intrusive, causing a culture shock, and that they never attend their check-ups again.

TI  - Archives and ethics in literature: the case of Gaston-Paul Effa in Le Miracule de Saint-Pierre
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF FRENCH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of recent African historical novels that aim to rehabilitate their protagonists through reference to the archives as they appear implicitly, both in the paratext and in the story itself, this article offers a reading of the novel Le Miracule de Saint-Pierre by Gaston-Paul Effa (2017). This polyphonic novel traces the life of Louis-Auguste Cyparis, allegedly the only survivor of the eruption of the Montagne Pelee in 1902. In this novel, the third-person narrative of Cyparis, which unfolds in three stages (Martinique, the Barnum & Bailey circus and Panama), is interspersed by a conversation between Effa himself as a character and a reader, who could be Cyparis's great-granddaughter. The validity of written sources is therefore questioned in favour of private remembrance, transmitted from generation to generation. By analysing the thematic of meeting or appointment, this reflection will illustrate the ethical significance of the novel, by combining the approaches of Emmanuel Levinas on the encounter with the Other and of Jacques Derrida on the archive, coalescing them in a postcolonial worldview.

T2  - QUAESTIO IURIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leon Dehon, founder of the Congregation of priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, was an important character in the propagation of ideals of the Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church and the presuppositions of integral education. In this sense, his actions as a priest reflected his deep conviction in the dignity of human nature and in the rights related to the development of holistic value of individuals, thus contributing to the spread of the constitutionalist values of a social state centered on sound moral principles. Moreover, Dehon's work is seen as a sociological synthesis of the neuralgic elements that characterize the sociopolitical thinking of the Catholic Church. In this way, the social works of Leon Dehon amalgamated with his philosophy typified the true spirit of the Social Doctrine of Pope Leo XIII. In view of this, this work, based on the deductive method, aims to elucidate the existing connections between Dehon's ideals and the constitutionalist mentality of defense of social rights and the so-called "existential minimum". In conclusion, the article tried to affirm Dehon's philosophy as one of the axiological foundations of social constitutionalism, establishing, therefore, a relationship of affinity of sociopolitical thought of the Doctrine of the Catholic Church with a legal worldview of defending human dignity.

AB  - Estimating the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the Photosynthetically Available Radiation (K-PAR) allows to monitor primary production, dissolved organic matters, coastal suspended sediments and water transparency. The latter aim, especially for military purposes, may be efficiently achieved with the use of underwater gliders. The present study aims at estimating the K-PAR in the the Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic), during a sea campaign which took place in February 2021, in fairly transparent waters mainly containing non-living suspended material. The sea survey involved a SEAEXPLORER glider equiped with an ocean color radiometer. The glider measurements were in agreement with those from shipboard CTD-PAR casts (with a mean relative difference of about 11%). VIIRS L2 and MODIS L4 satellite products were validated with the glider data. Accordingly, a bias correction has been proposed for the ocean color satellite K-PAR algorithm.

CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has long been used to monitor forest harvesting with accuracies appropriate for practical mapping across a wide range of forest types by using different sensors. Unfortunately, in Italy, most of the cuts take place in winter where the cloud cover is very high, making it impossible an early detection by optical data. In this framework, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data such as Sentinel-1 (S1) allows a better land monitoring by penetrating cloud cover. In this work we tested some methods for time series breakpoint detection with the aim of mapping significant forest cover changes in 2019 over an Italian forested area. These maps can be useful tools to support the focusing of field surveys by forest police with the aim of increasing the monitorable areas and decreasing the related field survey costs. Four methods were proposed and compared based on the analysis of SAR polarimetric index time series (Cross Ratio index). In particular, adopted methods search for a breakpoint in the cross-ratio time series assuming it as moment after that forest canopy temporal behaviour significantly change. In general, high overall accuracy and user's accuracy were found for all methods while producer's accuracy and K values are lower denoting an underestimation of harvested areas by single method. Conversely, combining all methods into a final classification shows highest user's accuracy (> 0.9) in detecting forests harvestings when more than two classification methods were adopted.

TI  - Analysis of Climate Change Effects on Surface Temperature in Central-Italy Lakes Using Satellite Data Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of the impact of climate change on water bodies has been one of the most discussed open issues of recent years. The exploitation of satellite data for the monitoring of water surface temperatures, combined with ground measurements where available, has already been shown in several previous studies, but these studies mainly focused on large lakes around the world. In this work the water surface temperature characterization during the last few decades of two small-medium Italian lakes, Lake Bracciano and Lake Martignano, using satellite data is addressed. The study also takes advantage of the last space-borne platforms, such as Sentinel-3. Long time series of clear sky conditions and atmospherically calibrated (using a simplified Planck's Law-based algorithm) images were processed in order to derive the lakes surface temperature trends from 1984 to 2019. The results show an overall increase in water surface temperatures which is more evident on the smallest and shallowest of the two test sites. In particular, it was observed that, since the year 2000, the surface temperature of both lakes has risen by about 0.106 degrees C/year on average, which doubles the rate that can be retrieved by considering the whole period 1984-2019 (0.053 degrees C/year on average).

AB  - Remote sensing measurements offer great potential to quantify evapotranspiration (ET) more accurately. This work assesses several remotely-sensed ET datasets at high, medium and coarse scale through a comparison with eddy covariance (EC) measurements. In particular, daily retrievals obtained from the Sen-ET model and the ECOSTRESS ET product, both having resolutions of tens of meters, were considered. In addition, 3-km daily ET estimates derived from SEVIRI were analyzed, together with 8-day MODIS ET composites at 500-m spatial resolution. The remotely-sensed actual ET retrievals at medium and coarse scale were compared with EC observations at five forest and grassland sites over different climate zones in Italy. Additionally, for one of these sites (Monte Bondone), the high-resolution ET estimates within the EC footprint were also evaluated. Sen-ET retrievals demonstrated a remarkable ability to describe EC latent heat fluxes (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient, R, equal to 0.83, and unbiased root-mean-square-difference, ubRMSD, equal to 0.85 mm/day), and therefore great potential for producing high-resolution ET estimates, while ECOSTRESS data were less performant (e.g., R = 0.46, and ubRMSD = 1.65 mm/day). Despite the spatial differences between EC footprint size and the medium along with coarse scale of remotely-sensed datasets, the latter both showed a good agreement with the measured EC fluxes. The SEVIRI ET, in particular, proved to be significantly suitable for the ET description also at a local scale (at daily time step, average R = 0.84, and average ubRMSD = 0.83 mm/day over the study sites), despite a tendency to underestimate in-situ measurements (negative biases ranging between 0.2 and 0.85 mm/day were observed). This study contributes to the topic of evaluating specific remotely-sensed ET datasets under different conditions. The obtained results generally confirm the value of satellite-derived retrievals for ET estimate and monitoring, as well as their potential to improve ET modeling.

The Biome Cerrado Dataset (Cerra-Data) is a large database created from 150 scenes of the CBERS-4A satellite. Images were created by merging the near-infrared, green, and blue bands. Moreover, pan-sharpening was performed between all the scenes and their respective panchromatic bands, resulting in a final spatial resolution of two meters. A total of 2.5 million tiles of 256x256 pixels were derived from these scenes. From this total, 50 thousand tiles were labeled. We also conducted a few-shot learning experiment considering a training set with only 100 samples, 11 deep neural networks (DNNs), and two traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Results show that the DNN DenseNet-161 was the best model but its performance can be improved if it is used only as a feature extractor, leaving the classification task for the traditional ML algorithms. However, by decreasing the size of the training set, smarter approaches are needed. The labeled subset of CerraData as well as the source code we developed to support this study are available on-line: https://github.com/ai4luc/CerraData-code-data.

AB  - This paper determined the surface temperature in 458 km2 from Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (Sao Paulo State -Brazil) through geotechnologies and compare these estimated data with the recorded in geothermometers from two weather stations. Meteorologic, remote sensing data and two matematical model were used to achieve the proposed objective. The results showed higher values in areas with absence and low vegetation density and less accentuated in vegetated areas. In a comparative context the data showed, among other information, weak (r = 0.3) and moderate (r = 0.4) correlation coefficient between the surface temperature determined by geotechnologies and recorded through geothermometer where the afericion equipament is on material with distinct thermal property from that identified mostly in the sattelite image pixel, corresponding to the weather stations location. On the other hand, the correlation coefficient was strong (r = 0.8) and very strong (r = 0.9) between the measured and estimated values in a situation where the equipment records the surface temperature of the place with the same thermal properties as the area identified by the sensor system's spectral channel.

TI  - OPENING THE DOORS OF LEARNING: INCREASING ACCESS TO MUSIC DEGREES
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is contextualized for Music and is a response to the CHE (2013) Report that proposes a flexible curriculum structure for undergraduate degrees in South Africa, to address student under preparedness. Research states that music graduates need well developed identities in music, as well as generic, transferable skills to ensure lifelong employment and that a bachelor of music degree is best suited for this. However, in the South African context, the bachelor of music degree qualification is not accessible to the majority of prospective students as they are under prepared to study music at tertiary level. Only a minority of learners receive quality music education at school, while the majority of learners, including those from low socio-economic communities, do not receive formal music education. Under preparedness to study music, has traditionally been addressed through certificates and diploma qualifications in music. A discussion, and interpretation of the literature, has led to the researcher to develop an alternate framework to both improve student access to music degrees and manage under preparedness. The proposed approach advocates that music departments at universities adopt the framework of the national certificate vocation as an alternative to certificates and diplomas. The alternative curriculum structure for music, would be a more cost effective way to address under preparedness, improve academic success and lead to high skill levels.The study is situated in a constructivist, interpretive worldview, with a qualitative research design. Purposive sampling in the form of the choice of literature for the theoretical framework was adopted. While this theoretical study is contextualized for music, it is applicable to other fields.

TI  - c-MET Receptor-Targeted Fluorescence on the Road to Image-Guided Surgery in Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In penile squamous cell carcinoma (pSCC), primary surgery aims to obtain oncologically safe margins while minimizing mutilation. Surgical guidance provided by receptor-specific tracers could potentially improve margin detection and reduce unnecessary excision of healthy tissue. Here, we present the first results of a prospective feasibility study for real-time intraoperative visualization of pSCC using a fluorescent mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) receptor targeting tracer (EMI-137). Methods: EMI137 tracer performance was initially assessed ex vivo (n = 10) via incubation of freshly excised pSCC in a solution containing EMI137 (500 nM). The in vivo potential of c-MET targeting and intraoperative tumor visualization was assessed after intravenous administration of EMI-137 to 5 pSCC patients scheduled for surgical resection using a cyanine-5 fluorescence camera. Fluorescence imaging results were related to standard pathologic tumor evaluation and c-MET immunohistochemistry. Three of the 5 in vivo patients also underwent a sentinel node resection after local administration of the hybrid tracer indocyanine green- 99mTc-nanocolloid, which could be imaged using a near-infrared fluorescence camera. Results: No tracer-related adverse events were encountered. Both ex vivo and in vivo, EMI-137 enabled c-MET-based tumor visualization in all patients. Histopathologic analyses showed that all pSCCs expressed c-MET, with expression levels of at least 70% in 14 of 15 patients. Moreover, the highest c-MET expression levels were seen on the outside rim of the tumors, and a visual correlation was found between c-MET expression and fluorescence signal intensity. No complications were encountered when combining primary tumor targeting with lymphatic mapping. As such, simultaneous use of cyanine-5 and indocyanine green in the same patient proved to be approach.

AB  - The construction industry is still one of the least digitised sectors worldwide and digitisation in the road construction sector in particular is even more dire. To improve the efficiency of the sector, it is of the utmost importance that construction monitoring tasks, i.e. progress, quality and quantity analyses, are automated. The goal of the presented framework is the automation of the following three vital interconnected subjects: (1) The systematic capture of remote sensing data with low-cost UAVs, (2) the information extraction from survey data and (3) the interlinking and exchange of interoperable BIM data (design, survey and extracted information) using Linked Data technologies. In this paper, the needed data for proper road construction digitisation and the desired data structure is discussed. Additionally, the automation of Real Time Kinematic (RTK)-flight processing is presented. The feasibility of the proposed workflow is examined based on real-life test cases. As a consequence of automation, the homogeneity of data across projects will increase. This will form the basis for further automation in road construction.

T2  - BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to estimate the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration through remote sensing (OLI/LANDSAT-8 - LS8). During 2017 and 2018, water was collected six times from the Umari and Mendubim reservoirs, located in the semi-arid climate regions of the Brazilian Northeast area, so as to determine the Chia and TOC values. Correlation coefficients between the spectral bands of OLI/LS8 images and the Chl-a and TOC values were calculated to select the bands to be used in simple and multiple linear regressions between the reflectance values and the limnological variable values. A correlation was found between the field data and the values estimated from the combination of B4 and B5 bands for Chl-a (R-2=0.87), and B2 and B5 for TOC (R-2=0.80). A correlation was found between the data obtained in the reservoirs and recovered from the OLI/LS8 images, with correlation coefficients of 0.76 for Chl-a and 0.71 for TOC in Umari, and 0.78 for Chl-a and 0.72 for TOC in Mendubim. The models were efficient in the Chl-a and TOC estimates in the environments studies, showing the feasibility of image use in the remote monitoring of these limnological variables in reservoirs located in the semi -arid -climate regions of Brazil.

AB  - In remote sensing, the conversion of sensor recorded radiance for each pixel in a scene to surface reflectance is a first step in many diagnostic analysis tasks. This process, known as reflectance conversion, is vital in the production of accurate information for a variety of applications, one of which is precision agriculture. Several calibration methods have been explored in previous research and are widely used today, with two of these being the empirical line method (ELM) and the at-altitude radiance ratio (AARR). The AARR approach is attractive to remote sensing practitioners as it allows reflectance conversion to be carried out in real-time throughout data collection, accounting for changes in illumination conditions, which can substantially reduce collection setup and subsequent data analysis time/effort. Illumination changes during a collection greatly influence the recorded scene radiance, which can confuse subsequent analysis results. While ELM has been demonstrated to report lower error when compared to AARR, the error introduced is often times acceptable depending on the application requirements and natural variation in the reflectance of the targets of interest. An onboard, downwelling irradiance spectrometer integrated onto a small unmanned aircraft system as part of this research is utilized to characterize the expected error in generated reflectance at varying aircraft altitudes and is cross compared to the ELM approach. Although the error introduced by AARR is larger when compared to ELM, this study allows the reader to determine if the ease of collection afforded by this real-time reflectance conversion methodology produces sufficiently accurate data for their particular remote sensing application.

AB  - Lava fountains produced from explosive eruptions at Etna volcano are characterized by the development of several km high ash plumes and lava overflows from the crater rim. The formation of lava flows and tephra deposits and the dispersion of volcanic clouds have the potential to impact on population, aviation and infrastructure. For this reason, mapping and quantifying the areal extension of the products erupted is of great importance for forecasting volcanic hazards. The huge amount of multispectral satellite data provides new perspectives for the near real-time monitoring of volcanic hazards, which needs new machine learning (ML) techniques for the automatic process of data. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and satellite data have been shown can be used to track lava flows and volcanic clouds. Here, we show the potentiality of using SVM and satellite data with different spatial and temporal resolutions to fully characterize the volcanic products erupted during the lava fountain event occurred at Etna volcano on 10 February 2022. Two SVM models have been adopted using Google Earth Engine platform to map and quantify (a) the extension of the lava flows and tephra deposits, and (b) the volcanic cloud dispersed into the atmosphere. Exploiting the potentiality of machine learning and cloud computing to process satellite remote sensing data, we obtained a global quantitative analysis of products erupted during lava fountaining with a high accuracy level.

AB  - In recent years, more and more different operational scenarios make use of algorithms based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques. These scenarios also include some of the most struggling, for their very strict and rigid physical requirements, like the aerospace applications. In this context, this work wants to present a feasibility study, including a prototype with an on board Artificial Intelligence (AI) module and a realistic testing equipment. Among the possible Earth Observation (EO) applications, the detection of volcanic eruptions has been investigated with the objective to produce prompt alerts and allow immediate interventions. Before mounting the equipment on possible future satellite missions, experiments must be carried out in advance to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture. A demo setup has been designed at this end, by means of a drone equipped with a Raspberry PI for generic processing, a Movidius stick as processing unit for AI-based computation and a camera. A strip with an image from a volcanic eruption is printed and used for the demo. The prototype employs hardware components characterized by low costs, and simple to find and to use. Moreover, the dataset created and used for this work has been published on GitHub, made available to interested researchers. The results are promising and represent a boost for the use of the proposed system in future EO missions, to compose a constellation of satellites with AI on board, like the Phi-Sat-1 satellite, launched on September 2020, the first step of ESA towards this direction.

T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the comparative analysis of the interpretations of the state presented in the works of Sergei Gessen and Ivan Ilyin, two Russian philosophers of the first half of the 20th century. The article demonstrates that the similarity between these interpretations lies primarily in the rejection of legal nihilism and legal positivism. Both philosophers distanced themselves from the mechanistic view of society and the state, which is germane to classical liberalism, and defended the principle of the sovereignty of law in public life. Differences in the understanding of the essence of the state by Gessen and Ilyin are caused by the discrepancy between the initial axiological, worldview, philosophical, and methodological presumptions. Conceptually, Ilyin compares the state to an integral spiritual organism, while for Gessen the state is nothing more than the highest coordinating body in the system of public life. According to Ilyin, the state performs a dual function: it ensures the spiritual unity of the people and protects the spiritual autonomy of an individual. Gessen, for his part, sees the main task of the state in protecting the "impenetrability" of an individual and asserting her supra-legal status. The interpretation of the relationship between the state and law proposed by Ilyin is monistic: "law and order" equal to the "state law and order". Gessen's concept of "legal socialism" is pluralistic: the state legal order coexists with non-state (social) legal orders that emerge in various communities, while state power loses its role as the only source of positive legal norms.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of neighborhood relations on existing landscape patches in the assessment of landscape patch quality.The quality of a landscape patch is directly related to the biodiversity and the land uses adjacent to the patch. In other words, the land use of neighboring patch can have a multifaceted effect on that patch. While these neighborhoods increase the biodiversity of the landscape patch, its connection with other patches, also cause degradation and loss of habitat. Therefore, when evaluating the quality of the landscape patch, neighboring relations should be taken into consideration. In this study, neighboring relationships of forest fire severity patches in existing land cover were analyzed with use of datasets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) which is a cloud computing platform. The data have been selected from Izmir which is the biggest city in Aegean Region of Turkey, and the neighboring relations have been analyzed. As an example, the forest fire occurred in 18th August 2019 case has been selected which is one of the biggest forest fire happened in Izmir from the past. This burned area is neighbor with the center of Menderes town in East, and the other directions are covered by unaffected forests. The relation between burned area and these patches are analyzed with use of Google Earth Engine derived NDVI data-sets from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 from the dates of pre- and post-forest fire event The burned area has been automatically detected, converted to vector, then the boundary of the patches have been converted to the points. The ratio of the points which belong to the patch with total number of points along the boundary of burned area gives the relationship ratio which is used to evaluate the effect.

TI  - Studies of Sea-Ice Thickness and Salinity Retrieval Using 0.5-2 GHz Microwave Radiometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea-ice thickness and salinity retrievals are simulated to explore the performance of nadir-observing microwave radiometry operating with up to 16 frequency channels in the 0.5-2-GHz frequency range. A radiative transfer model is used to create lookup tables of the circularly polarized thermal emissions of first-year (FY) and multiyear (MY) sea ice, and the performance of two distinct retrieval methods is examined. The first method retrieves only sea-ice thicknesses, while the second retrieves both ice thickness and ice salinity. Retrieval errors are simulated for both FY and MY sea ice as a function of ice thickness, salinity, and temperature to investigate the impact of radiometric uncertainty, the frequency channels used, and any errors in ancillary information. To gain further insight into Arctic scale retrieval performance, a simulated brightness temperature dataset is produced for Arctic sea ice for the period October 2020-March 2021 using sea-ice thicknesses from the SMOS-CryoSat-2 algorithm. Compared to existing sea-ice thickness retrievals obtained from 1.4-GHz microwave radiometers, the results demonstrate that 0.5-2-GHz radiometry can achieve higher sensitivity to a sea-ice thickness within the range 0.5-1.5 m for FY sea ice and enable the retrieval of multiple sea-ice parameters (thickness and salinity) simultaneously.

AB  - During Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, the presence of ghost is frequently observed on SAR images of maritime scenes due to the finite pulse repetition frequency and non-ideal antenna pattern. In Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images of ships, the ship movement makes the dispersion of span which is called ghost interference. This problem leads to high false alarm rates and measurement errors. To solve this problem, we propose a method applied to full-polarimetric SAR data. Firstly, we use multi-feature combination to enhance the scattering mechanism of the targets. Secondly, based on this method, using the Rank-1 and generalized similarity parameter (GSP) to improve the contrast between the sea and the ships. Finally, interference feature filter (IFF) is used to get the image with interference removed. We use the GaoFen-3 (GF-3) full-polarimetric SAR data for experiments. The results show that this method effectively removes the ghost interference, and then we will perform a target detection to prove that it can reduce the false alarm rate.

TI  - Extraction of Sugarcane Planting Area Based on Similarity of NDVI Time Series
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate estimation of the sugarcane planting area is of vital importance to the country's agricultural production and sugar development. In remote sensing crop mapping based on spectral similarity, there will be have a phenomenon of foreign matters with the same spectrum by obtaining an accurate crop reference curve for crop identification, limiting mapping accuracy. In this study, we improved the spectral reconstruction method based on singular value decomposition (SR-SVD). A decision tree model was established based on the similarity of the sugarcane Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series curve and the fluctuation range of NDVI in different growth periods. Using the Sentinel-2 (Level-2A) image data set to extract sugarcane planting area in two regions of Chongzuo City, Guangxi, China, the overall accuracy was higher than 96%, respectively. The results show that through the spectral similarity and the determination of the threshold fluctuation range, not only high-precision mapping of sugarcane can be achieved, but the problem of "same spectrum with different objects " can also be solved. Therefore, this method can provide accurate information on the sugarcane planting areas and technical support for monitoring the structure of sugarcane planting in the region.

AB  - Understanding the temporal variations of terrestrial water storage (TWS) in large river basins is crucial for water resource management and ecosystem protection. Yet, the variations of TWS in large river basins are often been assessed in term of temporal trends with limited studies on the stationarity of TWS. In this study, we investigated the temporal trends and stability of TWS in then large river basins in China from 2004 to 2014 using the corrected Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity satellite data. Key findings are: (1) the average TWS in China showed a significant downward trend during the study period; and (2) the TWS in ten large river basins was non-stationary across China. Water surpluses were observed in the Northeast and the Southeast, while water deficits were found in the Northwest and the Southwest. This study provides policy-makers with critical information to design adaptive strategies and plans for basin-scale water resources management.

AB  - Spectral variability and shadow effects can limit the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification performance. Compared with HSI, the LiDAR data is an excellent complement with its abundant elevation information. In this study, a procedure including pre-processing, deep residual network classification and post-processing is investigated for classification of HSI aided by the LiDAR data to release the problem of identifying shaded objects and spectral variability. Specifically, three aspects with respect to spectral band selection using Archetypal Analysis (AA), feature level fusion based classification by deploying a residual network associated approach and label correction utilizing the elevation information, are explored to realize more accurate classification. Experiments on three public multi-source (hyperspectral and LiDAR) remote sensing datasets show more promising classification can be achieved via fusion two-source of remote sensing data than that using only independent hyperspectral image. In particular, on the Houston 2017 dataset, OA and Kappa achieved significant gains of 2.47% and 2.79% respectively after incorporating LiDAR information. Moreover, the results demonstrate the elevation information used independently in the post-processing stage can help with effective refinement of classification results.

AB  - This paper examines the self-awareness of Silla, Balhae and Japan in the 8th and 9th centuries and the perception of others among them. Japan’s Ritsuryo state recognized Silla and Balhae as tributary countries, and treated Ezo, Hayato, and Namdo people as barbarians.In the 8th century, with the Emperor at the top, Japan established its own country-centered independent view of the world covered all one’s own and tributary countries, barbarians, namely, a small imperialist international order. Silla, which claims to be a tributary country of the Tang Dynasty, once established its own country-centered independent worldview that made Bodeok-country and Tamra or Balhae and Tamra a tributary country. At that time, the Silla people recognized their country as a state with the status of a royal castle and proudly regarded it as a Noble-man country(君子國) that developed Confucian culture comparable to that of China, on the other hand, despised Japan as an uncivilized barbarians country(夷狄國) that fell behind culturally. Since Silla invaded Balhae in 733, the two countries have maintained hostile relations for a while, and since the mid-8th century, Silla has treated Balhae as a country of good-neighbor diplomacy. The people of Silla, like Japan, considered Balhae a culturally backward country, showing their pride. Although Balhae claimed to be a tributary country of the Tang Dynasty, it aimed to establish the emperor’s state system internally. In addition, Balhae established its own country-centered independent worldview that made the neighboring Mamma tribes a tributary political group. Since the mid-8th century, Balhae has treated Silla as a country of good-neighbor diplomacy, and competed or interchanged with each other on the international stage. Balhae, like Silla, treated Japan as a country of good-neighbor diplomacy, either by claiming that Balhae and Japan were father-in-law and son-in-law relations or by referring to the national letter sent by Balhae King to the Japanese emperor as “Ki(啓).” Japan recognized Silla and Balhae as tributary countries, but Silla and Balhae treated Japan as a country of good-neighbor diplomacy, and Silla and Japan’s or Japan and Balhae’s dream of the same bed was caused by diplomatic friction and conflict. It can be summarized that Silla’s ego and perception of others during the Unified Silla Period became the source of Korea’s perception of China and Japan in the pre-modern era.

TI  - BETWEEN FICTION AND UTOPIA: CHANGE IN HABERMAS'S APPROACH TO RELIGION AND HIS PROJECT OF POST-SECULAR SOCIETY
T2  - BILIMNAME
M3  - Article
AB  - Secularization, as one of the most productive discussion areas of sociology, has been creating serious disagreements for the last half century. The secularization literature, which was founded by the prophecies of the founders of sociology for the future of religion, continues to expand with the different approaches of modern sociologists who opened more space to religion. In this literature, which has an interdisciplinary nature as it has some connection with many fields of social sciences, some concepts and approaches have attracted more attention, while some views have not been as effective as others. One of the secularization approaches that has not been adequately studied, especially in the Turkish literature, is the conceptualization of "post-secular". Although it appears in the works of some social theologians since the late 1950s, sociologist Jurgen Habermas has made the concept of post-secular a part of broader discussion. In many of his texts he wrote after the 2000s, Habermas argues that countries that have experienced secularization processes, such as European societies, are moving to a "post-secular" stage. Thus, he argues that secular and religious citizens who diversify in terms of worldview in that society should come together at a common point of consensus. This article, which problematizes Habermas's project of post-secular society, also aims to draw a portrait of Habermas, who has experienced an intellectual transformation in his approach to the phenomenon of religion. This study, in which the literature review method will be used, aims to make a comprehensive evaluation around the concept of "postsecular society", which has been criticized for being ambiguous, having utopian aspects and offering a Eurocentric perspective. This study concluded that the concept of post-secular society, although it has some dilemmas, should be considered important in order to overcome the secular-religious (sacred) dichotomy and to develop a more encompassing perspective on the issue. This study also draws attention to the fact that Habermas, whose views on religion are neglected especially in the social sciences literature of our country, should be taken into consideration more as a sociologist of religion in his analyzes on the subject.

AB  - Single tree detection has been a major research topic concerning automatic forest inventory using remote sensing data. Recently, deep learning-based approaches in remote sensing forestry have gained attention because of the prospect of improved accuracy. In this study, we present a novel tree detection method based on the detection transformer (DETR), which applies a transformer in combination with a pre-trained convolutional neural network to detect individual trees using high-resolution multispectral imagery. The test site (Kranzberg Forest Roof Experiment - KROOF) is located in Bavaria, north of Munich, and is characterised by a mixed forest which consists of large groups of European beeches (Fagus sylvatica) surrounded by Norway spruces (Picea abies). The image data were acquired with a MicaSense RedEdge-MX Dual camera mounted to UAV. Two flight mission were conducted at an altitude of around 85 m with a flight speed of 5 m/sec, resulting in a ground resolution of about 5 cm. 125 trees were surveyed by tacheometric means in the field for testing, and 1390 trees were labelled by visual interpretation of the multispectral imagery for training and validation. The novel tree detection method based on DETR shows promising results and outperforms the standard, well-known object detection method YOLOv4 in mixed and deciduous test plots. More detailed, Fl-scores were evaluated for coniferous plot at 83%, for mixed plot at 86% and for deciduous plot at 71%. The corresponding figures for YOLOv4 are 87% coniferous, 65% mixed and 67% deciduous. In terms of accuracy, DETR is inferior by 6% in coniferous plot, however superior by 28% and 5% in mixed and deciduous plot, respectively. Compared to YOLOv4, we found that DETR sometimes failed to detect small coniferous trees. Moreover, both deep learning-based methods tend to over-detect single trees in deciduous test areas. In sum, transformer-based tree detection shows great potential to improve single tree detection.

TI  - Investigation of Long and Short-Term Water Surface Area Changes in Coastal Ramsar Sites in Turkey with Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deltas and lagoons, which contain many flora and fauna, have rich coastal ecological and biological environments, and are wetlands of vital importance for humans. In this study, the current problems in all coastal Ramsar sites in Turkey are summarized, and changes in water surface areas are investigated using Landsat and Sentinel 1/2 satellite images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Landsat TM and OLI images were used in the long-term analysis, and time series were created by taking annual and July to September averages between 1985 and 2020. In the short-term analysis, monthly averages were determined using Sentinel 2 images between 2016 and 2020. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were used in the months when optical data were not suitable for use in monthly analysis. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to extract water surface areas from the optical images. Afterwards, a thresholding process was used for both optical and radar images to determine the changes. The changes were analyzed together with the meteorological data and the information obtained from the management plans and related studies in the literature. Changes in the water surface areas of all coastal Ramsar sites in Turkey were determined from 1985 to 2020 at different rates. There was a decreasing trend in the Goksu and Kizilirmak Deltas, which also have inland wetlands. The decreasing rates from 1985 to 2020 were -24.52% and -2.86%, for annual average water surfaces for the Goksu and Kizilirmak Deltas, respectively, and -21.64% and -6.34% for the dry season averages, respectively. However, Akyatan Lagoon, which also has inland wetlands, showed an increasing trend. Observing the annual average surface area from 1985 to 2020, an increase of 438 ha was seen, corresponding to 7.65%. Every year, there was an increasing trend in the Gediz Delta and Yumurtalik Lagoons, that do not have inland wetlands. The increasing rates from 1985 to 2020 were 46.01% and 17.31% for the annual average surface area, for the Gediz Delta and Yumurtalik Lagoons, respectively, and 38.34% and 21.04% for the dry season average, respectively. The obtained results reveal the importance of using remote sensing methods in formulating strategies for the sustainable management of wetlands.

AB  - Land cover is the most critical information required for land management and planning because human interference on land can be easily detected through it. However, mapping land cover utilizing optical remote sensing is not easy due to the acute shortage of cloud-free images. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an efficient and effective tool for huge land cover analysis by providing access to large volumes of imagery available within a few days after acquisition in one consolidated system. This article demonstrates the use of Sentinel-1 datasets to create a land cover map of Pusad, Maharashtra using the GEE platform. Sentinel-1 provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets that have a temporally dense and high spatial resolution, which is renowned for its cloud penetration characteristics and round-the-year observations irrespective of the weather. VV and VH polarization sentinel-1 time series data were automatically classified using a support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms. Overall accuracies (OA), ranging from 82.3% to 90%, were obtained depending on polarization and methodology used. RF algorithm with VV polarization dataset stands better in comparison to SVM achieving OA of 90% and Kappa coefficient of 0.86. The highest user accuracy was obtained for the water class with both classifiers.

AB  - Remote sensing data is crucial for applications ranging from monitoring forest fires and deforestation to tracking urbanization. Most of these tasks require dense pixel-level annotations for the model to parse visual information from limited labeled data available for these satellite images. Due to the dearth of high-quality labeled training data in this domain, there is a need to focus on semi-supervised techniques. These techniques generate pseudo-labels from a small set of labeled examples which are used to augment the labeled training set. This makes it necessary to have a highly representative and diverse labeled training set. Therefore, we propose to use an active learning-based sampling strategy to select a highly representative set of labeled training data. We demonstrate our proposed method's effectiveness on two existing semantic segmentation datasets containing satellite images: UC Merced Land Use Classification Dataset and DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset. We report a 27% improvement in mloU with as little as 2% labeled data using active learning sampling strategies over randomly sampling the small set of labeled training data.

AB  - Calculating CO2 emissions from a city using Global Protocol for Communities (GPC) guidelines is a data intensive exercise. Moreover, the outcome is difficult to verify because of the data quality issues. We have developed a quick and approximate method for calculating scope 1 and scope 2 CO2 emitted by a city, using Landsat 8 data. We used Vegetation-Impervious surfaces-Soil (VIS) classes extracted from the satellite image, and city population as independent variables and related it with CO2 emissions. The model results match well with the reported total annual carbon emissions by the world carbon budget report.

TI  - Positive Unlabelled Learning for Satellite Images'Time Series Analysis: An Application to Cereal and Forest Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications in which researchers aim to extract a single land type from remotely sensed data are quite common in practical scenarios: extract the urban footprint to make connections with socio-economic factors; map the forest extent to subsequently retrieve biophysical variables and detect a particular crop type to successively calibrate and deploy yield prediction models. In this scenario, the (positive) targeted class is well defined, while the negative class is difficult to describe. This one-class classification setting is also referred to as positive unlabelled learning (PUL) in the general field of machine learning. To deal with this challenging setting, when satellite image time series data are available, we propose a new framework named positive and unlabelled learning of satellite image time series (PUL-SITS). PUL-SITS involves two different stages: In the first one, a recurrent neural network autoencoder is trained to reconstruct only positive samples with the aim to higight reliable negative ones. In the second stage, both labelled and unlabelled samples are exploited in a semi-supervised manner to build the final binary classification model. To assess the quality of our approach, experiments were carried out on a real-world benchmark, namely Haute-Garonne, located in the southwest area of France. From this study site, we considered two different scenarios: a first one in which the process has the objective to map Cereals/Oilseeds cover versus the rest of the land cover classes and a second one in which the class of interest is the Forest land cover. The evaluation was carried out by comparing the proposed approach with recent competitors to deal with the considered positive and unlabelled learning scenarios.

TI  - Estimating the Pycnocline Depth From the SAR Signature of Internal Waves in the Alboran Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Alboran Sea, west of the Straits of Gibraltar, the pycnocline depth has been assessed from the signature of a large amplitude internal wave (LAIW) captured by a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. First, the coefficients of the extended Korteweg-deVries model were expressed using two different models of ocean stratification: an interfacial model and a continuously stratified ocean model. Then, via a backscattering model, the same extended Korteweg-deVries coefficients were computed. This latter calculation was performed along several transects extracted from the LAIW surface signature and through an improved CARMA-derived method. Using the values of the coefficients for the ocean stratification model and those calculated from the SAR image, we obtained solutions for the pycnocline depth and thickness. This method was applied to an LAIW event on 1 October 2008, for which SAR data and stratification measurements by an in-situ experiment were available jointly. The results are that the interfacial stratification model provides only few solutions for the pycnocline depth, while the continuous stratification model allows an interval of solutions for the pycnocline depth and thickness. These models are nevertheless complementary. Extra applications of this method on other ocean regions would be of interest.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone in the management of early cervical carcinoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy aims to assess lymph node status with reduced surgical morbidity. The aim of the study was to determine the accuracy and safety of SLN biopsy in the management of early cervical carcinoma using a double technique (technetium-99m (Tc-99m) nanocolloid and methylene blue dye injection). Methods This was a 10-year study from January 2009 to January 2019 that recruited 103 consecutive women undergoing surgery for early cervical carcinoma, FIGO 2009 stage IA1 (grade 3, and grade 2 with lymphovascular space invasion) to IB1 (<2 cm), at the West Kent Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Maidstone, UK. All patients were given the choice of pelvic node dissection and SLN mapping or SLN only. All patients elected to undergo SLN only. In total 97 patients had SLN mapping performed laparoscopically. We used the combined method (Tc-99m nanocolloid and/or methylene blue dye). All SLN routinely underwent ultrastaging. Results At least one SLN was detected in all 103 patients, using at least one of the combined methods (Tc-99m nanocolloid or blue dye). Bilaterally SLN were removed in 85/103 women with an 83% bilateral detection rate. The median SLN count was 2.3 (range 1-6) nodes. Of 103 patients, 7 (6.7%) patients had lymph node involvement. There were no pelvic or para-aortic lymph node recurrences with a median follow-up of 53 (range 8-120) months. The specificity and negative predictive value of a negative SLN was 100%. None of our 103 patients reported lower extremity lymphedema. Conclusion In carefully selected patients with early cervical carcinoma, SLN biopsy alone appears to be a safe method for lymph node assessment of women undergoing surgical staging. Ultrastaging is an essential part of histologic examination of SLN.

TI  - A reflective approach to the crisis of multilateralism in the face of the paradigm of the fight against drug trafficking and sustainable development: the eradication of illicit crops in Colombia and Peru as an alternative paradigm?
T2  - HALLAZGOS-REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to analyze and reflect on the current crisis of multilateralism and its general principles of conduct -ideas, discourses and practices- which may represent a scenario of opportunities and threats to respond to the complexity of the world drug problem and the crisis of its dominant paradigm whose strategy, primarily military, represents an anachronistic worldview regarding security reduced to the prohibitionist approach. Likewise, there are debates on the dominant development paradigm, built on global agreements and their general principles of conduct -ideas- that have determined and constrained a multidimensional approach in the case of Colombia and Peru. In this way, the worldview has been determined by the dialectical vision of the internal world -harmony- and external -anarchy- according to the rationalist approaches which, from the critique of reflective approaches in International Relations, poses more than an explanation (causality), the understanding (interpretation) and coconstitution of reality and current phenomena, such as the world drug problem and development for the consolidation of alternative paradigms in Colombia and Peru.

TI  - Polarimetric Scattering Spectrum Analysis for Target Characterization
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes the spectrum analysis of the scattering-type parameter, theta(FP), to characterize different land cover targets. Many orthonormal projections of the scattering information onto distinct polarization bases have been proposed in the literature. However, these conventional orthonormal basis projection techniques often provide various target characterization ambiguities and classification. In this work, we propose projecting the target coherency matrix onto several random realizations of the normalized scattering configuration without restriction to the orthogonality constraint. This unique approach helps enhanced target characterization from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We show the efficacy of our proposed technique over different land cover types using the C-band RADARSAT-2 data over San Francisco (SF) and the L-band ALOS-2 data over Mumbai.

TI  - Prediction of Oil Spill Trajectory on the Ocean Surface Using Mathematical Modeling
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A simplistic mathematical model based on the law of motion for predicting oil spill trajectory on the ocean surface utilizing random walk technique is proposed in this article. Validation of the proposed model is performed by comparing results with the General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment model and the available set of periodic Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the contingency location (Corsica oil spill incident in the Mediterranean Sea). SAR images are processed for speckle noise removal, dark spot detection, feature extraction, and classification of dark spots as oil spills and look-alikes for suitability of comparison. The accuracy of prediction is evaluated using centroid skill score metric and is compared with that of the prediction results from MEDSLIK-II model. The results of proposed model are found to be in good agreement with available SAR images. The simulation also showed that using an hourly wind and ocean current data on the study region, more accurate prediction of the trajectory is possible.

T2  - ANTHROPOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on ethnographic data collected in two Peruvian peasant communities on telluric worships, in this article I analyze the symbolic forms of the ritual interaction that Quechua people have with their environment, especially with topographic places such as land and mountains. The purpose is to observe how such ritual interactions are symbolic metonymies through which the Quechuas stay in contact with telluric entities such as Pachatnama, Apus and other topographical places of their environment. The above invites us to rethink gestures and ritual acts of Andean telluric worships as semiotic processes with a referential core, formed by the physicality and productive vitality of the Andean geo-physical elements. This referential core allows us to categorize Quechua telluric cults into new anthropological theories focused on the relationship between human beings and non -human elements of the Andean cosmology.

CP  - IEEE International Conference on Metrology for Extended Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering (IEEE MetroXRAINE)
CL  - Rome, ITALY
AB  - In this manuscript we propose a warning system based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to allow early detection of volcanic eruptions. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms and the early detection purpose can be exploited together to carry out the specific detection and inform the Civil Protection and the authorities in charge to guarantee immediate intervention for the protection of people. Indeed, the main goal presented in this work is to conceptualize and realize a system to be mounted on-board of satellites with the intent of producing swift alerts useful for decision makers. In the initial phase the proposed ML model is trained with SO2 data acquired by Sentinel-5P. The final scope is to define an on-board system similar to Phi-Sat 1, with its own sensor and its own systems. Our feasibility study has shown that it is possible to classify and identify volcanic eruptions in advance with an accuracy of 80% and 70% respectively. Work is in progress to improve these results.

CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Carrying out monitoring surveys in seismic regions is good practice both for the assessment of land deformation and the evaluation of building structures standing on it. In this work, topographic levelling and DInSAR techniques have been used for displacement measurement. These geomatic techniques are rarely applied in the same context and attempts are made to combine the results obtained for having a complete analysis of the site. The proposed work analyses, compares and discusses topographic levelling and advanced multi-temporal DInSAR techniques used to detect and measure ground deformation when the occurrence of seismic events might have played a role in the displacement. The area of interest had already been under observation through ground-based monitoring surveys, by means of metal bolts attached to facades of buildings detected by topographic level, from 1998 to 2021. The DInSAR analysis was carried out exploiting Sentinel-1A/B data acquired during the period 2014-2021. The goal of the DInSAR processing stage of the procedure is to derive the deformation map of the area of interest from SAR data. A zero date has been set for both survey methods in order to define similar time series for comparison analysis. The results showed that ground displacements measured by levelling and DInSAR have similar trends. On the geomorphological aspect, the same distribution map of terrain subsidence is found in both techniques.

AB  - In this study, the potentiality of an automatic processing system for fast implementation of interferometric SAR analysis is tested over a time series of COSMO-SkyMed data. A system architecture for the end-to-end implementation of Permanent Scatterer workflow is illustrated and applied to a test case located over the South-West area of the Rome area. The system architecture is aimed at providing a high degree of automation in the different steps of the procedures, from the Satellite products download and storage up to the data visualization. The proposed solution can be integrated with both commercial processing tools and open source frameworks. A two years of COSMO-SkyMed acquisitions from the MAPITALY archive have been analysed with SARscape and a customized open source workflow. The obtained results highlighted some interesting features on the considered area of interest. Moreover, the outcome of the analyses are in good agreement with previous studies on the same geographical region.

AB  - Climate change is perhaps the biggest single threat to humankind and the environment, as it severely impacts our terrestrial surface, home to most of the living species. Inspired by video prediction and exploiting the availability of Copernicus Sentinel-2 images, recent studies have attempted to forecast the land surface evolution as a function of past land surface evolution, elevation, and weather. Further extending this paradigm, we propose a model based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) that is computationally efficient (lightweight), however obtains superior results to the previous baselines. By introducing a ConvLSTM-based architecture to this problem, we can not only ingest the heterogeneous data sources (Sentinel2 time-series, weather data, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) but also explicitly condition the future predictions on the weather. Our experiments confirm the importance of weather parameters in understanding the land cover dynamics and show that weather maps are significantly more important than the DEM in this task. Furthermore, we perform generative simulations to investigate how varying a single weather parameter can alter the evolution of the land surface. All studies are performed using the EarthNet2021 dataset. The code, additional materials and results can be found at https://github.com/dcodrut/weather2land.

TI  - SATELLITE IMAGE CHANGE DETECTION USING DISJOINT INFORMATION AND LOCAL DISSIMILARITY MAP
T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, ICIP
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)
CL  - Bordeaux, FRANCE
AB  - This paper presents a new change detection technique for images taken from the sentinel-2 satellite between 2015 and 2018 in different regions of the world. These images are widely used in recent years for change detection. This technique is based on two dissimilarity measures: the Disjoint Information and the Local Dissimilarity Map. The disjoint information quantifies the dissimilarities between textures and the Local Dissimilarity Map those between structures of images. Firstly, the disjoint information is computed across the blocks of the RGB image channels and the value is multiplied by the center value of the pixel of each block. Secondly, the Local Dissimilarity Maps over the pre-processed channels and the average of the pixel values on the Local Dissimilarity Maps are computed. Finally, an extension of the Gaussian OTSU's threshold is used to detect changes in images. Experimental results on the well-known Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

AB  - The increased availability of remote sensing data combined with the wide-ranging applicability of artificial intelligence has enabled agriculture stakeholders to monitor changes in crops and their environment frequently and accurately. Applying cutting-edge technology in precision agriculture also enabled the prediction of pre-harvest yield from standing crop signals. Forecasting grain yield from standing crops benefits high-throughput plant phenotyping and agriculture policymaking with information on where crop production is likely to decline. Advanced developments in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform and sensor technologies aided high-resolution spatial, spectral, and structural data collection processes at a relatively lower cost and shorter time. In this study, UAV-based LiDAR and hyperspectral images were collected during the growing season of 2020 over a cornfield near Urbana Champaign, Illinois, USA. Hyperspectral imagery-based canopy spectral & texture features and LiDAR point cloudbased canopy structure features were extracted and, along with their combination, were used as inputs for maize yield prediction under the H2O Automated Machine Learning framework (H2O-AutoML). The research results are (1) UAV Hyperspectral imagery can successfully predict maize yield with relatively decent accuracies; additionally, LiDAR point cloud-based canopy structure features are found to be significant indicators for maize yield prediction, which produced slightly poorer, yet comparable results to hyperspectral data; (2) regardless of machine learning methods, integration of hyperspectral imagery-based canopy spectral and texture information with LiDAR-based canopy structure features outperformed the predictions when using a single sensor alone; (3) the H2O-AutoML framework presented to be an efficient strategy for machine learning-based data-driven model building.

AB  - GIS models of the empirical methods Blaney-Criddle, Hammon, De Bruin and Makkink have been developed in ArcMap model-builder environment to estimate daily mean reference evapotranspiration (ETo). MODIS LST Day and Night products along with meteorological data were used as inputs. The application was on Peloponnese, Greece, for months December and August of years 2016-2019. For the validation of the models FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) was used as a reference. For the evaluation of the models Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias (MB) and Normalized mean Bias (NMB) were computed. Hargreaves-Samani's and Hansen's previous estimates were also employed. Hammon's estimates are closer to FAO-PM for December, with Hansen's following closely. Hargreaves-Samani model, followed by De Bruin model, produced the closest estimates to FAO-PM for August. It is noteworthy that the estimates for August were significantly better than those for December for all empirical models. This is probably because of negligible wind speed values in August. FAO-PM is sensitive in the wind speed values of December. The presented empirical models are quick and accurate and can employ LST inputs of any spatial resolution.

TI  - Features of Functioning of Bacchic Vocabulary in Novel "Peter and Alexei"
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The features of the situation of wine drinking, its individual author's interpretation in D. S. Merezhkovsky's novel "Peter and Alexei" are considered. The relevance of the study is connected, firstly, with its inclusion in the circle of studies related to the study of the author's idiostyle, and secondly, with determining the influence of the views of the author-symbolist on the representation of the details of everyday life, in particular the situation of drinking wine. The material for the research was a selection of contexts containing Bacchic vocabulary. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that this novel is considered from the point of view of the representation of everyday values in the context of a historiosophical novel. While traditionally the novel is defined as a symbolist one, its importance in expressing the religious and philosophical views of the author is emphasized. It was revealed that the inclusion of words denoting the name of the dishes (chan, ushat, flyaga, etc.) in the picture of Peter's "most drunken cathedrals" gives wine-drinking features of inclusiveness and scale. Attention is paid to the symbolic reading of wine, and it is also noted that the sacred and the profane are in constant relationship and often have a Bacchic interpretation. It is indicated that vocabulary with the semantics of death is introduced into the wine-drinking scenes, which sets a symbolic interpretation and explicates the author's assessment.

AB  - Wildfires are among the most common natural disasters, which occur mainly in extremely dry conditions (summer period) due to natural causes or human activities. They can potentially lead to permanent vegetation loss, soil erosion and consequently flooding and desertification, while they can also be particularly harmful to humans themselves. In recent years, a rapid increase in the number of fires has been observed, especially in areas such as Siberia, California, Australia as well as in regions with Mediterranean climate. In the current study, we mapped the burned areas in the northwestern Peloponnese for a ten-year period (2011-2021) using spaceborne remote sensing data. Specifically, we obtained Sentinel-2 and Landsat data -provided free of charge to all users- covering the study area before and after wildfires. The identification and the subsequent mapping of the burnt areas was based on the calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as on the estimation of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index. Burnt areas arising from both missions were integrated into an ArcGIS environment in order to be measured and compared. The assessment of the results was carried out using burnt areas, acquired by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).

T2  - AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on utilizing full-polarimetric L-band radar data from ALOS PALSAR (JAXA) by means of Polarimetry (POL-SAR), over mountainous test sites in Bulgaria. General aim is to show feasibility of the Polarimetry to describe natural targets, which exhibits various scattering mechanisms in respect to their biophysical and geometrical properties. Firstly, the importance of Covariance and Coherent matrices is shown which is followed by calculation of the polarimetric coherences with their particular significance. The mathematical and physical model based decompositions are applied to describe backscattering media from scattering mechanisms. Radar indices resulted from H/A/a-decomposition showed randomization of scattering mechanisms over forest areas, whilst two major scattering mechanisms are observed mainly in crop lands. A comparison is made between polarimetric descriptors from acquisitions in different seasonality over mountainous forest and agricultural lands. Polarimetric segmentations and classifications are applied, with 8 (H/A) and 16 (H/A/a) components. Finally, a forest mask is proposed based on relevant polarimetric descriptors. Study showed good utilization and importance of the full-polarimetric L-band SAR data, derived from ALOS PALSAR, in natural targets and forest areas. This report resulted from a course GEO414 - "Polarimetrie" held at the University of Jena, Lehrstuhl flu- Fernerkundung, in the framework of ERASMUS+, with the kind support of - Dr. T. Jagdhuber (DLR) and Prof. C. Schmullius.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poseidon-4 is a dual-frequency redundant radar altimeter, embarked onboard the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (MF) European Commission Copernicus Programme satellite. In this article, we assess Poseidon-4 main instrumental improvements and performances with the presentation of the more important outcomes from the in-flight internal calibration modes and an external calibration analysis over a transponder. The instrumental performances of the radar altimeter are excellent for both radar chain sides: Poseidon-4 delivers a range/azimuth instrument impulse response (IR) with the highest quality and fidelity in the era of space-borne radar altimetry, and its thermal noise response is almost just random noise. A power decay of the level of the transmitted power in the Ku-band has been detected both for the nominal and redundant sides, which is larger than expected, though it will not violate the requirement of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio over the ocean at the end of the satellite design lifetime. The innovative CAL1 ECHO CAL calibration mode allows for very precisely characterizing the sensitivity of the instrument IR to the in-orbit temperature variations and, thus, correcting for it in the science data as standard practice.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the complex ecological interactions between geomorphometry, spectral indices, and soil properties to develop a watershed management plan that can mitigate the effects of global warming. In this study, Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument data was used to map some spectral indices. The digital elevation model was used to map transportation capacity index (TCI), stream power index (SPI), compound topographic index (CTI), and curvature. Some soil properties were analysed using 128 top-soils. According to the results, a strong correlation (p < 0.05) was found between CTI and NDVI (0.358), NDWI (-0.336), NDMI (0.372), SBI (-0.298), pH (-0.165), and phosphorus (0.164). The highest correlation (p < 0.01) was found between SPI and phosphorus (0.301). The CTI model of the watershed, which was developed using geomorphometric data, can increase the success of forestry activities. Spectral indices have the potential to be used in the evaluation of soil properties and geomorphometric characteristics.

TI  - Improving the Asymptotic Radiative Transfer Model to Better Characterize the Pure Snow Hyperspectral Bidirectional Reflectance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) model has been widely used in snow remote sensing. However, the anisotropic effects of snow reflectance challenge this model because of its underestimation in the forward-scattering direction. To exhibit these strong scattering properties of the snow surface, a microfacet specular kernel has been supplemented with the ART model (hereinafter named the ARTS model). In this study, we propose a method of multiplying by a correction term for improving the ART model (hereinafter named the ARTF model). We validate the performance of the ARTF model using various data sources. Our results demonstrate that: 1) the ARTF model has higher accuracy in characterizing snow bidirectional signatures, with R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values in the ranges from 0.722 to 0.990 and 0.007 to 0.041, respectively, than the ART (R-2 = 0.507-0.802 and RMSE = 0.038-0.088) and ARTS (R-2 = 0.686-0.962 and RMSE = 0.021-0.044) models, especially in the long-wave near-infrared region and 2) the ARTF model can effectively represent snow hyperspectral reflectance, while the ART and ARTS models significantly underestimate snow reflectance in the visible and shortwave near-infrared region. The R-2 values of these three models reach similar to 0.99, and the RMSE values of the ARTF model range from 0.012 to 0.024, which are smaller than those of the ART (RMSE = 0.021-0.061) and ARTS (RMSE = 0.021-0.049) models. These results demonstrate that the ARTF model is better than the ART and ARTS models for characterizing snow hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance.

TI  - Specific Windows Search for Multi-Ship and Multi-Scale Wake Detection in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional ship identification systems have difficulty in identifying illegal or broken ships, but the wakes generated by ships can be used as a major feature for identification. However, multi-ship and multi-scale wake detection is also a big challenge. This paper combines the geometric and pixel characteristics of ships and their wakes in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and proposes a method for multi-ship and multi-scale wake detection. This method first detects the highlight pixel area in the image and then generates specific windows around the centroid, thereby detecting wakes of different sizes in different areas. In addition, all wake components can be located completely based on wake clustering, the statistical features of wake axis pixels can be used to determine the visible length of the wake. Test results on the Gaofen-3 SAR image show the special potential of the method for wake detection.

TI  - Reconstruction of Hourly All-Weather Land Surface Temperature by Integrating Reanalysis Data and Thermal Infrared Data From Geostationary Satellites (RTG)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) land surface temperature (LST) products derived from geostationary satellites have a high temporal resolution in a diurnal cycle, but they have many missing values under cloudy-sky conditions. Therefore, it is pressing to obtain all-weather LST (AW LST) with a high temporal resolution by filling the gap of TIR LST. In this study, a method integrating reanalysis data and TIR data from geostationary satellites (RTG) was proposed for reconstructing hourly AW LST. Then, taking the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is a focus of climate change as a case, RTG was applied to the Chinese Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) TIR LST and China Land Surface Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) data. Validation based on the in-situ LST shows that the accuracy of the AW LST is better than the FY-4A LST and CLDAS LST under clear-sky, cloudy-sky, and all-weather conditions. The mean RMSEs are 3.02 K for clear-sky conditions, 3.94 K for cloudy-sky conditions, and 3.57 K for all-weather conditions. Uncertainty and coarse resolution of the original FY-4A and CLDAS data affect the accuracy of the obtained AW LST. The results of the LST time series comparison also show that the reconstructed AW LST is consistent with in-situ LST. The reconstructed AW LST also has the good image quality and provides reliable spatial patterns. RTG is practical in obtaining high temporal resolution AW LST from the Chinese FY-4A to satisfy related applications. It can also be extended to other geostationary satellites and reanalysis datasets.

TI  - Coherence-Guided Complex Convolutional Sparse Coding for Interferometric Phase Restoration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric phase restoration is a crucial step in retrieving large-scale geophysical parameters from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Existing noise impacts the accuracy of parameter retrieval as a result of decorrelation effects. Most state-of-the-art filtering methods belong to the group of nonlocal filters. In this article, we propose a novel convolutional sparse coding method in complex domain with the prior knowledge of coherence integrated into the optimization model, which is termed as CoComCSC. CoComCSC is not only capable of reducing noise in regions with continuous phase changes, but also of preserving the phase details prominently. The experiments results on simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of CoComCSC by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the obtained digital elevation model (DEM) product by CoComCSC from RADARSAT-2 data indicates its superior filtering performance over regions with heterogeneous land covers, which shows its great potential for generating high-resolution DEM products.

TI  - Augmented Sample-Based Real-Time Spatiotemporal Spectral Unmixing
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the method of spatiotemporal spectral unmixing (srsu) was developed to fully explore multi-scale temporal information (e.g., moms-Landsat image pairs) for spectral unmixing of coarse time series (e.g., MODIS data). To further enhance the application for timely monitoring, the real-time STSU (RSTSU) method was developed for real-time data. In RSTSU, we usually choose a spatially complete moms-Landsat image pair as auxiliary data. Due to cloud contamination, the temporal distance between the required effective auxiliary data and the real-time data to be unmixed can be large, causing great land cover changes and uncertainty in the extracted unchanged pixels (i.e., training samples). In this article, to extract more reliable training samples, we propose choosing the auxiliary moDis-Landsat data temporally closest to the prediction time. To deal with the cloud contamination in the auxiliary data, we propose an augmented sample-based RSTSU (ARSTSU) method. ARSTSU selects and augments the training samples extracted from the valid (i.e., non-cloud) area to synthesize more training samples, and then trains an effective learning model to predict the proportions. ARSTSU was validated using two MODIS data sets in the experiments. ARSTSU expands the applicability of RSTSU by solving the problem of cloud contamination in temporal neighbors in actual situations.

TI  - Estimating Surface Albedo of Arctic Sea Ice Using an Ensemble Back-Propagation Neural Network: Toward a Better Consideration of Reflectance Anisotropy and Melt Ponds
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface albedo of Arctic sea ice is a critical variable in the Earth's energy budget, and various Arctic sea ice albedo datasets have been derived from remote sensing data. However, the influences of reflectance anisotropy and melt ponds were not well considered in previous studies. To improve the estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency, we developed a method for estimating the surface albedo of Arctic sea ice using an ensemble hack-propagation neural network (EBPNN) model. A bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo dataset of snow, white ice, and melt ponds was constructed using the asymptotic analytical radiative transfer (AART) model, and the nonlinear relationships between the surface reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and surface albedo were established using the EBPNN model (prediction correlation coefficient (R) = 0.996 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.023). Our results are consistent with the in situ measurements and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) product (R = 0.916, RMSE = 0.085, and bias = 0.001), in which the reflectance anisotropy of the snow/ice and the influence of melt ponds were fully considered, and the calculation efficiency was significantly improved by using the EBPNN model. The results of this study provide new insights for estimating the Arctic sea ice albedo from satellite observations, and the proposed EBPNN method can be used to generate a long-term Arctic sea ice albedo dataset with superior estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency.

TI  - Selection index and stability analysis for malting barley variety release in Ethiopia
T2  - Journal of Crop Science and Biotechnology
M3  - research-article
AB  - Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the major strategic crops in Ethiopia. Average yield is low due to low-yielding varieties, biotic and abiotic constraints. Farmers are concerned with quantity while the malting industries need to ensure quality.There has been a general belief by the industry that two-row barleys are better than the six-row types in terms of quality but farmers are inclined to six-rows for higher yield. Evaluation was performed to identify a variety with desirable yield and quality standards. Single-trait selection for yield or quality traits has so far been the breeders’ target with less emphasis on multiple traits’ selection. The current research aims to identify a high-yielding variety with acceptable quality based on multiple selection criteria. Analysis of variance showed higher location variance for yield with no interaction efect. Stability analysis exhibited signifcant interaction efect for malt extract and protein content. Two genotypes MOATA and IBON-HI68 were identifed with stable malt extract and protein content. ‘MOATA’ has been released with a higher mean yield (5.1 t/ha), lower protein (10.2%) and beta glucan (2.5%) contents, higher friability (73%) and malt extract (81.3%) while IBON-HI68 has been maintained as a parent material for future crossing program. MOATA is less susceptible to shoot fy damage (22%), scald and net blotch (44%). Its peculiar compact spike and dropping awns imply quality merits. In conclusion, multiple traits selection index has proved successful in identifying the frst six-row malting barley variety in Ethiopia.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - The automatic establishment of image relationship between oblique images can be a challenging task. Feature based image matching (FBM) establishes this relationship by detecting and matching corresponding feature points. A robust matching is beneficial for many tasks including reconstruction, mapping and localization. The need of automatic processing of remotely sensed data, like very highresolution (VHR) satellite imagery, increased over the years. Furthermore, green vegetation and water are changing the physical properties with respect to the amount of light emitted, season and pollution. In addition, with human interaction, the change in appearance increases. The Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a well-known and studied index in order to detect healthy green vegetation. The Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) can help identify water areas in an image. They can be used to preliminarily segment images into different categories for later process. This study proposes a novel framework to explore the potential of feature based stereo matching for very high-resolution satellite imagery with segmentation. The proposed framework will perform first, image segmentation with NDVI and NDWI on stereo VHR satellite image pairs. Then, classification by threshold to detect healthy green vegetation, water and image frame. Features within these three classes are masked out and kept from being processed during the feature matching step. The idea is that, features in these classes are easy to cause miss matching because they are more prone to be affected by different image and environmental conditions in the stereo image pairs. As a result, the amount of miss matches can be reduced on average by 7.5%. Furthermore, the segmentation decreases the total amount of detected features by 13.71%, so that the processing time decreases. This study has successfully proven that segmentation can lead to improved stereo matching. In future, segmentation driven can be utilized by AI matching processes as well as traditionally photogrammetric or computer vision tasks.

AB  - This is a case report of a 31-year-old woman going through cancer staging after being diagnosed with breast cancer. During sentinel node dissection, a remarkable dark lymph node was found. Metastatic malignant melanoma was suspected, but with careful histochemical examination the lymph node was confirmed to only contain tattoo pigment. The patient had rather large tattoos on her arms, which was suspected to be the source of the ink in her lymph nodes. Tattoo pigment can complicate cancer staging, and it is important to know this rare effect on lymph nodes when dealing with cancer staging.

AB  - Early prediction of crop yield before harvest allows stakeholders to take strategic decisions to ensure food availability. Crop yield prediction using remote sensing satellite imagery is a better alternative to existing models using expensive survey data. Surface spectral reflectance and land surface temperature bands from the Terra Satellite's MODIS instrument obtained through Google Earth Engine is used to map against crop yield for building prediction models. MODIS products data used in this study are available with an 8-day composite period and are feature engineered to reduce input imagery's spatial and spectral dimension before feeding to sequence models. This study compared various sequence modeling techniques that used temporal features of the multispectral satellite images for yield forecasting. Results show that sequence-based deep learning models could capture temporal dependency in the data, and LSTM performs better than other models using feature engineered data.

AB  - Crop yield prediction before harvest is essential to address the instability of crop prices and ensure food security. Existing approaches of crop yield forecasting focus on survey data and are expensive. Remote sensing-based crop yield forecasting is a promising approach, especially in areas where field data is scarce. Recent studies used machine learning and deep learning techniques used modern representation learning ideas instead of traditionally used features that discarded many spectral bands available from the satellite imagery. A deep feature learning model using convolutional LSTM cells is used for forecasting rice yield from remote sensing satellite imagery. Convolutional LSTM with convolutional input and recurrent transformations directly captures spatial and temporal features of the input data. Feature selection is performed using principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of input data without much loss in the performance. Results suggest that features learned are highly informative and our proposed model performed better than other existing techniques.

AB  - Groundwater is a vital resource for drinking and irrigation in arid and semi-arid regions. During this study, we investigate the relationship between wells/boreholes and their corresponding rainfall, temperature, NDVI and EVI. These factors are selected due to their importance in reflecting agriculture changes. The wells/boreholes of the study area are classified based on the water static level. Three machine learning methods are used to classify the samples using the extracted features. Results show that the used features can separate to great accuracy(AUC = 0.96) the zones with low static water levels (20m) from the others. Furthermore, feature importance analysis shows that all the features have an almost close effect with rainfall (33%) and temperature (28%) as the leading factors.

AB  - In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed to enhance the spectral resolution of optical remote sensing data that have very few spectral bands. Inspired by the availability of LANDSAT-8 images, a spectral super-resolution method is used and extended to enhance the resolution of ALSAT-2B images. First, a convenient LANDSAT-8 image that incorporates the targeted ALSAT-2B image is identified. Second, the LANDSAT8 image is converted into dataset patches of RGB and B5, B6 and B7 spectral bands. A local spectral super-resolution method, based on deep learning, is then used to grasp the transformation between the considered patches. Finally, the learned transformation is applied to the ALSAT-2B scene. To assess the quality of the transformation, several criteria are used. In addition, the impact of the reconstructed bands is investigated on anomaly detection on a desert scene. Obtained results show a great improvement for the well-known Reed-Xiaoli detector.

AB  - The importance of the adolescence in the value orientations formation as a stable personality trait associated with the shaping of worldview has always been a matter of special research attention. This article seeks to investigate the formation of teenagers' value orientations through creolized texts. The creolized text is a text in which verbal and nonverbal components form a visual, structural, semantic and functional wholeness, aimed at a complex impact on the recipient. The authors cleared out cognitive, emotional, and behavioural criteria for the formation of students' value orientations. To determine students' instrumental and terminal values, M. Rokeach's method of value orientation diagnostics was used. Educational workshops aimed at altering teenagers' values with the use of creolized texts were arranged. Examples of motivational posters and comics created by students in the process of these extracurricular activities are provided. The reflexive component is presented through students' impressions of working with creolized texts.

T2  - STUDIA SLAVICA ET BALCANICA PETROPOLITANA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article attempts to verify some aspects of the research hypothesis which implies that normative orientations of the Byzanine orthodox theological thought (in ideologies, mentalities, discourses) contained traditions and constructions that were in odds with tendency to see communities of ethnic type in people whom we used to qualify as Russians and Ruthenians. In the East European Orthodox medieval Christian identity of groups included in the Church was thought of as a hindrance in forming discourses, which would claim that the Church community could be fragmented into ethnic and << national >> groups (nationes). Old Russian texts, and texts of Muscovy, as well as writings of some Orthodox authors in Ruthenia (Ukraine and Belarus') of the early 17th century have been taken in account. In these sources, very often, theological discourses were entering in conflict with tendency to transfer norms of ethnic (tribal) identity on the Christian communities. This generated a situation when << Russianness >> was not perceived in ethnic terms, and in this respect relationships between Christian and << ethnic >> were understood in a very different way, than in the theological culture of medieval West. Search for an explanation leads to the area of the Byzantine theological tradition, in which Christian and ethnic identities were regarded as two conflicting discourses. The Orthodox identity of emperor's subjects was understood as << effacing >> traces of tribal (ethnic) belonging. For subjects of Christian history (id est history of those, who got baptized) were regarded not the multiple nationes, but << new people >> who became a united << nation of God >>. In medieval Rus, this discursive ligic was expressed by << Tale of the bygone years >>; the same discursive << scenario >> seems to be implemented in other texts of Russian Middle Ages, and this lead to Orthodox culture of Muscovy, which repelled the ethnic definition of << Russianness >>. It is very likely, that the same tendency was alive - disappearing and reappearing - in the worldview of literati and broader circles of the Orthodox population of Ruthenian lands.

AB  - The objective of investigation is to trace the changes of the ion density in the magnetosheath from the magnetopause to the bow shock. The theoretical interpretation is based on the magnetosheath-magnetosphere model, where the boundaries - bow shock and magnetopause, are self-consistently determined. The parameters in the magnetosheath are described by the gas-dynamic theory, while a variant of the Tsyganenko model is used in the magnetosphere, modified to compute the magnetic field in an area with arbitrarily chosen boundary. Data of the WIND satellites are used as solar wind monitoring. Good description is obtained for the considered crossing of the satellite THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) of both the trend and ion density values of the magnetosheath.

AB  - With the recent advances in remote sensing technologies for Earth observation (EO), many different remote sensors (e.g., optical, radar) collect data with distinctive properties. EO data have been employed to monitor croplands and forested areas, oceans and seas, urban settlements, and natural hazards. The spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions of remote sensors have been continuously improving, making geospatial monitoring more accurate and comprehensive than ever before. To tackle this issue, various variable selection methods (e.g., filter, wrapper, and embedded methods) are nowadays used to reduce data complexity, and hence improve classification accuracy. Therefore, the goal of this research was twofold. Firstly, to assess the performance of the random forest (RF) classifier in a large heterogeneous landscape with diverse land-cover categories using multi-seasonal Sentinel imagery (i.e., Sentinel-1; S1 and Sentinel-2; S2) and ancillary data. Secondly, to compare RF variable selection methods to identify a subset of predictor variables that will be included in a final, simpler model. Using mean decrease accuracy (MDA) as a feature selection (FS) method, an original dataset was reduced from 114 to 34 input features, and its classification performance outperformed all-feature (114 features) and band-only (36 features) model with an OA of 90.91%. The most pertinent input features for vegetation mapping were S2 spectral bands (14 features), followed by the spectral indices derived from S2, texture features, and S1 bands. This research improved vegetation mapping by integrating radar and optical imagery, especially after applying FS methods which removed redundant and noisy features from the original dataset. Future research should address additional feature selection methods (i.e., filter, wrapper, or the embedded) for vegetation mapping, combined with advanced deep learning methods.

AB  - The NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) energy balanced and filled (EBAF) product provides top of atmosphere SW and LW fluxes for monitoring the Earth's energy budget and to validate climate models. The current EBAF Ed4.1 products, based on the Terra and Aqua CERES instrument observed radiances, rely on MODIS cloud properties to determine the scene-selected angular distribution model used to convert the CERES radiances into fluxes. The CERES EBAF Ed4.2 product will be based on NOAA-20 CERES observations beginning with the data month of April 2022. A seamless transition of fluxes and clouds can only occur if the analogous MODIS and VIIRS channels are properly inter-calibrated. The spectral response functions (SRF) of these bands differ noticeably and will require scene-dependent spectral band adjustment factors (SBAF) for proper radiometric scaling between them. VIIRS I1 and M5 same-granule reflectance measurements provide the optimal opportunity to validate SBAFs over many surface and cloud conditions. The CERES project maintains SCIAMACHY-, GOME-2-, and Hyperion-based scene-stratified hyper-spectral reflectance measurements that can be convolved with sensor pair SRFs to compute the corresponding SBAFs.The SCIAMACHY 2nd order and GOME-2 linear fit SBAFs were optimal in providing spatially uniform M5/I1 spectrally corrected reflectance ratios over all-sky tropical ocean scenes, which corrected both clear-sky and bright cloud reflectances simultaneously by varying the SBAF as a function of the reflectance. Dome-C and deep convective cloud (DCC) SBAFs had a small M5/I1 SBAF reflectance correction of similar to 1.03, whereas Libya-4 had a large M5/I1 SBAF reflectance correction of similar to 1.085. DCC, Dome-C and Libya-4 are spectrally uniform spatial targets with site M5/I1 reflectance ratio spatial homogeneity within 0.2%. The impact of cloud contamination from both the cloud tops and shadows over Libya-4 reduced the M5/I1 reflectance ratio. Over Dome-C, cloud contamination did not significantly shift the M5/I1 reflectance ratio. The Hyperion spectral reflectances are too coarse to be convolved with the narrow M5 SRF, which resulted in M5/I1 SBAFs that differed significantly from those based on SCIAMACHY and GOME-2.

TI  - Additional characterization of Libya-4 in support of post-launch vicarious calibration of satellite imagers
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The CEOS recommended Libya-4 Pseudo Invariant Calibration Site (PICS), located at 28.55 degrees N and 23.39 degrees E, has been extensively used for post-launch radiometric calibration and stability assessment of high, medium, and low-resolution satellite imagers, including MODIS and VIIRS. The NASA LaRC CERES Imager and Geostationary Calibration Group (IGCG) utilizes Libya-4 to perform an independent assessment of the radiometric stability of the MODIS and VIIRS L1B products, which are used in scene identification to convert CERES broadband radiances into fluxes. The site is also used for absolute radiometric scaling between MODIS, VIIRS, and geostationary imagers to ensure consistent cloud and radiative flux retrievals.The Libya-4 clear-sky TOA observed reflectances from sun-synchronous sensors are modeled as a function of solar angle. The model provides observed relative reflectances within 1% for bands 1-6 and 1.8% for band 7 (2.1-mu m). The Terra-MODIS, Aqua-MODIS, and NPP-VIIRS Libya-4 TOA observed relative reflectances are shown to fluctuate in tandem. The residual reflectance variability is associated with cloudy and dust storm events as well as seasonal variations of atmospheric parameters, such as precipitable water (PW) and ozone. By correlating the Aqua-MODIS TOA reflectances with PW and solar angle, the 0.64-mu m, 0.86-mu m, 1.24-mu m, and 2.1-mu m relative reflectance variability is reduced by 10%, 25%, 20%, and 50%, respectively. The relative reflectance dependency with ozone was minimal. Bright reflectance outliers were associated with large AOD events, whereas darker outliers were related to cloud events. The improved Libya-4 approach provides Aqua-MODIS C6.1 channel stability assessments that range between 0.5% for the 1.6-mu m band and 0.9% for the 0.46-mu m band.

TI  - Daily monitoring algorithms to detect geostationary imager visible radiance anomalies
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides observed flux and cloud products for the climate science community. Geostationary satellite (GEO) imager measured clouds and broadband derived fluxes are incorporated in the CERES SYN1deg product to provide regional diurnal information in between Sun-synchronous Terra and Aqua CERES measurements. The recently launched GEO imagers with onboard calibration systems have active calibration teams that incrementally update the calibration in order to mitigate calibration drifts. However, short-term L1B radiance anomalies and calibration adjustment discontinuities may still exist in the record. To avoid any GEO cloud and flux artifacts in the CERES SYN1deg product, these calibration events must be addressed while scaling the GEO imagers to the Aqua-moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) calibration reference. All-sky tropical ocean ray-matching (ATO-RM) and deep convective cloud invariant target (DCC-IT)-based monitoring algorithms are presented to detect calibration-driven daily anomalies in the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager L1B visible (0.65 mu m) radiance measurements. Sufficient daily ATO-RM sampling was obtained both by ray-matching GOES-16 with multiple MODIS and visible-infrared imaging radiometer suite imagers as well as by increasing the grid resolution. Optimized angular matching and outlier filtering were most effective in reducing the ATO-RM daily gain algorithm noise. The DCC-IT daily calibration algorithm utilized a larger domain and included more GOES-16 scan times. The DCC-IT daily gain uncertainty was reduced by normalizing the DCC regional reflectance on a regional, seasonal, and diurnal basis. The combination of ATO-RM and DCC-IT daily monitoring algorithms is shown to detect, with a high degree of confidence, daily GOES-16 L1B calibration-driven radiance anomalies >2.4%, while keeping false positives at a minimum. Remarkably, the ATO-RM and DCC-IT daily gains are mostly within 0.5%. The ATO-RM and DCC-IT daily monitoring algorithms can be easily adapted to other GEO imagers and visible channels.

AB  - The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) has been affected by land subsidence for more than one decade, which is the result of different drivers, including groundwater over-exploitation and natural compaction of holocene layers. The exact share of the contributions is so far unknown. In this work, we systematically study the initial settlement of newly built constructions and built-up areas in two cities in the VMD by incorporating Temporary Persistent Scatterers (TPS) into an existing PS-InSAR approach. We find that the portion of appearing TPS with high initial subsidence rates is larger than the portion of PS and fading TPS with high subsidence rates. We furthermore cluster appearing TPS by their location and appearing date to identify and analyse new constructions and built-up areas and find that they can have really high initial settlement rates which statistically decrease over time. We attribute this signal to the loading-induced initial settlement of constructions which lack a proper foundation. We assume settlement of this kind to contribute noticeably to the measured total subsidence all across the VMD, especially due to the recent high building activity.

TI  - Fully Integrated Temporary Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is a powerful remote sensing technique to monitor displacements of the Earth's surface. It is based on identifying and analyzing phase-stable scatterers undergoing marginal decorrelation over time. Most PSI approaches constrain the analysis to scatterers which are coherent over the whole considered time series persistent scatterer (PS) and neglect scatterers which are only temporary persistent (TPS). Here, we propose a method to fully integrate TPS into an existing PSI approach which is characterized by an iterative parameter estimation with subsequent phase unwrapping. We build on a previously published method to identify TPS and estimate their coherent lifetime based on amplitude statistics. A phase-based likelihood ratio test is proposed to iteratively refine the appearing/fading dates of TPS during parameter estimation. Finally, we jointly unwrap the phase observations of PS and TPS to receive displacement time series. The temporal data of TPS are redefined if their lifetime does not cover the selected master scene. Experimental results based on Sentinel-1 data in the Vietnamese city of Ca Mau show that the change date refinement significantly increases the average coherence and number of identified TPS. The densification of the observation point network by incorporating TPS helps better detect and understand displacement phenomena. The displacement time series of TPS are beneficial to analyze the nonlinear motion in connection with urban development, like initial settlement of newly constructed buildings.

TI  - Alteration Detections Using ASTER Remote Sensing data and Fractal Geometry for Mineral prospecting in Hemich Area, NE Iran

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Nowadays, remote sensing studies are considered as one of the best methods in mineral prospecting. Considering that most of the important deposits of the world, such as porphyry copper and epithermal gold deposits are widely associated with alteration zones. Identification of the alterations can be a significant exploratory guide for these types of deposits. The spectral difference between altered and unaltered rocks is the most important way of detecting alteration areas and thus exploring ore deposits by means of remote sensing. In this research, ASTER image was used to identify alteration areas in the Hemich Area, NE Iran. Geometric corrections were made on images in order to reduce the spatial errors caused by displacements and distortions related to sensors. Radiometric corrections were also applied to reduce the spectral errors caused by atmospheric effects. Subsequently, mineral prospectus areas were identified using false-color composite, band ratio, and principal components analysis. Since the results of these methods are grayscale images, a concentration-area fractal method was used to distinguish the regions containing the alterations. Using the results of these methods, some areas with the highest probability of mineralization were discovered, which were compatible with the ground control points.

AB  - Short-term sea level fluctuations prompted by abrupt atmospheric changes can be hazardous phenomena for coastal regions. We report on two such recent storm surges that occurred in 2020 on the shores of British Columbia, Canada. A rare concordance of ground-based and spaceborne sensors made it possible to observe these events with a variety of instruments : (1) a coastal oceanographic radar; (2) the synthetic aperture radar onboard satellite Sentinel-1B; and (3) a network of shoreside tide gauges. In the light of these case studies we show how satellite radar data can be used to complement the observation and interpretation of ground-based measurements in the context of "tsunami-like" oscillations.

T2  - EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective - This study investigated researchers' perceptions of open access publishing and the ways in which the university's open access subvention fund could evolve to meet the campus community's needs.Methods - In spring 2021, two librarians conducted an anonymous survey using a convenience sample to recruit participants. The survey was directly distributed to 113 University of Idaho (U of I) affiliates who had received funding from, or expressed interest in, the open access subvention fund during the previous three years (FY 2019 to FY 2021). Other U of I affiliates were also offered the opportunity to participate in the survey via a link shared in the U of I's daily email newsletter as well across the U of I's graduate student email list. The researchers received 42 usable survey responses. The survey included 26 closed and open-ended questions and analysis included cross-tabulations based on fund applicant status as well as respondent role. Of the 26 questions, 4 were modified from a colleague's previous study with U of I faculty members (Gaines, 2015).Results - Survey responses showed that interest in and support for open access were common among respondents. Although a majority of respondents had published an open access journal article and would like to continue to publish open access in the future, only 17% agreed that they had departmental support to do so. Results also demonstrated that researchers were less willing to pay article processing charges (APCs) out-of-pocket and preferred for funding to come from grant budgets first, followed by Office of Research Budgets, department or college budgets, and library budgets. Respondents expressed support for many of the open access subvention fund's current criteria and processes, but they also indicated an interest in establishing a more equitable fund distribution cycle and allowing researchers to seek pre-approval once their article was accepted for peer-review. Findings related to open access publishing perspectives built upon previous research conducted at the U of I (Gaines, 2015) and across other institutions.Conclusion - This study confirmed the importance of evaluating and assessing library programs and services to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of campus communities. Through the study results, the researchers demonstrated that respondents were interested in open access publishing and the continuation of the open access subvention fund, as well as offering the U of I an opportunity to adjust the open access subvention fund's processes to better serve researchers. These results also highlighted the need for those involved in open access publishing support to investigate new open access advocacy and education efforts to ensure that researchers receive the philosophical and financial support they need to pursue different models of scholarly publishing.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - For decades, the design of remote sensors has to make trade-offs among many characteristics such as the field of view (FOV), spatial resolution, spectral resolution, radiometric resolution, and the number of bands. It's inevitable to weaken some characteristics to enhance others. Moreover, these problems lead to using multi-sources of remote sensing data in practical projects where a single sensor can't meet the relevant requirements. The Airborne Dual-mode High-resolution Hyperspectral Imager (ADHHI) provides a new solution to the above limitations by the technology of multi-camera stitching. In this way, many excellent but conflicting characteristics can be separated into different imaging sub-systems, and are combined together during data processing. Supported by related processing algorithms and software, ADHHI embeds many excellent characteristics into one system, such as high spatial resolution, high spectral resolution, and high radiometric resolution. Firstly, this paper picks some common imaging sensors to illustrate the problem of conflicting characteristics. Secondly, we introduce the camera structure and sensor parameters of ADHHI. Then, we sketch out the data processing workflow and elaborate on relevant principles and results of the whole geometric correction, such as homospectral stitching and hetero-spectral registration. Finally, this airborne hyperspectral imager's advantages and application prospects are concluded.

TI  - A Feature Fusion Airport Detection Method Based on the Whole Scene Multispectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Being one of the most important infrastructures, airports play a vital role in both civil fields and military fields. However, detect airports directly based on the whole scene remote sensing images (RSIs) with complex background remains challenging. To address this issue, this article proposes a method that mainly combines spectral features and geometric features of airports with concrete runways to detect multiple airports simultaneously from a whole scene multispectral image with medium-high spatial resolution and with comparatively few bands (contains blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands). Specifically, a decision tree algorithm was developed based on the analysis of spectral features to extract main concrete areas within the whole RSI. Then, the geometric features are used to aim at extracting the point marks of candidate airports. The influence of different image spatial resolutions of the proposed method is explored and the detection effect and processing efficiency of proposed method is verified based on whole scene RSIs with complex background. The analysis of experimental results shows that Sentinel-2 images is more suitable for airport detection than Gaofen-6 and Landsat-8 images based on the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method provides high-accuracy detection of category airports based on Sentinel-2 images with different background complexity in experimental areas indicate the proposed method has a high robust and a good applicability. Finally, run-time test of the proposed method was conducted, and it demonstrates the proposed method has the higher processing efficiency when applying to regional airport detection.

TI  - Exploring discrepancies between in situ phenology and remotely derived phenometrics at NEON sites
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the use of satellite sensors, near-surface cameras, and other remote methods for monitoring vegetation phenology at landscape and higher scales has become increasingly common. These technologies provide a means to determine the timing of phenophases and growing season length at different spatial resolutions; coverage that is not attainable by human observers. However, in situ ground observations are required to validate remotely derived phenometrics. Despite increased knowledge and expertise there still remains the persistent challenge of reconciling ground observations at the individual plant level with remotely sensed (RS) phenometrics at landscape or larger scales. We compared the timing of in situ phenophase estimates (spring and autumn) with a range of corresponding remote sensing (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer [MODIS], visible infrared imaging radiometer suite [VIIRS], PhenoCam) phenometrics across five terrestrial sites in the United States' NEON (Harvard Forest [MA] [HARV], Onaqui [UT] [ONAQ], Abby Road [WA] [ABBY], Disney Wilderness Preserve [FL] [DSNY], and Ordway-Swisher Biological Station [FL] [OSBS]) focusing on the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019. Our main objective was to explore potential reasons for the observed discrepancies between in situ and RS phenometrics and to determine which technologies were better able to capture ground observations. Statistically significant relationships were strongest (p < 0.001) for spring phenophases, while the only RS phenometrics significantly correlated with in situ estimates of autumn phenophases were leaf fall (p < 0.01) and leaves (p < 0.000). In particular, root mean square error (RMSE) (mean bias error [MBE]) for MODIS-Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 band (EVI2), VIIRS-EVI2, and PhenoCam-green chromatic coordinate (GCC) derived early spring transition dates indicated overall differences of 21.7 days (-4.6 days), 28.4 days (-1.2 days), and 24.1 days (11.9 days) from in situ estimates of early leaf-out dates. In autumn, RMSE/MBE was smallest (10.9 days/-2.2 days) between phenesse estimates (95th percentile date) of the latest date of in situ leaf fall and VIIRS derived end of senescence, compared to the equivalent phenometric derived from MODIS (13.5 days/7.7 days) and PhenoCam (GCC greenness-falling) (13.8 days/-5.1 days). Overall, discrepancies between in situ and RS phenology related to scale, species availability, and the short duration of the time series (3 years). However, as the NEON project progresses these challenges are expected to be reduced as more data become available.

TI  - Nietzsche's Struggle with Pessimism
T2  - TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR FILOSOFIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the development of Nietzsche's thought on pessimism in the light of his own reflections. Drawing on GT, the late prefaces he wrote around 1886 (GT, MA, M, FW), the fifth book of FW, and unpublished notes, it recon-structs the several meanings that Nietzsche attributes to 'pessimism.' It focuses on the complex relation between 'romantic' and 'Dionysian' pessimism. It is shown that these two forms of pessimism are rooted in Nietzsche's ambivalent metaphysical pessimism in GT, which is influenced by Schopenhauer and the tragic Greeks. This approach is distinguished from the later Nietzsche who attempts to redefine his struggle with pessimism in order to 'forget' the metaphysical background, and to understand pessimism as a symptom of historical and psychological conditions. Nietzsche consequently understands his own thought as a continuation of Schopen-hauer's critique of the Christian worldview, which leads to the problem of nihilism. Nietzsche attempts to show how it is possible to overcome romantic pessimism and European morality, if he also suffers the consequences of nihilism. In order to tackle this problem, Nietzsche formulates a dynamic of self-overcoming which needs both strength and weakness, health and sickness.

TI  - How does the brown mussel Perna perna respond to environmental pollution? A review on pollution biomarkers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The brown mussel Perna perna (Linnaeus, 1758) is a valuable resource for aquaculture in tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It presents desirable characteristics for biomonitoring, including being sessile, widely distributed and abundant, and is a filter-feeder able to accumulate several classes of pollutants (e.g., metals, hydrocarbons, among others). Mussels' biological responses to pollution exposure can be measured as biomarkers, which include alterations ranging from molecular to physiological levels, to estimate the degree of environmental contamination and its effects on biota. This full review compiles two decades (2000-2020) of literature conceming biological effects on P. perna mussel caused by environmental pollutants (i.e., metals, hydrocarbons, and emerging pollutants), considering environmental and farm-based biomonitoring. Biochemical markers related to mussels' oxidative status were efficient for the biomonitoring of metals (i.e., antioxidant enzymes associated with oxidative damage in biomolecules). Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity indicators (i.e., comet, micronucleus, and neutral red assays) provided a depiction of hydrocarbon contamination. The neutral red assay gave a time-concentration cytotoxic response to a wide range of pollutants, including emerging pollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and biocides) and hydrocarbons. Perna perna hemocyte parameters provided a useful approach for biocide biomonitoring. This paper summarizes useful biomarkers from molecular to physiological levels in this mussel species used to identify and quantify the degree of coastal pollution. An integrated biomarker analysis may provide a way to overcome possible biomarker variations and assess multi-polluted sites. Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate biomarker variations according to natural factors (e.g., season and gonad maturation stage) to standardize them for trustworthy biomonitoring.

TI  - MULTITEMPORAL SEGMENTATION OF SENTINEL-2 IMAGES IN AN AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION REGION IN BRAZIL

AB  - With the recent evolution in the sensor's spatial resolution, such as the MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) of the Sentinel-2 mission, the need to use segmentation techniques in satellite images has increased. Although the advantages of image segmentation to delineate agricultural fields in images are already known, the literature shows that it is rarely used to consider temporal changes in highly managed regions with the intensification of agricultural activities. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate a multitemporal segmentation method based on the coefficient of variation of spectral bands and vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 images, considering two agricultural years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) in an area with agricultural intensification. Images of the coefficient of variation represented the spectro-temporal dynamics within the study area. These images were also used to apply an edge detection filter (Sobel) to verify their performance. The region-based algorithm Watershed Segmentation (WS) was used in the segmentation process. Subsequently, to assess the quality of the segmentation results produced, the metrics Potential Segmentation Error (PSE), Number-of-Segments Ratio (NSR), and Euclidean Distance 2 (ED2) were calculated from manually delineated reference objects. The segmentation achieved its best performance when applied to the unfiltered coefficient of variation images of spectral bands with an ED2 equal to 7.289 and 2.529 for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, respectively. There was a tendency for the WS algorithm to produce over-segmentation in the study area; however, its use proved to be effective in identifying objects in a dynamic area with the intensification of agricultural activities.

TI  - Revenge Is a Genre Best Served Old: Apocalypse in Christian Right Literature and Politics
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Apocalypse is a phenomenology of disorder that entails a range of religious affects and experiences largely outside normative expectations of benevolent religion. Vindication, judgment, revenge, resentment, righteous hatred of one's enemies, the wish for their imminent destruction, theological certainty, the triumphant display of right authority, right judgement, and just punishment-these are the primary affects. As a literary genre and a worldview, apocalypse characterizes both the most famous example of evangelical fiction-the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins-and the U.S. Christian Right's politics. This article's methodological contribution is to return us to the beginnings of apocalypse in Biblical and parabiblical literature to better understand the questions of theodicy that Left Behind renews in unexpected ways. Conservative white Christians use apocalypse to articulate their experience as God's chosen but persecuted people in a diversely populated cosmos, wherein their political foes are the enemies of God. However strange the supersessionist appropriation, apocalypse shapes their understanding of why God lets them suffer so-and may also signal an underlying fear about the power and attention of their deity.

AB  - Remote sensing is a powerful tool for tracking surface waterbodies at different scales and spatial and temporal resolutions. The efficient management of water resources, at basin or regional scales, requires the monitoring of water storage in reservoirs. In reservoirs where storage observations are available or a surface water-storage curve exists, storage can be estimated using optical remote sensing. Therefore, this study uses image segmentation to estimate the surface area of three large reservoirs to predict surface water storage volumes. We established a surface area- storage relationship using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), produced from Landsat imagery using the Google Earth engine code editor interface, to estimate surface water storage for the New Melones, Don Pedro and McClure reservoirs located in central California. Observed storage showed a very high correlation (R= 0.990) with remotely sensed surface area estimates. The results show that the modeled storage values derived from fitted equations of the remote sensing methodology were highly correlated (R >= 0.993, p-value < 0.001) with observed storage data. Monitoring surface water storage using satellite data is thus demonstrated, as is seasonal and inter-annual variations of storage levels, which are estimated with small errors and high predictive power (R-2 >= 0.987, PBIAS <= +0.6%, NSE >= 0.989).

AB  - k nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, a non-parametric and one of the machine learning techniques had been popularly used for stand-level AGB estimation. kNN algorithm has two distinct parameters which are concerning the distance and the number of nearest neighbors (k) and the distance of target plots with reference plots. This study was conducted to assess the effects of the number of k, reference plots density, and distance of target plots with reference plots on the performance of the kNN algorithm in estimating stand-level AGB information. Using the surface reflectance of the Sentinel-2 image, the effects of the number of k (3, 5, 8, 11), reference plots density (high=3932 pixels, low=656 pixels), and the distance of the target and reference plots (2km, 5km, and 10km) to the prediction error of the kNN algorithm were assessed. The performance of the kNN was assessed using the RMSE and RMSPE as evaluation criteria. The 3-way factorial ANOVA was used to determine the main and interaction effects of the variables. The results showed that the number of k, reference plot density, and the distance of target plots with reference plots have a significant effect on the prediction error of the kNN algorithm. The PRMSE increases with the increasing distance and decreased with the increased number of k. Further, the PRMSE was low when the reference plot density was high. The PRMSE can be improved by as much as 13% when the reference plot density is sufficient and when an optimal number of k and distance are used for the parameters.

AB  - Widely used to calculate illumination geometry for estimates of solar and emitted longwave radiation, and for correcting remotely sensed data for topographic effects, digital elevation models (DEMs) are now extensive globally at 10-30-m spatial resolution and locally at spatial resolutions down to a few centimeters. Globally, regionally, or locally, elevation datasets have many grid points. Many software packages calculate gradients over every grid cell or point, but in the mountains, shading by nearby terrain must also be assessed. Terrain may obscure a slope that would otherwise face the Sun. Four decades ago, a fast method to calculate topographic horizons at every point in an elevation grid required computations related only linearly to the size of the grid, but grids now have so many points that parallel computing still provides an advantage. Exploiting parallelism over terrain grids can use alternative strategies: among columns of a rotated grid, or simultaneously at multiple rotation angles, or on different tiles of a grid. On a multi-processor machine, the improvement in computing time approaches 2/3 the number of processors deployed.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regions around the world experience adverse climate-change-induced conditions that pose severe risks to the normal and sustainable operations of modern societies. Extreme weather events, such as floods, rising sea levels, and storms, stand as characteristic examples that impair the core services of the global ecosystem. Especially floods have a severe impact on human activities, hence, early and accurate delineation of the disaster is of top priority since it provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits and eases relief efforts. In this article, we introduce OmbriaNet, a deep neural network architecture, based on convolutional neural networks, that detects changes between permanent and flooded water areas by exploiting the temporal differences among flood events extracted by different sensors. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, we generated OMBRIA, a bitemporal and multimodal satellite imagery dataset for image segmentation through supervised binary classification. It consists of a total number of 3.376 images, synthetic aperture radar imagery from Sentinel-1, and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, accompanied with ground-truth binary images produced from data derived by experts and provided from the Emergency Management Service of the European Space Agency Copernicus Program. The dataset covers 23 flood events around the globe, from 2017 to 2021. We collected, co-registrated and preprocessed the data in Google Earth Engine. To validate the performance of our method, we performed different benchmarking experiments on the OMBRIA dataset and we compared with several competitive state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental analysis demonstrated that the proposed formulation is able to produce high-quality flood maps, achieving a superior performance over the state-of-the-art. We provide OMBRIA dataset, as well as OmbriaNet code at: https://github.com/geodrak/OMBRIA.

TI  - Determining the regional tectonic stress field by remote sensing in the Bou Azzer inlier, Central Anti-Atlas, Morocco
T2  - MINING OF MINERAL DEPOSITS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. This paper deals with the determination of the regional stress field direction of the Bou Azzer inlier using the re-mote sensing tool.Methods. In this study, we use an approach to digital mapping by remote sensing, including the steps of pre-processing and processing of Landsat-8 OLI images. Then, an automatic extraction of lineaments based on directional filtering has been per-formed. To determine the main directions of major mean fractures, these results have been supplemented and confirmed by an integrated model, including a synthesis of bibliographic works and field studies.Findings. The directional rosette analysis results show four systems of major directions namely, N0 degrees, N45 degrees, N90 degrees and N135 degrees. The regional stress field in the study area, according to tectonic history, is characterized by a horizontal compression tectonic regime, as indicated by several systems of strike-slip faults with a high tendency to deformation. Thus, the abundance of brittle and ductile microtectonic indicators confirms the direction of the main compressive stress N degrees 30. The direction of the three-dimensional stress field: Sigma 1: N degrees 30, Sigma 2: N degrees 120, Sigma 3: Vertical component.Originality. The present study allows to determine the regional stress field direction of the Bou Azzer inlier, in particular, in areas affected by complex tectonics of various scales, as well as in hard-to-reach areas.Practical implications. In mining practice, the study of stability using 2D and 3D geotechnical numerical modeling of un-derground mine workings is essential. The stress field direction is an important input parameter to develop more realistic deci-sion support models, as well as to ensure the safety of people and materials at the Bou Azzer mine.

AB  - The modernization of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) requires the large scale and frequent monitoring of agricultural land. Towards this direction, the free and open satellite data (i.e., Sentinel missions) have been extensively used as the sources for the required high spatial and temporal resolution Earth observations. Nevertheless, monitoring the CAP at large scales constitutes a big data problem and puts a strain on CAP paying agencies that need to adapt fast in terms of infrastructure and know-how. Hence, there is a need for efficient and easy-to-use tools for the acquisition, storage, processing and exploitation of big satellite data. In this work, we present the Agriculture monitoring Data Cube (ADC), which is an automated, modular, end-to-end framework for discovering, pre-processing and indexing optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images into a multidimensional cube. We also offer a set of powerful tools on top of the ADC, including i) the generation of analysis-ready feature spaces of big satellite data to feed downstream machine learning tasks and ii) the support of Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) analysis via services pertinent to the monitoring of the CAP (e.g., detecting trends and events, monitoring the growth status etc.). The knowledge extracted from the SITS analyses and the machine learning tasks returns to the data cube, building scalable country-specific knowledge bases that can efficiently answer complex and multi-faceted geospatial queries.

AB  - The use of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can improve the performance of persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI). However, its huge potential remains locked for the amplitude information-based offset tracking (OT) technology. For example, to the best knowledge of the authors, there is no single example of a polarization-based image optimization method that has been developed for OT processing. In this article, an amplitude contrast enhancement (ACE) algorithm is introduced, which demonstrates the potential of the polarimetric SAR data on the improvement of OT performance. Its core idea is finding the optimal combination of the different scattering mechanisms for each pixel to improve the contrast. First, the orientation of the reflected polarization ellipse is removed, to avoid the influence of the geometric relationship between the antenna and the target, and the properties of the target. Then three similarity parameters are defined to represent the three basic reflection types of the single bounce, the double bounce, and the random reflection. After that, the optimizing equation is constructed with two optimizing vectors. Finally, the optimizing vectors are calculated to obtain the enhanced amplitude image. Three examples of the enhancement are presented with different PolSAR images sets of both full- (Radarsat-2) and dual-polarization (TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1). The performance of ACE-OT has been compared with another method, the adaptive histogram enhancement (AHE). The impact of the number of polarization channels available on ACE-OT performance has also been studied.

TI  - Agricultural Land Abandonment and Retirement Mapping in the Northern China Crop-Pasture Band Using Temporal Consistency Check and Trajectory-Based Change Detection Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment and retirement are important and lead to different types of land use and cover change. Generally, abandonment and retirement are caused by different social and environmental factors and result in different ecological and economic benefits and costs. Faced with the complexity of agricultural land change over time, this study aims to develop a new framework to distinguish between agricultural land abandonment and retirement and detect the extent and exact year of abandonment and retirement using Google Earth Engine (GEE). We tested our approach for three typical regions in the northern China crop-pasture band, where agricultural land abandonment and retirement are widespread. First, based on the spectral features obtained from Landsat images, annual land-cover maps were obtained with sample migration and random forest from 1998 to 2019 (0.87 overall accuracy). Second, a temporal consistency check method was proposed to further improve the classification performance (0.92 overall accuracy). Third, a trajectory-based change detection approach was developed to identify abandonment and retirement (F1 score for abandonment: 0.74, retirement: 0.83). Our results indicate that the spatiotemporal patterns of abandonment and retirement in the study area greatly differed. Overlapping of the topography and climate data showed that agricultural land with steep slopes (>10 degrees) was more likely to be retired and that abandonment was more likely to occur in areas with less precipitation. Overall, the methods used herein are robust for agricultural land abandonment and retirement monitoring and may be extended to other land-cover change studies.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution Characteristics of Global Annual Maximum Land Surface Temperature Derived from MODIS Thermal Infrared Data From 2003 to 2019
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in the physical processes of energy and water balance at the local and global scales. The annual maximum composite of LST provides important information about ecosystem exposure patterns to extreme LST. It has the ability to characterize the changes associated with extreme climatic events and significant land-cover changes. In this study, the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of global annual maximum LST extracted from the MODIS LST product (MYD11A1) during the period 2003-2019 were investigated. The results indicate that the spatial pattern of annual maximum LST is associated with the biophysical and biogeographic factors of Earth's ecosystems. The interannual variability of annual maximum LST during the period 2003-2019 is relatively small. The changing trend of annual maximum LST during the period 2003-2019 in the globe is 0.1 degrees C/decade. The annual maximum LST data was applied to detect thermal anomalies, including drought, heat waves, and ice melting. Some significant thermal anomaly events were well identified using the annual maximum LST data with a standardized anomaly index larger than 2.5.

M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improving diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), we assessed the value of combining clinicopathological, conventional ultrasound, SWE features in the cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients.METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 285 patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer who underwent preoperative ultrasound examination of the lesion and axillary, with shear wave elastography (SWE) of the lesions. According to the postoperative pathological results, they were divided into <= 2 metastatic ALNs group (low nodal burden, LNB) and > 2 metastatic ALNs group (high nodal burden, HNB). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to screen independent risk factors and establish prediction models. The best cut-off value of continuous variables is determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the performance of the prediction model is evaluated.RESULTS: Presence of lymphovascular invasion (OR = 7.966, P = 0.010), tumor size (OR = 2.485, P = 0.019), Emean of intratumor (OR = 0.939, P = 0.002) and cortical thickness of lymph node (OR = 9.277, P < 0.001) were independent risk predictors for HNB of cT1-2N0 Group. The predictive model of combined method had better performance in predicting HNB of cT1-2N0 compared with models based on SWE and conventional ultrasound alone (area under the curve: 0.824 vs 0.658, P < 0.001; 0.824 vs 0.789, P = 0.035).CONCLUSIONS: The predictive models of combined method obtained from significant clinicopathological and ultrasonographic features can potentially improve the diagnosis and individual treatment of ALNM in patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer.

AB  - The detection of invasive plant species in aquatic ecosystems is important to help in the control or to mitigate its spread and impacts. Remote sensing (RS) can be explored in this context, helping to monitor this type of plants. This study intends to present a free to use and open-source software application that, through a graphical user interface, can process remote sensed data to monitor the spread of invasive plant species in aquatic environments, enabling a multi-temporal monitoring. Both unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite-based data were used to validate the potential of the proposed application. A site containing water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) was selected as case study. Both RS platforms provided effective data to detect the areas containing water hyacinth. Thus, this tool provides an alternative and user-friendly way to include RS-based data in ecological studies allowing the detection of invasive plants in water channels.

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XIII Part of SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The vegetation phenology is defined as the seasonal timing of recurring biological events, the causes of their timing, their relationship to biotic and abiotic forces, and the interrelations among phases of the same or different species. Phenology is one of the most reliable indicators of vegetation dynamics Geographical Information Systems (GIS) combined with freely available satellite imagery significantly contributes to the study of vegetation phenology. A GIS open-source application that estimates vegetation phenology metrics from time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as proxies for phenology was already been developed. The application was based on products from MODIS sensor (MOD13 data) and considered two crops, vineyards and maize However, this application is now obsolete in the recent version of QGIS software. This work aims to develop an improved version of the open-source application to automatically extract the phenological metrics from a set of Sentinel 2 input data. Sentinel 2 has the advantage of also being free, with higher spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, being particularly suitable for "in-season crop forecasting". Several limitations found in the previous version can be surpassed with the use of Sentinel 2 data. For instance, the small farms, due to the presence of multiple land cover types within a pixel, can now be monitored with much greater confidence. The application is free and open source, so it can be modified according to the user requirements and adopted to different crops and regions.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the remote sensing evidence of the harmful algal bloom at the coast of Kamchatka, a widely reported ecological disaster in the autumn of 2020. We analyzed time series of relative chlorophyll concentration anomaly maps derived from Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI data and historical sea surface temperature data from Sentinel-3 SLSTR. Significant chlorophyll concentration anomaly values were observed during September and October of 2020. There was also a notable increase in sea surface temperature compared to earlier years. Both of these effects are indirect evidence for the presence of an algal bloom. Without any in situ measurements, our results do not constitute an irrefutable case by themselves, but in conjunction with extensive on-site investigation reports, leave a harmful algal bloom as the only plausible explanation.

TI  - Treatment of Locally Advanced Merkel Cell Carcinoma-A Multi-Center Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer with unfavorable outcomes. Surgery remains the standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced disease. Perioperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be considered in selected patients. Analyzing 161 patients with locally advanced MCC treated with curative intent, we found that over one-third of patients developed disease recurrence. The use of perioperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of disease recurrence by over 50%. The 5-year overall survival rate was 55%. Moreover, we identified male gender, age above 70, metastases in lymph nodes at diagnosis, and no sentinel lymph node biopsy as factors associated with shorter overall survival. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive skin cancer with a high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. The treatment of locally advanced disease involves surgery and radiotherapy. To analyze real-life treatment patterns and clinical outcomes, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 161 MCC patients treated with curative intent in four oncological centers in Poland. The median age at diagnosis was 72 years (30-94); 49.7% were male. Lymph node (LN) involvement at diagnosis was found in 26.9% of patients. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in 36.5% of patients (positive in 10.5%), and 51.9% of patients received perioperative treatment. The relapse rate was 38.3%. With the median follow-up of 2.3 years, the median disease-free survival (DFS) was not reached, and the 1-year rate was 65%. The negative independent risk factors for DFS were male gender, metastases in LN at diagnosis, no SLNB in patients without clinical nodal metastases, and no perioperative radiotherapy. The estimated median overall survival (OS) was 6.9 years (95% CI 4.64-9.15). The negative independent risk factors for OS were male gender, age above 70, metastases in LN at diagnosis, and no SLNB in patients without clinical nodal metastases. Our results confirm that the MCC treatment should be conducted in an experienced multidisciplinary team; however, the outcomes are still unsatisfactory.

TI  - Multisensor Machine Learning to Retrieve High Spatiotemporal Resolution Land Surface Temperature
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is making heat waves more frequent, long-lasting, and severe. While multiple satellite types provide data to monitor surface temperature, geostationary (GEO) sensors provide near-continuous, continental-scale observations which can better capture the diurnal variability of land surface temperature (LST) than intermittent observations from low-earth orbit (LEO) sensors. However, standard products from GEO satellites are available at coarsened spatial and temporal resolutions compared to the native sensor resolution. Using datasets from the NASA Earth Exchange, we leveraged co-located, co-temporal observations from LEO and GEO satellites to learn a data-driven mapping using a convolutional neural network. The resulting NASA Earth eXchange Artificial Intelligence LST (NEXAI-LST) achieved a mean absolute error of 1.73 K relative to the target LEO product and improves on both spatial and temporal resolution [2 km, 10 minute] compared to the GEO full disk standard product [10 km, hourly]. In validation against measurements from a ground-based sensor network, NEXAI-LST achieves similar or better fit than both LEO and GEO standard products, while depending none of the prior knowledge of land surface and atmospheric states required by physical-statistical models. Further, application of the model to unseen LEO and GEO satellites demonstrates robust generalization of the model across spatial region, time of day, and sensor. In support of NASA's open-source science initiative, we make our NEXAI-LST product, model, and codes available to facilitate data exploration and further studies.

UAV survey takes place on 3rd march 2021, using the acquired images, vegetation indices were calculated without resampling the UAV data. Sensitivity of the two techniques is depicted by their correlation coefficient between the vegetation indices using the random point data of all the indices. The difference in the point value and range is due to the difference in spatial resolution. Five, chosen indices, shown good correlation between two techniques. NDVI shows the maximum similarity with a correlation coefficient of 0.77.

TI  - Semantic decomposition of four Quranic words Mark DURIE
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the author proposes Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) semantic decompositions of four difficult-to-translate quranic Arabic words using Natural Semantic Metalanguage (Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014, Wierzbicka 2021). This is the first study to propose an explicit semantic explication of these core Islamic lexical items, which are foundational for the spiritual worldview of the almost two billion followers of Islam in the world today. The first word considered is rasul, which refers to intermediaries sent by Allah to humans and is used in the Quran alongside nabi, which has almost the same meaning. An NSM semantic explication of rasul is contrasted with explications of biblical Hebrew naba' `prophesy' and nabi' `prophet'. In English translations of the Quran, rasul is usually rendered as `messenger' and nabi as `prophet', yet these translations are misleadingly inadequate. Three further quranic concepts are examined, which have received the most diverse and unsatisfactory renderings in English translations of the Quran: shirk `association' and kafir `disbeliever' refer to two dimensions of disbelief, and ittaqa, a difficult-to-translate verb, refers to cautious piety. The use of Natural Semantic Metalanguage overcomes the resistance of these terms to translation into English, by means of fine-grained semantic explications using semantic primes. These explications are designed to be readily accessible to speakers of languages other than English.

TI  - Africanized honeybee population (<i>Apis mellifera</i> L.) in Nicaragua: Forewing length and mitotype lineages
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Various subspecies of Apis mellifera L. were introduced to Central America since colonization 500 years ago. Hybridization increased with the entrance of the Africanized bee in Nicaragua in 1984. Rustic beekeeping activities and numerous feral swarms define the genetic pattern, reflected in phenotypic heterogeneity and remarkable differences in the behaviour of the bee colonies, especially the nest defence. Due to these facts, the question emerge about the degree of Africanization of honeybee colonies in Nicaragua. In this study, we identified Africanized honeybee colonies based on the single character "mean forewing length" and we corroborated our results by determining mitotypes using mtDNA analysis. Morphometric and genetic approaches were realized in three different geographical zones of Nicaragua and related to beehive characteristics and management. Worker bee samples were taken from the inside of 146 hives from 26 apiaries. Abdominal colour as phenotypic character was the first examination, followed by measurement of 1460 right forewings to determine corresponding probability of Africanization. More than 60% of the beehives showed phenotypic heterogeneity and mean forewing length of 8.74 mm (SD 0.16 mm) indicated a high degree of Africanization. Those results provided a selection of 96 worker bees to perform PCR of two worker bees per hive. For mitochondrial DNA analysis 14 samples from sentinel apiaries were added. Three from 61 beehives presented bees with different mtDNA. Throughout, three mitotypes of the African (A) lineage were detected; one mitotype is still unidentified. Mitotype A1 A. mellifera iberiensis was represented by 88 bees and mitotype A4 A. mellifera scutellata by 21 bees. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the PCR findings. No associations were found between mitotypes, forewing length, beehive characteristics and management. A high degree of Africanization in A. mellifera colonies represented by two predominating mitotypes from the A lineage, prevail in Neotropical Nicaragua, with mitotype A4 predominating at higher altitudes.

Methodologically, the study rests on the system approach that assumes the dialectical unity of the assimilation of the concrete (Karl Marx) and using the method of alternatives (Karl Popper). Historically, the role of the starting point of economic theory was claimed by: 1) the most abstract concepts, such as labour, Homo economicus, etc.; 2) ostensive definitions of a commodity, an "ordinary person", etc., allowing one to rely on personal (implicit) knowledge. An analysis of the methodology of scientific knowledge shows that, when ascending from the abstract to the concrete, there is a high probability of falling into the induction trap, which can be avoided through structural similarity (homomorphism) of the object and its theoretical representation (model). This approach allows identifying the functional characteristics of economic phenomena and processes, such as the correspondence of supply and demand in the Walrasian system of general equilibrium equations (the Arrow-Debreu model). The other approach is premised on faith, worldview, intuition, which stimulate qualitatively new hypotheses to be formulated. The two approaches interact and complement each other, forming a continuum of economic knowledge, where there are no clearly defined frontiers, and the genesis can, explicitly or implicitly, happen in each of the constituent elements forming a single whole (scientific article, dissertation, textbook, etc.). It is relevant for any scholar, and even more so for a lecturer, to hold a holistic view of the subject of the discipline under study, its relationship with other knowledge areas and reality.

TI  - CATEGORY OF EVENTFULNESS IN INTERDISCOURSE
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on the interaction between two socially significant discourses - law discourse and literary discourse, forming a unique linguo-socio-cultural space - interdiscourse. This interdiscourse, the formation of which is associated with a specific historical-legal communicative situation - to transfer knowledge from a highly specialized, closed legal field to the public in order to solve some urgent social problems - is actua-lized in the artistic worldview in the novel on various levels of meaning generation. Unpredictable correlations in the text of a literary work emerging at the junction of two polar discourses, and requiring dynamic "switching" of the mindset - legal and creative, are suggested to be considered through the rhizome-model of event-driven narration. This structural matrix makes it possible to bring together two worldviews in the recipient's mind, to trace discursive transformations and new meanings, to detect multiplicative effects arising during studying the series of events in the novel. The category of discursive eventfulness reflects significant changes in the histo-ricallegal reality of England in the mid 19th century (in particular, in Chancery Court) and allows the researcher to evaluate the integrity of a literary work functioning on the borderline between two polar, but equally socially significant discourses. By combining separate fragments separated from one another in the textual space of the novel, the category of eventfulness facilitates the modeling of semantic connections of the "cause - effect" type. The identified types of the category of discursive eventfulness (event-emblem, event-node, event-retrospective, event-interference, event-accumulation) describe one macro-event - the crisis in the Chancery Court - from different points of view. Due to a wide range of literary descriptive means, Ch. Dickens manages not only to create a prototypical image of reality, but also to demonstrate his legal consciousness himself - to act as a "homo linguis".

AB  - On average, about half of all optical satellite data observing Earth is covered by haze or clouds. These atmospheric disturbances hinder the ongoing observation of our planet and prevent the seamless application of established remote sensing methods. Accordingly, to allow for an ongoing monitoring of Earth, approaches to reconstruct optical space-borne observations are required. This work introduces a new data set, SEN12MS-CR-TS, for the purpose of multi-sensor time series cloud removal. SEN12MS-CR-TS consists of co-registered radar and optical satellite data, featuring a sequence of bi-weekly observations throughout an entire year. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of our novel data set by developing a new multi-sensor time-series cloud removal architecture. We are positive that our curated data set as well as the proposed model will advance future research in satellite image reconstruction and benefit the expanding adaptation of global and all-weather remote sensing applications.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - About half of all optical observations collected via spaceborne satellites are affected by haze or clouds. Consequently, cloud coverage affects the remote-sensing practitioner's capabilities of a continuous and seamless monitoring of our planet. This work addresses the challenge of optical satellite image reconstruction and cloud removal by proposing a novel multimodal and multitemporal data set called SEN12MS-CR-TS. We propose two models highlighting the benefits and use cases of SEN12MS-CR-TS: First, a multimodal multitemporal 3-D convolution neural network that predicts a cloud-free image from a sequence of cloudy optical and radar images. Second, a sequence-to-sequence translation model that predicts a cloud-free time series from a cloud-covered time series. Both approaches are evaluated experimentally, with their respective models trained and tested on SEN12MS-CR-TS. The conducted experiments highlight the contribution of our data set to the remote-sensing community as well as the benefits of multimodal and multitemporal information to reconstruct noisy information. Our data set is available at https://patrickTUM.github.io/cloud_removal.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Accurate human perceived color cannot be obtained from most multispectral imagery (MSI) sensors without post-processing, as sensor spectral response is often not in parity with the spectral sensitivities of the human visual system. In this experiment, 30 WorldView-2 and WorldView-3, 8-band visible-through-near-infrared (VNIR) images were collected over a color array consisting of 24 16-ft x 16-ft plywood targets painted to match the Macbeth ColorChecker scheme. The images were atmospherically compensated using the Empirical Line Method (ELM), and 6-band reflectance spectra covering the visible wavelengths were harvested from the image for each color target. These reflectance spectra were reconstructed to high-resolution spectra using spectral basis functions derived from a principal component analysis (PCA) performed on a set of high-resolution spectra measured from a calibrated color standard. Initial reconstruction performance was evaluated by comparing reconstructed spectra to high-resolution ground truth spectra using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Reconstructed spectra were then converted to CIELAB (L*a*b*) values using the D65 illuminant, and CIE 1931 2 degrees Standard Observer. Reconstructed L*a*b* values were compared to ground truth L*a*b* values using the CIEDE2000 (Delta Epsilon(*)(00)) color difference metric, and colorimetric accuracy of the process was evaluated. It was found that this method derived absolute colors with a median accuracy of Delta Epsilon(*)(00) < 6 across all color targets and images.

TI  - Rivers in reverse: Upstream-migrating dechannelization and flooding cause avulsions on fluvial fans
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of river avulsion builds floodplains and fills alluvial basins. We report on a new style of river avulsion identified in the Landsat satellite record. We found 69 examples of retrogradational avulsions on rivers of densely forested fluvial fans in the Andean and New Guinean alluvial basins. Retrogradational avulsions are initiated by a channel blockage, e.g., a logjam, that fills the channel with sediment and forces water overbank (dechannelization), which creates a chevron-shaped flooding pattern. Dechannelization waves travel upstream at a median rate of 387 m/yr and last on average for 13 yr; many rivers show multiple dechannelizing events on the same reach. Dechannelization ends and the avulsion is complete when the river finds a new flow path. We simulate upstream migrating dechannelization with a one-dimensional morphodynamic model for open channel flow. Observations are consistent with model results and show that channel blockages can cause dechannelization on steep (10(-2) to 10(-3)), low-discharge (similar to 10(1) m(3) s(-1)) rivers. This illustrates a new style of floodplain sedimentation that is unaccounted for in ecologic and stratigraphic models.

AB  - Jeonggamnok(鄭鑑錄) refers to books that handed down Korea’s own secret prophecies that have been handed down since the mid to late Joseon Dynasty. It also refers to the faith in the contents of these books which consisted of divination and prophecy. The purpose of this paper is to accurately understand the meaning of the phrase ‘tiandiyinyang xianweizhǔzhang(天地陰陽 先爲主 張)’ that usually appears at the beginning of several Jeonggamnok books. This phrase is the dialogue theme of characters appearing in ‘Gamgeol(鑑訣)’, ‘Bijiron(秘知論)’, and ‘YiJeong lyusanron(李鄭流山論)’ and so on, which is key materials among the various editions of Jeonggamnok. And this phrase can be said to be derived from the worldview of ‘tiandiyinyang(天地陰陽)’, which runs through the entire Jeonggamnok. Since the existing translation of this phrase is not accurate, anyone who attempts to understand the phrase in Jeonggamnok faces difficulties. This paper is focused on analyzing ‘Huipiao(會 票)’, a chronicle of the history of the universe presented by Jeonggam in unit of Hui(會, 10,800 years per one hui), in ‘Jeonggammundap(鄭堪問答)’, a edition that shows the characteristics of understanding ‘tiandiyinyang’.The main point of this paper is to argue that if you combine ‘tiandiyinyang’ like a single vocabulary and understand the meaning, the narrative of Jeonggamnok can be understood more clearly. This is an important understanding obtained through a comparative analysis of various Jeonggamnok editions and ‘Jeonggammundap’, and a contextual analysis within the same text.In conclusion, the meaning of ‘tiandiyinyang xianweizhǔzhang’ is, ‘tiandiyinyang presides over first’. In other words, in the overall context of Jeonggamnok, it means “First, I will judge and prophesy the future based on ‘tiandiyinyang’. This will be an understanding that is consistent with the worldview of ‘tiandiyinyang’ in Jeonggamnok reflecting feng shui(風水) based on yinyang ideas. Finally, this study can find its contribution in that it provides an accurate source for clarifying the meaning of the phrase ‘tiandiyinyang xianweizhǔzhang’, which can be compared to the threshold or gate of Jeonggamrok’s world.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation Using Sentinel-1/-2 Imagery Coupled With CycleGAN for Time-Series Gap Filing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast soil moisture content (SMC) mapping is necessary to support water resource management and to understand crop growth, quality, and yield. Therefore, earth observation (EO) plays a key role due to its ability of almost real-time monitoring of large areas at a low cost. This study aimed to explore the possibility of taking advantage of freely available Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) EO data for the simultaneous prediction of SMC with cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) for time-series gap filling. The proposed methodology, first, learns latent low-dimensional representation of the satellite images, then learns a simple machine learning (ML) model on top of these representations. To evaluate the methodology, a series of vineyards, located in South Australia & x2019;s Eden valley are chosen. Specifically, we presented an efficient framework for extracting latent features from S1 and S2 imagery. We showed how one could use S1 to S2 feature translation based on CycleGAN using S1 and S2 time series when there are missing images acquired over an area of interest. The resulting data in our study is then used to fill gaps in time-series data. We used the resulting latent representations to predict SMC with various ML tools. In the experiments, CycleGAN and the autoencoders were trained with data randomly chosen around the site of interest, so we could augment the existing dataset. The best performance was demonstrated with random forest (RF) algorithm, whereas linear regression model demonstrated significant overfitting. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods if there are missing optical and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images.

AB  - The current processes of national revival of the minor indigenous peoples of Russia include not only a return to the origins of national culture, but also have a religious component. Attempts are being made everywhere to reproduce ancient religious traditions and cult practices. However, the transformation of the religious state that took place during the 20th century has not been studied enough. We have little reliable data on how the active introduction of Soviet ideology influenced this transformation. The article examines the secularisation processes that took place during the Soviet period in the territory of the Nenets Autonomous District (NAO) and reveals the peculiarities of their influence on the life of the minor indigenous people of Russia, i.e., the Nenets. This people are heterogeneous due to their wide area of settlement; therefore, various factors influenced the formation of their religious worldview. The Nenets of the NAO differ from the Nenets living in Yamalo-Nenets and Taimyr (Dolgano-Nenets) Districts not only in terms of their dialect, but also in their cultural traditions. When considering the Nenets of the NAO, it was revealed that the Soviet secularisation influenced them to a greater extent than the Nenets of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District and Taimyr (Dolgano-Nenets) District. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to find out how the Soviet secularisation influenced the worldview of the Nenets of the NAO. The methodology of this study is based on K. Dobbelere's concept of the three-level model of secularisation. The materials of the State Archive of Nenets Autonomous District, the local newspaper Naryana Vynder and results of the field research in the territory of the Nenets Autonomous District from 2014 to 2019 were used as sources.

AB  - Methane emissions monitoring is essential to control methane pollution. In this paper, we propose an automatic practical methodology using time series to estimate the quantity of methane in a given plume using a multispectral satellite like Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 proposes a low revisit time, a good spatial resolution and a low acquisition cost. Contrary to previous methods, the proposed approach does not require a manual selection of an optimal reference image. We compared its performance on an oil-and-gas site in Kazakhstan. This is the first step toward an automatic global monitoring system for methane plume detection and quantification with these satellites.

TI  - NowCasting-Nets: Representation Learning to Mitigate Latency Gap of Satellite Precipitation Products Using Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely estimation of precipitation is critical for issuing hazard warnings (e.g., for flash floods or landslides). Current remotely sensed precipitation products have a few hours of latency, associated with the acquisition and processing of satellite data. By applying a robust nowcasting system to these products, it is (in principle) possible to mitigate this latency and improve their applicability, value, and impact. However, the development of such a system is complicated by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, lack of sufficient knowledge about the evolution of precipitation systems based on previous observations, and the consequent rapid changes that can occur in the structures of precipitation systems. In this work, we develop two approaches (hereafter referred to as NowCasting-nets) that use recurrent and convolutional deep neural network (DNN) structures to address the challenge of precipitation nowcasting. A total of five models are trained using global precipitation measurement (GPM) Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation data over the Eastern contiguous United States (CONUS) and then tested against independent data for the Eastern and Western CONUS. The models were designed to provide forecasts with a lead time of up to 1.5 h, and by using a feedback loop approach, the ability of the models to extend the forecast time to 4.5 h was also investigated. The performance of the models was compared against the random forest (RF) and linear regression (LR) machine learning (ML) methods, a persistence benchmark (BM) that uses the most recent observation as the forecast, and optical flow (OF). Independent IMERG observations were used as a reference, and experiments were conducted to examine both overall statistics and case studies involving specific precipitation events. Overall, the forecasts provided by the NowCasting-net models are superior, with the convolutional NowCasting-net (CNC) achieving 42%, 24%, 18%, and 16% improvement on the test set mean squared error (MSE) over the BM, LR, RF, and OF models, respectively, for the Eastern CONUS. Results of further testing over the Western CONUS (which was not part of the training data) are encouraging and indicate the ability of the proposed models to learn the dynamics of precipitation systems without having explicit access to motion vectors and other auxiliary features and then to generalize to different hydro-geo-climatic conditions.

AB  - Road traffic noise represents a global health issue. Despite its importance, noise data are unavailable in many regions of the world. We therefore propose to approximate noise data from satellite imagery in an end-to-end Deep Learning approach. We train a U-Net segmentation model to estimate road noise based on freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and existing road traffic noise estimates for Switzerland. We are able to achieve an RMSE of 8.8 dB(A) for daytime traffic noise and 7.6 dB(A) for nighttime traffic noise with a spatial resolution of 10 m. In addition to identifying major road networks, our model succeeds to predict the spatial propagation of noise. Our results suggest that this approach provides a pathway to estimating road traffic noise for areas for which no such measures are available.

AB  - Solar energy is in rapid development in Morocco. Thanks to its geographical and climatic location, the Kingdom of Morocco is privileged to develop large-scale solar energy exploitation. The knowledge of the solar potential in a given site is crucial for most solar energy applications. The present study aims to evaluate the energy potential in several cities in Morocco to provide guidance to solar energy users about the available amount of energy. The assessment was done using 10 years of data from the Helioclim3 satellite database. In addition to the solar potential analysis, we performed a classification of the days to determine the dominant climatology based on the clear sky index. The results showed the dominance of clear days toward all study sites, and selected sites may be a promising location for solar projects with annual global horizontal irradiation reaching 2075 kWh/m(2) and direct normal irradiation reaching 2463 kWh/m(2).

AB  - The present work uses a classification approach based on an artificial neural network (ANN) of the Multilayer Perceptron type (MLP). This algorithm was used to better discriminate individuals by highlighting non-linear relationships that are impossible to obtain with classical ordination methods. This method consists of projecting the spectrum of a gas, taken from remote sensing data, onto a three-dimensional space, using a MLP type neural network model. The latter adopts, during the training process, the gradient back-propagation algorithm, during which the mean squared error (MSE) at the output is continuously calculated and fed back to the input until it reaches a fixed minimum threshold, in order to correct the synaptic weights of the network. In this context, the ANN will provide undeniably effective solutions for classification. We have shown in this study that for the classification of gases (H2S-NO2 mixture, H2S, NO2), the best performing model is the one that uses as transfer functions, the Tansig function in the hidden layer and the Purelin function in the output layer, while using a Scalar Conjugate Gradient (SCG) training algorithm.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we aim to evaluate urban sprawl dynamics and surface temperature changes between 1985 and 2019, and to predict a future scenario of their evolution in 2027 and 2038 in great El Jadida city using Landsat images. We compared the resulting maps using spatio-temporal and statistical analysis. The results reveal that the built-up area increased by 5,121 ha (247%) between 1985 and 2019 (34 years). During the same period, the surface temperature was mutated in the distribution of different temperature intervals, marked essentially by an increase in the areas where the surface temperature was between 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C and a decrease in areas where the temperature was above 30 degrees C. The overlapping of urban extension evolution and the surface temperature maps reveals the impact of urban extension on surface temperature spatial distribution. Finally, the Markov cellular automata model application allowed prediction in the map forms of future changes in 2027 and 2037.

TI  - Detection and 3D Modeling of Potential Buried Archaeological Structures Using WorldView-3 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the world, cultural heritage sites are under the direct threat of damage or destruction due to developing environmental and anthropogenic hazards, such as urban expansion, looting, and rising water levels. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that many of the most vulnerable sites' exact locations and/or full spatial extents have yet to be uncovered, making any attempts at their protection exceedingly difficult. However, the utilization of earth observation data has recently emerged as an unmatched tool in the exploration and (digital) preservation of endangered archaeological sites. The presented research employs very high-resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery (~30 cm) for identifying and delineating previously unknown subsurface archaeological structures at the ancient Egyptian site of Hermopolis (el-Ashmunein). A particular emphasis is placed on the application of spectral indices, specifically those looking at vegetation cropmarks and iron oxide levels. Through this analysis, seven promising structures were identified, including three elongated installations, which may have been utilized for storage purposes, and a potential casemate foundation structure. As 2D outlines of structures are often difficult to visualize, the newly identified archaeological features were expanded into a realistic, georeferenced 3D model using the computer programs, SketchUp Pro and Chaos V-Ray. The goal of this 3D model is to ensure that the results derived from this research are more accessible (and tangible) to a wider audience-the scientific community and the public alike. The methodological scheme presented in this article is highly adaptable and with some minor modifications can be replicated for other archaeological sites worldwide.

TI  - Wild Plant Habitat Characterization in the Last Two Decades in the Nile Delta Coastal Region of Egypt
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental and land-use changes put severe pressure on wild plant habitats. The present study aims to assess the biodiversity of wild plant habitats and the associated spatiotemporal environmental changes in the coastal region of Dakahlia Governorate following an integrated approach of remote sensing, GIS, and samples analysis. Thirty-seven stands were spatially identified and studied to represent the different habitats of wild plants in the Deltaic Mediterranean coastline region. Physical and chemical characteristics of soil samples were examined, while TWINSPAN classification was used to identify plant communities. Two free Landsat images (TM and OLI) acquired in 1999 and 2019 were processed to assess changes via the production of land use and cover maps (LULC). Moreover, NDSI, NDMI, and NDSI indices were used to identify wild plant habitats. The floristic composition indicated the existence of 57 species, belonging to 51 genera of 20 families. The largest families were Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Chenopodiaceae. The classification of vegetation led to the identification of four groups. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed that electrical conductivity, cations, organic carbon, porosity, chlorides, and bicarbonates are the most effective soil variables influencing vegetation. The results of the spectral analysis indicated an annual coverage of bare lands (3.56 km(2)), which is strongly related to the annual increase in vegetation (1.91 km(2)), water bodies (1.22 km(2)), and urban areas (0.43 km(2)). The expansion of urban and agricultural regions subsequently increased water bodies and caused occupancy of bare land, resulting in the development of wild plant habitats, which are mostly represented by the sparse vegetation class as evaluated by NDVI. The increase in mean moisture values (NDMI) from 0.03 in 1999 to 0.15 in 2019 might be explained by the increase in total areas of wild plant habitats throughout the study period (1999-2019). This may improve the adequacy of environments for wild habitats, causing natural plant proliferation.

TI  - Sub-regional Trend of HIV Infection Among Antenatal Clinic Attendees in Andhra Pradesh (2003-2019)
T2  - CURRENT HIV RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The analyses of local risks at sub-national levels and tailored interventions are being emphasized for effective HIV management. Andhra Pradesh (AP) is a high HIV prevalence state in India, with the second-highest number of People with HIV (PWH) and a consistent decline in HIV prevalence at the state level. Probing further into the region and district-wise levels and trends of HIV prevalence will provide critical insights into sub-regional epidemic patterns. Hence, this paper analyzes the regional and district-level trends of HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics (ANC) from 2003 to 2019 in AP, South India. Methods: HIV prevalence data collected from pregnant women in AP during HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) between 2003 and 2019 was used for trend analysis. The consistent sites were grouped into three regions (Coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema and Uttar Andhra), totaling 39 sites, including 21 rural and 18 urban sites. Regional and district-level HIV prevalence was analyzed using the Chi-square trend test, and spatial analysis was done using QGIS software. For the last three HSS rounds, HIV prevalence based on sociodemographic variables was calculated to understand the factors contributing to HIV positivity in each region. Results: In total, 143,211 pregnant women were recruited. HIV prevalence in AP was 0.30% (95% CI: 0.22 - 0.39) in 2019. The prevalence was 0.31%, 0.35% and 0.22% in Coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema and Uttar Andhra, respectively. HIV prevalence had significantly (P < 0.05) declined in all regions. The overall trend indicated that the HIV prevalence was higher among older pregnant women and in urban regions. However, recent trends consistently report HIV positivity among young and new pregnant mothers, illiterates, and rural regions. Conclusion: The overall trend indicated that the HIV prevalence was higher among older pregnant women and in urban regions. However, recent trends consistently report HIV positivity among young and new pregnant mothers, illiterates, and rural regions. Identifying the contextual risk patterns associated with HIV transmission will further improve HIV preventive and management programs among the general population.

TI  - Using the Pauli Scattering Mechanisms for Analysis of Polarimetric SAR Images from RADARSAT Constellation and TanDEM-X Missions
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes techniques for extraction of information in polarimetric images from RADARSAT constellation mission (RCM) and TanDEM-X (TDX) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellites. Using the boundary conditions of Maxwell's equations it is shown how the single bounce and double bounce scattering can be extracted from quad-pol and compact polarimetric (CP) SAR. We develop new equations to calculate the Pauli decomposition from simulated CP data using RCM quad-pol data. The RCM CP option is circular transmit, linear receive. We find that using quad-pol data performs better than using CP data for Pauli decomposition, especially extraction of the HV component. Estimation of single bounce and double bounce scattering from RCM CP data is feasible and yields more information about scattering properties than the CP components alone. We show how more information can be extracted from bistatic TSX/TDX quad-pol data by estimation of the coherence of the different Pauli components and optimization of the interferometric coherence using ships as detection objects. This is a unique opportunity to use optimized coherence on moving ships for characterizing their structure.

AB  - Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have seen a surge in deployment over the past few years by virtue of their ability to provide broadband Internet access as well as to collect vast amounts of Earth observational data that can be utilized to develop AI on a global scale. As traditional machine learning (ML) approaches that train a model by downloading satellite data to a ground station (GS) are not practical, Federated Learning (FL) offers a potential solution. However, existing FL approaches cannot be readily applied because of their excessively prolonged training time caused by the challenging satellite-GS communication environment. This paper proposes FedHAP, which introduces high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed parameter servers (PSs) into FL for Satcom (or more concretely LEO constellations), to achieve fast and efficient model training. FedHAP consists of three components: 1) a hierarchical communication architecture, 2) a model dissemination algorithm, and 3) a model aggregation algorithm. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that FedHAP significantly accelerates FL model convergence as compared to state-of-the-art baselines, cutting the training time from several days down to a few hours, yet achieving higher accuracy.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to perform a retrospective analysis of the feasibility of the clinical application of SLNB using methylene blue dye (MBD) for the identification of SLN followed by frozen section biopsy to detect occult metastasis in clinically N0 necks. Hence, to know the reliability of MBD in reducing the need for extensive surgery.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinic pathological data of 48 patients with early oral cancer.The SLN identiﬁcation rate (IR) was calculated in SLNB with MBD and the false-negative rate (FNR). Intra operative frozen section biopsy was done for all patients was compared with post-operative paraffin histopathology report and the prognosis of patients was analyzed.RESULTS: Analysis of the 48 SLNB cases showed that there were significant differences in SLN successful detection rate among patients with different site (p=0.043) and clinical presentation (p=0.007). Similar significant results (p<0.05) were observed with intra-operative frozen and post-operative paraffin histopathology sections. SLNs were successfully detected in 37(77.1%) patients out of 48. The intra operative frozen histopathology completely matched with the post-operative paraffin histopathology showing 39 (81.2%) negative and 09 (18.8%) positive cases. A prognostic analysis of SLN detection based on 48 patients showed that the 5-year survival rate was 100%.CONCLUSION: MBD has acceptable SLN identification rate and a low FNR(false negative report) in frozen sections. Stained SLNs with no SLN metastasis are associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Hence, MBD-SLN biopsy has significantly reduced the need for extensive neck dissection in N0 neck with less morbidity.

TI  - Direct Comparison of Sea Surface Velocity Estimated From Sentinel-1 and TanDEM-X SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the first direct comparison of the sea surface radial velocity (RVL) derived from the two satellite SAR systems Sentinel-1 and TanDEM-X, operating at different frequencies and imaging modes. The RVL is derived from the Doppler centroid (Dc) provided in the Sentinel-1 OCN product and from the along-track interferometric phase of the TanDEM-X. The comparison is carried out using unique opportunistic acquisitions, collocated in space and time, over three different sites located in the Iceland Sea, the Pentland Firth, and the Kattegat Sea. First, it is observed that the RVL derived from both satellites is biased, thus calibration is applied using the land as a reference. The comparison shows that the correlation and the mean bias between the two datasets depend on the differences in acquisition time, incidence angle, and azimuth angle, and on wind and surface velocities. It is found that, given a time difference of less than or similar to 20 min, the spatial correlation coefficient is relatively high (between 0.70 and 0.93), which indicates that the two SAR systems observe similar sea surface current fields. The spatial correlation degrades primarily due to increasing time difference and decreasing velocity magnitudes. It is also found that the mean RVL bias increases primarily with the radial wind speed, which suggests that the bias is mainly due to the wave-induced Doppler shift. This article shows that under certain conditions, i.e., similar acquisition geometry and short time delay, a good agreement between the two independently derived RVL is achieved, both in the spatial variation and absolute mean value. This encourages a synergistic use of the sea surface velocity estimated from different C- and X-band SAR systems.

TI  - Geothermal Well Exploration in Nigeria Using Remote Sensing and Modified Thermal Equations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the preliminary evidence of volcanoes, hot springs, and Geysers in parts of Nigeria, it is proposed that deep geothermal wells can be found in Nigeria. This research uses thermal anomalies zones to identify types of geothermal wells in Nigeria, i.e., using remote sensing and modified thermal equations. The remote sensing dataset includes the ground heat flux (GHF) dataset from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) of 28 years; sediment thickness dataset from EarthData; and surface geology from LANDSAT. The thermal transport model was used to narrow potential locations across Nigeria using the ground heat flux and sediment thickness, while the surface geology was used to confirm the deep geothermal zones. Four GHF patterns were discovered in Nigeria. The research shows that the deep geothermal wells might be located in Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Ekiti, Kogi, Benue, Nassarawa, and Taraba. Also, the medium-depth geothermal wells may be located in Sokoto, Zamfara, Kastina, Kwara, Oyo, and Jigawa States. It was revealed that the southern parts of Nigeria have lots of shallow geothermal wells. The deep geothermal wells can be found in the Chad Basin and Benue trough, while the medium -depth geothermal wells can be found in the Sokoto basin, Bida basin, and parts of the lower Benue trough. It is recommended that further ground trotting exploration be carried out in the identified geographical locations.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the cultural characteristics, worldview, and cultural hybridity of the negidal through funeral protocols. The funeral protocols encompasses the entire process from death, funeral, yu(虞) funeral, and the soul transfer rites(送魂式). Although shamans do not participate in funeral and yu funeral, do participate in the soul transfer rites. Therefore, the funeral rites of negidal is a complex ceremony in which the ideas of different layers from different times are mixed. The size and procedure of funerals vary depending on the deceased's surname, age, social status, and cause of death. Based on the notion that men stand for the number 3 and women for the number 4, men play the 3-day rites and women the 4-day rites. The funeral is gradually converted into a rites for the soul of the deceased, a rites for the middle realm between the soul of the deceased and an ancestor spirit, and a rites for an ancestor spirit. The yu funeral funeral is held on the 7th day after the funeral, and the soul transfer rites is held 1-3 years after the funeral. Funerals for children, twins, and drowning people are different from ordinary funerals for those who have died. This is due to the notion that children who died before the age of one go directly to the underworld. and are reincarnated, twins are integrated into the natural gods, and drownings are integrated into the world of fetishes.

AB  - In this paper, the cultural identity of the Nivh people is investigated through the analysis of the view of the cosmos and the soul. The Nivh are an indigenous people group in the lower Amur River and on the island of Sakhalin. For the Nivh people, the idea that the universe is a three-tiered world of upper world tli, middle mif, and lower mlibo, and each world is divided into multiple layers, is most widely spread. In particular, the relay is divided into three worlds: the world of the mountain-taiga, the world of the sea, and the world where the Nivh people live. In general, the concept of a middle ground developed among the Nivh people, but the idea of the upper and lower worlds was not very developed. However, in the Nivh concept, these worlds are independent but interpenetrating relationships, and each world influences the other world according to its rules and rules of conduct.At the root of the traditional beliefs of the Nivh people lies the animism that all things in the universe, including humans, have souls. According to the concept of the Nivh people, the human soul is in the form of a bird. During life, the bird's nature is hidden by the body, but after cremation, it is separated from the body and freed, regaining its original animal nature. The Nivh concept of the number of human souls is very unclear and fluid. The notion that the human soul has one tan or one tehn is universal, and tan and tehn originate from t'ad- (breathe, breathe/ nivh). The core of the Nivh view of the soul is immortality through reincarnation, and the birth of a child is due to the reincarnation of an ancestor spirit.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the originality and hybridity of these worldviews through the udege's conception of the shape of the universe and the structure of the universe as a three-tiered world based on the mythological data of the udege. In the concept of the udege, the shape of the universe was transformed into an inseparable unity in the mythological concept, and a flat square in the topographical and ecological concept. In the concept of the udege, the universe is a three-tiered structure of upper, middle, and lower worlds, and each world is further divided into multiple layers. Little is known about the structure of the upper ugu buga (ulije na, ba na) in the udege's conception, the emergence and completion of the relay bar in the concept of the udege is a process to establish the order of the universe, and it goes through the stages of existence of the original oceanthe appearance of the earththe appearance of three suns and the death of two suns by a cultural hero. In the notion of the udege, the hegi uhe ba is structured as a first floor for kengma oyoni, a second floor for dokini oyoni, and a third floor for buniga. The cosmological view of the udege is located at the midpoint between the northern tungus tribe, the southern tungus tribe, and the paleoasiatic nivh.

AB  - In this paper, the concept of the indigenous peoples of the Far East regarding the three-tiered worldview as the structure of the universe and the cosmic tree, the cosmic river, and the cosmic mountain as the central axis of the cosmos was examined. The core of the universe view of the indigenous peoples of the Far East is a three-tiered worldview that the universe is a structure of the upper world, the middle world, and the lower world. In the notion of the indigenous peoples of the Far East, the central axis of the universe is embodied as the cosmic tree, the cosmic river, and the cosmic mountain. The cosmic river has a function similar to the cosmic tree, but the cosmic tree has a strong element of totemism that views the universe vertically, singly, and integrally. In the notion of the indigenous peoples of the Far East, the cosmic mountain is a fusion of a vertical and horizontal model of the universe, and is generally embodied as a big deer or a reindeer with horns touching the sky.

TI  - Adapting InSAR Phase Linking for Seasonally Snow-Covered Terrain
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis of natural terrain allows for characterization of long-term geophysical trends over extended areas and, in the case of distributed scatterers (DSs), is significantly enhanced by methods that exploit the full complex-valued scattering statistics. Phase-linking (PL) estimators impose a phase-closure constraint in order to estimate the temporal wrapped-phase history of a DS directly from its complex backscatter sample coherence matrix. Some PL methods, such as the SqueeSAR and maximum-likelihood-estimator of Interferometric phase (EMI) estimators, rely on knowledge of the coherence magnitude matrix. The true coherence magnitude is a priori unknown and must therefore be estimated from the data. Bias in these estimated coherence magnitudes reduces PL performance when the true coherence magnitude is low. Many areas of the Earth are seasonally snow-covered and, for natural terrain, this leads to severe cross-season decorrelation. This poses a significant challenge for PL estimators due to bias of the near-zero cross-season coherence magnitude estimates. We introduce a clustering approach to mitigate the PL estimator bias problem that exploits the fact that in natural terrain, many DSs decorrelate similarly. This allows for averaging over large numbers of same-behaving DS, which provides robust debiasing of the coherence magnitudes used during PL. We apply our method to a RADARSAT-2 spotlight-mode InSAR dataset over a site in the western Canadian Arctic and demonstrate significant reductions in a posteriori phase variance when compared to existing PL methods.

AB  - This paper discusses the alignment of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image pairs with one image acquired at L- and the other at C-band. For our study we used data from ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 taken over sea ice in the Fram Strait. The use of multifrequency SAR data is beneficial for sea ice characterization and classification because it combines the advantages of the frequency dependence of signal penetration depths and backscattering characteristics due to small-scale ice properties. For drifting sea ice, however, an immediate combination of image pairs acquired with a time gap is usually not possible. Such cases require to consider the effects of ice drift. In this study we investigate the possibility to compensate for sea ice drift for separation in acquisition time ranging from a few hours to several days. The first results are promising and suggest that alignment of SAR image pairs obtained at different frequencies is possible even for larger time gaps between acquisitions if drift and deformation can be estimated reliably.

TI  - Assessment of Natural Plant Communities through the Use of Remote Sensing Data of the Stavropol Territory Steppes
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The relevance of the study of steppe phytocenoses is caused by the unsatisfactory state of natural grass stands, namely a low level of biodiversity and a high degree of degradation. The aim of the work is to determine the features of the connection of the Earth remote sensing data with the state and degree of degradation of natural grass stands in unstable moistening zone and arid zone of the Stavropol Territory. The Earth remote sensing data with certain temporal and spatial resolutions make it possible to carry out almost continuous monitoring of the state of natural grass stands.Materials and Methods. The study of steppe phytocenoses was carried out in 2016-2020 on the ground at discount areas (100 m(2)) according to the requirements of methods generally accepted in phytocenology. Vegetation condition was assessed using the Earth remote sensing data based on the values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. According to the satellite data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index cartograms were constructed for each point of the study.Results. The proportion of polygons with a high degree of degradation is 18.8% of research objects located in the zone of unstable moistening and the proportion of polygons with an average degree of degradation is 37.5%, while in the arid zone 70.6 and 23.5%, respectively. In the zone of unstable moistening, the highest coefficients of rank correlation between the degradation degree and the area occupied by herbaceous vegetation with a certain value of the vegetation index are observed in the case if Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is in the range of 0.0-0.4, and in the arid zone 0.0-0.3 (at 0.01 significance level).Discussion and Conclusion. When using the Earth remote sensing data to assess the degree of degradation of steppe ecosystems of the Stavropol Territory, it is necessary to use regression models specific to various soil and climatic conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Management of the hydropower plants requires the economically efficient use of water re-sources based on the forecasts and simulation models of the hydropower plant and the reservoir. There are various data sources for the water inflow forecasting: meteorological and hydrological posts, Earth remote sensing. However, the problem arises of combining the specified heterogeneous data for aggre-gated processing with the use of machine learning methods. The research goal is to design an architec-ture of a system for collecting and processing data from various sources to operational forecast of the water inflow and the reservoir water-level. It was achieved by analyzing and selecting the sources and methods for using Earth remote sensing data; observing the main principles of hydrological modeling; assessing the availability of the different data; analyzing the ways of increasing the observability of the hydrological objects by installing additional meteorological and hydrological posts; and designing a technology for the automatic data collection and processing. The most significant results are developed architecture of the data collection and processing system and the technology for aggregating heteroge-neous data with the use of machine learning methods. It is aimed to reduce the error of short-term fore-casting of the water inflow to the reservoir. The significance of the results lies in the fact that the pro-posed technology was proposed and justified for a real hydropower plant; and it can improve the water resources management efficiency: increase the energy generation, minimize the sterile spills, increase the flood forecasting horizon and reduce the risk of flooding during the spring high water.

TI  - Natural Afforestation on Abandoned Agricultural Lands during Post-Soviet Period: A Comparative Landsat Data Analysis of Bordering Regions in Russia and Belarus
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote monitoring of natural afforestation processes on abandoned agricultural lands is crucial for assessments and predictions of forest cover dynamics, biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services. In this work, we built on the general approach of combining satellite and field data for forest mapping and developed a simple and robust method for afforestation dynamics assessment. This method is based on Landsat imagery and index-based thresholding and specifically targets suitability for limited field data. We demonstrated method's details and performance by conducting a case study for two bordering districts of Rudnya (Smolensk region, Russia) and Liozno (Vitebsk region, Belarus). This study area was selected because of the striking differences in the development of the agrarian sectors of these countries during the post-Soviet period (1991-present day). We used Landsat data to generate a consistent time series of five-year cloud-free multispectral composite images for the 1985-2020 period via the Google Earth Engine. Three spectral indices, each specifically designed for either forest, water or bare soil identification, were used for forest cover and arable land mapping. Threshold values for indices classification were both determined and verified based on field data and additional samples obtained by visual interpretation of very high-resolution satellite imagery. The developed approach was applied over the full Landsat time series to quantify 35-year afforestation dynamics over the study area. About 32% of initial arable lands and grasslands in the Russian district were afforested by the end of considered period, while the agricultural lands in Belarus' district decreased only by around 5%. Obtained results are in the good agreement with the previous studies dedicated to the agricultural lands abandonment in the Eastern Europe region. The proposed method could be further developed into a general universally applicable technique for forest cover mapping in different growing conditions at local and regional spatial levels.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a reliable and valid instrument for determining worldviews towards astrobiology subjects of prospective science teachers. With this purpose, an instrument called as "Inventory of Worldview related to Astrobiology Subjects (IWAS)" was developed by the researchers. The validity and reliability studies of the instrument was conducted with 192 prospective teachers studying in Science Education Department. The validity studies was conducted with the experts from the different fields. According to the expert opinions, "temperature", "water" an "oxygen" was determined as themes in the instrument and then five different worldview as "Anthropocentric", "Ecocentric", "Earth Centric, "Teleological" and "Essentialist" were included in each item placed under these themes. For the construct validity of the instrument, the correlations between items and between each item and total score was examined and it was observed that the instrument has single dimensional structure in terms of investigated variable. Test-retest method was used for the reliability and it was seen that the instrument has consistency for determining worldviews toward astrobiology of prospective science teachers. As a result, in the descriptive analyses performed with the reliable and valid instrument, it was observed that the prospective science teachers' worldview on astrobiology subjects were dominated by the ecocentric worldview.

AB  - An approach for a Robot Sentinel is described as an alternative to medicinal or physical fixation. The robot offers the opportunity to give the patient some privacy while also offering protection from falling out of bed. This approach is solely based on input data given by a Kinect One. A database with IR data with labels according to the sleep stages of the patient was generated. With given database the presented framework is able to detect the movement of the patient in bed from given input data and therefore warn the staff, if a possible harmful situation occurs. In two different experimental phases the approach could be tested and was able to successfully recognize different sleeping phases of the patient (e.g. unsettled sleep, falling asleep and wakeup phase). An unsettling sleep serves as an indication of waking up and therefore the possible desire of standing up. Recognizing those sleeping phases and counteracting this desire, preserves the patient from falling out of bed and potential injury.

M3  - Article
AB  - Through the works of the authors that we have gathered here under the name of concentration prisoners, or also prisoners of lager, such as the Spaniard Jorge Semprun (1923-2011), the Romanian-Israeli Aaron Appelfeld (1932-2018), the Austrian nationalized Belgian Jean Amery (1912-1978) or the Hungarian Imre Kersterz (1929-2016), we propose a reflection on the linguistic dehumanization that runs parallel to the withdrawal of the human condition of prisoners. Each of the authors cited will try to find a way out of the confinement that can not left behind, because they still live the lager as their most daily reality. If Appelfeld decides to look at soah from the innocence of a child, assuming a worldview in which creativity is at a stage prior to rationalization and conceptualization, thus avoiding skepticism, to explain the non-biographical realism of his novels, Kersterz must to mark distances and justify itself in the face of the new French realism that spre-ads under Robe-Grillet's objectivism; while Semprun defends the "artifice " as a way of communicate not only about the unimaginable, but about the unlivable, Amery, in turn, narrates, first from perplexity and then from desolation and anger, the existential emptiness of seeing his language native invaded by totalitarianism. Through them, we observe the different literary and existential solutions, not always successful, to get out of a confinement that keeps them in its midst.

TI  - Daily and Seasonal Variation of Aerosol Optical Depth and Angstrom Exponent over Ethiopia using MODIS Data
T2  - POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are tiny particles (liquid or solid) suspended in the atmosphere. They play a significant role in climate dynamics directly or indirectly. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) are significant parameters to study the concentration and size or type of aerosol over an area, respectively. In this article, we utilized three years of AOD and AE parameters derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite during the period January, 2013 to December, 2015 over Ethiopia. In order to study the spatiotemporal pattern of aerosols, we choose three areas (Debretabour, Gojjam and Addis Ababa) over Ethiopian highlands, which are representative of non-industrial, agricultural and industrial areas respectively. Further we compare continental aerosols with marine aerosols from Djibouti. Our results clearly depicts the aerosol distribution over Ethiopia is highly variable spatially and temporally. The results indicates that the urban and biomass aerosols are dominate over Addis Ababa, and Gojjam respectively, whereas dust and biomass aerosols are present over Debretabour, while Djibouti is loaded by sea spray aerosols. The seasonal variability of AOD is found to be maximum during the kiremt (summer) and minimum during bega (winter) over all areas (continental and marine).

TI  - Evaluation of relative abundance of lymphedema after reverse axillary mapping in patients with breast cancer
T2  - ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique identifies and preserves arm nodes during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Here, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of lymphedema following ARM. Materials and Methods: This is a clinical trial that was performed in 2019-2020 in Isfahan on patients with breast cancer in the early stages. Demographic and initial information of all cases including age and body mass index (BMI) was collected. Patients were then underwent SLNB & PLUSMN; ALND associated with ARM and were followed up for lymphedema every 6 months to a year. The occurrence of lymphedema was assessed. Results: By evaluating data of 102 patients, we found that 10 patients (9.8%) had lymphedema and patients with lymphedema had significantly higher age (P = 0.004), higher BMI (P = 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.018), and longer surgery duration (P < 0.001). The frequency of menopausal women was higher in patients with lymphedema compared to other cases (P = 0.001). Conclusion: The prevalence of lymphedema was high among patients undergoing ARM that was associated with factors including higher age, higher BMI, prolonged surgery duration, larger tumor size, and menopause. We believe that further comparative studies should be conducted on this issue.

AB  - Maritime trade and trasport occupy a pivotal position in the current era of globalization. Thus, monitoring ships at sea represents the starting point of this paper in which a novel approach to detect ships by wake has been proposed, based on Instance Segmentation deep learning architecture Mask R-CNN. In order to train and test this network, 766 wake chips cropped from 50 multispectral images acquired from Sentinel-2 satellites were observed. In particular, B2 (blue), B3 (green), B4 (red) and B8 (Infrared) bands were considered since they are all characterized by same resolution. The results proved that Mask R-CNN is capable to detect the vast majority of ship wakes with high confidence percentage in different configurations, i.e. slanted wakes, multiple wake scenarios or wakes in dark areas not related to their features.

TI  - Validation of Recent Altimeter Missions at Non-Dedicated Tide Gauge Stations in the Southeastern North Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent calibration and monitoring is a basic prerequisite for providing a reliable time series of global and regional sea-level variations from altimetry. The precisions of sea-level measurements and regional biases for six altimeter missions (Jason-1/2/3, Envisat, Saral, Sentinel-3A) are assessed in this study at 11 GNSS-controlled tide gauge stations in the German Bight (SE North Sea) for the period 2002 to 2019. The gauges are partly located at the open water, and partly at the coast close to mudflats. The altimetry is extracted at virtual stations with distances from 2 to 24 km from the gauges. The processing is optimized for the region and adjusted for the comparison with instantaneous tide gauge readings. An empirical correction is developed to account for mean height gradients and slight differences of the tidal dynamics between the gauge and altimetry, which improves the agreement between the two data sets by 15-75%. The precision of the altimeters depends on the location and mission and ranges from 1.8 to 3.7 cm if the precision of the gauges is 2 cm. The accuracy of the regional mission biases is strongly dependent on the mean sea surface heights near the stations. The most consistent biases are obtained based on the CLS2011 model with mission-dependent accuracies from 1.3 to 3.4 cm. Hence, the GNSS-controlled tide gauges operated operationally by the German Waterway and Shipping Administration (WSV) might complement the calibration and monitoring activities at dedicated CalVal stations.

TI  - Validation of North American land data assimilation system Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) air temperature forcing and downscaled data with New York State station observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and meteorological factors including temperature and associated heat exposure metrics are related to environmental health risk factors and the incidence of health effects. While meteorological station data provide a good source of point measurements, temporal and spatially consistent temperature data are needed for health studies. Reanalysis data such as the North American Land Data Assimilation System's (NLDAS) 12 km gridded product are an effort to resolve spatio-temporal environmental data issues. With funding from the NASA Applied Sciences Program, the NLDAS 12 km air temperature product has been downscaled to 1 km using MODIS Land Surface Temperature patterns. Limited validation of the native 12 km NLDAS reanalysis data has been undertaken. Our objective is to evaluate the accuracy of both the 12 km and 1 km downscaled products using the US Historical Climatology Network station data geographically dispersed across New York State for 2006, 2009, and 2010. These years were selected by a climatological analysis over the past 10 years that found 2006 to be a reference year with near-normal temperatures, 2009 a cool year and 2010 a warm year. Statistical methods including correlation, scatterplots, time series and summary statistics were used to determine the accuracy of the remotely sensed maximum and minimum temperature products. The effects of elevation and terrain slope on remotely sensed temperature product accuracy were determined with 10 m digital elevation data. National Land Cover Land Use data was used to determine the effect of mixed pixels on the accuracy of the NLDAS products. Results show the downscaled temperature product improves accuracy over the native 12 km temperature product with average correlation improvements from 0.82 to 0.87 for minimum and 0.76 to 0.85 for maximum temperatures. Higher terrain slope was related to lower correlations between stations and remotely sensed products. Stations in pixels with higher percentages of open water tended to have higher correlations. Our results inform health studies using remotely sensed temperature products to determine health risk from excessive heat by providing a more robust assessment of the accuracy of the 12 km NLDAS product and additional accuracy gained from the 1 km downscaled product.

T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Synchronous double cancers are an infrequent finding. The focus of this study was a case of diagnosed synchronous double breast cancer (BC) and axillary (Ax) follicular lymphoma (FL). The patient was a 73-year-old woman who had been visiting her local doctor for follow-up of a fibroadenoma of the left breast, and was referred to our hospital after being diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the left breast. Ultrasonography (US) revealed enlarged Ax lymph nodes (LNs) and US-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed. CNB revealed no metastasis of IDC; however, a diagnosis of FL was made. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with synchronous double BC and Ax FL and underwent partial surgical resection of the BC and close monitoring of the FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of malignant lymphoma diagnosed by CNB of Ax LNs during preoperative BC screening. CNB allows for a shorter waiting time for the examination, and it is considered to be minimally invasive, cost-effective and non-inferior to surgical resection in terms of specimen volume. Therefore, active preoperative evaluation of Ax LNs using US-guided CNB may contribute to BC staging, and may also help diagnose synchronous cancers.

TI  - High-Resolution Satellite Bathymetry Mapping: Regression and Machine Learning-Based Approaches
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote spectral imaging of coastal areas can provide valuable information for their sustainable management and conservation of their biodiversity. Unfortunately, such areas are very sensitive to changes due to human activity, natural phenomenon, introduction of non-native species, and climate change. Thus, the main objective of this research is the implementation of a robust image processing methodology to produce accurate bathymetry maps in shallow coastal waters using high-resolution multispectral WorldView-2/3 satellite imagery for the monitoring at the maximum spatial and spectral resolutions. Two different island ecosystems have been selected for the assessment, since they stand out for their richness in endemic species and they are more vulnerable to climate change: Cabrera National Park and Maspalomas Natural Protected area, located in the Balearic and Canary Islands, Spain, respectively. In addition, a third example to show the applicability of the mapping methodology to monitor the construction of a new port in Granadilla (Canary Islands) is presented. Contributions of this work focus on improving the preprocessing methodology and, mainly, on the proposal and assessment of new satellite-derived regression and machine learning bathymetric models, which have been validated and compared with respect to measured reference bathymetry. After a thorough analysis of nine techniques, using visual and quantitative statistical parameters, ensemble learning approaches have demonstrated excellent performance, even in challenging scenarios up to 35-m depth, with mean RMSE values around 2 m.

AB  - Today, the convergence of the real and virtual worlds has brought changes in lifestyle and consumption culture, and the meaning and role of places have also changed. The metaverse space has evolved into a concept that includes a place of communication that replaces the existing place for the MZ generation. In this study, we conducted a metaverse place branding strategic value study that provides multi-persona strategies and implications by examining identity psychologically and analyzing the characteristics of the MZ generation. As for the research method, domestic and foreign brand cases were analyzed and the MZ generation questionnaire was conducted on the metaverse spatiality component and multi-persona strategy application method. As a result of the analysis, first, it is necessary to build an expanded worldview centering on the brand IP. Second, multi-dimensional interactions must be provided for continuous activity. Third, the MZ generation and the brand must achieve cooperative co-creation. Fourth, it should enable a continuous multimodal experience. In order to expand contact points with the MZ generation who will lead the consumption culture in the future, it is necessary to reflect and actively utilize the multi-persona strategy by reflecting the characteristics of the MZ generation in the metaverse environment.

AB  - In the history of Korean literature, Son Chang Seop is a writer whose narrative aesthetics are outstanding. His literary personality was strong enough to receive a literary historical evaluation of an exceptional writer, a writer with a distinct personality. Son Chang Seop deeply embodied the tragic reality of the 1950s under the themes of disaster, migration, and refugees. His novels are characterized by narrative unexpectedness and ridiculous situation settings. Their main characters are also portrayed as helpless, or show indifference to the abordities of reality. The unexpected narrative, aesthetic ridiculousness, and non-mainstream worldview aroused enthusiastic response from readers in the 1950s.Son Chang Seop’s novels look at the ethics of the existing system from an unfamiliar perspective. This unique perspective has the power to deconstruct the existing social system. While keeping distance from the tragic reality of the 1950s, this appears to criticize the established system by shaping the world viewed by non-mainstream humans. At the heart of it lies the ‘aesthetic of ridiculousness’. Son Chang Seop’s novel world is evaluated as having folklore and currentity because the novels depict the criticism of the existing system, an unfamiliar perspective, and a non-mainstream worldview.Son Chang Seop’s unique aesthetic world was evaluated as an achievement of Korean literature in the 1950s. However, after he abruptly moved to Japan at the end of 1973, his literature is sadly forgotten. This writer explored ‘San 4 Heukseok-dong,’ where Son Chang Seop lived from 1958 to 1973. By reviving the literary space of Son Chang Seop, it is expected to reinterpret the literature of Son Chang Seop. Son Chang Seop’s novel world, which has accomplished a precious ‘aesthetic achievement’ in the history of Korean literature, can be given the meaning of ‘the unexpectedness of the narrative’, ‘ridiculousness’, and ‘non-mainstream worldview’.

AB  - Lee Mun-gu's  Gwanchon Supil , which was published in 1977, is considered an important aesthetic achievement representing Korean novels. Lee Mun-gu lost his father and two older brothers to the Korean War. All of them suffered a tragic massacre for their left-wing activities.From the Korean War to 1980, an anti-human rights system called the guilt-by-association system was implemented in Korean society. The guilt-by-association system was a suppressive mechanism that made it impossible to lead a normal social life if someone in the family was involved in left-wing activities. In the 1970s, Lee Mun-gu entered the path of the anti-dictatorship democratization movement. Lee Mun-gu believed that he could avoid the risk of arrest and detention only if he talked about ‘the issue of his family’s involvement in left-wing activities’. Lee Mun-gu created  Gwanchon Supil  which considers the courage of 'self-disclosure' and the politics of confession. Gwanchon Supil  consists of a total of 8 volumes. Since it has been published for over five years, each novel has a slightly different spatial and temporal background. By examining the composition of space and time f or t he e ight s eries of  Gwanchon Supil , the t heme o f the work can be specified. ｢Ilakseosan｣, ｢Hwamusipil｣, and ｢Haengunyusu｣ are the recollections of the narrator who visited Gwanchon Village on January 3, 1972, and have secured narrative homogeneity. With the background of Gwanchon Village, they have a similar format of recalling the past and maintain consistency as a series of novels. ｢Noksucheongsan｣, ｢ Gongsantowol｣ and ｢Gwansanchujeong｣ take a way of reminiscing the past f rom the p resent and depict the wealthy people of Daeboki, Seokgong, Yumanman and Boksan through Gwanchon Village as a medium. The singularity of these series is that the story of the present and the story of the past overlap and form a free flow. ｢Yeoyojuseo｣ and ｢Wolgokhuya｣ unfold the current story in a space outside Gwanchon Village. ｢Yeoyojuseo ｣ critically portrayed the conflict between animal protection and respect for human rights through the character Shin Yong-mo, and ｢Wolgokhuya｣ embodied the rural reality related to the 4H Movement (Saemaul Movement) from a satirical point of view through Kim Hee-chan as a medium. Yi Mun-gu moved from 'self-disclosure' to 'reflexive perception of reality' and 'active critique of rural reality' during the five-year period of creating the  Gwanchon Supil  series.The figure of the grandfather appearing in  Gwanchon Supil  shows the impressive features of the lost Joseon Confucian scholars. The figure of his father, who was a socialist, is carefully hidden. However, in ｢ Ilakseosan｣, ｢Noksucheongsan｣, and ｢Gongsantowol｣, the father gradually takes shape. The speaker reconciles with his father, who has an egalitarian worldview, and affirms his father. Through the image of his grandfather, who had a Confucian worldview, and h is father, who pursued the ideal of egalitarianism, the narrator moves on the path of a ‘popular egalitarian’.In that sense, Gwanchon Supil can be seen as a     narrative of the discovery of the people spirit and a story of becoming the people.Lee Mun-gu has strengthened active self-discovery and social critical awareness in the process of creating novel series of  Gwanchon Supil  for over 5 years. A t first, the work depicted a n arrative o f careful confession, then it was active self-expression as a victim. Later, he published works that actively defended the egalitarian worldview of the people spirit through becoming the people.  Gwanchon Supil  contains an e thic o f care a nd a n ethic o f life. T hrough t his work, implications can be found that can connect the possibility of constructing an ecological future society with the restoration of rural communities.

AB  - This article is to understand Hamgyong-do Mangmuk-gut.In order to understand the notion of afterlife view of Korean-gut, the article analyzes and compares <Tasung-puri> of Hamgyong-do Manmuk-gut and Tibetan 《Book of the Dead》. The differences found in the reality despite of the same religious background can be summed up as below.First of all, <Tasung-puri> of Mangmuk-gut in Hamgyoung-do and Tibetan 《Book of the Dead》 both embody the Buddhist worldview of the underworld. But the afterlife of <Tasung-puri> is shaped as a mixture of ancient and Buddhist afterlife. In the underworld of Tibetan 《Book of the Dead》, the dead are told to realize the source of the world and discover the true self.Secondly, both docuements share the notion of reincarnation of Buddhism. However, the reincarnation of Tibet is chosen by those who fail to attain the enlightenment. On the other hand, <Tasung-puri> is provided with an opportunity to enjoy full happiness that was not obtained in the previous life through reincarnation. <Tasung-puri> reflects the perception of the present world in a positive light.To sum up, The <Tasung-puri> and Tibetan 《Book of the Dead》 present the process of human death throughout an individual death. The notion of afterlife, which is universally shared, is seen. This work is carried out through the worldview of Buddhism in Tibetan 《Book of the Dead》 and <Tasung-puri> through the worldview of shamanism.Through these studies, it can be seen that the “Taeseungpuri” is challenging the authority of medieval religions that arose from the central power of civilization. It suggests an alternative to the medieval religion with shamanism to break out of its authority. In the end, <Tasung-puri> presents the reincarnation of Buddhism in our shamanism way. In other words, it broke the core of the worldview that was important in the Middle Ages.

AB  - Transmedia is a concept that crosses over the boundaries between medias and builds a story of the overall worldview. This concept of marketing requires huge capital. Mainly the major companies in North America have been successfully attempted this concept of marketing. The research of transmedia storytelling in game character have also been attempted in Korea based on Korean original tales. However, the results were insufficient due to capital limitations of domestic game companies.Korean original stories are fully attractive to become a game content. However, due to capital condition of the domestic game companies, they cannot afford to turn Korean original stories in to a transmedia content. Given this situation, foreign capital takes in charge of most of the story telling contents of original Korean tales.The “Ari” character, based on the Korean tale “fox with nine tails”, was made by League of Legends, a global box office game released in United States. This study analyzed the character “Ari” and its transmedia storytelling pattern to seek how foreign big capital transformed original tale story into commercial success. Therefore, the discussion ends by mentioning who has the right to use and transform the original story, and how the cultural authority should respond to the global trend of transforming the original story.

AB  - The cases of applying the Content IP on business models after recognizing the importance of it. Those are mainly to reduce the market failure through the proven original works, and such a cases of producing secondary contents from already proven webtoon and webnovel by applying on movies, dramas, games and goods can easily be found. In the past, the case of creating content using the original work was an OSMU strategy, but now the strategy of expanding IP as a way to create synergy by expanding content is being used. Prequal, spin-off, and sequels are the ways to expand the world-view around IP. In this study, the purpose of the study was to find out the case of content spin-off expansion using content IP and how the worldview expansion strategy was used in webtoons. As the form of webtoon production has been diversified, the cases of Y-Lab Universe, Park Tae-Joon ComicsCompany Universe, and Kangful Universe were analyzed by classifying them as webtoon content producers, private companies, and individual writers. They were expanding IP by maintaining their respective world-views through brand-string strategy, spin-off, and world-view expansion. Through the study, it was confirmed that spin-off, which was used as a strategy to expand the world-view in webtoons, is being used not only in characters and settings, but also in the case of the same producer and writer. In order to expand the world-view through spin-off, readers who encounter the content must be aware that they are in the world-view of the original contents and spin-off works. To this end, it was found that interconnection should be premised based on a shared world-view through a spin-off strategy using time, space, and characters, not just an simple expansion of the story.

AB  - The past two decades have seen continuing progress in the field of deformation analysis based on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. In particular, refined methods for processing distributed scatterers (DS) have been developed. A general idea is that in a pre-processing step DS can be transformed to quasi PS and that the quasi PS together with PS can be analyzed with an arbitrary PS algorithm. This can be achieved by grouping statistically similar pixels, applying some outlier rejection, estimating the coherence matrix based on the group of pixels, performing some bias correction and extracting the signal of the DS from the coherence matrix. In the first part of this study, presented at IGARSS 2021, different alternatives for grouping, estimation of the coherence matrix and signal extraction have been investigated with help of comprehensive simulations. Meanwhile, these investigations have been complemented with tests on Sentinel 1 data and of outlier rejection and bias correction, which are the focus of this second part of the study.

AB  - The deformation of the surface of the earth is triggered by numerous naturally occurring and artificial processes such as global isostatic adjustment, aseismic and coseismic movement, varying amounts of groundwater or gas stored underground, and soil consolidation due to urbanization. Monitoring these surface deformations is essential to understand the underlying processes and provide authorities and the public with hazard assessments. Remote sensing techniques, such as Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), have the capability of mapping these deformations. Besides a spatial analysis of the deformation patterns, PSI also provides information on their temporal evolution. Post-processing strategies to analyze the displacement time series have gained interest in recent years. This paper presents our PSI post-processing strategy, which incorporates different deformation models and automatically chooses the best-fitting one based on statistical tests.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article reveals the characteristic features of the religious and philosophical worldview of M.Yu. Lermontov, first discovered by Russian thinkers of the Silver Age. Lermontov thinks that the divine principle of being lies in man and represents his deepest essence. A person who has managed to reveal his human essence to the fullest extent becomes a "higher personality", a divine being with extraordinary power in relation to the world around him. The article shows that the main character of the novel "A Hero of Our Time" Pechorin is such a "higher personality", he is able to rule over fate and over ordinary people. The special nature of Pechorin's relationship with fate is clearly shown by Lermontov in the last part of the novel, called "The Fatalist". A detailed analysis of this part of the novel allows us to assert that the dispute between Pechorin and the Serb Vulich essentially expresses the struggle of the wills of two heroes. It is Pechorin, as a more developed "higher personality", with his will, with his almost divine power, who determines the fate of Vulich and directs him to inevitable death. The article shows that the idea of a person that is present in the novel "A Hero of Our Time" can be found in the story of A.S. Pushkin "The Queen of Spades"; later it becomes the basis of philosophical outlook of F.M. Dostoevsky. Like Lermontov, Dostoevsky believes that God is nothing but the true essence of man, and for the will of a person who has fully revealed his essence, there are no restrictions in the world.

TI  - Assimilation of satellite data in numerical weather prediction. Part II: Recent years
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Developments in the assimilation of satellite data in numerical weather prediction (NWP), from the first experiments in the late 1960s to the present day, are presented in a two-part review article. This part, Part II, reviews the progress in recent years, from about 2000. It includes summaries of advances in the relevant satellite remote-sensing technologies and in methods to assimilate observations from these instruments into NWP systems. It also summarises impacts on forecast skill. Continued progress has been made on the assimilation of passive infrared (IR) sounding data and microwave (MW) sounding and imaging data. This has included data from hyperspectral IR sounders, which first became available during this period. Advances in the use of cloud-affected radiances, from both IR and MW instruments, have been made. In support of this progress, further developments have been made in fast radiative transfer models and in bias correction techniques, and work has continued to improve understanding and representation of observation uncertainties. Continued progress has also been made on the use of wind information from satellites, including atmospheric motion vectors and scatterometer data. A new source of temperature and humidity information, from radio occultation observations, has become available during the period and has been exploited by many NWP centres. The impact of satellite data on NWP accuracy is continually assessed using a range of methods and metrics. Some results from recent Observing System Experiments (OSEs) and Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact (FSOI) assessment are presented and other methods are discussed. The role of satellite data in NWP-based atmospheric reanalysis systems is also described.

TI  - Improved Combined Scatterers Interferometry With Optimized Point Scatterers (ICOPS) for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Time-Series Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the development of point-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series methods, such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), it remains difficult to identify reliable measurement points (MPs) in areas under vegetated cover. In this study, we developed a new algorithm, improved combined scatterers interferometry with optimized point scatterers (ICOPS), to monitor changes in surface deformation by combining persistent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs). The algorithm was subsequently improved through the application of a machine learning process. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) was applied to identify statistically homogeneous pixels suitable for a small SAR dataset. A machine learning-based optimization process was used to overcome the increase in MPs after the combined scatterers interferometry (CSI) process. The MP optimization process used the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to find the optimal point from all MPs in the dataset. To improve the reliability of the MP surface deformation mapping after optimization, the optimized hot-spot analysis (OHSA) method was applied to obtain spatially clustered MPs; this was possible despite a low deformation identification rate. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICOPS method, we applied this approach to Yellowstone Lake in the USA using 95 SAR images from the Sentinel-1 satellite that was taken during the period of 2017-2020. The CSI method produced an increase in MP density, especially in areas not covered by PSI, which indicated its ability to detect deformations in mountainous areas. Comparisons with GPS data and traditional methods produced promising results with an accuracy of 1 cm/year in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE). The optimization process in CSI also had the advantage of retrieving helpful information in the MP dataset and increased the accuracy of CSI by 12%. Deformation mapping using the optimized results provided new insights regarding the spatial clustering of surface deformation in MPs. This could provide the foundation for developing a posttime-series optimization process based on point scatter as a surface change detection tool.

TI  - On the Phase Nonclosure of Multilook SAR Interferogram Triplets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the properties characterizing the phase nonclosure of multilook (ML) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms. Specifically, we study the implications of ML phase time incongruences on the generation of ground displacement time series through small baseline (SB) multitemporal InSAR (Mt-InSAR) methods. Our research clarifies how these phase inconsistencies can propagate through a time-redundant network of SB interferograms and contribute, along with phase unwrapping (PhU) errors, to the quality of the generated ground displacement products. Moreover, we analyze the effects of short-lived phase bias signals that could happen in sequences of SB interferograms and propose a strategy for their mitigation. The developed methods have been tested using both simulated and real SAR data. The latter were collected by the Sentinel-1 A/B (C-band) sensors over the study areas of Nevada, USA, and Sicily, Italy.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval From Sentinel-1 Time-Series Data Over Croplands of Northeastern Thailand
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a dual-temporal dual-channel (DTDC) algorithm for soil moisture retrieval by using time-series observations from the Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar. This algorithm utilizes the ancillary information of vegetation water content derived from optical images and assumes no variation on the surface roughness during the two consecutive radar measurements. Therefore, with the DTDC backscatter observations, four equations could be established using forward models, while three unknowns (the two consecutive soil moisture values and one roughness parameter) could be solved simultaneously by minimizing a cost function. The algorithm was tested with a series of Sentinel-1 dual-channel (VV + VH) data over croplands (sugarcane and cassava) of Northeast Thailand with an upscaling resolution of 1 km. Results show that the proposed algorithm could well capture the temporal change of soil moisture with root-mean-square errors within 0.06 m(3)/m(3) when ignoring days with precipitation, and could achieve a similar spatial pattern of soil moisture as detected from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission, indicating the Sentinel-1 might be a proper tool for agricultural water management.

TI  - On the Processing of Gaofen-3 Spaceborne Dual-Channel Sliding Spotlight SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, in the spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) community, the sliding spotlight mode has been widely applied to achieve high-resolution imaging. However, limited by the system pulse repetition frequency (PRF), it is usually impossible to realize a large-scale coverage at the same time. The technique of azimuth multichannel alleviates the PRF restriction by receiving additional spatial samples proportional to the number of Rx channels. A system combining the technique of azimuth multichannel with sliding spotlight SAR is able to achieve ultrahigh-resolution and wide-swath imaging simultaneously. In the advanced multichannel sliding spotlight mode, some problems may occur. First, azimuth beam progressive steering leads to an enlarged Doppler bandwidth over , and conventional azimuth multichannel reconstruction algorithms developed for the stripmap mode are, thus, not directly suitable for the sliding spotlight mode. Second, the phase characteristics of multichannel sliding spotlight SAR is different from that of multichannel stripmap SAR due to the time variation of the system Doppler centroid. Third, processing of spaceborne multichannel sliding spotlight SAR experimental data shows that the convolution function used in the full-aperture reconstruction method is closely related to the antenna phase configuration strategy of the phased array antenna system. Therefore, an improved processing frame is required for the multichannel sliding spotlight SAR, reexamining the validity of assumptions, such as the stop-go-stop approximation and that of a noncurved trajectory during the relatively long aperture time. Recently, as an exploratory study, a dual-channel sliding spotlight experiment was conducted with the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR. Two experimental data sets were acquired with different PRFs. In this article, the GF-3 payload and the experiment design are introduced, and a complete multichannel sliding spotlight SAR data processing chain is provided. The first imaging results of spaceborne multichannel sliding spotlight SAR are demonstrated.

TI  - Evaluation of SMOS, SMAP, AMSR2 and FY-3C soil moisture products over China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave remote sensing can provide long-term near-surface soil moisture data on regional and global scales. Conducting standardized authenticity tests is critical to the effective use of observed data products in models, data assimilation, and various terminal scenarios. Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data were used as a reference for comparative analysis, and triple collocation analysis was used to validate data from four mainstream passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture products: Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP), Global Change Observation Mission-Water using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument, and Fengyun-3C (FY-3C). The effects of topography, land cover, and meteorological factors on the accuracy of soil moisture observation data were determined. The results show that SMAP had the best overall performance and AMSR2 the worst. Passive microwave detection technology can accurately capture soil moisture data in areas at high altitude with uniform terrain, particularly if the underlying surface is soil, and in areas with low average temperatures and little precipitation, such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. FY-3C performed in the middle of the group and was relatively optimal in northeast China but showed poor data integrity. Variation in accuracy between products, together with other factors identified in the study, provides a baseline reference for the improvement of the retrieval algorithm, and the research results provide a quantitative basis for developing better use of passive microwave soil moisture products.

AB  - Small water bodies and their temporal changes are, especially in urban areas, closely related to the urban climate, people's daily life, among others. Mapping of small water bodies with optical remote sensing images in complex urban landscapes is challenging: that is to establish a balance between reducing incorrect water detection and increasing the integrity of water extraction. In this work we propose a spatial information-integrated small water bodies mapping (SWM) method to achieve a complete and accurate extraction and temporal change monitoring of small water bodies. The spatial contextual information is exploited by the proposed water index roughness feature to compensate for the indistinguishability of small water bodies in spectral information. Results using Landsat and Sentinel-2 data show that the proposed algorithm achieves better water extraction performance, i.e. higher completeness and less incorrect extractions. It proves the ability to observe the changes of surface water.

TI  - Analysis of Swarm Satellite Magnetic Field Data for the 2015 Mw 7.8 Nepal Earthquake Based on Nonnegative Tensor Decomposition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A nonnegative tensor decomposition (NTD) approach has been developed to analyze the ionospheric magnetic field data of the Swarm Alpha and Charlie satellites for the Mw7.8 2015 Nepal earthquake. All available satellite data were analyzed regardless of geomagnetic activity. We used the amplitude time-frequency spectra of the two-satellite data to build third-order tensors and decomposed them into three components. One of these components seems to be more affected by seismicity. In particular, the cumulative number of anomalous tracks of this component displays accelerated growth that conforms to a sigmoid fit from 60 to 40 days before the mainshock. Subsequently, until ten days before the earthquake, it shows a weak accelerating trend that obeys a power-law behavior and then resumes linear growth after the mainshock. Moreover, the cumulative anomaly was indicated not to be caused by geomagnetic activity, solar activity, or other nonseismic factors. An investigation of the foreshocks around the epicenter reveals that the cumulative Benioff strain also exhibited two accelerated growths before the mainshock, which is consistent with the cumulative result of ionospheric anomalies. In the first acceleration stage, seismicity appeared in the region surrounding the epicenter, and most of the ionospheric anomalies were offset away from the epicenter. During the second acceleration stage, some foreshocks occurred closer to or on the mainshock fault, and ionospheric anomalies also appeared near two faults around the epicenter. Furthermore, the correspondence between the ionospheric anomalies and the anomalies in different geolayers can be explained by the lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling model.

AB  - Running intelligent applications on a satellite is in urgent need, which can help to extract useful information from massive surveillance or remote sensing data and return it to ground in time. However, the limited computing ability on a satellite prohibits it from completing the whole application by itself quickly. Within the circumstance of space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), we propose to offload part of the computation task from the satellite to the ground station with strong computing ability, through the introduction of airship, which can assist the satellite not only by relaying but also in computing. To save the energy consumption of the satellite and airship, task offloading policy and resource allocation, are investigated for a special task model supporting deep neural network (DNN), which is popular in intelligent application. An optimization problem is formulated, which is difficult to solve. We achieve the global optimal solution through the following operations: 1) Transform the formulated problem into two levels, with every level dealing with discrete or continuous variables exclusively; 2) Explore implicit monotonicity and convexity of concerned functions so as to solve the non-convex lower level problem optimally only with several rounds of bisection or Golden search methods; 3) Solve the upper level problem optimally by enumeration but with polynomial complexity. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI  - Fine-Scale Urban Informal Settlements Mapping by Fusing Remote Sensing Images and Building Data via a Transformer-Based Multimodal Fusion Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban informal settlements (UISs) are high-density population settlements with low standards of living and supply. UIS semantic segmentation, which identifies pixels corresponding to informal settlements in remote sensing images, is crucial to the estimation of poor communities, urban management, resource allocation, and future planning, particularly in megacities. However, most studies on informal settlement mapping are either based on parcels (image classification) or pixels (semantic segmentation). Few studies utilize object information to improve UIS mapping. Since informal settlements are formed by buildings (objects), utilizing object information can improve UIS semantic segmentation. Furthermore, current UIS mapping studies mainly focus on using single-modality remote sensing images, and there is a lack of related research on using multimodal data. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of informal settlements, using only a single modality of remote sensing image features limits the effectiveness and accuracy of informal settlements semantic segmentation. Aiming at achieving fine-scale UIS mapping results, this article proposes a UIS semantic segmentation method, namely UisNet, that utilizes a transformer-based block to receive multimodal data, including high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images (parcel- and pixel-level) and building polygon data (object-level) to identify UIS. The experiments were conducted in Shenzhen City, and they confirmed the superior performance of UisNet, which achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.80% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 85.51% in the testing set of the manually labeled UIS semantic segmentation dataset (UIS-Shenzhen dataset) and outperformed the best models on semantic segmentation tasks. Besides, we add a set of experiments on a public dataset [gaofen image dataset (GID) dataset] and compare our method with the current state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods. Experiments show that the proposed UisNet improves mIoU by 1.64% to 7.58% compared to other methods. This work will be available at https://github.com/RunyuFan/.

TI  - Comparison of the Anthropogenic Emission Inventory for CMIP6 Models with a Country-Level Inventory over China and the Simulations of the Aerosol Properties
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic emission inventory for aerosols and reactive gases is crucial to the estimation of aerosol radiative forcing and climate effects. Here, the anthropogenic emission inventory for AerChemMIP, endorsed by CMIP6, is briefly introduced. The CMIP6 inventory is compared with a country-level inventory (i.e., MEIC) over China from 1986 to 2015. Discrepancies are found in the yearly trends of the two inventories, especially after 2006. The yearly trends of the aerosol burdens simulated by CESM2 using the two inventories follow their emission trends and deviate after the mid-2000s, while the simulated aerosol optical depths (AODs) show similar trends. The difference between the simulated AODs is much smaller than the difference between model and observation. Although the simulated AODs agree with the MODIS satellite retrievals for country-wide average, the good agreement is an offset between the underestimation in eastern China and the overestimation in western China. Low-biased precursor gas of SO2, overly strong convergence of the wind field, overly strong dilution and transport by summer monsoon circulation, too much wet scavenging by precipitation, and overly weak aerosol swelling due to low-biased relative humidity are suggested to be responsible for the underestimated AOD in eastern China. This indicates that the influence of the emission inventory uncertainties on simulated aerosol properties can be overwhelmed by model biases of meteorology and aerosol processes. It is necessary for climate models to perform reasonably well in the dynamical, physical, and chemical processes that would influence aerosol simulations.

TI  - Original Evaluation and Prediction of Coastal Zone Ecosystem Health at the County Scale
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone is a major area for human settlement and exploitation of marine resources. The assessment and prediction of ecosystem health in coastal zones is important for its environmental management and the formulation of sustainable development policy. In this study, based on the Pressure-State-Response model and Markov model, the health of the coastal zone ecosystem was assessed and predicted at the county scale. Landsat remote sensing images of the Ningde coastal zone in China captured in 2000, 2009, and 2014 were used. Previous studies have primarily evaluated ecosystem health at macroscopic scales; however, in this study, the research scale was reduced to the county scale to examine and predict coastal ecosystem health. The results of this study showed that the size of the composite indicators for the county ecosystems in the Ningde coastal zone was in the descending order of Fu'an > Jiaocheng > Xiapu > Fuding. The composite indicators of the Fu'an and Xiapu ecosystems were good, whereas those of the Fuding and Xiapu ecosystems were poor and moderate, respectively. In 2024, the stress indicators of the Fuding, Xiapu, Fu'an, and Jiaocheng ecosystems will continue to increase, whereas the state indicators will decline significantly. Increasing the area of forest and grassland will reduce the pressure on the Fuding and Xiapu ecosystems and improve their ecosystem status and service capacity. In contrast, the pressure, state and response indicators of the Fu'an and Jiaocheng ecosystems were unaffected by changes to forest and grassland areas.

TI  - Long Time Series Changes of Vegetation EVI and the Natural Influencing Factors in Qinling-Daba Mountains Area
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinling-Daba Mountains Range is an important geographical transition zone between northern and southern China. This paper aims to fully understand the ecological changes and the influencing factors in this area in the past 20 years. To achieve this, MODIS-EVI data were applied, combined with temperature, precipitation, and DEM data, and the maximum synthesis method, trend analysis method, and partial correlation analysis were used on the basis of altitude. Besides, temporal and spatial changes in the enhanced vegetation index ( EVI) for different vegetation types at various altitudes and their correlation with temperature and precipitation from 2000 to 2020 were analyzed. The main conclusions are : (1) From 2000 to 2020, the average annual EVI of vegetation in the Qinling-Daba Mountains area presented a fluctuating upward trend. Overall, 80. 67% of the area showed a significant improvement on EVI and 13. 29% of the area showed a slight improvemont on EVI. The EVI was relatively stable at an altitude of 1 600-1 800 m, which is more suitable for vegetation growth. (2) Cultivated vegetation and broad-leaved forests are the main types of vegetation in the Qinling-Daba Mountains region. The EVI values of the various vegetation types range in the order of broad-leaved forest > shrub > coniferous forest > grassland > cultivated vegetation > others. The inter-vegetation area accounts for the majority of vegetation in the altitude range of 1 000-2 000 m, while the altitude range of 1 600-1 800 m is the most suitable for natural vegetation growth. (3) From 2000 to 2020, the climate in the Qinling-Daba Mountains area became wanner and more humid. The correlation between EVI and temperature was relatively uniform across the region, and the impact of precipitation on EVI was greater than that of temperature. However, at higher altitudes, the correlation between EVI and temperature is generally greater than precipitation.

TI  - Land Cover Classification of Resources Survey Remote Sensing Images Based on Segmentation Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land type survey is an important task of land resources survey and the basis of scientific management of land resources. With the increasingly prominent problems of population, resources, and environment, there is an urgent need for a fast and accurate classification method of large-scale land use and land cover based on remote sensing data. Traditional machine learning classification methods based on pixel classification achieved sufficient results and are widely used, such as maximum likelihood classification and random forests method. However, with the development of the novel technology of deep learning, in practical application, for multi-classified land resources, how to use the fast and effective classification method of low and medium resolution RS images needs further research. This paper takes the land resource classification of the Tonghe medium resolution RS dataset of the third land survey in China as an example to screen and compare traditional machine learning classification methods and semantic segmentation models FC-DenseNet56, GCN, BiSeNet, U-Net, DeepLabV3, AdapNet, and PSPNet, which aim to select the optimal feature extraction model. The results show that the classification accuracy of the U-Net model can reach 93.62%, which is more accurate and effective than traditional machine learning methods and other semantic segmentation models. It is suitable for multi-classification tasks of land cover resources in low and medium resolution RS images and shows a superior effect in practical application. Besides, the conclusion of this study can provide a demonstration for large-scale land cover resources investigation using low and medium resolution RS images.

AB  - High-resolution land surface temperature (LST) retrieval is a hot research topic in recent ten years, and the development of various high-resolution satellite sensors provides a data basis for this study. The Visual and Infrared Multispectral Imager (VIMI) on Gaofen5-02 (GF5-02) satellite provides 40m spatial resolution thermal infrared data ranging from 8 mu m to 12.5 mu m, including four thermal infrared channels. In this paper, we developed a split-window algorithm for retrieving LST from VIMI data. First, the two thermal infrared channels 11 and 12 of VIMI are cross-calibrated using MODIS bands 31 and 32, and then high-resolution LST was derived using the generalized splitwindow algorithm. The GF5-02 LST was cross-validated with the MODIS MOD21 LST products, the preliminary results indicate that GF5-02 LST shows a reasonable accuracy, with a mean bias of 0.05 K and a mean RMSE of 3.29 K.

AB  - Remote sensing image spatiotemporal fusion (STF) algorism plays an important role by supplementing the lack of original high-resolution remote sensing satellite images in the study scenarios of dense time-series data. In recent years, the deep-learning-based STF algorithm has become a research hotspot with comparatively higher accuracy and robustness. However, due to the lack of sufficient high-quality images for training and the huge resolution gap between low-resolution images and high-resolution images, it is difficult to recover detailed information, especially for areas of land-cover change. In this paper, we propose a two-layers super-resolution based generation adversarial spatiotemporal fusion model(TLSRSTF) using smaller inputs to reduce pressure on data requirements and a mutual affine convolution to reduce model parameters. Specifically, we only use a pair of high-resolution and low-resolution images and a high-resolution image at any time. A spatial degradation consistency is constructed to adaptively determine the ratio of two layers of the super-resolution STF model. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results on public spatiotemporal fusion datasets demonstrate our superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Multichannel Sliding Spotlight SAR Imaging: First Result of GF-3 Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multichannel SAR system operating in the sliding spotlight mode has the capacity of imaging with very high resolution as requested by future spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission; hence, it has been attracted more and more attention in the SAR community. In a multichannel sliding spotlight SAR system with $N$ channels, the overall Doppler bandwidth of the data acquired by each channel is greater than $N \cdot \text {PRF}$ ; thus, the preprocessing algorithms (channel mismatch calibration and signal reconstruction) are no more available. To address this issue, a full-aperture imaging method for azimuth multichannel sliding spotlight mode is proposed in this article. First, the raw data of each channel need to be preprocessed based on a deramping operation, which can obtain an unambiguous Doppler spectrum. Afterward, the algorithm proposed for single-channel sliding spotlight mode can be performed. Finally, to avoid possible back-folded SAR images, postprocessing after focusing is demanded in some cases. The imaging results of the data acquired by GaoFen-3 (GF-3) are given for the first time in this article, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed imaging method and demonstrates the capacity of high-resolution wide-swath imaging of the multichannel sliding spotlight mode.

TI  - A Bayesian Deep Image Prior Downscaling Approach for High-Resolution Soil Moisture Estimation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) estimation is a critical part of environmental and agricultural monitoring, with satellite-based microwave remote sensing being the main SM source. However, the limited spatial resolution of most current remote sensing SM products reduces their utility for many applications, such as evapotranspiration modeling and agriculture management. In this article, to address this issue, we propose a Bayesian deep image prior (BDIP) downscaling approach to estimate the high-resolution SM from satellite products. More specifically, the high-resolution SM estimation problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem, and solved via a neural network comprising of a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for modeling the prior spatial correlation distribution of the underlying high-resolution SM variables, and a forward model characterizing the SM map degeneration process for modeling the data likelihood. As such, the proposed BDIP approach provides a statistical framework that integrates deep learning with forward modeling in a coherent manner for combining different sources of information, i.e., the knowledge in the forward model, the spatial correlation prior in FCNN architecture, and the remote sensing data and products. Experiments on the downscaling of SM active passive SM products using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products show that SM maps estimated using the proposed method provide greater spatial detail information than other downscaling methods, with the SM estimates very close to in situ measurements.

AB  - The fine classification of vegetation is a prerequisite for relevant remote sensing applications. Based on the phenological differences of different vegetation and the temporal changes of vegetation index, a crop fine classification algorithm is proposed, which combines spectral angle mapper algorithm and spectral information divergence algorithm. Taking Shihezi City, Xinjiang Province as the research area, 15 Sentinel-2 high-resolution images are selected as the data source, combined with the local phenological information, the NDVI time series curves of different crops are constructed, the refined classification of crops in this area is carried out, and compared with the traditional SVM algorithm and maximum likelihood method, The results show that the overall classification accuracy of this algorithm is 89.25% and 86.45% respectively, the kappa coefficient reaches 0.79 and 0.78. The experimental results fully show the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with the traditional single temporal data source algorithm, and have a certain reference significance for the application of remote sensing images in ground feature classification.

TI  - Semisupervised Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Using Pseudo Labels for PolSAR Image Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep-learning-based methods have obtained satisfying results in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. However, these methods require large numbers of labeled samples, which are usually time-consuming and high-priced for PolSAR images. To address this issue, a semisupervised method based on a 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D-CNN) using pseudo labels (PL-3-D-CNN) is proposed. First, the coherency matrix of PolSAR data is converted into a 6-D real-valued vector by a unitary transformation. Then, the K-means algorithm is utilized for generating pseudo labels. After that, labeled samples and pseudo labeled samples are fed into the PL-3-D-CNN model to extract supervised and unsupervised features. Finally, the supervised and unsupervised features are combined to improve classification accuracy. The proposed method is tested on both AIRSAR and RADARSAT-2 data sets. The results show that the proposed method is an effective method for PolSAR image classification and shows good performance under a small number of labeled samples. The source code for the PL-3-D-CNN model is available at https://github.com/fangzheng-nuaa/PL-3D-CNN.

T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work focuses on lineament mapping using new spatial remote sensing techniques in the central High Atlas (CHA) of Morocco. In this study, the automatic extraction of lineaments was based on using multispectral images type Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER, L1B) with high spatial resolution up to 15 m for the visible/near-infrared (VNIR) bands. Besides, a digital elevation model (DEM) type ASTER GDEM was used with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The satellite image was pre-processed before the automatic extraction of the lineaments using the mathematical algorithm Line Module of the PCI Geomatica software 2016. Then, multisource data, such as an extract of the Ouarzazate Alougoum geological map (1/100000) covering the entire study area and a calibrated field imaging background (source: Esri, Maxar, GeoEye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus, DS, USDA, AeroGRID, IGN, and the GIS User Community), was used for validating the results. The extraction of the lineaments from the first principal component (PC1) image was derived from the satellite image and the DEM. These results proved that each produced map has a strong similarity in concentration and orientation with three major directions including NE-SW, E-W and ENE-WSW. We observed a high concentration of these lineaments in both the central and northern parts of the study area as well.

AB  - Desertification detection is a challenging problem because of the dynamic climate change and human activity. This paper proposes a methodology to detect regions with desertification risk based on Landsat imagery (RGB bands and NDVI) and variational auto-Encoder (VAE). The considered features (RGB and NDVI) are extracted from multitemporal Landsat optical images taken from the freely available Landsat program from 2001 to 2020. The arid region around Jeffara in Medenine (Tunisia) is selected as a study area. The VAE model was evaluated and compared with two deep learning models: convolutional neural network ( CNN), convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN_RNN), and VAE without NDVI. The comparative results showed that the VAE outperformed the other models for desertification detection, with an accuracy of over 98 %.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly affected global industrial and transportation markets. Airlines, rails, and cars' industries and their supporting energy sectors have been substantially disrupted by the pandemic. This has resulted in undermined energy demand around the world during 2019 and 2020. The organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) led by Saudi Arabia failed to persuade Russia to cutback oil supplies to deal with the loss of demand from the COVID-19 pandemic. On 8 March 2020, Saudi Arabia announced a raise in its oil production and offered a large discount on its crude oil sales. By April 2020, Saudi Arabia increased its oil production to about 12 million-oil barrels/day. This rise in oil production has not only resulted in the biggest fall in oil prices since the 1991 Gulf War but also increased methane emissions over the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) regions. Here, we report 2019 and 2020 data set of average seasonal methane-mixing ratio retrieved from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of S5P spacecraft over 19 refineries and oil fields in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain. Low methane emissions were recorded over western and central Saudi Arabia compared to the eastern side of the country. In general, high methane emissions were observed in 2020 compared to 2019 around oil refineries and fields in western, central, and eastern regions of Saudi Arabia as well as over other GCC countries. This could be attributed to the oil high production associated with the oil prices fluctuation during 2020.

AB  - TELECER project is supported through Rural Development Programme regional action of EU CAP and is aimed at providing Precision Agriculture-devoted services for cereals monitoring in the Piemonte Region (NW-Italy) context. In this work authors explored some general and preliminary issues mainly aimed at demonstrating and formalizing those evident relationships existing between NDVI image time series and the main ordinary agronomic parameters, with special focus on phenology and thermal efficiency of crops as related to Growing Degrees Day (GDD). Winter wheat was investigated and relationships calibrated at field level, making possible to spatially characterise environmental and management effects. Two different analysis were achieved: (i) one aimed at mapping crop phenological metrics, as derivable from NDVI S2 time series; (ii) one aimed at locally modelling relationship linking GDD and NDVI to somehow test the thermal efficiency of crops in the different parts of the study area. The first analysis showed that the end of season appears to be the most constant phenological metric in the study area possibly demonstrating a time concentration of harvest operations in the area. Differently, the peak of season and the start of season metrics showed to be largely varying in the study, thus suggesting to be stronger predictors: (i) of crop development; (ii) of the effects induced by local agronomical practices. Several base temperatures were used to compute correspondent GDD. These were tested against NDVI and modelled by a parabolic model at field level. Model coefficients distribution were analysed and mapped the correspondent agronomic interpretation suggested.

AB  - Treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma has been controversial for more than a century. A series of clinical trials evaluating elective lymph node dissection and then sentinel lymph node biopsy have helped define the current standard of care. These trials resulted in increasingly selective application of surgical intervention for regional lymph nodes in melanoma. First by focusing on optimal candidates for elective lymph node dissection and then by identifying patients through sentinel lymph node biopsy. The current standard of sentinel lymph node biopsy for appropriately selected patients and nodal observation for many patients, even with involved sentinel nodes is both more accurate in staging and much less morbid than what came before.

TI  - "Un petit entrainement physique, pour l'acceptation du monde". Christophe Tarkos and the neoliberal counter-revolution as the Revolution
T2  - TRANS-REVUE DE LITTERATURE GENERALE ET COMPAREE
M3  - Article
AB  - Christophe Tarkos, a self-defined "poete revolutionnaire", does a revolution of a weird kind. His texts maximise the duplicity of the revolutionary idea in the 1990's neoliberal context. On the one hand, as Graeber notes: "the Left had largely abandoned utopianism"; on the other: "the Right [...] had catastrophically appropriated [...] the idea that the revolutionary is the agent of the inevitable march of history" (Graeber: 2014). As the onslaught of neoliberal capitalism on all of life's aspects is declared complete (Dardot and Laval: 2009), Tarkos formulates the depleted the critique of capital in the counter-revolutionary idiom of neoliberalism - "L'argent est la seule valeur universelle", "l'argent est revolutionnaire" (Tarkos: 2008). In so doing, he lays out a political double-bind: that of neoliberalism itself, consistently destroying humans' bodies, psyches and their living milieu, and that of the impossibility for revolutionary forces to bring the counter-revolution to a stop. In providing his reader with "un petit exercice musculaire de remise en forme pour supporter, accepter le reel" (Tarkos: 2014), he devises the poetical counterpart to Gary Becker's extension of Homo oeconomicus to humankind: "someone who accepts reality" (Becker: 1962).Yet most critics interpret Tarkos' texts in light of Left-wing emancipatory ideals: either in the indirectly subversive manner of Deleuze (Barda: 2018; Sainsbury: 2018; Caillee: 2014) or through a Marx-inspired exposition of capital's hidden contradictions (Farah). Focussing on the poems L'Argent (1997) and Oui (1996), I argue that Tarkos does nothing of the sort. Claiming that neoliberalism and the political context of the 1990's is more relevant to interpret them than the emancipatory tradition, I show that Tarkos' poetry "litteralise" the worldview in which there is indeed no alternative (Gleize: 2009). Comparing Tarkos' poems to the foundational kernel of neoliberal thought (W. Lippman; L. von Mises; F. Hayek; G. Becker and Paul H. Rubin), this article highlights their disturbing proximity and explore the socio-literary effects of the quashing of non-capitalist revolutionary hopes.Focussing on L'Argent, part 1 analyses how capitalist contradictions are weaponized, capitalism absolutised, and the Marxian revolution is equated with the neoliberal one. In part 2, a close-reading of oui shows Tarkos' language to be a free-evolving and indeterminately plastic entity which manages to combine freedom and determinacy in a way neoliberals have hitherto failed to conceive. From this, part 3 presents the foundations of neoliberal theory which are at work in Tarkos' texts. In accordance with this tradition, Tarkos instrumentalizes the evolutionary view of history in which capitalism is the "Great Revolution" (Lippman: 1937) to which the "intuitive" mind of "common men" (Paul H. Rubin: 2003) has to be adapted. Given that their "mental architecture" is "adapted to life in the small roving bands" (Hayek: 1988), it follows that the true task of revolutionaries, for Tarkos and neoliberals alike, is to foster "the revolutionary re-adaptation" of humanity to market fundamentalism, the division of labour, heightened competition and the universalisation of the commodity form. "La valeur de l'argent, he writes, reconcilie l'ensemble de soi et du monde, elle fait de soi l'adaptation elle-meme" (Tarkos: 2008). In a poetical tour de force, Tarkos effectively invents the dream idiom of neoliberalism. The pre-determined horizon of capital as human's necessary destiny is thereby reconciled with the metamorphic, unpredictable and internally "plastic" (Malabou) features of life and thought. A better player of this fool's language-game than France's game master Emmanuel Macron (Revolution: 2016), Tarkos' poems square the revolutionary circle in neoliberal times.

TI  - A Daytime Multisensor Satellite System for Global Gas Flaring Monitoring
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural gas flaring (GF) is a longstanding problem for the oil industry. Recent estimates indicate that this phenomenon has increased to levels recorded a full decade earlier. While in 2020 there was a decline in global GF due to COVID-19 pandemic, data suggest that GF continues to be a persistent issue, with solutions remaining difficult or uneconomical in certain countries. Nighttime satellite products are widely used to map and monitor GF affected areas, partially filling the general lack of information from oil companies and/or national reporting. In this work, we assess the potential of daytime infrared satellite observations at high spatial resolution from operational land imager (OLI) and multispectral instrument (MSI) sensors, respectively, onboard Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, in monitoring GF activity. The normalized hotspot indices (NHI) algorithm is used for this purpose, testing its performance over six different GF sites. Results show the NHI capability in providing accurate information about GF-related thermal (e.g., 100 & x0025; of detections offshore; up to 92 & x0025; onshore), despite some limitations due to clouds and smoke. They open challenging scenarios regarding the possibility of quantifying the volume of emitted gas from daytime S2-MSI and L8-OLI data, integrating information from well-established nighttime operational systems.

TI  - Monitoring of land use and land cover changes by using remote sensing and GIS techniques at human-induced mangrove forests areas in Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced wetlands are more exposed to threats around the world. For conserving and protecting wetland resources, such as mangrove forests, it is significant to monitor the wetlands and their associated land features and land cover use. The land use and land cover (LULC) changes with remote sensing have been used with different aspects to evaluate the wetland's change dynamics in many areas. This study used four satellite images of Landsat 5 and 8 for LULC mapping of mangrove wetlands and their adjacent areas to evaluate the change dynamics for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. During the period 1990 to 2020, significant changes in land features have been observed. The LULC analysis revealed a remarkable increase in aquaculture and a significant decrease in agriculture. The NDVI ( 0.08 to 0.35) and NDWI (0.10 to 0.32) indices analysis also visibly confirmed changes in land features. The aquaculture area was increased by 5686 ha (similar to 230%), whereas the agricultural area decreased by 6682 ha (similar to 66%) in 2020 compared to 1990. The analysis also found a decrease of 1881 ha (similar to 14%) of the forest area for the same period. A decrease in agricultural lands and an increase in aquaculture areas indicate that inhabitants in the area change their profession over the period. This transformation has negatively impacted human-induced activities in the ecosystem and biodiversity of mangrove forests. The biodiversity welfare of natural wetlands, such as mangrove forests, is gradually reduced because of human interventions in the study area. Therefore, appropriate measures need to be imposed to improve the condition of mangrove forests and protect forest biodiversity.

AB  - On 14 November 2021, a doublet earthquake (M-w 6.2 and M-w 6.3) struck the Fin area in southern Iran. Utilizing the two-pass differential SAR Interferometry (InSAR) method, the coseismic deformation fields, retrieved from 12-day pairs descending and ascending Sentinel-1 as well as descending ALOS-2, demonstrate a displacement pattern of maximum 40 cm toward the satellite in the epicentral area. The preliminary slip inversion from the InSAR analysis exhibits best fitting on an east-west trending (similar to 263 degrees), north-dipping (similar to 71 degrees) fault as well as an east-west trending (similar to 84 degrees), south-dipping (similar to 15 degrees) thrust with a maximum coseismic slip value of similar to 2 meters. The south-dipping model shows a better fit and conforms well with the geological setting of the area introduced in the previous studies.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Chile has been in a mega-drought since 2010, leading to critical water scarcity in the central zone. Research projects that to 2040 climate change, in conjunction with the loose use of water for irrigation, will cause severe water stress to the whole country. Agriculture amounts to 72% of the water consumption in the zone, and in cities like El Tabo, 18% of the population consumes water provided in cistern trucks. Therefore, reliable registering of water use is essential for sustainable water management. However, in-field manual measurements of water use can be tedious, time, and labor-intensive and may exhibit significant spatial variability, and be inefficient for surveying large areas. Currently, private initiatives lead the efforts in water use optimization, consisting mainly of expensive in-site sensors and drones' imagery, and the public sector is currently designing new policies, regulations, and management. Still, there is no record of the current status and their variation through time of the farms and paddocks at a country level.This paper aims to develop and test an automatic paddock's boundaries segmentation/recognition system using hyperspectral images from Sentinel 2. The developed system includes new image enhancements, bands selection, and training a model using the images and handmade polygons. Having the boundaries, farmers could use them to understand the impact the climate change is causing on their crops and hopefully enable them to optimize data-driven irrigation scheduling and other optimization tools to preserve the water and keep its use at the minimum possible. The method was tested with sentinel-2-l2a data with 10-meter ground resolution in four spectral bands: Band 02 (visible blue), Band 03 (visible green), Band 04 (visible red), Band 08 (near-infrared). Multiple metrics are presented for results. It can play a vital role in supporting improved Chile's water accounting-both independently and in combination with in-situ monitoring.

M3  - Article
AB  - This is the publication of a diary started by a young Muscovite in October 1940 as he was drafted into the Red Army to serve in the border-guard force in southern Georgia, on the border with Turkey. Since this armed force was subordinated to the infamous Soviet security service - the NKVD - when the Soviet-German war started in 1941, he continued service in the NKVD troops, seeing combat for the last time in May 1944 in fighting Ukrainian resistance. This document is published without revealing the author's identity due to the sensitivity of its content. The text contains two intertwined narratives: one is sustained by a detailed record of actions and events, and the other by verbose discourses about personal relations and political ideals. Combining ethnographic details and fiction, the diary opens a window on the worldview of a young Soviet man from a privileged family.

TI  - Application of remote sensing data for monitoring eutrophication of floodplain water bodies
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article was to investigate the influence of structural features of the floodplain water network on the spatial and temporal dynamics of chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator of eutrophication. The research was conducted in the waters of the "Dnipro-Orilskiy" Nature Reserve. The geographic information base with polygonal objects which represented water bodies of the reserve was created on the basis of detailed geographical maps and the high resolution space images. The water bodies were characterized using such parameters as the distance of the water body centroid from the nearest shore of the Dnipro River, the area of the water body, the order of the water body and the connectivity of the water body. Chlorophyll-a concentration was estimated based on the surface algal bloom index The information was obtained about 148 water bodies, 141 of which are water bodies in the floodplain of the Dnipro River. The area of floodplain water bodies within the reserve was 328 million m(2). The area of floodplain water bodies ranged from 300-232,500 m(2). Trophic State Index allows us to estimate the trophic level of Dnipro River waters as mesotrophic, water bodies of first and second order as eutrophic, and water bodies of third and fourth order as hypereutrophic. The dynamics of chlorophyll-a content in water followed the seasonal course of temperatures. The concentration was lowest in the cold period of the year and reached its maximum in the second half of summer. The autumn decrease occurred at the end of September. The seasonal course of air temperature was superimposed on the peculiarities of the temperature regime of a particular water body, which depended on its depth and flow rate. The time, water body area, distance from the Dnipro River channel, connectivity and order of water bodies were the statistically significant predictors of chlorophyll concentration in water and were able to explain 85% of the variation of this indicator. The increase in chlorophyll-a concentration with increasing order of a water body is due to a decrease in the intensity of water exchange and a decrease in the depth of water bodies of higher order. An increase in the order of a water body is accompanied by a branching network of water bodies, the ability of water bodies to clear sediments decreases. Sediment accumulation leads to a decrease in their depth. Warming of shallow ponds and accumulation of organic matter in them are factors of intensive growth of blue-green algae. The evacuation of surplus organic matter, which results from mass vegetation development with excessive nutrient inputs, is a key driver of the eutrophic regime of water bodies. The increasing importance of regulatory processes develops in agreement with an increase in chlorophyll-a concentration in a water body. The importance of the considered factors reaches the highest level in summer time, when simultaneous maximum warming of water bodies and minimum water level in them take place. Accordingly, the differences between deep and relatively cool water bodies and shallow water bodies that warm up quickly, which significantly stimulates the growth of organic mass, reach the greatest contrast.The spatial patterns of variation in chlorophylla concentration have a complex multiscale structure, indicating the multiple nature of the acting factors. The spatial variability was represented as a composition of broad-scale and medium-scale spatial processes. The broad-scale process is most dependent on connectivity, whereas for the medium-scale process the leading one is the effect of water body order.

TI  - Application of the Winter and Early-Spring Satellite Images for Assessment of the Birch Forest Coverage on the Abandoned Agricultural Lands
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 40 million hectares of agricultural land were abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union. A significant part of the land is covered by spontane-ously regenerating woody and shrubby vegetation. When identifying the forest regenera-tion, the stands with a tree cover of more than 50% are accurately identified. It is diffi-cult to identify the initial stages of forest regeneration on the abandoned agricultural lands using summer satellite images because of little difference between the young trees and saplings due to their low height and low density on the one hand, and herbaceous vegetation on the other. The purpose of this work was to apply winter and early-spring satellite images for assessments of the tree cover of birch-dominated stands (Betula pen-dula Roth.) formed on the abandoned agricultural lands (See Fig. 1). We used 189 releves of birch forests on the abandoned agricultural lands in the broad-leaved forest zone of the Republic of Bashkortostan. A regression analysis of the evaluation of the tree cover was carried out using the values of the spectral reflec-tance of the RED, NIR, SWIR11, and SWIR12 bands, as well as the values of the NDFSI snow index from seven cloudless Sentinel-2 images taken between 04.11.2020 and 13.05.2021 (See Fig. 2, 3). When selecting optimal regression models, the values of correlation coefficients (R) and determination coefficients (R2) were used to assess the model quality. To test the possibility of using the obtained models for assessing the tree cover of the stand at earlier succession stages, we involved the data on the tree cover from 36 geobotanical releves, where the crown density of the stand was visually evaluated in July 2013. Then, the described procedure was applied to calculate the tree cover using the Landsat-8 image taken on 25.03.2014. When creating regression models to calculate the tree cover, the best results were obtained using the red band of early spring images during the period when snowpack is still solid (from mid-March to the first half of April) (See Table 1). The correlation between the tree cover and the spectral reflectance of the red band was-0.90. The model allowed us to determine accurately the tree cover of birch forests aged from 18 to 20 years which prevail in the zone of broad-leaved forests in the Republic of Bash-kortostan. The accuracy of the model for determining the tree cover according to the obtained regression models for other dates is unstable and highly likely influenced by the snow depth and the seasonal dynamics of changes in the radiation intensity of the red and infrared bands (See Table 2, 3). To conclude, the equations calculated from modern satellite images can be used to assess the tree cover using retrospective images at earlier succession stages of the abandoned field recovery. When using early-spring images, the snow depth should be taken into account since the snowpack melting dates can vary greatly from year to year.

AB  - The article examines the accuracy of atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms of Sentinel-3/OLCI images of the Gorky reservoir, whose waters are characterized by a high content of phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter. All considered algorithms showed unsatisfactory accuracy due to incorrect determination of atmospheric aerosol parameters and aerosol radiance. In pixels, where atmospheric correction algorithms overestimate the aerosol radiance, aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is 3-10 times higher than the values in the adjacent areas with more clear waters. To resolve this issue, an algorithm with a fixed AOT was proposed. The fixed AOT spectrum was determined in the area with relatively "clean water" as 5 percentile of AOT in all water pixels. The proposed algorithm allowed to retrieve remote sensing reflectance with high accuracy. The slopes of lenear regression are close to 1 and the intercepts tend to zero in nearly all spectral bands. The determination coefficients are more than 0.9; the bias, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error are noticeably lower than for other AC algorithms.

TI  - IMPROVED <i>R<sub>RS</sub></i> AND TURBIDITY RETRIEVAL FROM OLI IMAGES IN COMPLEX INLAND WATERS: A CASE STUDY FOR LAGUNA DE BAY

AB  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of water quality parameters such as turbidity in inland waters is desirable to better understand productivity and mitigate the negative impacts of pollution induced by increasing anthropogenic activities. However, precise retrieval of water quality parameters in complex turbid waters from the remote sensing reflectance R-rs remains a challenging task due to the varying optical complexity of the water body. In this study, a modified version of the Atmospheric Correction for OLI-lite (ModACO) scheme for turbid inland waters, which implements a linear extrapolation of MR aerosol reflectance in the visible bands instead of a nonlinear function, is presented. The performance of the proposed method and other existing algorithms such as the Atmospheric Correction for OLI-lite (ACOLITE), Management Unit of the Noth Seas Mathematical Models (MUMM) scheme, SeaDAS standard processing, and SWIRL were evaluated. The R-rs retrievals from these models were then used as input for turbidity estimation and mapping of Laguna de Bay. Results show lowest R-rs error in all five spectral bands (443, 482, 561, 655, and 865 nm) on ModACO-based retrievals. Relative to the ACOLITE and other atmospheric correction schemes, the proposed method reduced the R-rs retrieval errors in terms of RMSE and MAPE by more than 50% Similarly, significant improvements in turbidity retrievals were achieved from ModACO-based R-rs values, wherein comparable accuracy was observed from red/green ratio and the single MR band turbidity models. Turbidity maps of Laguna de Bay show elevated values from the mid of dry season, which may be associated with point source discharge and wind-induced resuspension of bottom sediments. The lake turbidity then drops by the end of dry season, which is linked to the absence of prevailing strong winds that may increase in-water mixing. Using the aforementioned method, accurate monitoring of turbidity can be done to determine and mitigate possible degradation on the water quality of Laguna de Bay and other productive turbid inland waters.

TI  - Mapping the 2021 October Flood Event in the Subsiding Taiyuan Basin by Multitemporal SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A flood event induced by heavy rainfall hit the Taiyuan basin in north China in early October of 2021. In this study, we map the flood event process using the multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by Sentinel-1. First, we develop a spatiotemporal filter based on low-rank tensor approximation (STF-LRTA) for removing the speckle noise in SAR images. Next, we employ the classic log-ratio change indicator and the minimum error threshold algorithm to characterize the flood using the filtered images. Finally, we relate the flood inundation to the land subsidence in the Taiyuan basin by jointly analyzing the multitemporal SAR change detection results and interferometric SAR (InSAR) time-series measurements (preflood). The validation experiments compare the proposed filter with the Refined-Lee filter, Gamma filter, and a statistically homogeneous pixels selection based multitemporal SAR filter. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed STF-LRTA method in SAR despeckling and detail preservation, and the applicability to change scenes. The joint analyses reveal that land subsidence might be an important contributor to the flood event, and the flood recession process linearly correlates with time and subsidence magnitude.

TI  - A Deep Multitask Convolutional Neural Network for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution and Colorization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data have become increasingly vital in target detection, disaster monitoring, and military surveillance. Abundant pan-sharpening and super-resolution (SR) methods based on deep learning have been proposed and have achieved remarkable performance. However, pan-sharpening requires paired panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images, and SR cannot increase the spectral resolution of PAN. Thus, we introduce a computational imaging-based method to recover or produce the incomplete data of single PAN or MS. This work also explores the integration of multiple tasks by a single neural network. We start with SR and colorization, study the feasibility of simultaneously finishing SR colorization, and use a model trained in SR colorization to finish pan-sharpening without MS. A generic neural network, remote sensing image improvement network (RSI-Net), is designed for remote sensing image SR, colorization, simultaneous SR colorization, and pan-sharpening. To verify its performance, RSI-Net is compared with the state-of-the-art SR and colorization methods. Experiments show that RSI-Net can be competitive in visual effects and evaluation indexes, and it performs well at simultaneous SR colorization, and RSI-Net finishes pan-sharpening and only needs to input PAN. Our experiments confirm the effect of integrating multiple tasks.

TI  - Remote Sensing Evaluation and Influence Factor Analysis of Ecological Environment Quality in the Fenghe River Watershed
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to accurately assess the quality of ecological environment through remote sensing data, which is of great importance to decision-making guidance for regional ecological environmental protection and sustainable development. Taking the Fenghe River watershed as the research object, the indicators of greenness, humidity, dryness, and heat were extracted from the Landsat remote sensing images and coupled into the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) to analyze the spatio.temporal variation characteristics of the ecological environment in the Fenghe River watershed over the past 20 years. Then, the spatial clustering distribution pattern of the ecological environment quality in the study area was analyzed through spatial autocorrelation analysis. At the same time, geographic detector was used to explore the dominant and interactive factors affecting the regional ecological environment. The results show the following, (1) The mean RSEI values of the Fenghe River watershed in 2001, 2005, 2011, 2015, and 2021 were 0.543, 0.600, 0.634, 0.668, and 0.649, respectively, indicating that the ecological environment in the study area improved during 2001-2015 and slightly degraded during 2015-2021. (2) The value of global Moran's I ranged from 0.767 to 0.887, showing that the spatial distribution of the ecological environmental quality in the Fenghe River watershed had a significant positive correlation. In addition, the high. high value (H-H) agglomerations were distributed in the southern part of the study area such as Luanzhen subdistrict, while the low-low value (L-L) agglomerations were mainly distributed in Wangsi subdistrict and other northern areas with high urbanization levels. Over the past 20 years, the area of the L-L agglomerations decreased obviously at first and then increased slightly. (3) The ecological environment quality of the Fenghe River watershed was not the result of the action of a single factor, but the result of enhancement after the interaction of multiple factors. For enample, the synergistic effect was significantly strengthened after the dryness indicator interacted with other factors in 2015, suggesting that the bare soil and building area had the greatest impact on the ecological environment in the Fenghe River watershed. In future development, land-use should be rationally planned to realize the coordinated development of the river watershed economy and the natural environment in the Fenghe River watershed.

TI  - Integrating Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Imagery With Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery to Improve High-Resolution Impervious Surface Area Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping impervious surface area (ISA) in an accurate and timely manner is essential for a variety of fields and applications, such as urban heat islands, hydrology, waterlogging, and urban planning and management. However, the large and complex urban landscapes pose great challenges in retrieving ISA information. Spaceborne hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing imagery provides rich spectral information with short revisit cycles, making it an ideal data source for ISA extraction from complex urban scenes. Nevertheless, insufficient single-band energy, the involvement of modulation transfer function (MTF), and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spaceborne HS imagery usually result in poor image clarity and noises, leading to inaccurate ISA extraction. To address this challenge, we propose a new deep feature fusion-based classification method to improve 10 m resolution ISA mapping by integrating Zhuhai-1 HS imagery with Sentinel-2 multispectral (MS) imagery. We extract deep features that include spectral and spatial features, respectively, from MS and HS imagery via a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN), aiming to increase feature diversity and improve the model's recognition capability. The Sentinel-2 imagery is used to enhance the spatial information of the Zhuhai-1 HS image, improving the urban ISA retrieval by reducing the impact of noises. By combining the deep spatial features and deep spectral features, we obtain joint spatial-spectral features, leading to high classification accuracy and robustness. We test the proposed method in two highly urbanized study areas that cover Foshan city and Wuhan city, China. The results reveal that the proposed method obtains an overall accuracy of 96.72% and 96.75% in the two study areas, 18.78% and 8.66% higher than classification results with only HS imagery as input. The final ISA extraction overall accuracy is 95.42% and 95.50% in the two study areas, the highest among the comparison methods.

TI  - An Improved Geometric Calibration Model for Spaceborne SAR Systems With a Case Study of Large-Scale Gaofen-3 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image positioning is commonly affected by factors such as platform instability, aging of onboard instruments, and changing observation environments. Thus, geometric calibration is needed to improve the accuracy of image positioning before mapping and application. An improved geometric calibration model for SAR images was developed, which does not require long-delayed meteorological data and geometric calibration fields. In this method, the standard atmospheric and Saastamoinen models (SAM-S) are combined for atmospheric delay correction, and this integrated method named SAM-S was used for the first time in SAR image geometric calibration. The method was applied to China's Gaofen-3 satellite and a case study was conducted in the Yangtze River Delta, where the weather is cloudy and rainy. By selecting three images, four images, and five images from eight candidate images with a bandwidth of 60 MHz for calibration experiments, where the geometric positioning accuracy was increasingly stable with more SAR images included in the combination. The root mean square of the calibrated SAR images was about 6 m for different combinations and the maximum error was about 12 m for all images. Two selected areas showed that the geometric calibration has reduced the geometric distortion, showing shapes in the SAR images close to the ground targets. The positioning accuracy improvement of Gaofen-3 images can help improve their application potential in global remote sensing mapping, land-use change monitoring, and ground target detection. The proposed geometric calibration method can also be applied to other SAR missions such as ERS, RADARSAT, and TerraSAR-X.

TI  - SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION OF REMOTE SENSING IMAGES USING DEEP LEARNING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional remote sensing image semantic segmentation has problems such as low segmentation accuracy and large model parameters and calculations. A semantic segmentation network of remote sensing images using deep learning from the perspective of ecological environment protection is proposed. Firstly, the "Gaofen-5" remote sensing image set is preprocessed by means of data cutting and image denoising to improve the data quality. Then, the local and global diffusion blocks (LGD) is introduced to improve the EfficientNet B0 network to construct an ENet-LGD network model to improve feature learning. Finally, the conditional random field model is improved based on superpixels. That is, each small block of the super pixel reflects the boundary of the feature, which further improves the segmentation effect. The experimental results based on the Pingshuo mining area in Shanxi Province show that the proposed network can accurately reflect the surface types and their boundaries. The average segmentation accuracy is 0.865, which is better than other comparison networks. It provides a certain theoretical basis for subsequent practical applications.

TI  - Environmental drivers of phytoplankton crops and taxonomic composition in northeastern Antarctic Peninsula adjacent sea area
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem of the sea region adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula is undergoing remarkable physical and biological changes, in the context of global warming. However, understanding of the dynamics of phytoplankton taxonomic composition in this marginal ice zone remains unclear. In this study, seawater samples collected from 36 stations in the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula were analyzed for nutrients and phytoplankton pigments. Combining with CHEMTAX analysis, remote sensing data, and physicochemical measurements, we investigated the relationships between phytoplankton crops, taxonomic composition, and marine environmental drivers. Integrated chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations (200 m) varied from 8.9 mg/m(2) to 64.2 mg/m(2), with an average of (23.2 +/- 12.0) mg/m(2) and higher phytoplankton biomass concentrated in the coastal region of South Orkney Island and South Shetland Island. Diatoms were the dominant functional group (63%+/- 21%). Higher proportions of diatoms were associated with higher Chl a (r=0.40, p<0.01), stable water columns (r=0.20, p<0.01), higher Si/P ratios (r=0.34, p<0.01), higher photosynthetically active radiation intensity (r=0.64, p<0.01), and higher sea ice melt water contributions (MWC, r=0.20, p<0.01). Conversely, Phaeocystis antarctica contributed a smaller overall proportion (31%+/- 18%) and was more concentrated in the offshore water masses (e.g., Philip Ridge and South Scotia Ridge) with lower light levels (r=-0.58, p<0.01), deeper mixed layer depths (r=0.17, p<0.05), higher nutrient concentrations (e.g., N, P, and Si, r>0.35, p<0.01), and lower MWC (r=-0.20, p<0.01). In comparison, the total contribution from green flagellates (4%+/- 5%), cryptophyta (1%+/- 3%), dinoflagellates (1%+/- 4%), and cyanobacteria (1% +/- 5%) was only 6%. In offshore regions with well-mixed water, less varied taxonomic composition and lower crops with a higher proportion of nanophytoplankton were observed. In contrast, significantly decreasing crops below the mixed layer depth was observed in water columns with strong stratification, where the dominant phytoplankter changed from diatoms to P. antarctica. These findings have important implications for better understanding the future dynamics of marine ecosystems in the sea area adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula.

TI  - Using a Low-Cost Green Light Emitting Diode to Measure Total Suspended Solids in a Marine Protected Area of the Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seawater parameters are important indicators of coastal water conditions. One of the essential parameters is the total suspended solids (TSS). This study probed how to use a low-cost 535-nm green LED to measure the TSS in marine protected areas of barangay Lo-ong, Concepcion, Iloilo, Philippines. It aims to examine the relationship of the total attenuation coefficients (TAC) to total suspended solids (TSS) values in coastal water. Sample sea waters were taken from various locations and brought to a laboratory for a filtration process known as gravimetry. Different available filter paper sizes (1.5 microns, 6 microns, 20 microns, and 50 microns) were used in the filtration process and were dried in a controlled constant temperature of 110 degrees Celsius for 24 hours using an electric oven. Dried filter papers' weights were measured using an analytical balance before using the infiltration of seawater. TAC values were also measured in different seawater samples using a prototype device made up of LED and photodiode. This study demonstrated that TAC values of green LEDs are positively correlated with TSS values (R value of 0.45). Results reveal that the moderate correlation between an LED's TAC values to TSS positively proved that a low-cost LED can be used as an alternative to the more expensive remote sensing satellite data. Findings of the study also showed that TSS values in the marine protected area under study were far below the acceptable limits for coastal waters. The performance of the LED-based measuring device can still be improved in the future by using collimating lenses and more sensitive photomultiplier tubes.

TI  - Image, body and representation of women in Euridice and Orfeo by Antonio de Solis
T2  - CRITICON
M3  - Article
AB  - Euridice became the main character in Euridice y Orfeo by Antonio de Solis, staged in Pamplona in 1643 and adapted to be performed at Coliseo del Buen Retiro in 1655. The playwright created a love- honourjelalousy conflict based on Euridice. But in her baroque characterization for stage, several questions linked to the limits of art and the representation of women came into light and activated some epistemological problems which were essential to Seventeenth century worldview regarding body-image and life-art dialectics. In Coliseo's rendition Solis could moreover profit from a number of performing options not only in order to intensify the visual power of mythological fest but also deepen into tensions about the representation of the female which also appeared in poetry and visual arts.

TI  - A MULTIMODAL TRANSLATION OF FOLKTALES: TEXT, ILLUSTRATION AND CULTURAL COUNTERSIGNS IN EL HEMATOCRITICO
T2  - MONTI
M3  - Article
AB  - Folktale versions can be understood as successive translations of archetypes underlying them. In the case of El Hematocritico's stories, this translation happens in a double sense: that of the text and that of the illustration. In the dialogue of both aspects emerges the whole sense of the story. In this paper, we will analyze the connection between both of them in a narrative sense, but in the descriptive one as well. On the other side, these stories have been published between 2014 and 2020, which makes the dialog go from a timeless view of the world to another one clearly marked by a postdigital (or hiperdigital) culture. Besides of this, but connected with it, we find in theses stories some cultural countersigns devoted mostly to adults intermediating in children's reading. They show collective worldview transformation after years of interaction between reading and mass media.

TI  - Time-Resolved Sentinel-3 Vegetation Indices Via Inter-Sensor 3-D Convolutional Regression Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel missions provide widespread opportunities of exploiting inter-sensor synergies to improve the operational monitoring of terrestrial photosynthetic activity and canopy structural variations using vegetation indices (VI). In this context, continuous and consistent temporal data are logically required to rapidly detect vegetation changes across sensors. Nonetheless, the existing temporal limitations inherent to satellite orbits, cloud occlusions, data degradation, and many other factors may severely constrain the availability of data involving multiple satellites. In response, this letter proposes a novel deep 3-D convolutional regression network (3CRN) for temporally enhancing Sentinel-3 (S3) VI by taking advantage of inter-sensor Sentinel-2 (S2) observations. Unlike existing regression and deep learning-based methods, the proposed approach allows convolutional kernels to slide across the temporal dimension to exploit not only the higher spatial resolution of the S2 instrument but also its own temporal evolution to better estimate time-resolved VI in S3. To validate the proposed approach, we built a database made of multiple day-synchronized S2 and S3 operational products from a study area in Extremadura (Spain). The conducted experimental comparison, including multiple state-of-the-art regression and deep learning models, shows the statistically significant advantages of the presented framework.

TI  - ForestAz-Using Google Earth Engine and Sentinel data for forest monitoring in the Azores Islands (Portugal)
T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: ForestAz application was developed to (i) map Azorean forest areas accurately through semiautomatic supervised clas-sification; (ii) assess vegetation condition (e.g., greenness and moisture) by computing and comparing several spectral indices; and (iii) quantitatively evaluate the stocks and dynamics of aboveground carbon (AGC) sequestrated by Azorean forest areas. Area of study: ForestAz focuses primarily on the Public Forest Perimeter of S. Miguel Island (Archipelago of the Azores, Portugal), with about 3808 hectares. Materials and methods: ForestAz was developed with Javascript for the Google Earth Engine platform, relying solely on open satellite remote sensing data, as Copernicus Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral). Main results: By accurately mapping S. Miguel island forest areas using a detailed species-based vegetation mapping approach; by allowing frequent and periodic monitoring of vegetation condition; and by quantitatively assessing the stocks and dynamics of AGC by these forest areas, this remote sensing-based application may constitute a robust and low-cost operational tool able to support local/regional decision-making on forest planning and management. Research highlights: This collaborative initiative between the University of the Azores and the Azores Regional Authority in Forest Affairs was selected to be one of the 99 user stories by local and regional authorities described in the catalog edited by the European Com-mission, the Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies (NEREUS Association), and the European Space Agency (ESA).

TI  - Does philosophical knowledge presuppose a moral attitude? A discussion of Max Scheler's metaphilosophical thesis
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores Max Scheler's metaphilosophical views. In particular, the paper seeks to reconstruct and assess Scheler's thesis according to which philosophical knowledge presupposes a moral attitude which he describes as an "act of upsurge" on the part of the whole person of the philosopher toward the essential, an act which cannot be found in either the natural worldview or the sciences. After motivating the topic in the introduction (section 1), the paper explores how Scheler approaches the question about the nature of philosophy by focusing on the type of person of the philosopher (section 2). It then examines Scheler's claim according to which philosophy is fundamentally distinct from the sciences (section 3), before exploring the moral attitude of the philosopher by examining three of its conditions: love, self-humbling, and self-mastery (section 4). The paper presents some challenges and objections against Scheler's metaphilosophical thesis. In particular, critiques of its metaphysical implications and of the view of science implicit in it are provided (section 5). Finally, it is also argued that the thesis contains a grain of truth and as such a moderate interpretation of it could be defended (section 6). The main findings are summarized in the conclusion (section 7).

TI  - Seasonal-land-covers dynamics in a semi-arid region of Argentina using remote sensing techniques
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA VENEZOLANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate supervised and unsupervised classification methods to organize land cover on a seasonal scale with high spatial resolution in the south of the Pampeana Region (Argentina). Field trips were made, and georeferenced sites were recorded with a differential GPS. Moreover, SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 satellite images were processed on which spectral indices of vegetation, soil and water were calculated. Five classification methods were applied based on reflectivity and spectral knowledge of land cover. The results were compared with a pixel-by-pixel confusion matrix and the Kappa Coefficient (CK). From the analysis, it was obtained that in the spring and summer, the Mahalanobis Distance method was the one that yielded more precise values. At the same time, for Autumn and Winter, it was the Maximum Likelihood (CK of 0.90 and 0.97, respectively). Designed maps represent an essential tool for those spaces that base their economy on rainfed agricultural production and show high climatic vulnerability to the occurrence of extreme precipitation events.

TI  - On the Combination of Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 Ascending/Descending Orbiting Passes to Estimate Damage Due to the 2016 Central Italy Earthquake
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the extra benefit provided by the joint use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetric diversity and ascending/descending orbit passes to quantify postearthquake damage that occurred over the area of Amatrice, an Italian city significantly damaged by the 2016 Central Italy earthquake. First, the sensitivity of PolSAR features derived from SAR scenes collected under ascending/descending orbits to the damage is investigated. Then, the damage assessment is performed using a processing chain that consists of extracting dual-polarimetric SAR features to detect damage and, then, applying a fuzzy clustering scheme, to partition the feature outputs into damage levels. This processing chain is first separately applied to Sentinel-1 SAR scenes collected under ascending/descending orbits; then the processing outputs are merged using two different approaches. To discuss the quality of the estimated damage maps, ground information collected by surveys performed by a trained team is used. Experimental results show that the joint use of ascending/descending orbit passes improves the estimation of damage levels (up to 78%) with respect to the estimation performed using the orbiting passes separately.

TI  - A Hybrid Robotic Network for Maritime Situational Awareness: Results From the INFORE22 Sea Trial
T2  - 2022 OCEANS HAMPTON ROADS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS Hampton Roads Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this paper we describe an integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) applications, built on a cooperative autonomous robotic network, and developed in the maritime use case of the INFORE EU H2020 project. INFORE project developed an interactive, real-time, extreme-scale analytics and forecasting system for handling and analysing massive streams of data. The MSA INFORE system exploits the synergy between global view (AIS data, ESA Sentinel satellite data), which provide contextual information over a wide area, and local view produced by a sensorised hybrid robotic network. Such a network was validated during the INFORE22 sea trial, held off the coast of Portovenere, Italy, in the Gulf of La Spezia, in February-March 2022. It was composed of a thermal camera and of two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with passive sonars. The robots fused their measurements, and cooperatively adapted their navigation for localising a suspicious vessel, communicating her position to the MSA INFORE platform in real-time. For controlling the robots, we developed a perception layer, based on an occupancy grid map framework, which enabled the fusion of passive sonar bearing-only measurements for target localisation. The perception layer was also the basis for making cooperative decisions to adapt the network spatial configuration for improving mission performance.In this paper we report and discuss results from the INFORE22 trial. These results are one the first demonstrations of how data fusion and cooperative autonomy can increase the performance of a complex robotic network in a passive sonar surveillance mission in a real-world scenario. The INFORE MSA systems paves the way towards the development of complex, integrated MSA systems, which exploit robotic networks, characterised by advanced cooperative autonomy capabilities, for improving the local view picture, and for promptly reacting to the evolving scenario.

T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - This study aimed at exploring the potential of neural networks composed of convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to handle dense Sentinel-1 data time series to develop a tree cover loss Early Warning System (EWS). The study area was in the Madre de Dios region in Peru that hosts a humid tropical forest. The second objective of this study was to investigate the potential of large free open-source datasets such as those from the GLAD and Geobosques alerts to calibrate and validate the models. The study demonstrated the capacity of the tested NN models to improve the detection of tree cover loss compared to a classical random forest algorithm thanks to their capacity to handle explicitly both spatial and temporal data. The accuracies of the best model compare reasonably well with those from similar studies. However, the observed overestimation of the Cover-loss class in the output map can be mainly linked to the quality of the alert datasets used as input data. Avenues to overcome the identified limits of this preliminary study are presented. This work provides a solid knowledge basis on the potential of a NN-based EWS and opens potential avenues for further improvements.

TI  - Philosophical Senses of Patriotism in the Conditions of Contemporary World Development: Perspective and Retrospective Dimensions
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to clarify the most relevant philosophical dimensions of modern patriotism against the background of defending the processes of national identity. The theoretical basis of the study consisted of institutional analysis, synergetic and philosophical-anthropological approaches, as well as existential philosophy and philosophy of applied ethics. Patriotism is seen as a path to self-expression, the world of life, mental self-limitation and self- aggrandizement of modern man. The peculiarities of modern considerations about the philosophical content of patriotism within the framework of its comparison with other value structures, such as cosmopolitanism, liberalism, nationalism, etc., are established. Originality. The scientific novelty is that the article for the first time reveals the correlations of patriotism with other ideological and ideological doctrines and systems of political and social worldview, which fix the identity of individuals and groups in the context of ethnic, social or political community. Conclusions. The existential dimension of patriotism is based on worldviews of involvement in the local community. Trends in globalization are forcing modern people to "seek refuge" in small communities, or even in a family or other small group. "Local" or "neighborhood" patriotism acquires the character of an expression of involvement in a friend and relative. It almost completely "crosses out" the constitutional and ideological patriotism inherent in the states of the twentieth century. The reorientation of significant philosophical justifications of patriotism in modern conditions provokes a discussion about the spirituality and societal nature of patriotic meanings. In the struggle for the independence of modern Ukraine, we are all witnessing the process of overcoming "state" patriotism "local". This process is very important in the face of opposition to the totalitarian ideology of the Russian aggressor.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. At the current stage of information technology development, methods for remote sensing have been increasingly used for mineral exploration.Problem Statement. Significant capital intensity of geological works for intrusive bodies search when the crystalline basement is overlapped by a thin sedimentary cover requires the implementation of advanced methods that, on the one hand, allow reducing the costs of exploration and, on the other hand, enable increasing the accuracy of objects identification.Purpose. The development of methodological framework for the application of remote sensing data to identify prospective areas in search of buried intrusive bodies.Materials and Methods. Medium (Landsat, Sentinel) and high (WorldView) resolution optical satellite imagery data in the thermal infrared and visible ranges of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum; radar satellite data (SRTM), multispectral aerial survey data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles; methods for structural interpretation, digital terrain model analysis, results of field thermometry have been used in this research.Results. A few prospective sites for the search for buried intrusions within the Hubkivska and Anastasivsko-Bolyarska squares of the Novohrad-Volynskyi block of the Ukrainian Shield, regardless of the geophysical data, have been identified. These objects were later confirmed by detailed geomagnetic surveying and drilling. Within the detected thermal anomalies, several small (60 -120 m long and 30-50 m wide) dikes have been detected. Four of the 5 wells drilled have confirmed the presence of dike bodies, and 1 well enters the fracture zone. In other areas, where detailed geophysical survey was carried out within the detected thermal anomalies, new dike bodies have been discoveredConclusions. The developed technique may be used as an additional tool in geological prospecting.

AB  - This paper examines Joseph's non-interment as the main reason for Jacob's lack of consolation in Philo's De Iosepho 16-27, in which his attitude toward bereavement and grief is reflected, to demonstrate the existence of GraecoRoman consolatory literature grounded in the Stoic worldview alongside that of other philosophical schools in Philo. The biblical concern for proper burial as well as the Roman notion that leaving a corpse unburied had unpleasant repercussions on the fate of the departed soul may be the key to understanding Jacob's surprising words in De Iosepho 23 " it is not your death which grieves me, but the manner of it".

CL  - Dublin, IRELAND
AB  - This abstract discusses the development of a Part-of-Speech tagger for te reo Maori, which is the Indigenous language of Aotearoa - New Zealand. It mostly focuses on the creation of a tagset that is appropriate for Maori. This is in consideration of the fact that some tagsets have existing tags that are not suitable for some Maori word classes. Alternatively, the existing tagsets might lack entirely a suitable tag for some Maori word classes. And finally. some existing tagsets do not adequately reflect a Maori worldview. Emphasis is put on the importance of capturing the language according to the conceptualization of its speakers. and not imposing "traditional" grammatical categories where it is not appropriate. The solution involved changing how some existing tags are used and in some cases creating entirely new tags that are appropriate for Te reo Maori. The Part-of-Speech tagger was successfully built by a Maori Indigenous organisation and is being used as the foundation for other applications.

TI  - Unsupervised Sparse Unmixing of Atmospheric Trace Gases From Hyperspectral Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a new approach for the retrieval of the vertical column concentrations of trace gases from hyperspectral satellite observations is proposed. The main idea is to perform a linear spectral unmixing by estimating the abundances of trace gases' spectral signatures in each mixed pixel collected by an imaging spectrometer in the ultraviolet region. To this aim, the sparse nature of the measurements is brought to light and the compressive sensing paradigm is applied to estimate the concentrations of the gases' endmembers given by an a priori wide spectral library, including reference cross sections measured at different temperatures and pressures at the same time. The proposed approach has been experimentally assessed using both simulated and real hyperspectral datasets. Specifically, the experimental analysis relies on the retrieval of sulfur dioxide during volcanic emissions using data collected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument. To validate the procedure, we also compare the obtained results with the sulfur dioxide total column product based on the differential optical absorption spectroscopy technique and the retrieved concentrations estimated using the blind source separation.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Climate change is affecting the planet due to lack of information regarding its temperatures, precipitation and decrease in the surface area of the snow-capped mountains, which causes a high impact on the melting of the snow-capped mountains, for this reason it is important to have predictive models of multivariate regressions that allow forecasting the surface area of snowcapped mountains over time. In the investigation, the multivariate regression model was used for each snowfall under study, having as regressive variables the temperature, precipitation and as a dependent variable the surface area of the snowfall with data obtained through Landsat 4-5, 7 and 8 images during the years 2010-2020. A model of the snow-capped Huaytapallana was obtained in the form y = 34.274 - 2.3197 X-1 + 0.135 X-2 with p-value = 0.034 of significance and the snow-capped Coropuna with a model of the shape y = 101.34876.720 X-1 + 0.331 X-2 having p-value = 0.036 being significant for your prediction. The mean of the highest surface area was Coropuna (53.92 km(2)) with a SD of 14.94, and the lowest was Veronica (16.16 km(2)) with a SD of 37.77. The Huaytapallana mountain showed the least reduction in surface area, decreasing by 7%, while the Veronica mountain was reduced by 52%, being the most affected of the 4 snow-capped mountains, due to the melting under study during the 10 years of data analyzed.

AB  - The Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired using the TOPSAR modes i.e., IW and EW on cross-polarization are significantly affected by the thermal noise on low-back-scattering areas. For example, in the arctic and some desert zones both interswath and inter-burst noise amplification occurs. In this paper we propose a workflow for removing the thermal noise from Sentinel-1 ground detected SAR images on low back-scattering conditions by employing the co-polarization SAR image and the Gaussian Process Regression. Our processing flow uses the noise vectors provided in the European Space Agency (ESA) ground detected product and scales them such that a slightly over-denoised image is produced. Then, the Gaussian Process Regression is used to map the co-polarization SAR image into the cross-polarization SAR image. Prior to this step, a radiometric correction is applied on the co-polarization data, since its pixel values are heavily dependent on the incidence angle. Finally, the denoised cross-polarization image is obtained as a linear combination between the over-denoised version and the predicted image. Since, the co-polarization channel is employed for the prediction of the missing values in the cross-polarization channel there is no need for co-registration and the denoising procedure is trustworthy.

TI  - Mediation Effects of Self-Regulation in the Relationship between School Engagement and Academic Success of Students of Different Ages
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presented study's objective is to identi-fy the mediating role of conscious self -regu-lation in the relationship between the com-ponents of school engagement and the aca-demic performance of students of different grades. We used the following methods: the Russian version of the questionnaire "Multidimensional School Enga gement Scale" (Wang et al., 2019b; Fomina, Morosanova, 2020); V.I. Moro sanova's questionnaire "The Self-Regu la tion Profile of Learning Activity Ques tion naire (SRPLAQ)" (Morosanova, Bon darenko, 2017). The study analyzes the data obtained from a sample of students in grades 5-11 (N = 1127). New significant results were obtained on the relationship between conscious self-regulation and school engagement, as well as the specifics of their joint contribution to the academic performance of students of different ages. It is shown that conscious self-regulation acts not only as a resource for academic success but also as a factor mediating the impact of school engagement (its general level and individual components) on academic per-formance. The analysis showed the mediat-ing effects of conscious self-regulation related to cognitive, emotional, behavioral and social components of school engage-ment. The analysis of moderated mediation revealed significant moderating effects of the age factor (school grade) on the rela-tionship between self-regulation, school engagement and academic performance. The most pronounced mediating effects were found in grades 7, 10, 11. The obtained results are discussed in the con-text of the problem of conscious self -regula-tion development, the dynamics of school engagement and academic motivation in different periods of education, and the pos-sibility of developing practical programs aimed at maintaining school engagement and academic performance of students.

TI  - Antarctic biological soil crusts surface reflectance patterns from landsat and sentinel-2 images
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing techniques must be used to obtain long-term information in remote areas, like the Antarctic continent, to monitor the environmental productivity and its changes. The aim of this work was to analyze the surface reflectance profile patterns for the Antarctic biological soil crusts (algae, lichens, and mosses) in an area of Nelson Island (South Shetland Islands, maritime Antarctic), calculated from Landsat and Sentinel-2 images to identify its similarities and differences due to targets, sensors and acquired date. The surface reflectance values for Antarctic biological soil crusts are similar for those observed for biological soil crusts in other Earth extreme environments, like deserts. In Landsat images, the differences among biological soil crusts surface reflectance were identified at visible and near-infrared wavelengths and for Sentinel-2 images, the differences occur at visible, red-edge and shortwave infrared wavelengths, showing the feasibility of using surface reflectance products to identify these different crusts, despite its inherent pixel spectral mixture. Long-term biophysical parameters from such crusts as retrieved from orbital data is not possible due to very low cloud-free images over the Antarctic, which prevents building a consistent surface reflectance time-series which covers all biological soil crusts growth season.

TI  - Early-Season Crop Mapping on an Agricultural Area in Italy Using <i>X</i>-Band Dual-Polarization SAR Satellite Data and Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-season crop mapping provides decision-makers with timely information on crop types and conditions that are crucial for agricultural management. Current satellite-based mapping solutions mainly rely on optical imagery, albeit limited by weather conditions. Very few exploit long-time series of polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. To address this gap, we assessed the performance of COSMO-SkyMed X-band dual-polarized (HH, VV) data in a test area in Ponte a Elsa (central Italy) in January-September 2020 and 2021. A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier arranged with two different architectures (1-D and 3-D) was trained and used to recognize ten classes. Validation was undertaken with in situ measurements from regular field campaigns carried out during satellite overpasses over more than 100 plots each year. The 3-D classifier structure and the combination of HH+VV backscatter provide the best classification accuracy, especially during the first months of each year, i.e., 80% already in April 2020 and in May 2021. Overall accuracy above 90% is always marked from June using the 3-D classifier with HH, VV, and HH+VV backscatter. These experiments showcase the value of the developed SAR-based early-season crop mapping approach. The influence of vegetation phenology, structure, density, biomass, and turgor on the CNN classifier using X-band data requires further investigations, along with the relatively low producer accuracy marked by vineyard and uncultivated fields.

AB  - As climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of climate and weather hazards, improving detection and monitoring of flood events is a priority. Being weather independent and high resolution, Sentinel 1 (S1) radar satellite imagery data has become the go to data source to detect flood events accurately. However, current methods are either based on fixed thresholds to differentiate water from land or train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models based on only S1 data, despite the availability of many other relevant data sources publicly. These models also lack comprehensive validations on out-of-sample data and deployment at scale. In this study, we investigated whether adding extra input layers could increase the performance of AI models in detecting floods from 51 data. We also provide performance across a range of 11 historical events, with results ranging between 0.93 and 0.97 accuracy, 0.53 and 0.81 IoU, and 0.68 and 0.89 F1 scores. Finally, we show the infrastructure we developed to deploy our AI models at scale to satisfy a range of use cases and user requests.

TI  - SEnSeI: A Deep Learning Module for Creating Sensor Independent Cloud Masks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a novel neural network architecture-spectral encoder for sensor independence (SEnSeI)-by which several multispectral instruments, each with different combinations of spectral bands, can be used to train a generalized deep learning model. We focus on the problem of cloud masking, using several preexisting datasets, and a new, freely available dataset for Sentinel-2. Our model is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the satellites on which it was trained (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) and is able to extrapolate to sensors that it has not seen during training, such as Landsat 7, PeruSat-1, and Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). Model performance is shown to improve when multiple satellites are used in training, approaching, or surpassing the performance of specialized, single-sensor models. This work is motivated by the fact that the remote sensing community has access to data taken with a huge variety of sensors. This has inevitably led to labeling efforts being undertaken separately for different sensors, which limits the performance of deep learning models, given their need for huge training sets to perform optimally. Sensor independence can enable deep learning models to utilize multiple datasets for training simultaneously, boosting performance, and making them much more widely applicable. This may lead to deep learning approaches being used more frequently for onboard applications and in ground segment data processing, which generally requires models to be ready at launch or soon afterward.

AB  - Soil moisture has a strong influence on the stability of shallow colluvial hillslopes. Thus, it is often necessary to monitor seasonal variations of soil moisture at individual sites of interest. This work demonstrated a workflow showing that satellite-based soil moisture data can be downscaled through machine learning and used as a source of data for landslide stability analyses. In particular, the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 Root Zone Soil Moisture (L4_SM) product provides near-real-time measurements of soil moisture on a gridded spatial resolution of 9 km. Such resolution, however, is too coarse for soil moisture measurements at a single site. Therefore, satellite-based soil moisture data must be downscaled for use in slope stability assessment at individual sites. This study used a machine learning (ML) technique, Random Forest Regression, to downscale the SMAP Level 4 Root Zone Soil Moisture product and applied the results to landslide slope stability analyses. We modeled the L4_SM data based on 1 km NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. First, the MODIS products were upscaled from 1 km to 9 km and used as features, combining with L4_SM data as labels to train the Random Forest model. Then, the L4_SM data were downscaled from 9 km to 1 km through the trained model and locally calibrated to that of ground-based data by linear regression. The processed SMAP data were served as the input of an infinite-slope stability model, which was used to investigate incipient slope failure conditions. The slope stability results were verified using known landslide occurrences in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Results of this work showed that the stability models constructed using downscaled L4_SM data functioned well at detecting incipient conditions at the investigated sites. The purpose behind this study was to develop a process flow routine through which SMAP L4_SM data can be downscaled through machine learning as well as investigating the potential efficacy of utilizing downscaled L4_SM to conduct landslide stability analyses.

AB  - Lakes and reservoirs are considered sentinels of climate and anthropogenic changes. Lakes and reservoirs surface water storage is an essential hydrological variable but poorly known as this information is scarce. Earth Observation data are a reliable source of information to overcome this scarcity. Among these, the combined use of satellite images, to derive water extent, and radar altimetry, which enables to estimate water levels, provides valuable information on water storage changes. Here, we used Synthetic Aperture Radar images from Sentinel-1 and radar altimetry data from Sentinel-3 to monitor the water volume changes of Lake Bracciano from 2016 to 2021. This lake was affected by a water crisis in 2017 and the water supply to the city of Rome (Italy) was interrupted September 2017 to preserve its ecosystem. Hence, we demonstrate how Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-3 data can be useful to monitor water extent and level, which can be profoundly changed by the climate crisis.

AB  - As part of the Polytechnic of Bari's research project on the evaluation of the geological risk in the coastal environment (DICATECH), the planimetric position of the coastline of the Puglia Region was analyzed using a digitally extracted orthophoto made available from the Office of the State Property of the Puglia Region in 2017.Remote sensing data analysis led to the geometric extraction of the shoreline from orthophoto maps through automatic extraction and visual digitization techniques. Particular attention was paid to the geological analysis of the coast, with respect to its morphological characters. A comparison study was conducted using the most recent cartographic surveys available on the official geological cartography (CARG project).The results have allowed a more detailed and in-depth definition of some aspects of geological cartography and the various elements of geohazard as well as a clearer reconstruction of the mechanisms of interaction between the various processes involved in geohazard.The detailed analysis of some of the most representative cases has also confirmed the complexity of the coastal issues and highlighted some crucial questions about the making of geological cartography and coastal maps of the ongoing CARG project to further investigate.We call for a greater in-depth knowledge of the geomorphological and meteomarine characteristics of the coastal environment to observe its evolution through accurate and continuous monitoring over time. This allows the analysis of evolutionary trends and both natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the delicate balance of the coastline.

AB  - World-wide, snow avalanches are one of the main natural hazard in cold mountain areas, threatening life and infrastructure. For a snow avalanche expert, it takes several hours to visually inspect and map individual snow avalanche paths. At times this task cannot be accomplished before several days after a snow avalanche cycle. Several studies have shown that data from space-borne optical sensors, as well as from radar sensors, can be used to detect and map snow avalanche debris. Being able to remotely detect and record snow avalanches aids to target mitigation strategies. Here we present several examples on how the analysis of optical and radar satellite data can yield hind-cast snow avalanche inventory observations on a regional scale.

TI  - Multispectral Remote Sensing for mapping the areas affected by the techno-industrial disaster of the oil spill on Brazilian beaches
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the emergence in August 2019 of portions of varying sizes of crude oil on several beaches in the Northeast region of Brazil, various studies have been conducted to identify the source of the disaster and estimate the damage caused. This article aims to contribute to this scientific effort in order to describe an extensive mapping that used Remote Sensing data of the impacted areas and its correlation with socioeconomic typology of the municipalities directly affected. The research was based on the list of 201 oiled beaches published on October 28th, 2019 in Technical Note from the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA, 2019). Applying the Supervised Classification to images from the MSI/Sentinel-2 sensor, a methodology for beach cartography was defined, then geographical sections were subsequently classified and quantified by thematic classes. This thematic mapping fostered to obtain a proxy of the possible impacted areas up to that date, generating an "Atlas of Beaches Affected by Oil" with 402 maps of the affected beaches, which is available on the Joaquim Nabuco Foundation website. This mapping is unprecedented and it becomes important for the environmental monitoring of these areas. This article was prepared from a request for the special edition of the AABC journal.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the levels of environmental contamination in a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. For this, two areas were chosen along the Mearim River: the reference area (A1) and the potentially contaminated area (A2), where water samples were collected, for physicochemical and microbiological analyses, as well as specimens of Hoplias malabaricus, for the evaluation of biometric data and incidence of branchial lesions. The physicochemical analyzes of the water from both areas showed contamination (low levels of dissolved oxygen, tubidity and high iron concentrations, especially in A2). The microbiological analyzes showed that all water samples showed total coliform values higher than those acceptable by CONAMA and WHO (with higher values in A2), in addition to E. coli values higher than those allowed by legislation in A2. Regarding biometric data, male and female fishes were significantly longer and heavier in A1 during the dry and rain seasons and the gonadosomatic index also showed higher values in A1 than in A2 in both seasons. H. malabaricus showed gill lesions of minimal to moderate pathological importance in A1 and A2, indicating that specimens from both areas of the Mearim River showed biological responses to contamination. The observed changes in the water quality, bimetic parameters and the histological analyzes of the specimens of H. malabaricus directly reflect on the quality and health of the fishes in the Mearim River, and point to the urgent need for prevention and remediation of contamination in these ecosystems.

AB  - This contribution presents an approach for generating and modelling spatially referenced, multi-dimensional urban models from remote sensing data for regions where no reliable reference data are available. The focus is on a modular service-oriented process chain covering the entire process from data acquisition to effective web-based visualization, addressing raw data, preprocessing, management, spatial analyses, visualisation and applications. The use case, investigated in the framework of a EU-funded multidisciplinary R+D project, is the cityspace of East Jerusalem (about 190 about 190 sqkm). Due to the controversial geopolitical situation, usable and high-resolution reference data of the complex, granular urban fabric is unavailable. Hence very high-resolution stereo aerial images (571 pcs. 'a 10 cm GSD) were acquired and photogram-metrically processed to build a high-resolution 3D reference point cloud. Corresponding semantic data from various sources and household surveys (3,500 pcs.) specially conducted were integrated into the data and managed within a unified, fully-referenced 3D database (opensource). The resulting virtual urban 3D model includes functionalities for geospatial exploration and analysis, allowing spatio-temporal applications, such as land use/management, social/technical infrastructure, or tourism for documentation, information, education as well as decision-making. It addresses both the local civil society and, through specific functions, urban planners and decision makers. Analysis and interaction functionalities are provided in a user-oriented and application-related framework, taking into account effective visualisation (cartographic and visual gestalt principles). The independent spatial reference of a multiscale grid is used for spatial analyses and visualisation purposes. The generic construction of the dedicated virtual cityspace allows for the transferability of results.

TI  - Axillary Reverse Lymphatic Mapping in the Treatment of Axillary Accessory Breast Cancer: A Case Report and Review of Management
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Accessory breast tissue is a rare aberration of normal breast development, that presents most commonly in the axilla. Similar to normal breast tissue, it can undergo physiologic and pathologic changes, including malignant transformation. We report a rare case of accessory breast cancer, treated with surgical resection and axillary reverse mapping (ARM), and review current literature focusing on management. We report a 68-year-old female with a history of left breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and axillary dissection, who later developed in-breast recurrence treated with re-lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy which mapped at the contralateral (right) axilla, but was negative. Two years later screening imaging revealed right axillary tail focal asymmetry with two spiculated masses. Core biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and histologic examination of the biopsy could not determine whether this represents a new primary breast cancer or axillary metastasis from the contralateral site. She underwent lumpectomy of the two masses and sentinel node biopsy. During surgery, the masses were identified in the axilla itself, rather than the axillary tail. Final pathology revealed IDC, pT1N0(sn), and extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Due to positive margins, she underwent re-lumpectomy with ARM. Final pathology revealed residual DCIS with negative new margins. The patient was referred for adjuvant radiotherapy. Accessory axillary breast tissue can be confused with axillary tail tissue. It is necessary for the surgeon to distinguish between them by meticulous physical examination and radiologic evaluation, as resection of axillary breast tissue may warrant reverse lymphatic mapping for lymphedema prevention.

TI  - A Generalized Complex-Valued Constrained Energy Minimization Scheme for the Arctic Sea Ice Extraction Aided With Neural Algorithm
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the significant role of sea ice in the Arctic-related research, developing high-precision and robust Arctic sea ice extraction techniques for multi-source remote-sensing images encounters a great challenge. In the light of the constrained energy minimization scheme, this article provides a generalized complex-valued constrained energy minimization (GCVCEM) scheme for the Arctic sea ice extraction with strong robustness and accessible implementation. Given the fact that the image extraction process is easily disturbed by noise in real-life application scenarios, a modified Newton integration (MNI) neural algorithm with the noise-tolerance ability and high extraction accuracy is proposed to aid the GCVCEM scheme. Its key idea is to add an error integration feedback term on the basis of the Newton-Raphson iterative (NRI) algorithm to resist noise perturbation on the solution process of the GCVCEM scheme for high-precision and robust extraction of the Arctic sea ice. Besides, the corresponding convergence analyses and robustness proofs on the proposed MNI neural algorithm are furnished. To evaluate the extraction performance of the proposed MNI neural algorithm, multiple comparative experiments with different sea ice observation images and different noise workspaces are performed. Both the visualized and quantitative experimental results substantiate the superiorities of the proposed MNI neural algorithm aided the GCVCEM scheme for the Arctic sea ice extraction.

AB  - Natural hazards (e.g., floods, landslides, earthquakes and hurricanes) can cause catastrophic damages and significant socioeconomic loss. In the event of a natural disaster, the time lag of satellite data availability, and the scarcity of hazard sensing and rescue resources become major obstacles. We believe motivating social and stakeholders engagement will help improve the resilience capacity against disasters, minimizing the impact of uncertainties of disasters, and allowing hazard management systems to make efficient allocation of rescue resources (e.g., first responders) and relocation plans. In this paper we propose a novel, efficient, effective, economical, and sustainable approach, which exploits resources and data from stakeholders (e.g., citizens, infrastructure managers, authorities, rescuers, NGOs, urban and land-use planners) to tackle the intrinsic uncertainty in the nature environment and the human society. This approach will help forming a new understanding and exploitation of stakeholder resources to reduce risks, provide quick responses, exploit scarce resources, save more lives, assist reliefs and beyond. We also outline some future directions including using metaverse-based emulations.

TI  - Fusion of Hyperspectral and Multispectral Images Accounting for Localized Inter-Image Changes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images (HSIs) generally comes at the expense of low spatial resolution, which hinders the application of HSIs. Fusing an HSI and a multispectral image (MSI) from different sensors to get an image with the high spatial and spectral resolution is an economic and effective approach, but localized spatial and spectral changes between images acquired at different time instants can have negative impacts on the fusion results, which has rarely been considered in many fusion methods. In this article, we propose a novel group sparsity constrained fusion (GSFus) method to fuse hyperspectral and MSIs based on matrix factorization. Specifically, we imposed l(2,1) norm on the residual term of theMSI to account for the localized interimage changes occurring during the acquisition of the hyperspectral and MSIs. Furthermore, by exploiting the plug-and-play framework, we plugged a state-of-the-art denoiser, namely block-matching and 3-D filtering (BM3D), as the prior of the subspace coefficients. We refer to the proposed fusion method as GSFus method. We performed fusion experiments on two kinds of datasets, i.e., with and without obvious localized changes between the HSIs and MSIs, and a full resolution dataset. Extensive experiments in comparison with seven state-of-the-art fusion methods suggest that the proposed fusion method is more effective on fusing hyperspectral and MSIs than the competitors.

TI  - Super-Resolution Reconstruction of Remote Sensing Images Using Generative Adversarial Network With Shallow Information Enhancement
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The super-resolution (SR) reconstruction method based on deep learning can significantly improve the spatial SR of remote sensing images. However, the current methods make insufficient use of the remote context information and channel information in shallow feature extraction, resulting in the limited effect of SR reconstruction. This article proposed a new SR reconstruction model, SIEGAN, which uses generative adversarial network with shallow information enhancement to improve the effect of SR reconstruction of remote sensing images. Similar to other generative adversarial models, SIEGAN is composed of generator and discriminator. But SIEGAN enhances the generator's ability to extract shallow information by using three different scale convolution operations. Specifically, a depthwise convolution is used to extract the local context information of each band of the image. A depthwise dilation convolution is used to capture the remote context information in the image. Finally, a 1x1 convolution is used to extract the correlation features between different channels in remote sensing images. In addition, SIEGAN uses U-Net network as its discriminator to provide detailed feedback per pixel to the generator to improve the model's ability to identify image details. And the spectral-spatial total variation loss function is introduced to ensure the spectral-spatial reliability of the reconstructed images. The experimental results on Gaofen-1 data proved that compared with the state-of-the-art models, SIEGAN has achieved better SR reconstruction performance. Furthermore, the reconstructed images by SIEGAN demonstrate better performance in land cover classification.

TI  - SatViT: Pretraining Transformers for Earth Observation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the enormous success of the "pretraining and fine-tuning" paradigm, widespread across machine learning, it has yet to pervade remote sensing (RS). To help rectify this, we pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) on 1.3 million satellite-derived RS images. We pretrain SatViT using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm called masked autoencoding (MAE), which learns general representations by reconstructing held-out image patches. Crucially, this approach does not require annotated data, allowing us to pretrain on unlabeled images acquired from Sentinel-1 and 2. After fine-tuning, SatViT outperforms SOTA ImageNet and RS-specific pretrained models on both of our downstream tasks. We further improve the overall accuracy (OA) (by 3.2% and 0.21%) by continuing to pretrain SatViT-still using MAE-on the unlabelled target datasets. Most importantly, we release our code, pretrained model weights, and tutorials aimed at helping researchers fine-tune our models (https://github.com/antofuller/SatViT).

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite Meteorological Datasets for their Application to the Distributed Rainfall-runoff Model in Scarce-data Southeast Asian Watersheds
T2  - Science Bulletin of the Faculty of Agriculture Kyushu University
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the accuracy of satellite meteorological data was firstly evaluated, and a bias correc-tion method was developed to apply these satellite meteorological data to the rainfall-runoff analysis in scarce-data watersheds of southeast Asia.The Sai Gon-Dong Nai river basin located in the southern part of Vietnam and the lower Chao Phraya river basin in Thailand were the target watersheds for the evaluation of satellite data, and the Thac Mo basin, which is a sub-basin of the Sai Gon-Dong Nai river basin, was the target of rainfall runoff analyses.The error indices of mean absolute error, root mean square error, percent bias and correlation coef-ficient were calculated for 5 types of rainfall satellite data and 2 types of evapotranspiration satellite data. As a result, the IMERG was selected for rainfall and the AgMERRA was selected for evapotran-spiration as the data with high estimation accuracy. Next, based on the results of evaluation using the spatial distribution index SPE and the spatial mapping, the AgMERRA and the MSWEP were selected for rainfall and the AgMERRA was selected for evapotranspiration as highly compatible data for the spatial distribution patternThe bias correction using the percent bias was performed on these satellite data, and as a result of using them as input values for the distributed rainfall-runoff model incorporating the tank models for several land utilizations, good simulation accuracy could be obtained.It was concluded that the satellite data with high estimation accuracy to ground-based observation data could be sufficiently applied to rainfall-runoff analysis, and that the satellite data that had high compatibility with the spatial distribution pattern of ground-based observation data could be also ap-plied to rainfall-runoff analysis by introducing the bias correction.

T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND CORPUS-BASED PHRASEOLOGY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th International Conference on Computational and Corpus-Based Phraseology (Europhras)
CL  - Malaga, SPAIN
AB  - Within the broad spectrum of phraseology, this article focuses on the phrasemes typically used in Bajan, the English-based creole spoken in Barbados, and attempts to show how they work as harbingers of culture by highlighting the uniqueness of Bajan identity within (but also outside) the Anglophone Caribbean. By relying on the amateur lexicographic works on Bajan (and Barbadian English) produced over the past seven decades and on their comparison with the professional reference tools compiled by Richard Allsopp, namely the Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage and the New Register of Caribbean English Usage, Bajan-proper phraseological items are quantified and commented on. In greater detail, this study aims at depicting the distinct worldview of Bajan speakers by looking at the images conveyed through specific idioms which employ local toponyms; although the colonial history of Barbados is hitherto evident in the Bajanisms selected, the jocular connotations attached to them convert such idioms into emblems of the Barbadian character. A further intent of this analysis is to confirm the hypothesis that, for linguists and laypeople alike, Bajan and Barbadian English, the variety of English spoken simultaneously on the island, are separated by a fine line, especially if lexical and phraseological parameters are set.

AB  - Intertidal flats are vulnerable areas that are difficult to access and that are home to many species. We are using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for the monitoring of exposed intertidal flats to assess their economic use through intensive aquacultures, and to identify areas of strong morphodynamics. Polarimetric decomposition of Gaofen-3 SAR data of various spots on the Chinese coast revealed that aquacultural rafts show different backscattering mechanisms than the surrounding mud flats. Moreover, Sentinel-1 SAR-C data are used to generate topographic maps of extended intertidal flats on the German North Sea coast. Those maps, derived for different time periods, will be used to assess morphodynamic changes.

AB  - Detecting changes in real-time using remote sensing data is of paramount importance in areas such as crop health monitoring, weed detection, and disaster management. However, real-time change detection using remote sensing imagery faces several challenges: a) it requires real-time data extraction which is a challenge for traditional satellite imagery sources such as MODIS and LANDSAT due to the latency associated with collecting and processing the data. Due to the advances made in the past decade in drone technology, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used for real-time data collection. However, a large percentage of this data will be unlabeled which limits the use of well-known supervised machine learning methods; b) from an infrastructure perspective, the cloud-edge solution of processing the data collected from UAVs (edge) only on the cloud is also constrained by latency and bandwidth-related issues. Due to these limitations, transferring large amounts of data between cloud and edge, or storing large amounts of information regarding past time periods on an edge device is infeasible. We can limit the amount of data transferred between the cloud and edge by performing analyses on-the-fly at the edge using low-power devices (edge devices) that can be connected to UAVs. However, edge devices have computational and memory bottlenecks, which would limit the usage of complex machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we demonstrate how an unsupervised GMM-based real-time change detection method at the edge can be used to identify weeds in real-time. We evaluate the scalability of our method on edge computing and traditional devices such as NVIDIA Jetson TX2, RTX 2080, and traditional Intel CPUs. We perform a case study for weed detection on images collected from UAVs. Our results demonstrate both the efficacy and computational efficiency of our method.

TI  - The Shamanism of the Island Space  in Lee Chung-jun's novel Ieodo(이어도)
T2  - Journal of the Island Culture
T2  - 『도서문화』
M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to reveal that the spatial characteristics presented in the novel Ieodo are based on shamanism as a reality-oriented embracing the transcendent world. The island space occupies a position similar to that of shamanism. Because the island is located far from the center, it is free from state power or established ideologies. Shamanism is also a religious phenomenon that forms a sub-system and exists across the power of the ruling class. If shamanism is different from established religions, while the latter aims at glory or attribution to the transcendental world, the former places value on the happiness and continuation of life by allowing the transcendental world to permeate throughout the real world. An island is a space floating in the middle of the sea, but it has properties closer to the land. Normally, in shamanism, the space of water is ruled by the dragon king(용왕) and is close to the transcendental realm just like the sky. Therefore, the island as the boundary between land and sea is a real space that is influenced more by the transcendental world than anywhere else. The actions of the main characters in the text, who deny the existence of Ieodo, but yearn for the possibility of salvation by Ieodo more than anyone else, symbolize the existential position of human beings located in the middle between God and nature, while also showing the ambivalence of reality and transcendence. It reveals an aspect of the shamanic world with ambivalence. Shamanism is not drawn to transcendence, but is based on a reality-oriented worldview that brings it to reality. It can be said that the reason for this is that the Ieodo of the text is not only on the other side, but also functions as an existence that constantly drives the lives of the people of the island space called Jeju.

AB  - Oil spills can cause long-term damage to the marine ecosystem and force desalination plants to shut down. Thus, this study aims to detect the oil spill in Arabian Gulf which produces a quarter of the world's oil. Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 spectral imageries are utilized to detect oil spill. Sentinel-1 SAR is used to perform semantic segmentation with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) using a U-Net structure and Sentinel-2 band ratio for mapping oil spill. Based on the segmentation results, the intersection-over-union (IoU) shows low values of <0.1 for the oil spill incidents along the Gulf coasts, but higher values for the offshore oil spill incidents (>0.65). Coastal land has adversely affected the segmentation process. As for the band ratio approach, it succeeded in distinguishing the oil spill, however prior knowledge or an expert interpretation is needed to verify the presence of the spill.

AB  - This study presents a novel bridge monitoring approach for transport assets, based on the synergistic use of high-resolution (X-band) SAR imagery. A multi-temporal SAR Interferometry analysis is performed to detect potential issues related to the Rochester Bridge, located in Rochester, UK. A displacement map for the structure was produced using space-based SAR measurements acquired by the Italian constellation COSMO-SkyMed over the period 2017-2019, provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) in the framework of the Open-call for Science Project "Motib - ID742". The outcomes of this study demonstrate that multi- temporal InSAR remote sensing techniques can be applied to complement information from non-destructive ground-based methods (e.g., ground-penetrating radars, laser scanners, accelerometers etc.), paving the way for future integrated approaches in the smart monitoring of infrastructure assets.

TI  - Burned Area Classification Based on Extreme Learning Machine and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellite images allow high separability for mapping burned and unburned areas. This problem has been extensively addressed using machine-learning algorithms. However, these need a suitable dataset and entail considerable training time. Recently, extreme learning machines (ELM) have presented high precision in classification and regression problems but with low computational cost. This paper proposes evaluating ELM to map burned areas and compare them with other machine-learning algorithms broadly used. Several indices, metrics and training times were used to assess the performance of the algorithms. Considering the average of datasets, the best performance was obtained by random forest (DICE = 0.93; omission and commission = 0.08) and ELM (DICE = 0.90; omission and commission = 0.07). The training time for the best model was from ELM (1.45 s) and logistic regression (1.85 s). According to results, ELM was the best burned-area classification algorithm, considering precision and training time, evidencing great potential to map burned areas at global scales with medium-high spatial resolution images. This information is essential to fire-risk systems and burned-area records used to design prevention and fire-combat strategies, and it provides valuable knowledge on the effect of fires on the landscape and atmosphere.

AB  - Miscommunication occurring during the nursing handoff continues to be a primary cause of sentinel events and adverse patient outcomes. The primary purpose of the nursing handoff is to communicate essential patient data, information, and knowledge to ensure the safe continued continuity of care. The aim of this study was to examine the content of the nurse-to-nurse change-of-shift handoff communication in terms of data, information, and knowledge for both bedside and nonbedside handoffs of a patient who has experienced a clinical event. The setting was an urban medical center on a medical-surgical floor. The sample consisted of one nurse giving and one nurse receiving the handoff (n = 19 registered nurses). Five bedside and five nonbedside handoffs were audio recorded and analyzed using content analysis. The handoff overall contained 34.7% data, 51.7% information, and 13.6% knowledge. The nonbedside handoff compared with the bedside handoff contained a substantially higher percentage of data and less information. The percentage of knowledge being communicated in both the nonbedside and bedside handoff was low at 13.6% and 13.7%, respectively. The percentage of data compared with the percentage of knowledge in the handoff places the nurses at greater risk of experiencing cognitive lapses due to cognitive overload.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture is currently one of the fastest growing food production systems globally, and shrimp is considered one of the most highly valued products. Our study area is the lower Jaguaribe River sub-basin (LJRSB), located in the northeastern part of Ceara in Brazil. The aquaculture activity in this area began in the early 1990s and is currently one of the largest shrimp producers in Brazil. This study generated a spatial-temporal analysis of vegetation index and land use and land cover (LULC) using remote sensing images from Landsat satellites processed using geographic information systems (GIS). The findings showed an increase in the water bodies class where shrimp farms are found. In addition, to help us discuss the results, data from the Global Surface Water Explorer was also used to understand this change throughout intra and interannual water variability. Besides shrimp farms' intensification, agricultural areas in the LJRSB also increased, mainly in the irrigated perimeter lands (IPLs), causing a loss in the Caatinga native vegetation. In summary, over recent years, significant changes have been noticeable in the LJRSB coastal region, caused by an increase in shrimp farms mainly located on the Jaguaribe River margins, destroying the native riparian forest.

AB  - Ikh Nuuruudyn khotgor in western Mongolia which is characterized by large vertical extend of the sand and area with intensity of desertification in Mongolia. Therefore, it is required to do scientific basis of preservation and usage after examining sand shifting, type, extents of sand in this area. The main objective is to detect the dune sand distribution and its movement in study area, including 1) to determine the geographical conditions 2) to mapping dune sand distribution from topographic map and satellite images, 3) to calculate correlation with climate factors. The variations of spatial and time series of the sand distribution area in this area were delineated using Landsat, NOAA, DEM, MODIS data from 1985-1990-1995-2000-2005-2010-2015-2020 and variations of precipitation and temperature is estimated between these periods. Correlation matrix by Pearson's correlation coefficient (2) and the ordinary least square estimation of regression analysis was applied in this study to analyze time series of field study area. The result of the study showed sand accumulation area as 1457722.3 hectares (12.7% of total study area) and 1889957.9 hectares (16.5% of total study area) in 1985 and 2020 respectively in this area. Compared to 1985, the sandy area increased by 432235.6 ha in 2020. It is increased by 29.07 % as relative variation percent for three decades in study area. The results showed that the sand distribution changes are negatively correlated with NDVI and precipitation as Pearson's correlation coefficient. Besides, sand distribution changes are linear correlated with temperature between 1985 and 2020 in study area.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Expansion and Loss of Agriculture on the North Coast of West Java Province, Indonesia, Using Google Earth Engine and Intensity Analysis.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Uncontrolled urban expansion resulting from urbanization has a disastrous impact on agricultural land. This situation is being experienced by the densely populated and fertile island Java in Indonesia. Remote sensing technologies have developed rapidly in recent years, including the creation of Google Earth Engine (GEE). Intensity analysis (IA) is increasingly being used to systematically and substantially analyze land-use/land-cover (LULC) change. As yet, however, no study of land conversion from agriculture to urban areas in Indonesia has adopted GEE and IA approaches simultaneously. Therefore, this study aims to monitor urban penetration to agricultural land in the north coastal region of West Java Province by applying both methods to two time intervals: 2003-2013 and 2013-2020. Landsat data and a robust random forest (RF) classifier available in GEE were chosen for producing LULC maps. Monitoring LULC change using GEE and IA has demonstrated reliable findings. The overall accuracy of Landsat image classification results for 2003, 2013, and 2020 were 88%, 87%, and 88%, respectively. IA outputs at interval levels for all categories showed that the annual change-of-area rate was higher during 2013-2020 than during 2003-2013. At the category level, IA results showed that the area of agricultural land experienced net losses in both periods, with net loss in 2013-2020 being 2.3 times greater than that in 2003-2013 (1,850ha per year). In contrast, the built-up area made net gains in both periods, reaching almost twice as much in the second period as in the first (2,030ha per year). The transition-level IA performed proved that agricultural land had been the primary target for the expansion of built-up areas. The most extensive spatial distribution of land conversion from agriculture to built-up area was concentrated in the regencies of Bekasi, Karawang, and Cirebon. These findings are intended to provide stakeholders with enrichment in terms of available literature and with valuable inputs useful for identifying better urban and regional planning policies in Indonesia and similar regions.

AB  - Cyclones and floods are significant disasters seen by southeast Asian countries. With cloud occlusions on the affected regions, monitoring the disaster becomes tedious. Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) can penetrate through the clouds (due to their microwave frequencies) and image the area underneath. Being active sensors, they also can image around the clock. These properties enable the domain experts to use SAR images for disaster monitoring; however, even professionals find it challenging to interpret the data since the human eye is unfamiliar with the impact of distance-dependent imaging, signal intensities observed in the radar spectrum, and image features associated to speckle or post-processing procedures. This manuscript exploits the valuable imaging properties of SAR images to propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize realistic and semantic optical images by conditioning them over the microwave satellite images. It enables the model to synthesize optical images of an affected area in all weather and around the clock conditions, making it a critical disaster monitoring assistance tool.

AB  - The noise correction and image enhancements are done at the Data Processing Generation System (DPGS) at the National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) satellite data production chain. Even after the noise correction algorithms, pixel noise is observed at the checkout by the Product Quality Control (PQC) system. These are detected manually at PQC and an alert is raised at the DPGS to recorrect the image. This process is time consuming due to the manual intervention and the application of noise correction algorithm on the entire image. This manuscript proposes a novel 2-stage, sliding window-based algorithm to automatically detect pixel noise in satellite images and localise the noise pixels so that the correction algorithms can be applied in a localised fashion. This local noise correction also restores the overall SNR of the image compared to global correction. This algorithm is realized and tested on data obtained from the Indian remote sensing (IRS) satellites like Cartosat-2S, Resourcesat-2/2A. The dataset is not open-sourced, and hence very minimal information is provided regarding the IRS data. However, we use Landsat-8 data to conduct a few analyses on the algorithm's performance. The role of patch size considered during the detection of pixel noise in satellite data is also analyzed.

AB  - Urban expansion has been creating an alarming situation in all countries of the world. High rates of migrant urban population has led to serious unplanned land use problems such as loss of agricultural land, unauthorized urban sprawl, high land values, pollution, poverty and social unrest making urban governance a difficult task to maintain healthy urban environment. In the emerging scenario it is essential to have up-to-date information in existing land use information system.In the recent times, remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) are very valuable and advantageous in providing contemporary land use information. The present study highlights significance of remote sensing in the study of land use /land cover ofurban land use changes for the time periods using LISS III satellite imageries from the BHUVAN portal. The satellite imageries of LISS III for two consecutive dates were merged to produce a single image. These merged images were further introduced to GIS environment and subjected to supervised classification for land use land cover analysis. The study area is a typical peri-urban region located towards the eastern extent of the Pune Metropolitan region in the state of Maharashtra. The result obtained from the land use / land cover analysis shows a significant decrease of agricultural area and an increase in built-up area from year 2009 to 2018. The spatial information from the remote sensing satellite plays a vital role in analysis of changing land use/land cover pattern. The study area was classified into eight categories on the basis of field study, geographical conditions, and remote sensing data.

AB  - Phenocams that capture images of a given area in the RGB or near-infrared (NIR) spectrum have been used for more than a decade to estimate phenology in natural landscapes and crop fields. The aim of our study is to estimate phenological parameters, start (SOS) and end (EOS) of season, for barley, from RGB and NIR Phenocam and compare them with in-situ observations from two sites, one with growing season 2014/2015 and the other with growing season 2021/2022. Time series of Phenocam Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were computed then scaled to Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 surface (HLS), available for both sites, and Sentinel-2 (S2), available for only one site, datasets. The HLS and S2 datasets were gap filled with classical and machine learning methods before the scaling. Phenological parameters were extracted from the scaled GCC and NDVI Phenocam data and from the gap filled HLS and S2 datasets. Our preliminary results show that the SOS can be modelled with one day difference compared with the in-situ observed with the scaled Phenocam NDVI and a week difference compared with the in-situ observed with gap filled HLS and S2 datasets with both vegetation indices.

TI  - TSPol-ASLIC: Adaptive Superpixel Generation With Local Iterative Clustering for Time-Series Quad- and Dual-Polarization SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The superpixel generation is a key step for object-based classification and change detection. For the time-series polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) superpixel generation, the traditional polarimetric similarity measure based on the joint covariance matrix has limitations in discriminating different time-series similarity sequences with different fluctuations. Besides, in the traditional time-series PolSAR superpixel generation methods, it is difficult to determine the tradeoff factor between polarimetric and spatial similarity. In this article, an adaptive time-series PolSAR superpixel generation method based on the simple local iterative clustering (SLIC) is proposed, named time-series polarimetric SAR (TSPol)-adaptive simple local iterative clustering (ASLIC). There are three main improvements. First, a novel time-series polarimetric similarity measure based on the root mean square (rms) is proposed. Multitemporal polarimetric statistical information is combined to describe the polarimetric proximity between pixels, referring to the rms of the multitemporal proximities. Second, an edge detection method based on the stacked 2-D Gaussian-shaped (s2-D GS) window is proposed to initialize the central seeds for superpixel generation. Third, an improved SLIC clustering similarity combined with the time-series polarimetric, time-series power, and spatial similarities is proposed. Meanwhile, a homogeneity factor is applied to adaptively balance the relative weights of various similarities. We use eight Radarsat-2 quad-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and 14 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR images to evaluate the effectiveness. The results show our similarity measure and superpixel generation results are superior to those of the traditional methods. For example, as for the Radarsat-2 data, the improvement of the boundary recall by the proposed similarity measure and homogeneity factor is about 4% and 10%, respectively.

CP  - 7th Asia Pacific Conference on Optics Manufacture (APCOM)

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry (GNSS-R) technology uses the signal receiver to receive the reflected signal of navigation satellite for ground feature inversion. It has the advantages of wide dynamic range, all day, all weather, light weight and low cost. It has a broad application prospect in the field of remote sensing. On June 5, 2019, China's first group of test satellites carrying GNSS-R payload, BF-1 A/B satellites, was successfully launched on the sea by using CZ-11 carrier rocket. GNSS-R data with high spatial and temporal resolution were obtained during the operation of the satellite in orbit. In order to solve the problem of low accuracy and few methods of GNSS-R inversion of sea surface wind speed, this paper proposes a sea surface wind speed inversion method based on the delay doppler map average (DDMA) of BF-1 satellite. Firstly, the GNSS-R sea surface scattering model is established by using Z-V model and Elfouhaily wave spectrum to verify the relationship between the observation of BF-1 satellite and the change of wind speed, Then, the principle of GNSS-R sea surface wind speed inversion is studied. Through the correction and normalization of observations, the inversion observation DDMA is obtained. Finally, the geophysical model function (GMF) is established by using L1 level satellite data to realize the high-precision inversion of sea surface wind speed. The root mean square (RMS) accuracy of wind speed inversion is 1.81m/s, which is slightly higher than that of CYGNSS when compared with that of CYGNSS at the same time. The experimental results show that the inversion trend of the same region and time is the same, which proves the accuracy and effectiveness of the data processing results, it will also provide support for the follow-up GNSS-R satellite development and the development and optimization of surface wind speed inversion algorithm.

TI  - Application of Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test in the Distribution of Saturn's Regular Satellites
T2  - BULGARIAN ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the application of nonparametric statistical inference methods in astronomy, aiming to reveal the potential distribution of physical characteristics of Saturn's regular satellites. Based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we fit the eight physical features (equatorial radius, equatorial circumference, volume, density, mass, surface area, surface gravity, and escape velocity) of Saturn's regular satellite data one by one. It is found that except for the two characteristics of density and surface gravity, which obey the Stable distribution and the generalized Pareto distribution, respectively, the best-fitting distributions of the other six physical characteristics are all Lognormal distributions. The rationality of this result is verified by comparison with the cumulative distribution function derived from an analytical perspective. In addition, an example of predicting the physical properties of Saturn's satellite Pandora is added to illustrate the effectiveness of distribution inference to further illustrate in practical applications.

AB  - For studies of urban development, it is an important method for obtaining the distribution of impervious surface (IS) areas and their dynamic change from remote sensing data. The dilemma of the same spectrum for different features and different spectrums for the same features, posed by the complexity of the IS objects, is the fundamental obstacle encountered in the extraction of urban IS areas. In this study, an automatic extraction method for urban IS areas is proposed and analyzed, based on classification and regression tree (CART) and ensemble learning strategies. The Sentinel-2 MSI data of 30 cities in China from 2018 to 2020 were selected for IS extraction experiments. We perform temporal and spatial modeling of the splitting threshold offset in the classification model to explore the effect of time and space on IS extraction. The obtained offset models show that the temporal variation is not significant, while the spatial offsets have more obvious linear relationships.

AB  - Pansharpening, whose aim is to acquire high resolution multispectral data (HRMS) by the fusion of low resolution multispectral data (LRMS) and panchromatic data (PAN), is a specific mission of spatial-spectral fusion in remote sensing field. In recent years, deep learning methods have proved the most feasible methods for pansharpening task. However, these deep learning methods have difficulty in training in an unsupervised manner and become useless when it comes to the condition where no training dataset is available. In this paper, we propose a universal algorithm called deep image interpolation for pansharpening task. The main idea is achieving high-quality fusion results by interpolating two low-quality multispectral images in a deep neural network. We apply it to two conditions: 1) unsupervised training a network when there are enough datasets; 2) directly optimizing the fusion result where no training datasets are available. Simulation and real-data experiments are conducted on various kinds of satellite data. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional pansharpening methods and even catch up with those supervised methods to some extent.

TI  - Measuring Spatial Connectivity between patches of the heat source and sink (SCSS): A new index to quantify the heterogeneity impacts of landscape patterns on land surface temperature
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on the interactions between landscape patterns and land surface temperature (LST) are critical to mitigate urban heat islands (UHIs). However, integrated spatial indices combining both composition and configuration to quantify this relationship requires further development. We present an index of spatial connectivity between patches of the heat source and sink (SCSS) to assess the heterogeneity impact of landscape patterns on LST in Wuhan, China. We examined the relationship between LST and SCSS at the urban (within the urban growth boundaries, UGBs) and city levels, using spatial regression analyses. Results show that: (1) the SCSS and LST presented a significant negative correlation, and the SCSS can explain 76% and 81% of the variability in LST at city level and urban level, respectively; (2) for every 0.1 increase in SCSS, the LST will decrease by 0.96 degrees C at city level, and 1.67 degrees C at urban level; (3) the percentage of the source landscape area should be no more than 62% and the SCSS should not fall below 0.18 to control the UHI effect; (4) maintaining the percentage of the source landscape area at below 18%, and the value of SCSS at over 0.43, will help to bring about a significant cooling effect. Our findings allow a better understanding of the interactions between the spatial heterogeneity and the thermal regulation function of landscapes and provide insights for urban planners to mitigate the UHI effect.

TI  - AlgaeNet: A Deep-Learning Framework to Detect Floating Green Algae From Optical and SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article developed a scalable deep-learning model, the AlgaeNet model, for floating Ulva prolifera (U. prolifera) detection in moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We labeled 1055/4071 pairs of samples, among which 70%/30% were used for training/validation. As a result, the model reached an accuracy of 97.03%/99.83% and a mean intersection over union of 48.57%/88.43% for the MODIS/SAR images. The model was designed based on the classic U-Net model with two tailored modifications. First, the physics information input was a multichannel multisource remote sensing data. Second, a new loss function was developed to resolve the class-unbalanced samples (algae and seawater) and improve model performance. In addition, this model is expandable to process images from optical sensors (e.g., MODIS/GOCI/Landsat) and SAR (e.g., Sentinel-1/GF-3/Radarsat-1 or 2), reducing the potential biases due to the selection of extraction thresholds during the traditional threshold-based segmentation. We process satellite images containing U. prolifera in the Yellow Sea and draw two conclusions. First, adding the 10-m high-resolution SAR imagery shows a 63.66% increase in algae detection based on the 250-m resolution MODIS image alone. Second, we define a floating and submerged ratio number (FS ratio) based on the floating and submerged parts of U. prolifera detected by SAR and MODIS. A research vessel measurement confirms the FS ratio to be a good indicator for representing different life phases of U. prolifera.

AB  - Marine floating raft aquaculture (FRA) monitoring is significant for marine ecological environment and food security assessment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based monitoring is considered to be the effective way for FRA identification because of its capability for the all-weather application. Considering the poor generalization ability and extraction accuracy of traditional monitoring methods, we proposed a semantic segmentation model called D-ResUnet to extract FRA areas from Sentinel-1 images. It has the U-Net-like structure but combines the pre-trained ResNet34 as the encoder and dense residual units in the decoder. The experiments showed the effectiveness and superiority of FRA extraction based on the proposed D-ResUnet compared with the other three state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models.

TI  - Using multisource remote sensing data to predict the maximum flood extent in poorly gauged basins
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For small- or medium-sized river basins that suffer from floods, the lack of river gauging data is an important reason why flood warning at the appropriate time is difficult for local stakeholders. As a valuable dataset observed from spaceborne or airborne platforms, remote sensing images can capture slices of time-series information to cover the whole river basin. We consider the Nilwara Ganga tributaries in southern Sri Lanka for our research. The maximum flood extents and the corresponding elevations of flooded areas were determined in the postflood Sentinel-1 images. Relying only on commonly available remote sensing datasets, the rainfall-triggered flood inundation models were proposed to simulate the maximum inundation extent of a potential flood. The results show that the models proposed here can be well applied in the determination of peak stage, especially for the non-tributary river reach (root mean square error = 0.59, R-square = 0.76). The average of Intersection over Union (IoU) accuracy of the maximum flood extent predictions was 0.75. Validations of two flood events had the IoU accuracy of 0.79 and 0.69, respectively. For gauging data-scarce areas, this approach has great potential to provide a different perspective for flood early warning and will benefit the subsequent risk assessment and disaster mitigation.

TI  - INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING USING THE INTERFEROMETRIC SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (INSAR) TECHNIQUE
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - This paper focuses on the application of spaceborne radar interferometry as a tool for assisting the monitoring different types of infrastructures, including railways and highways. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique, the most advanced class of differential interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar techniques (DInSAR), is used to generate the deformation maps, including the time series and the displacement velocity for each measured persistent scatterers. The dataset considered in this work consists of 261 SAR IW-SLC images acquired by the Sentinel-1 A/B satellites, between January 2016 and September 2021, over the metropolitan area of Barcelona. The infrastructures, especially railways and highways, not only cross the cities, but also connect them crossing non-urban areas. One main technical issue of monitoring infrastructures is the low density of persistent scatterers (PS) in rural areas. To improve the density, the processing chain combines the interferograms selection based on the coherence threshold. Also, for a better point selection, the Equivalent Spatial Coherence (Omega Factor) is tested.

TI  - Performance Comparison of Statistical Models for Characterizing Sea Clutter and Ship CFAR Detection in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fundamental issue of maritime applications of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is the development of precise statistical models for clutter pixels. Several statistical models including the GK, K+R, and G(AO) have been demonstrated to be promising for characterizing sea clutter in SAR images. This article is devoted to investigating the improvements in clutter fitting and ship detection performances by using the recently proposed G(AO). compared to that using the GK and K+R. First, the solution uniqueness of parameter estimators by applying the "method of log cumulants" for the G(AO) is mathematically proven in the first time. Then, we assess the fitting performance of different models for sea surfaces with different wind speed conditions. Next, the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection performance of ships based on different models is compared by the indicators of CFAR loss and detection efficiency. Experiments performed on L-band ALOS-PALSAR SAR data verify the modeling capability of the G(AO )model for sea clutter. Moreover, several ship detection examples indicate the usefulness and potential of the G(AO) model for CFAR detection in practical applications.

TI  - Measuring Ice Flow Velocity on the Greenland Ice Sheet Using Stable Supraglacial River
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice flow velocities of many outlet glaciers on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) have increased dramatically over the past two decades, leading to significant GrIS mass loss. It is challenging to match multitemporal synthetic aperture radar or optical images because the GrIS ice surface changes dramatically, particularly during melt seasons. Therefore, ice surface features used for image matching are required to remain persistent even if the other image characteristics change significantly. This letter proposes that supraglacial rivers can be used to match multitemporal images' tie points (TPs) and to measure the ice flow velocities. First, multitemporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images are used to detect supraglacial rivers by integrating cross-sectional and longitudinal channel information. Second, potential river TPs are created using GIS buffer and overlaying operations. Third, a nonrigid coherent point drift algorithm is used to match river TPs, and the spatial displacements among the corresponding matching river TPs are used to calculate the ice flow velocities. A typical outlet glacier of the northeast GrIS is selected as the study area and six multispectral Sentinel-2 images are used to calculate the summer and annual ice flow velocities during 2016-2018. The results show that the summer ice flow velocity is similar to 640-665 m/a, 9%-14% higher than the annual ice flow velocity (similar to 581-588 m/a). The summer and annual ice flow velocities both decrease along the ice and river flow direction. The derived ice flow velocities are closely correlated with two state-of-the-art ice flow velocity products (R-2 >= 0.981), indicating the high accuracy of the proposed method.

TI  - HTGCE: An Graph-Based and Classifier-Oriented Dimension Reduction Method for Multisource Heterogeneous Feature Tensors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the multiple observations from satellites with different types of sensors, the available object data are regarded as different combinations of multisource heterogeneous data. To achieve accurate object recognition, the dimension reduction (DR) technology is important to capture the low-dimensional discriminative representation containing complementary information from multisource data, while off-the-shelf DR methods can only handle input represented as vector or homogeneous tensors and fail to deal with multisource data represented as heterogeneous tensors. In addition, the existing DR methods are classifier-independent, making it difficult to ensure effective recognition under a specific classifier. To solve these problems, the DR method for Heterogeneous Tensors based on Graph-based and Classifier-oriented Embedding (HTGCE) method is proposed to learn the low-dimensional representation of multisource data using different combinations of samples. First, self-learning adjacency matrices are constructed to capture the local structure of different combinations of multisource data autonomously. Then, unlike the classifier-independent discriminant term used in existing DR methods, a classifier-oriented discriminant term is constructed to enhance the specific classifier-based recognition results. Furthermore, the reconstruction error minimization term is created to enable DR results to inherit the main information of the original data. Moreover, an adaptive weight factor is built to balance the importance of different sources for object recognition. Finally, an alternative optimization strategy is presented to solve the optimization problem of HTGCE. Using the multiresolution multiangle optical dataset and the paired optical and SAR dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that the HTGCE outperforms typical vector- and tensor-based DR methods in terms of recognition accuracy.

TI  - An Orbital Error Correction Model Based on Triplet Network and Shrunken Estimation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Orbital error, one of the major error sources of InSAR observations, is characterized by long-wavelength artifacts which can downgrade the monitoring accuracy, especially for wide-swath SAR missions. In this letter, we present a novel approach for time-series orbital error correction, with an emphasis on the computational and estimation efficiency of orbital error parameters over wide-area scale scenes. The proposed method combines the temporal triplet network and shrunken estimator, which integrates L-2- with L-1-Norm regularization, also known as Lasso regularization. The rationale behind it is to first determine the initial orbital parameters by utilizing the traditional polynomial-based method in the spatial domain. Next, in order to weaken the interference of phase unwrapping errors and other undesired phase contributions, an additional correction procedure is implemented by building up a redundant triplet network in the time domain and further a shrunken estimation method. Experiments on synthetic data and real Sentinel-1 datasets covering Eastern California confirm that the presented method can better balance the accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed approach may, therefore, be useful for the processing of emerging big data InSAR.

T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of the influence of the digitalization of education on human consciousness and the development trends of modern society. The main approaches of modern philosophy to the formation processes of the world educational space are under research. The authors set themselves the goal of identifying the most important consequences of these processes for human consciousness and the evolution of society. The article discusses the impact of digital education on the structure and functions of traditional educational institutions and the modern human consciousness; attention is paid to the consequences of the digitalization of education for such a historically established social group as the professional intelligentsia (clerisy). The analysis of the problem concludes that a fundamentally new model of the transmission of social experience and scientific knowledge is emerging in the modern world educational space. Traditional educational institutions like schools and universities are giving way to a whole system of network structures. This process is accompanied by the deinstitutionalization of education, the departure of education from some of its historical functions, such as the reproduction of the traditional worldview, the decline in the social status of a university diploma, and the transformation of the clerisy.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown situation have generated a significant negative impact on the world economy but have provided a unique opportunity to understand the impact of human activity on environmental pollution and how it affects the urban climate. This study takes the city of Granada (Spain) in order to carry out an evaluation of the environmental parameters (So2, No2, Co and O3) obtained through Sentinel 5P images and how they affect the Terrestrial Surface Temperature (TST) and the Surface Urban Heat Island (ICUS) obtained through Sentinel 3 images. Knowing the environmental impact on the TST and ICUS of the different Local Climate Zones (ZCL) of the city will have an impact on future urban resilience studies. As a result, and during the confinement period, the following variations have been obtained with respect to environmental pollutants: So2 (-24.0%), No2 (-6.7%), Co (-13.2%) and O3 (+4.0%). The TST has experienced an average reduction of-8.7 degrees C (-38.0%) while the ICUS has decreased by-1.6 degrees C (-66.0%).

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing global lockdown situation have generated a very negative impact on the world economy, but they have also lent us a unique opportunity to research and better grasp the impacts of human activity on environmental pollution and urban climates. Such studies will be of vital importance for decision-making on measures needed to mitigate the effects of climate change in urban areas, in order to turn them into resilient environments. This study looks at eight cities in the region of Andalusia (southern Spain) to comprehensively assess their environmental quality with parameters (Pm-10, So(2), No-2, Co and O-3) obtained from meteorological stations. The aim was to determine how these parameters affect the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), on the basis of Sentinel 3 satellite thermal images. Knowing to what extent improved air quality can reduce the LST and SUHI of cities will be essential in the context of future environmental studies on which to base sustainable decisions. The geographic situation of cities in the Mediterranean Sea basin, highly vulnerable to climate change, and the high pollution rates and high daily temperature variations of these urban areas make them particularly attractive for analyses of this sort. During the confinement period, average reductions of some environmental pollutants were achieved: So(2) (-33.5%), Pm-10 (-38.3%), No-2 (-44.0%) and Co (-26.5%). However, the environmental variable O-3 underwent an average growth of 5.9%. The LST showed an average reduction of -4.6 degrees C (-19.3%), while the SUHI decreased by 1.02 degrees C (-59.8%). These values exhibit high spatio-temporal variations be-tween day and night, and between inland and coastal cities.

TI  - Efficient Semantic Segmentation of Hyperspectral Images Using Adaptable Rectangular Convolution
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are relevant tools for remote sensing data processing in the last few years. Kernels process and integrate the spatial information of remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) accurately enough, so as to reduce the noise and spectral variations present in the data. Despite the great efficiency of the CNNs with HSI data, kernels need to be composed of a large number of layers and parameters to be able to obtain good performance, forcing the model to process a large amount of information from the datasets and making the model prone to overfitting, due to the limited number of labels in some cases. On the other hand, with that huge amount of data to consume, a large number of kernels are needed, making the model less efficient due to computational complexity. To overcome these challenges, this letter presents a new technique to reduce the computational cost and increase the model accuracy [based on adaptable rectangular convolutions (ARCs)], leading to a substantial reduction of the number of parameters and improving the model, in order to achieve better results in the context of HSI semantic segmentation. Thus, the model learns through the convolution the dimensions and offsets of the kernel of this Adaptable layer, performing the average operation based on integral image works to achieve better results with fewer parameters, reducing the risk of overfitting and computational cost.

AB  - Technologies such as radiometry, radar or synthetic aperture radar have demonstrated the potential of remote sensing to observe the Earth's land surface and estimate variables that influence the climate system. Among the remote sensed variables, soil moisture has become increasingly important as the impacts of climate change on water resources continue to intensify. Soil moisture products, normally retrieved from microwave remote sensing data, are typically not suitable for regional hydrological and agricultural applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions, due to their coarse spatial resolution. Providing accurate information on soil moisture at an appropriate temporal and spatial scale is challenging for traditional interpolation methods, due to the high variability of soil moisture. Aiming to provide fine resolution soil moisture estimations, in this paper we evaluate the performance of our proposed graph-based downscaling method to obtain fine resolution soil moisture data (9km) from coarse satellite observations (9km) using very fine resolution evapotranspiration data (30m). Our approach formulates the data interpolation problem as a signal reconstruction on a graph, where coarse soil moisture observations are signals at the nodes, while high resolution evapotranspiration data is used to compute the weights of the edges connecting the nodes.

TI  - Miniatures with nine studs Interdisciplinary explorations of a new type of Viking Age artefact
T2  - FORNVANNEN-JOURNAL OF SWEDISH ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the materiality and symbolic significance of a recently emerging group of Viking Age miniature pendants decorated with nine studs. Artefacts that make up this group, typically made of silver or copper alloy and known exclusively from Denmark and Norway, have all been discovered stray as a result of amateur metal detecting. Although their designs are varied and no two specimens are ever exactly the same, it appears that the number nine was of fundamental importance to their designers and users. Drawing on the 'concept of citation and theoretical approaches to miniaturisation, this study explores the conceptual correspondences between miniatures with nine studs and other Viking Age objects that creatively utilised the number nine motif. In creating a 'web of citational relationships' with a host of other artefacts, these finds can be interpreted in the context of textual sources that emphasise the importance of the number nine in the Norse worldview.

TI  - Mass balance and morphological evolution of the Dokriani Glacier, central Himalaya, India during 1999-2014
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciological mass balance (MB) is considered the most direct, undelayed and unfiltered response of the glaciers to climatic perturbations. However, it may inherit errors associated with stake under-representation, averaging over the entire glacier and human bias. Therefore, proper validation of glaciological MB with geodetic MB is highly recommended by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). The present study focuses on the Dokriani Glacier, central Himalaya which is one of the bench-mark glaciers in the region and has glaciological MB records from 1993 to 2013 with intermittent gaps. In the present study, firstly the glaciological MB series is extended to 2014 i.e., field-based MB for one more year is computed and, to compare with it, the geodetic MB is computed for the 1999-2014 period using high resolution Cartosat-1 digital elevation model (DEM) and SRTM DEM. Finally, the study assesses the regional representation of the Dokriani Glacier in terms of MB and evaluates the influence of the MB regime on its morphological evolution. Results show that the average glaciological MB (-0.34 +/- 0.2 m water equivalent (w.e.) y(-1)) is more negative than the geodetic MB (-0.23 +/- 0.1 m w.e. y(-1)) for the 1999-2014 period. This is likely because of the partial representation of glacier margins in the glaciological MB, where melting is strikingly low owing to thick debris cover (>30 cm). In contrast, geodetic MB considers all marginal pixels leading to a comparatively low MB. A comparative assessment shows that the MB of Dokriani Glacier is less negative (possibly due to its huge accumulation area) than most other glacier-specific and regional MBs, restricting it to be a representative glacier in the region. Moreover, continuous negative MB has brought a peculiar change in the epiglacial morphology in the lower tongue of the glacier as differential debris thickness-induced differential melting has turned the glacier surface into a concave one. This concavity has led to development of a large (10-20 m deep) supraglacial channel which is expanding incessantly. The supraglacial channel is also connected with the snout wall and accelerates terminus disintegration. Given the total thickness of about 30-50 m in the lower glacier tongue, downwasting at its current pace, deepening/widening of supraglacial channel coupled with rapid terminus retreat may lead to the complete vanishing of the lower one km glacier tongue.

TI  - A comparison of National Water Model retrospective analysis snow outputs at snow telemetry sites across the Western United States
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares the US National Water Model (NWM) reanalysis snow outputs to observed snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow-covered area fraction (SCAF) at snow telemetry (SNOTEL) sites across the Western United States. SWE was obtained from SNOTEL sites, while SCAF was obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations at a nominal 500 m grid scale. Retrospective NWM results were at a 1000 m grid scale. We compared results for SNOTEL sites to gridded NWM and MODIS outputs for the grid cells encompassing each SNOTEL site. Differences between modelled and observed SWE were attributed to both model errors, as well as errors in inputs, notably precipitation and temperature. The NWM generally under-predicted SWE, partly due to precipitation input differences. There was also a slight general bias for model input temperature to be cooler than observed, counter to the direction expected to lead to under-modelling of SWE. There was also under-modelling of SWE for a subset of sites where precipitation inputs were good. Furthermore, the NWM generally tends to melt snow early. There was considerable variability between modelled and observed SCAF as well as the binary comparison of snow cover presence that hampered useful interpretation of SCAF comparisons. This is in part due to the shortcomings associated with both model SCAF parameterization and MODIS observations, particularly in vegetated regions. However, when SCAF was aggregated across all sites and years, modelled SCAF tended to be more than observed using MODIS. These differences are regional with generally better SWE and SCAF results in the Central Basin and Range and differences tending to become larger the further away regions are from this region. These findings identify areas where predictions from the NWM involving snow may be better or worse, and suggest opportunities for research directed towards model improvements.

AB  - In many applications, ground-leaving reflectance data is needed to fully understand the desired phenomenology in the obtained observations. Of course, measured sensor data is altered by spectrally dependent effects due to the atmosphere, particularly molecular absorption and Rayleigh and aerosol scattering (e.g., haze, smoke, fog). Thus, an atmospheric compensation approach is warranted to remove these effects. Most existing atmospheric compensation algorithms, such as Landsat's LaSRC and Sentinel's Sen2Cor, are specifically designed to operate on single image products and do not leverage information collected over time. Leveraging a co-registered temporal series of images can be used to understand changing atmospheric effects over non-changing ground materials or objects. This can lead to a general improvement in surface reflectance retrievals as compared to retrievals from a single image.We present an atmospheric compensation algorithm, leveraging the dark dense vegetation approach to aerosol estimation, that takes advantage of multiple temporal images over a single site for an overall improved compensation result. More specifically the algorithm identifies psuedo-invariant feature pixels common across an entire time series and adjusts the compensation for an improved result over single image compensation. In this paper we illustrate results relative to RadCalNet ground truth bottom of the atmosphere reflectance measurements. Initial results show that our temporal approach outperforms Sen2Cor, improves surface reflectance retrieval accuracy of Sentinel-2 products by 38.63% (i.e., percent change relative to stand-alone processed), and yields an overall accuracy of 5.6% using a stack of 8 Sentinel-2 images (relative to RadCalNet ground truth values).

AB  - The paper presents an unsupervised procedure for change mapping from two very-high-resolution (VHR) SAR acquisitions. Following the approach proposed in [1], the method exploits the characteristics of a robust, parametric, high-order statistics change feature by extending it to a multiscale version, namely Multi-scale Kullback-Leibler (MKL) feature. Its effectiveness is experimentally confirmed on simulated and real VHR amplitude SAR image pairs. The thresholding algorithm is revisited, optimized and tested on true Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) images. The experimental tests demonstrate the robustness and quality of the proposed change mapping method, which can be applied for damage assessment in disaster management systems.

AB  - More clinicians are using mindfulness-based therapeutic strategies; however, Evangelical Christian clients sometimes worry about the Buddhist origins of these treatments. Christian accommodative mindfulness (CAM) attempts to address these concerns with culturally sensitive adaptations to mindfulness methods. We present a definition of CAM and propose some worldview adjustments to typical mindfulness constructs when working with these clients. The empirical research on Christian-derived meditation strategies and Christian-adapted mindfulness strategies will then be reviewed. We introduce a four-session group CAM protocol currently being researched that focuses on scripture meditation, breath meditation, body awareness, and loving-kindness meditation. Sample scripts are included.

AB  - Hydrographic survey is an activity to provide spatial information in the marine sector. To produce accurate data, hydrographic surveys require very large costs. With the vast sea area in Indonesia, this becomes a very big challenge. In addition, there are some areas that cannot be reached by survey vessels (limited to a depth of > 25 m). Therefore, an alternative method is needed to provide bathymetry data in Indonesia. There is a new technique that is being developed and does not require high costs to obtain water depth data, by using remote sensing technology, especially by using passive sensor image technology. This technique or method is known as Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) which can estimate depths of up to 30 meters. The SDB technique which is often used is empirical SDB. The empirical SDB has the principle of connecting the spectral value of the image with the measured depth. With the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery which has high temporal and spatial resolution, the SDB capability is expected to be improved. East coastal waters of Java Island are in the Bali Strait. This strait separates the island of Java from the island of Bali. In the Bali Strait there is a busy ferry shipping lane and there are also underwater cables used to supply electricity to Bali Island from Java Island. On the Java side, there are also many beaches and underwater tourism that must be preserved. Therefore, it is very important to be able to know the hydrographic data such as bathymetry data in the east coastal waters of Java Island. The objective of this work is thus to estimate shallow water depths using empirical SDB and Sentinel-2 images in the east coastal waters of Java Island. With two band combinations applied in the algorithm, best combination to produce the best depth map for the study area can be obtained. Comparing with reference data, the results show Band 1&3 combination give the better correlation and RMSE (0.76 and 0.026) than Band 2&3 combination (0.64 and 0.075).

AB  - This paper presents a semi-guided method to detect lakes in Sentinel-1 SAR data. The proposed approach is an adaptation of the grab-cut framework developed in [1]. Starting from a coarse bounding box around the lake, an accurate segmentation is extracted using a Conditional Random Field formalism and a graph-cut based optimization. Then an extension of this approach to process jointly a stack of multi-temporal data is presented. A temporal regularization term is introduced to control the joint segmentation.The proposed approach is evaluated on Sentinel-1 datasets. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the interest of the proposed framework and its robustness to the initialization polygon of the lake.

AB  - Nowadays, forests are the most widely spread land cover and therefore play a significant role in ecology and create processes' dynamics. Forests are threatened by various harmful effects due to biotic (insects, fungi, viruses, weeds, animals) and abiotic (floods, fires, storms, droughts, polluted atmospheres etc.) damages. Also, human damage (anthropogenic impact) is numerous and varied. They are caused by direct human action on the forest and indirect activities and processes (damage due to grazing, consequent devastation and erosion of habitats etc.). Forest devastation and illegal logging are one of the immediate negative human activities that have a detrimental impact on the forest. The research refers to the state forests of two management units, Javornik and Corkovae-Karlice in the border area of the Republic of Croatia. Part of the forests (about 3,000 hectares) of these two management units are located in a mine suspected area along the state border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. This research aims to develop an automatic algorithm for forest degradation monitoring by remote sensing methods and Copernicus data. The developed algorithm was based on the Sentinel-2 (S2) optical satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine. The proposed automatic forest degradation monitoring algorithm was based on the Delta NDVI change detection approach. Accuracy assessment was done by independent data in higher, 3-m resolution based PlanetScope imagery. Preliminary results show very similar forest degradation values per all tested forest compartment/subcompartment for automatically generated S2 10-m imagery forest degradation map and 3-m forest maps obtained manually from PlanetScope imagery.

AB  - The anisotropy of land surfaces reflectance of greatly impacts the acquisition and analysis of satellite images. Normalization methods using semi empirical kernel-driven models commonly remove these directional effects. Here, we present a physically-based approach to assess the accuracy of 2 normalization methods of Sentinel-2 (S2) and 3 (S3) images. A ReBeLS-based process fits the parameters of a kernel-driven model with S3 and S2 images simulated by the DART RT model in agricultural and urban areas. Here, normalization methods (c-factor, NDVI-disaggregation) hardly validate their assumptions: surface type and orientation have a great influence. We show the potential of RT models to assess and improve normalization methods.

T2  - Case reports in women's health
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Vulval cancer is rare in women of reproductive age. We report two cases of vulval squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) in pregnancy. They presented with a solitary labial mass, at 20 and 21weeks of gestation, diagnosed as stage 1B VSCC based on clinical examination and cross-sectional imaging. In the first case, the patient underwent close clinical surveillance whilst pregnant and had an elective caesarean section at 39weeks of gestation. Two months post-partum she underwent a radical anterior vulvectomy and bilateral groin sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the second case, the patient underwent an anterior vulvectomy at 33weeks of gestation followed by a vaginal delivery at 37weeks of gestation. Six weeks post-natally she had bilateral groin sentinel lymph node biopsies. We conclude that surgical resection is safe during pregnancy under spinal anaesthesia but it can be deferred until the post-partum period if the cancer presents at early stage.

TI  - The Estimation of Snow Cover Distribution Using Satellite Data in the Cold Arid Leh Region of Indian Himalaya
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important feature for the supply of freshwater and influences climatic hydrology at various altitudes, especially in mountain regions. Snow is a significant component of the environmental threat. In order to map and realize the extent of snow cover at high altitudes, continuous monitoring is therefore necessary. Data from satellite remote sensing helps to capture land cover and changes in land cover. The major intricacies in the snow cover mapping in the Leh region are the underlying vegetation, debris, and sparse snow. The Landsat OLI satellite data base methodology was developed to map the snow cover in the Leh region of the Indian Himalayas through NDSI (normalized difference snow index) to overcome such area specific issues. NDSI encompasses a reasonably good accuracy and can be used extensively because topographic shadows, water bodies and clouds can easily be misinterpreted as snow. It is capable of differentiating pixels of snow from pixels of cloud, debris, vegetation, and water. The NDSI was generated for snow mapping using Landsat OLI satellite images. Using the high reflectance of the snow in the blue band, misinterpreted water bodies were removed. NDSI was subsequently used month-wise to estimate the snow cover of the Leh region (Ladakh Union Territory of India). The findings of present study clearly indicate that the accuracy of the NDSI is reasonably appropriate for the estimation of the snow cover distribution over a wider area. It has been also observed that the snow cover in the study region has decreased over the years.

TI  - DELINEATION OF METROPOLITAN AREAS IN POLAND: A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH
T2  - ECONOMICS & SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineation of urban functional areas helps policymakers and urban planners understand the connections between the core cities and areas surrounding them, and subsequently develop policies and solutions that can serve local populations. This article develops a readily applicable econometric method for delineation that considers functional aspects of cities and their surroundings. We perform delineation analysis using the data for 78 Polish core cities, grouping them by population size. Using the satellite data on lights emitted at night, population density, commuter numbers as well as the number of houses and apartments built in each commune, we apply a threshold regression model to determine the boundaries of functional urban areas. Our main results suggest that the mean radius of functional urban areas (FUAs) around the largest (most populous) cities is, on average, 21 km, while it is between 13 and 16 km for smaller cities. We then test how the econometric results compare with the perceptions of local inhabitants through a citizen science project (CSP) conducted as a robustness check.

TI  - The Stability and Suitability of the Bhasan Char Island as an Accommodation for the Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the dynamics of Bhasan Char is very crucial, as the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has recently selected the island as the accommodation of the FDMN. This article critically evaluates the spatiotemporal morphological variations due to erosion, accretion, and subsurface deformation of the island through multi-temporal geospatial and geophysical data analysis, groundwater quality-quantity, and also determines the nature and rate of changes from 2003 to 2020. This is the first study in this island on which multi-temporal Landsat Satellite Imagery and seismic data have been used with geospatial techniques with Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and petrel platform, respectively. The analysis of satellite images suggests that the island first appeared in 2003 in the Bay of Bengal, then progressively evolved to the present stable condition. Significant changes have taken place in the morphological and geographical conditions of the island since its inception. Since 2012, the island has been constantly accreted by insignificant erosion. It receives tidally influenced fluvial sediments from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system and the sedimentary accretion, in this case, is higher than the erosion due to relatively weaker wave action and longshore currents. It has gained approximately 68 km(2) area, mostly in the northern part and because of erosion in the south. Although the migration of the Bhasan Char was ubiquitous during 2003-2012, it has been concentrated in a small area to the east since 2018. The net shoreline movements (NSM) suggest that the length of the shoreline enlarged significantly by around 39 km in 2020 from its first appearance. Seismic and GPS data clearly indicate that the island is located on the crest of a slowly uplifting low-amplitude anticline, which may result in a stable landform around the island. Based on the analysis of historical data, it has been assessed that the current configuration of Bhasan Char would not be severely affected by 10-15-foot-high cyclone. Therefore, FDMN rehabilitation here might be safer that would be a good example for future geo-environmental assessment for any areas around the world for rehabilitation of human in remote and vulnerable island. The findings of this research will facilitate the government's decision to rehabilitate FDMN refugees to the island and also contribute to future research in this area.

AB  - In recent years, multiple sources of remote sensing data have become increasingly available to monitor Earth's surface phenomena. However, unlike High Spatial Resolution (HSR) data, Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) satellite images remain difficult to collect over large areas due to acquisition costs and a smaller swath. This often compromises the simultaneous use of both sources of data over same study areas for many applications. In this work, we investigate a land cover mapping setting in which both HSR and VHSR are available at the learning stage of a deep neural network while only the HSR data is available at inference time for model inference. We thus propose simple but effective strategies for enhancing the land cover classification in this scenario of incomplete multi-source remote sensing data when the model is deployed.

AB  - In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep learning models in predicting forest tree height in boreal forest zone using ESA Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. The performance of studied deep learning models is compared to several popular conventional machine learning approaches. The study area is located near Hyytiala forestry station in Finland, and represents a conifer-dominated mixed boreal forestland. Improved predictions were obtained when using combined optical and SAR data for all studied models. Our results indicate that UNet based models can achieve better accuracy in predicting forest tree heights (RMSE of 1.90m, R-2 of 0.69), compared to traditional parametric and machine learning models with RMSE range of 2.27-2.41m and R-2 range of 0.50-0.56 when satellite optical and radar data are combined.

TI  - Improved Semisupervised UNet Deep Learning Model for Forest Height Mapping With Satellite SAR and Optical Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we introduce an improved semisupervised deep learning approach, and demonstrate its suitability for modeling the relationship between forest structural parameters and satellite remote sensing imagery and producing forest maps. The improved approach is based on a popular UNet model, modified and fine-tuned to improve the forest parameter prediction performance. Within the improved model, squeeze-and-excitation blocks are embedded to recalibrate the multisource features via retrieved channel-wise self-attention and a novel cross-pseudo regression strategy is implemented to train the model in a semisupervised way. The improvement imposes consistency learning on two perturbed network branches: 1) generating regression pseudo-reference; 2) expanding the dataset size. For demonstration, we used satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 and multispectral optical Sentinel-2 images as remote sensing data, complemented with reference data represented by forest tree height as one of the key forest structural variables. The study area is located in a boreal forestland in Central Finland. Proposed approach showed larger accuracy compared to traditional machine learning methods such as random forests and boosting trees, and baseline UNet model. Best accuracy figures for forest tree height were achieved with combined SAR and optical imagery and were as small as 24.1% root-mean-square error (RMSE) on pixel-level and 15.4% RMSE on forest stand level.

AB  - The real and imaginary components of the scattering matrix elements measured for each pixel in single look fully polarimetric SAR(POLSAR) are coherently combined from a large number of scatterers in each resolution bin. These components for the three independent Sinclair matrix scattering elements have normal distributions when collected over homogeneous regions. This is observed from the ocean surface, homogeneous desert regions, agricultural areas and more. These distributions are studied in this paper. Other distributions such as those for the amplitude ratios and the phase differences of the Sinclair matrix elements are addressed. This is done for single look fully polarimetric SIR-C data at L and C band and TerraSAR-X data. Distributions of observables from 4 look SIR-C data at L and C band are also addressed and compared to the single look distributions. All terrestial surfaces are considered where data is available.

AB  - Watershed management is critical to sustainable development. The topographical, and hydrogeomor-phological conditions in the western part of the Luxor region give rise to sudden floods. The purpose of the present study is to map the flood hazard zones in the western part of Luxor by using: 1-linear Watershed Index Model (LWIM) through the identification of 24 morphometric parameters; 2-DEM, as input to the GIS environment, using the Arc hydro-Tool; 3-Remote sensing (RS), is built into GIS to detect LU /LC via supervised classification of Landsat images, for the year 1991/2021, and Dreanig density (Dd) maps; 4 -Integration of LWIM, Dd, and LU/LC maps. Results indicated that agricultural land increased by approximately (292.7 km(2)), while urbanization increased by (43 km(2)) between 1991 and 2021, expanding toward the western structure plateau. This study concluded that flood areas west of Luxor are confined to the desert area west of cities Luxor -Arment, and Isna. These areas represent 13.25 % of the hazard flooding zones. The study proposed to establish small dams with diversion channels in the way of the mainstream channels with high orders 4th and directed the water of flood to new canals which joined with the main canals in the study area, re-design of the desert zone west of Luxor.

TI  - Deep Relearning in the Geospatial Domain for Semantic Remote Sensing Image Segmentation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a classification postprocessing (CPP) technique based on fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic remote sensing image segmentation. Conventional CPP techniques aim to enhance the classification accuracy by imposing smoothness priors in the image domain. Contrary to that, here, a relearning strategy is proposed where the initial classification outcome of a CNN model is provided to a subsequent CNN model via an extended input space to guide the learning of discriminative feature representations in an end-to-end fashion. This deep relearning CNN (DRCNN) explicitly accounts for the geospatial domain by taking the spatial alignment of preliminary class labels into account. Hereby, we evaluate to learn the DRCNN in a cumulative and noncumulative way, i.e., extending the input space based on all previous or solely preceding model outputs, respectively, during an iterative procedure. Besides, the DRCNN can also be conveniently coupled with alternative CPP techniques such as object-based voting (OBV). The experimental results obtained from two test sites of WorldView-II imagery underline the beneficial performance properties of the DRCNN models. They can increase the accuracies of the initial CNN models on average from 72.64x0025; to 76.01x0025; and from 92.43x0025; to 94.52x0025; in terms of statistic. An additional increase of 1.65 and 2.84 percentage points can be achieved when combining the DRCNN models with an OBV strategy. From an epistemological point of view, our results underline that CNNs can benefit from the consideration of preliminary model outcomes and that conventional CPP techniques can profit from an upstream relearning strategy.

TI  - Wetland Change Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithms, and Their Link with Climate Variation and Economic Growth: A Case Study of Guangling County, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are a distinctive terrestrial ecosystem that benefits living things, including people, in various ways. Sustainable wetland ecosystem resources are needed to protect the global environment. Wetlands in China have undergone positive and negative changes in response to several factors, but studies documenting their long-term dynamicity have been few, particularly in Guangling County. This study examines the change of wetlands area based on remotely sensed data while exploring trends associated with climate variations and economic growth in Guangling County, China. Analysis of remotely sensed imagery, mainly in hilly and nonhomogeneous environments is problematic, largely as a result of interference and their high spectral non-homogeneity. We conducted experiments using five classical machine learning algorithms based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and obtained the greatest robustness and accuracy using a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel approach, with overall accuracy and kappa statistics ranging from 86% to 98.1% and from 0.789 to 0.960, respectively. Based on the SVM-RBF model's outperformance of four other algorithms, we identified spatial distributions of wetland in the study area and associated change trends. We found that 45.71 km(2) of wetland area was lost over the past 3.7 decades (January 1984-December 2020), or 81.82% of wetland area coverage. In this paper, we explore how factors such as county economic growth (GDP), humidity, and temperature variations are tightly linked with wetland change.

TI  - Rotated Object Detection of Remote Sensing Image Based on Binary Smooth Encoding and Ellipse-Like Focus Loss
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image object detection has been widely developed in many applications. Objects in remote sensing data have the characteristic of arbitrary directions, which leads to poor detection performance based on horizontal box detectors. To address this issue, a novel rotated object detection model based on binary smooth encoding and ellipse-like focus loss is proposed in this letter. First, a multilayer feature fusion network with an attention mechanism is developed to extract features of multiscale objects. Then, an anchor-free detection module with binary smooth encoding is proposed, which aims to predict the rotated angles of objects. Moreover, an ellipse-like focus loss is proposed to obtain high-quality bounding boxes drawing near the object center. Experimental results on two public remote sensing datasets verify that the proposed method can yield superior detection performance than other related rotated object detection models.

TI  - Application of a Hypergeometric Model in Simulating Canopy Gap Fraction and BRF for Forest Plantations on Sloping Terrains
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of tree distribution and slope on canopy gap fraction (GF) and bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is shown here to be non-negligible. Trees are often assumed to be randomly distributed in natural forests due to random distribution of natural resources, but this assumption is not valid for forest plantations. A geometric optical model for forest plantations (GOFP) is a geometric optical model for forest plantations on horizontal surfaces based on the theory of exclusion distance among crowns. Sloping terrains change the exclusion distance among crowns, and inevitably affect the canopy GF and BRF. In this article, GOFP with a hypergeometric model (distances among trees are considered) on horizontal surfaces is modified as GOFP-T to simulate BRF for forest plantations on sloping terrains under two scenarios: (horizontal distances among crowns remain unchanged with slope) and (sloping distances among crowns remain unchanged with slope). Two three-dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer models (DART and LESS) and field measurements are used to evaluate and validate GOFP-T simulations. The results show that 1) the canopy GF, four component area ratios, and canopy BRF simulated by GOFP-T show high consistency with results from the two 3-D model: root-mean-square errors in GF, sunlit foliage, and sunlit ground are less than 0.02, 0.06, and 0.03, respectively; 2) forest coverage and canopy reflectance in GOFP-T are compared well with point cloud results from an airboard LiDAR system and Landsat 8 OLI surface reflectance products, respectively, indicating that GOFP-T has ability in simulating canopy reflectance for forest plantations on sloping terrains. GOFP-T with the hypergeometric model in this article is the first simple model to simulate canopy GF and BRF for forest plantations on sloping terrains.

TI  - Variation of Clumping Index With Zenith Angle for Forest Canopies
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy clumping index (CI) characterizes the extent of the nonrandom spatial distribution of foliage elements within a canopy and is critical for determining the radiative transfer, photosynthesis, and transpiration processes in the canopy. It is widely perceived that the CI increases with zenith angle (0), because between-crown gaps decrease in size and number with increasing theta. In this study, we demonstrate that this is not always true. Analytical equations between CI and theta are first developed based on widely used forest canopy gap fraction (GF) theories. The results show that the zenith angular variation of CI is closely related to crown-projected area or crown shapes [i.e., the ratio of the crown height to its diameter (RID)]: CI increases with theta for canopies with "tower" crowns (RID > 1), but decreases with 0 for umbrella crowns (RID < 1) and does not vary much with theta for "sphere" crowns (RID = 1). These results are validated in a large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework (LESS) platform and published datasets, including the measurements in field and radiative transfer model intercomparison (RAMI) forest stands. The findings are essential for the derivation of angular-integrated (hemispherical) CI from in situ measurements and multiangular remote sensing.

AB  - In recent years, mariculture has been extensively developed in China. However, this rapid and uncontrolled expansion poses risks to the coastal environment, economic development and biodiversity conservation. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing can overcome the limitation of weather and has the advantage of all-day observing, which can effectively image the floating aquaculture area (FAR). In this study, we applied various deep learning methods to extract FAR by high-resolution Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR data. The trained and predicted datasets were constructed and trained by using U-Net, FCN, and SegNet networks. The results show that the U-Net and SegNet networks are more suitable than FCN, SegNet, and DeeplapV3+ networks for mariculture raft extraction in different scenarios. The best overall accuracy, F1 measure and kappa coefficient best overall accuracy are 95%, 0.84 and 0.80, respectively.

TI  - Potential of ANN for Prolonging Remote Sensing-Based Soil Moisture Products for Long-term Time Series Analysis
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in the water-heat-energy exchange and water cycle of the land ecosystem. Long-term SM products are vital in the time series study of ecology and hydrology. Therefore, it is vital to extend the time span with limited SM monitoring sensors, since there is no single long-term SM product currently. In this study, an SM product prolonging method based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical products was proposed. The prolonging results of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Fenyun-3B (FY3B) products were validated in Tibetan Plateau to present the feasibility of this method. The result shows this method is feasible in areas under medium vegetation cover (0.2 < NDVI < 0.6), but it still needs to be improved in some areas (especially in areas with very high or very low NDVI). The prolonging data fits well (R = 0.84, RMSE < 0.06 cm(3)cm(-3)) with in situ measurements for both SMAP and FY-3B products. The generated long-term SM will benefit the global water cycle study.

TI  - Assessing the potential of Sentinel-2 data for tracking invasive water hyacinth in a river branch
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) has become a threat to many aquatic environments worldwide. This aquatic weed presents a rapid reproductive capacity and outcompetes other aquatic plant species, forming dense, free-floating mats, which in many instances completely cover fresh-water surfaces. The infestation leads to several serious environmental (including ecological and socioeconomic) impacts that are hazardous to aquatic systems, disables human uses of surface waters, and affects hydraulic infrastructures (e.g., waterways and pumping stations). Our study explores the use of remote sensing tools to monitor and categorize the spread of water hyacinth, aiming at new insights into the detection, observation, and mapping of this invasive plant using vegetation indices and water indices calculated from multispectral data from satellite Sentinel-2, such as normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index. The approach uses spatiotemporal information and has the potential to contribute to inform planners and decision-makers that are concerned with managing the plant by applying integrated measures. The case study deals with a small water course located in the downstream part of the Mondego river valley in Portugal, a country where water hyacinth is widely spread and constitutes a major problem, mainly in the irrigated agricultural areas of the Tagus, Sado, Mondego, and Lis rivers' basins.

TI  - A PERSPECTIVE OF THE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC PICTURE OF THE WORLD: COLLISIONS AND TRENDS
T2  - EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the problems of constructing a scientific picture of the world in a technogenic civilization at the stage of its globalization. The interdependence of science, technology and society generates a number of issues of a socio-humanitarian and, in particular, ideologi-cal nature. Interdisciplinary forms of organization of sciences contribute to the development of borderline methodologies. These methodologies integrate the achievements and problems of specific disciplines into a certain overall picture. The ambitions of this worldview include space (near, far), planetary nature with all geo - shells, as well as the bio-sphere, technosphere, sociosphere, anthroposphere. In the course of communicative interactions, scientists have developed methodological principles for constructing a picture of the world. These princi-ples claim to be universal: integrity, consistency, coherence, structurality, evolution/involution, complexity, self-organization, human dimension. However, epistemic and communicative diffi-culties accompany the construction of a general scientific picture of the world. There are methodological, experimental, linguistic, cognitive barriers between disciplines. Also, the unevenness of their development is strong. Competition between disciplines and reductionist programs are often caused by social reasons - politicization, ideologization and commercialization of big sci-ence. Philosophy seeks to connect the idea of a scientific picture of the world with a change in self-consciousness and a person's place in the world. The prospect of intellectual synthesis fluctu-ates between the transdisciplinary form of organization of col-lective scientific thinking and the ideological imperialism of indi-vidual philosophical and scientific programs.

T2  - ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The export performance is the most significant aspect to consider for the economic development of every country, even Pakistan. International trade, mainly export, is the main factor in boosting Pakistan's economic development. Therefore, this study finds a short-run & long-run association between export performance and Pakistan's export factors. This study used ARDL-Autoregressive Distributed lag and the data time series from FY1972 to FY 2021. The study has found a short-run and long-run association between factors of exports, including inflation rate, FDIs, exchange rate, GDP, interest rate, and export performance of Pakistan. The findings of the Granger causality check further discovered unidirectional causation between GDP and exports, FDI and exports, and real effective exchange rate & export performance in Pakistan on lag one. Similarly, on lag two, there is a one-way causal relationship between inflation rate and exports and two-way causation between export performance and FDI. Thus, from the results, it is acquainted that there must be much closer coordination with trading alliances to get sustainable export growth among countries.

AB  - Accurate and spatially explicit information on irrigation is essential for sustainable water resource management, crop condition monitoring, and modelling. Although some advances have been made for irrigation mapping using remotely sensed data, most studies are conducted in semi-arid areas, while field-level irrigation mapping remains challenging for temperate regions. To assess the applicability of different time series for irrigation mapping, we used optical and Sentinel-1 data over northern Germany. Landsat and Sentinel 2 based vegetation indices and Tasselled Cap components were aggregated over the growing season and specific key phenological stages. Irrigated areas were then classified using random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (XGboost) based classifiers. In general, XGboost outperformed RF for irrigation mapping with both composites from specific growth stages and growing seasons. Overall accuracy reached satisfactory levels (similar to 80%). The synergistic use of optical and radar data enhanced the classification accuracy.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation is considered the main renewable energy source which reshapes the global sustainability plan for future development. Due to the lack of solar radiation measurements, this work investigates the performance of several temperature-based hybrid solar radiation models combining the parametric, statistical and satellite data approaches to estimate the global solar radiation on a horizontal surface. Over 35 years of meteorological data in the new location, Arar City, KSA (Latitude 30 degrees 96 ' N and longitude 41 degrees 05 ' E) are employed to establish and validate the models. These models are validated using two datasets with different averaging time spans to investigate the accuracy and reliability of different models as forecasting tools for the solar radiation. The mostly common statistical indicators are calculated to identify the most accurate model. The results show that Model (1) has the best performance among all models with high reliability as a solar radiation forecasting tool in this new location. This model is also validated against the widely-used datasets, namely NASA, On-Site measurements and PVGIS-SARAH data. The model shows excellent values for statistical indicators with high values of coefficient of determination, R-2 > 0.955, presenting the best performance regardless of the time span of the validation datasets.

AB  - Flood-damages on crops are related to several factors concerning both flood event and crops characteristics. In particular, flooded area size and water level are critical parameters while assessing yield loss and damages related to agricultural infrastructure and irrigation systems. With reference to the Sesia river (North-Western Italy) flood, occurred on 3rd October 2020, a methodology to detect flooded areas and estimate water level above ground was proposed based on Sentinel-1 (S1) data and Digital Terrain Model (DTM). S1 imagery was collected and processed by GEE. In particular, S1 VV image difference (pre- post-event) was analyzed by Otsu's method to define a threshold able to map flooded pixels. A watershed segmentation was performed on DTM to locate terrain depressions patches that, once coupled with flooded areas map, made possible to get an estimate of water level and map it. Agricultural crops were recognized based on the CORINE Land Cover 2018 level 3 map. A Normalized Difference Vegetation Index map from Sentinel-2 data was also obtained to describe crop activity before the event and associated to crops. This made possible to investigate which "active" crops were flooded and get an estimate of the water level that affected each area. This issue, together with water time persistence, strictly influences the degree of damage that a crop can suffer from. With these premised, the proposed methodology could be intended as a useful tool to support agricultural-related damages models generating a preliminary and rapid map of flooded crops taking care of the local topography.

TI  - Food security analysis and forecasting: A machine learning case study in southern Malawi
T2  - DATA & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chronic food insecurity remains a challenge globally, exacerbated by climate change-driven shocks such as droughts and floods. Forecasting food insecurity levels and targeting vulnerable households is apriority for humanitarian programming to ensure timely delivery of assistance. In this study, we propose to harness a machine learning approach trained on high-frequency household survey data to infer the predictors of food insecurity and forecast household level outcomes in near real-time. Our empirical analyses leverage the Measurement Indicators for Resilience Analysis (MIRA) data collection protocol implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in southern Malawi, a series of sentinel sites collecting household data monthly. When focusing on predictors of community-level vulnerability, we show that a random forest model outperforms other algorithms and that location and self-reported welfare are the best predictors of food insecurity. We also show performance results across several neural networks and classical models for various data modeling scenarios to forecast food security. We pose that problem as binary classification via dichotomization of the food security score based on two different thresholds, which results in two different positive class to negative class ratios. Our best performing model has an F1 of 81% and an accuracy of 83% in predicting food security outcomes when the outcome is dichotomized based on threshold 16 and predictor features consist of historical food security score along with 20 variables selected by artificial intelligence explainability frameworks. These results showcase the value of combining high-frequency sentinel site data with machine learning algorithms to predict future food insecurity outcomes.

TI  - Application of Artificial Neural Networks for Mangrove Mapping Using Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves, as unique coastal wetlands with numerous benefits, are endangered mainly due to the coupled effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change. Therefore, acquiring reliable and up-to-date information about these ecosystems is vital for their conservation and sustainable blue carbon development. In this regard, the joint use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms can assist in producing accurate mangrove ecosystem maps. This study investigated the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different topologies and specifications for mangrove classification in Iran. To this end, multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Afterward, the ANN topologies and specifications considering the number of layers and neurons, learning algorithm, type of activation function, and learning rate were examined for mangrove ecosystem mapping. The results indicated that an ANN model with four hidden layers, 36 neurons in each layer, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) learning algorithm, rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function, and the learning rate of 0.001 produced the most accurate mangrove ecosystem map (F-score = 0.97). Further analysis revealed that although ANN models were subjected to accuracy decline when a limited number of training samples were used, they still resulted in satisfactory results. Additionally, it was observed that ANN models had a high resistance when training samples included wrong labels, and only the ANN model with the Adam learning algorithm produced an accurate mangrove ecosystem map when no data standardization was performed. Moreover, further investigations showed the higher potential of multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data compared to single-source and mono-temporal (e.g., single season) for accurate mangrove ecosystem mapping. Overall, the high potential of the proposed method, along with utilizing open-access satellite images and big-geo data processing platforms (i.e., GEE, Google Colab, and scikit-learn), made the proposed approach efficient and applicable over other study areas for all interested users.

TI  - Landslide4Sense: Reference Benchmark Data and Deep Learning Models for Landslide Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces Landslide4Sense, a reference benchmark for landslide detection from remote sensing. The repository features 3799 image patches fusing optical layers from Sentinel-2 sensors with the digital elevation model and slope layer derived from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) phased array-type L-band SAR (PALSAR). The added topographical information facilitates an accurate detection of landslide borders, in which recent research has shown to be challenging using optical data alone. The extensive dataset supports deep learning (DL) studies in landslide detection and the development and validation of methods for the systematic update of landslide inventories. The benchmark dataset has been collected at four different times and geographical locations: Iburi (September 2018), Kodagu (August 2018), Gorkha (April 2015), and Taiwan (August 2009). Each image pixel is labeled as belonging to a landslide or not, incorporating various sources and thorough manual annotation. We then evaluate the landslide detection performance of 11 state-of-the-art DL segmentation models: U-Net, ResU-Net, pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), ContextNet, DeepLabv2, DeepLab-v3+, FCN-8s, LinkNet, FRRN-A, FRRN-B, and SQNet. All models were trained from scratch on patches from one-quarter of each study area and tested on independent patches from the other three quarters. Our experiments demonstrate that ResU-Net outperformed the other models for the landslide detection task. We make the multisource landslide benchmark data (Landslide4Sense) and the tested DL models publicly available at https://www.iarai.ac.at/landslide4sense, establishing an important resource for remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning communities in studies of image classification in general and applications to landslide detection in particular.

AB  - Floods are the most frequent, costliest natural disasters having devastating consequences on people, infrastructure, and the ecosystem. During flood events near real-time satellite imagery has proven to be an efficient management tool for disaster management authorities. However one of the challenges is accurate classification and segmentation of flooded water. The generalization ability of binary segmentation using threshold split-based method, is limited due to the effects of backscatter, geographical area, and time of image collection. Recent advancements in deep learning algorithms for image segmentation has demonstrated excellent potential for improving flood detection. However, there have been limited studies in this domain due to the lack of large scale labeled flood event dataset. In this paper, we present two deep learning approaches, first using a UNet and second, using a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), both based on a backbone of EfficientNet-B7, by leveraging publicly available Sentinel-1 dataset provided jointly by NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team, and IEEE GRSS Earth Science Informatics Technical Committee. The dataset covers flood events from Nebraska, North Alabama, Bangladesh, Red River North, and Florence. The performances of both networks were evaluated with multiple training, testing, and validation. During testing, the UNet model achieved the meanIOU score of 75.06% and the FPN model achieved the meanIOU score of 75.76%.

AB  - Crop biophysical parameters, such as the Plant Area Index (PAI), Wet-biomass (WB), and Vegetation Water Content (VWC), play a vital role in estimating crop yield. Over the last few decades, various biophysical parameter retrieval methods have come into existence. Studies have shown, weaknesses of physical and parametric methodologies supersede their strengths. In this regard, non-linear non-parametric methods like the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) have advantages over existing techniques. This study retrieved specific crop biophysical parameters over a Canadian test site using GPR employing different polarization combinations of the Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We used the ground measurements of wheat and soybean of the SMAPVEX-16 campaign as the in-situ data. We characterized the performance of GPR by using statistical measures, such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Pearson correlation coefficient. We noticed that besides the full pol (HH + HV + VV) combination, the performance of the dual-pol (HV+VV) configuration had shown encouraging results in estimating the biophysical parameters.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th Workshop on Hyperspectral Imaging and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)
CL  - Rome, ITALY
AB  - This paper aims to provide a deep neural network (DNN) considering the statistical properties of data for robust one-class classification. To achieve that, we take advantage of the properties of Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) to guide the DNN. WST is a translation-invariant image representation that retains high-frequency information for classification while being stable to rotation. The resulting stable and low-variance features make the clustering of data easier for DNN. The importance of WST in guiding the DNN for the classification of highly textured images is evaluated in terms of accuracy gain and robustness to outlier pollution. Superior robustness to both translation and rotation is also demonstrated. The method is not only evaluated in a standard computer vision dataset (CIFAR10), but the use of largely invariant features allows for coping with the more challenging case of satellite imagery (EuroSAT).

AB  - Scene classification is one of the most important tasks in the remote sensing field. In general, remotely sensed data comprises targets of different nature with many detailed classes. Therefore, the classification of patches in a satellite scene is a challenging issue. To address the problem, the preferred alternative is to transform to polar coordinates and analyze angular distances. Prior works have so far considered angular distances between points, while ignoring that the target class is not a point, but a distribution. In this paper, we take advantage of this critical fact by using a point-to-probability distribution measure rather than an l(n) norm. In this paper, two similarity measures (Euclidean and Mahalanobis) in two different feature space are experimentally investigated through some remote sensing datasets.

CP  - 28th International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling (MMM)

AB  - The necessity of organising big streams of Earth Observation (EO) data induces the efficient clustering of image patches, deriving from satellite imagery, into groups. Since the different concepts of the satellite image patches are not known a priori, DBSCAN-Martingale can be applied to estimate the number of the desired clusters. In this paper we provide a parallel version of the DBSCAN-Martingale algorithm and a framework for clustering EO data in an unsupervised way. The approach is evaluated on a benchmark dataset of Sentinel-2 images with ground-truth annotation and is also implemented on High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure to demonstrate its scalability. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted to find the optimal selection of reserved nodes for running the proposed algorithm, in relation to execution time and cost.

AB  - Multi-temporal remotely sensed observations acquired by multi-spectral sensors contain a wealth of information related to the Earth's state. Deep learning methods have demonstrated a great potential in analyzing such observations. Traditional 2D and 3D approaches are unable to effectively extract valuable information encoded across all available dimensions. In this work, we propose the extension of current fully-convolutional models for multi-temporal remote sensing data classification to their high-dimensional analogs, which can naturally capture multi-dimensional dependencies and correlations. Experimental analysis on recently released observations from Landsat-8 reveals that our proposed high-dimensional fully-convolutional approach exhibits a clear classification performance improvement over state of the art low-order fully-convolutional models.

TI  - On the Role of Polarimetric Decomposition and Speckle Filtering Methods for C-Band SAR Wetland Classification Purposes
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous wetlands studies have thoroughly verified the usefulness of data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors in various acquisition modes. However, the effect of the processing parameters in wetland classification remains poorly explored. In this study, we investigated the influence of speckle filters and decomposition methods with different combinations of filter and decomposition windows sizes on classification accuracy. We used a C-band Radarsat 2 image acquired over a wetland located in northeast Poland. We processed the SAR data using various speckle filters: boxcar, intensity-driven adaptive-neighborhood (IDAN), improved Lee sigma, refined Lee (in 5x5 to 11x11 pixel window sizes), and a nonlocal NL-SAR. Next, we processed the nonfiltered and filtered data using nine polarimetric decompositions, also in 5x5 to 11x11 pixel window sizes. The extracted polarimetric features were applied as an input dataset in the random forest classification model in single- and multidecomposition scenarios. In the single-decomposition scenario, the Cloude-Pottier decomposition produced the highest (72%) and the Touzi decomposition achieved the lowest (38%) accuracy. The IDAN filter with an 11x11 filter window and a 9x9 decomposition window had the highest, and the nonfiltered data with a 5x5 decomposition window had the lowest accuracy in the multidecomposition scenario. The most important features were the alpha parameter from the Cloude-Pottier decomposition, the polarimetric contribution of the Shannon entropy, and the volume backscattering components. The results stress the importance of appropriate processing parameters in the SAR data classification workflow, and the study guides in selecting the most suitable combination of radar image processing parameters for wetland classification.

TI  - Digital mapping of indicators that determine the sorption properties of soils in relation to pollutants, according to remote sensing data of the Earth using machine learning
T2  - GEORESURSY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the data of remote sensing of the Earth, the accuracy of the spatial prediction of soil indicators determining sorption properties in relation to pollutants was compared. To build spatial maps of changes in soil properties, machine learning methods based on support vector regression models (SVMr) and random forest (RF) were used. It was shown that the methods of machine modeling using remote sensing can be successfully used for spatial prediction of the content of particle size fractions, organic matter, pH and the capacity of cation exchange of soils in small areas. It is shown that the spatial prediction of the content of silt fraction is best modeled using the RF algorithm, while the other properties of soils that can determine their sorption potential in relation to pollutants are better modeled using the SVMr method. In general, both machine learning methods have similar spatial prediction results.

TI  - STUDY OF CHANGES IN MANGROVE FOREST COVER IN THREE AREAS LOCATED ON THE EAST COAST OF NORTH SUMATRA PROVINCE BETWEEN 1990 AND 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring mangrove distribution is essential to ensure appropriate and efficient management of mangrove forests, as an effort to minimise the damage that potentially occurs in the ecosystem, including preventing human-induced activities that could lower the quantity and quality of mangroves. On the other hand, monitoring activities are also important for mangrove forest rehabilitation programmes. The use of high- and medium-resolution satellite imageries, especially free Landsat images, is very popular for mapping mangrove forests. As a unique wetland ecosystem, mangroves are mapped by applying unsupervised and supervised classification techniques. The specific objective of this study was to examine the rate of change in mangrove forest cover in two regencies and one city located on the east coast of North Sumatra province over a period of three decades. It was found that mangrove forests have lost 34,063.12 ha over three decades between 1990 and 2020, with the main drivers of mangrove deforestation being conversion to agricultural lands (similar to 20,961.27 ha) and ponds (similar to 8,584.39 ha) . The normalised difference vegetation index showed that the current extent of mangroves in North Sumatra Province in 2020 were: very poor (344.91 ha), poor (244,78 ha), moderate (844.98 ha), healthy (5,692.58 ha) and very healthy (12,989.71 ha).

TI  - Smouldering multiple sclerosis: the 'real MS'
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Using a philosophical approach or deductive reasoning, we challenge the dominant clinico-radiological worldview that defines multiple sclerosis (MS) as a focal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). We provide a range of evidence to argue that the 'real MS' is in fact driven primarily by a smouldering pathological disease process. In natural history studies and clinical trials, relapses and focal activity revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in MS patients on placebo or on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) were found to be poor predictors of long-term disease evolution and were dissociated from disability outcomes. In addition, the progressive accumulation of disability in MS can occur independently of relapse activity from early in the disease course. This scenario is underpinned by a more diffuse smouldering pathological process that may affect the entire CNS. Many putative pathological drivers of smouldering MS can be potentially modified by specific therapeutic strategies, an approach that may have major implications for the management of MS patients. We hypothesise that therapeutically targeting a state of 'no evident inflammatory disease activity' (NEIDA) cannot sufficiently prevent disability accumulation in MS, meaning that treatment should also focus on other brain and spinal cord pathological processes contributing to the slow loss of neurological function. This should also be complemented with a holistic approach to the management of other systemic disease processes that have been shown to worsen MS outcomes.

AB  - A new system has been developed to improve the accuracy of aligning a laser beam towards a specific location on a grid board. The system consists of automatic laser spot detection and spatial calibration, both in real time. Laser detection uses OPEN-CV libraries in Python to get precise coordinates of laser spot contour center. Comparison with coordinates from point to aim, gives real time deviation and allows the operator the adjust laser direction to meet the quality criterion. This system improves overall alignment uncertainties by a factor of 3 compared to the classical alignment procedure thanks to precise laser spot location and helpful assistance in in setting the laser direction.

TI  - The Extended Timing Annotation Dataset for Sentinel-1-Product Description and First Evaluation Results
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces the extended timing annotation dataset (ETAD) product for Sentinel-1 (S-1) which was developed in a joint effort of German Aerospace Center (DLR) and European Space Agency (ESA). It allows to correct range and azimuth timing of S-1 images for geophysical effects and for inaccuracies in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image focusing. In combination with the precise orbit solution, these effects determine the absolute geolocation accuracy of S-1 SAR images and the relative collocation accuracy of repeat pass image stacks. ETAD contains the gridded timing corrections for the tropospheric and ionospheric path delays, the tidal-based surface displacements, and the SAR processing effects, all of which are computed for each data taken using standard models from geodesy and auxiliary atmospheric data. The ETAD product helps S-1 users to significantly improve the geolocation accuracy of the S-1 SAR products to better than 0.2 m and offers a potential solution for correcting large-scale interferometric phase variations. The product layout and product generation are described schematically. This article also reports first the results for different SAR techniques: first, the improvement in geolocation accuracy down to a few centimeters by verification of accurately surveyed corner reflector positions in the range-azimuth plane; second, the well-established offset-tracking technique, which is used for systematic ice velocity monitoring of ice sheets and glaciers, where ETAD can reduce velocity biases down to subcentimetric values; and third, the correction of atmospheric phase contributions in wide-area interferograms used for national and European ground motion services. These early results proof the added value of the ETAD corrections and that the product design is well-suited to be integrated into the processing flows of established SAR applications such as absolute ranging of targets, speckle/feature tracking, and interferometry.

TI  - Evaluating the Utility of High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Air Pollution Data in Estimating Local PM<sub>2.5</sub> Exposures in California from 2015-2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality management is increasingly focused not only on across-the-board reductions in ambient pollution concentrations but also on identifying and remediating elevated exposures that often occur in traditionally disadvantaged communities. Remote sensing of ambient air pollution using data derived from satellites has the potential to better inform management decisions that address environmental disparities by providing increased spatial coverage, at high-spatial resolutions, compared to air pollution exposure estimates based on ground-based monitors alone. Daily PM2.5 estimates for 2015-2018 were estimated at a 1 km(2) resolution, derived from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm in order to assess the utility of highly refined spatiotemporal air pollution data in 92 California cities and in the 13 communities included in the California Community Air Protection Program. The identification of pollution hot-spots within a city is typically not possible relying solely on the regulatory monitoring networks; however, day-to-day temporal variability was shown to be generally well represented by nearby ground-based monitoring data even in communities with strong spatial gradients in pollutant concentrations. An assessment of within-ZIP Code variability in pollution estimates indicates that high-resolution pollution estimates (i.e., 1 km(2)) are not always needed to identify spatial differences in exposure but become increasingly important for larger geographic areas (approximately 50 km(2)). Taken together, these findings can help inform strategies for use of remote sensing data for air quality management including the screening of locations with air pollution exposures that are not well represented by existing ground-based air pollution monitors.

TI  - Aseneth's Epiphanies
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF JUDAISM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the function of epiphany in Joseph and Aseneth. Though central to the narrative, this literary device and theological phenomenon is frequently overlooked or only indirectly included in other studies. This reading argues that the mode of epiphany is central, not only to the plot, but to the main themes and messages of Joseph and Aseneth; epiphany operates as a boundary marker between two groups in Joseph and Aseneth. These two groups are insiders and outsiders, and mortal and (quasi-)divine beings. While epiphanies are used to distinguish between these groups, they also invite the narrative's heroine, Aseneth, to transcend these boundaries. The story's numerous epiphanies signpost Aseneth's transition from a mortal outsider to a quasi-divine insider. Used in this way, the epiphanies build a worldview wherein the divine intercedes directly on behalf of, and grants particular dispensations to certain individuals.

AB  - In contact with the ocean, the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) starts to float and forms ice shelves. These ice shelves have an important role in the AIS stability, acting as active regulators of the upward ice streams. In this article, we extract from four years of Sentinel-1 SAR images ice velocity fields. Using speckle tracking, we determine the ice velocities at high spatial and temporal resolution over the particular case of the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf - RBIS. The results show the strong influence of ice rises, as well as intra-annual temporal variability, a part being attributable to tides and inverse barometer effect. Apart from these variations, we observe no significant trend in any regions of the RBIS. Nevertheless, and following the recent RBIS calving event, we recommend continuing to monitor the region and observing any potential changes.

TI  - Antiquity and its heritage in intellectual and political self-identification by the prisoner of island of Saint Helena
T2  - DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examined the problem of the personal attitude of Napoleon Bonaparte to antiquity. The authors focus on various aspects of the perception of antiquity in the imperial epoch, creating a social and cultural background. In relation to Napoleon, the authors turn to the time of his stay on the island of St. Helena. The main source is the memoirs of Count Las Cases, as well as personal records of Napoleon. It follows from them that on the island Napoleon more than once turns to antiquity, to its heritage, which in many respects influenced his worldview, becoming for him a kind of landmark, a source of knowledge and experience. Discussions about ancient statehood, political and military figures of antiquity, assessment and analysis of historical events allow us to determine the specifics of Napoleon's attitude to ancient history. The authors of the article conclude that Napoleon, being far from the centers of civilization, remains one of the outstanding intellectuals of his time.

AB  - In modern fantasy narratives, AI is already a kind of platform and at the same time providing a new worldview itself, or expanding into new characters that slowly deviate from SF's narrative customs along with the identity assigned to robots. Although AI appears in various fantasy narratives, a multi-layered and detailed approach is taking place, it is also noteworthy that it also begins within the premise already imagined in common. This paper starts by reading the AI implemented (imagined) in the narrative as a character. Although AI appears in various fantasy narratives, a multi-layered and detailed approach is taking place, it is also noteworthy that it also begins within the premise already imagined in common. Another major feature is that these familiar settings naturally lead to the agreed narrative, including basic mechanical settings of character AI, learning about functions and environments, and errors. Therefore, Character AI is a problematic character that can expand the exterior of our narrative, which has developed around probability, in the boundary between reality and fantasy, humans and non-humans, creatures and non-living things.This paper examines the epic position by reading the AI implemented (imagined) in the narrative as a character, distinguishing it from the real world's AI through Ku Byung-mo's long story, "Time of One Spoon" The AI Eun-gyeol in this work raises the fundamental question of the novel "What is humanity" in the new terrain we will soon face, with familiar narratives in basic settings, learning processes, and points of error. The part that the narrative dealing with character AI pays attention to is also about boundaries, like other fantasy narratives. Therefore, the settings as a machine and unexpected errors at the same time as the programmed learning process are also familiar devices to induce discussions on the boundaries. If the genre of SF is to induce people to think richly about the present by imagining the future, character AI is a challenging example of a new human with signs.

TI  - Thresholding process on the dissimilarities between probability models for change detection on remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection comprises a very important application in environmental studies involving multitemporal data obtained by remote sensing. Developing more accurate change detection methods is an ongoing challenge. Our study presents a new, unsupervised change detection method based on the concepts of stochastic distances and thresholding. To prove the effectiveness of the method, a study was carried out involving a region in southeastern Brazil, from 1999 to 2018, which underwent a high rate of environmental degradation caused by urban, industrial, and sand mining expansion. In this investigation, images obtained by thematic mapper and operational land imager sensors aboard the Landsat-5 and -8 satellites were used. Comparisons with the change vector analysis (CVA) method are included in the analyses. Results showed that the proposed method is capable of providing more accurate results in relation to the CVA method, after adequate parameterization, providing more realistic mappings with greater precision.

T2  - CURRENT ORGANOCATALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Catalytic degradation of azo dye. Background Azo dyes are toxic agents and pollutants, and the degradation of these dyes has an important application in the treatment of textile industry wastes.Catalytic decolorization of fast yellow dye by hexacyanoferrate (III), abbreviated as HCF(III) using polyvinylpyrrolidone abbreviated as PVP stabilized Ir-Ni bimetallic nanocrystals has been evaluated by kinetic spectrophotometric method at 440nm wavelength of the reaction mixture. Methods The impact of various operational factors such as fast yellow dye abbreviated as [FY], oxidant [HCF(III)] ions, promoter iridium-nickel bimetallic nanoparticles abbreviated as [(Ir-Ni)] BMNPs, and solution pH on the rate of the reaction have been examined. Results The results represent that the reaction follows the first-order kinetics model with respect to [oxidant] at optimum pH 8 and fix temperature 40 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Thermodynamic parameters (such as activation energy (E)a(), enthalpy (Delta H)(#)(), entropy (Delta S)(#)(),) frequency factor (A), and free energy of activation (Delta F-#) have been evaluated by examining the reaction rate at four temperatures i.e., 40(0)C, 45(0)C, 50(0)C, and 55(0)C. On the basis of experimental outcomes, an appropriate mechanism involving complex formation has been proposed. Conclusion Analytical techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, and LCMS of degraded products represent the formation of easier and less harmful compounds.

TI  - A Two-Stage PAN-Sharpening Algorithm Based on Sparse Representation for Spectral Distortion Reduction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspite of technological advancement, inherent processing capability of current age sensors limits the desired details in the acquired image for variety of remote sensing applications. Pan-sharpening is a prominent scheme to integrate the essential spatial details inferred from panchromatic (PAN) image and the desired spectral information of multispectral (MS) image. This paper presents an effective two-stage pan-sharpening method to produce high resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. The proposed method is based on the premise that the HRMS image can be formulated as an amalgam of spectral and spatial components. The spectral components are estimated by processing the interpolated MS image with a filter approximated with modulation transfer function (MTF) of the sensor. Sparse representation theory is adapted to construct the spatial components. The high-frequency details extracted from the PAN image and its low resolution variant are utilized to construct dual dictionaries. The dictionaries are jointly learned by an efficient training algorithm to enhance the adaptability. The hypothesis of sparse coefficients invariance over scales is also incorporated to reckon the appropriate spatial information. Further, an iterative filtering mechanism is developed to enhance the quality of fused image. Four distinct datasets generated from QuickBird, IKONOS, Pleiades and WorldView-2 sensors are used for experimentation. The comprehensive assessment at reduced-scale and full-scale persuade the effectiveness of proposed method in the retention of spectral information and intensification of the spatial details.

TI  - IMAGE OF THE SHAMAN IN ETHNOGRAPHIC CINEMA (ON THE MATERIAL OF THE FILM "OLD MAN PETER")
T2  - EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers ethnographic cinema as a form of visual representation of religious phenomena (manifestations of shamanism) among the Ob Ugrians. The authors argue that ethnographic films are of particular value for the study of indigenous shamanism. They demonstrate not only ritual practice and rites, but the ordinary, non-ritual side of the life of shamans as well as combine research and cinematic approaches. As a case study, the documentary "Old Man Peter", shot by filmmaker I. A. Golovnev in 2004-2008 in the Ob North, in the places of residence of the Kazym Khanty, is considered. Based on the experience gained during the filmmaking in the place of the Kazym River, the diary of the author of the film and scientific literature, the authors reconstruct the cult practices of the Kazym Khanty (veneration of nature spirits, Bear cult, Bear Festival) that exist in modern Khanty culture as rudiments. The main themes and plots related to the formation of the cinematic image of the Khanty shaman Petr Sengepov, the leader of the local community is considered. Authors came to the conclusion that modern ethnographic films that represent shamanism not as splendiferous, but as a personal phenomenon, are an effective tool for the "cultural revitalization" of local communities. Visualization of shamanism in ethnographic cinema allows to capture the characteristics of the worldview of indigenous peoples.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research was to develop a coherent theoretical proposal for counteracting drug trafficking in Russia and Germany. The methodological basis of the research is the dialectical and worldview approach. The latter determined the application of the general principles of cognition to study the current situation of drug abuse in Russia and Germany. Among the results stands out the fact that, previously tested forms of preventive work require careful restructuring and adjustment on the example of the implementation of the Strategy of the State Anti-Drug Policy of the Russian Federation until 2030, which implies the involvement of various actors in the organization of preventive work. In addition, the scientific results of the research include a critical analysis of the legislation on drug trafficking, trends in the drug situation and criminological study of persons involved in drug trafficking. In conclusion, the authors provided a legal formulation of certain areas of the fight against drug trafficking in the Russian Federation and Germany.

AB  - Objective: To present an inventory of the species of the genus Lutzomyia in 33 rural districts of six municipalities located in the area of influence of the Sogamoso Hydroelectric Power Plant located in Santander during 2016-2017. Methodology: Non-systematic entomological monitoring was carried out in rural areas of the municipalities of Betulia, Giron, Lebrija, Los Santos, San Vicente de Chucuri, and Zapatoca. The following techniques were used for data collection: (a) miniature CDC-type light traps from 6:00 p.m. to 6: 00 a.m.; (b) Shannon trap from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.; (c) BG-Sentinel trap for 24 hours (10 a.m. to 10 a.m.); (d) captures with protected human bait using manual vacuum cleaners between 6:00 p.m and 8:00 p.m.; (e) active search in tree trunks, caves and walls of houses between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. The collected species were identified with the keys of Young and Duncan. Scope: A general list of species is provided for the department of Santander, as well as two new records for the area of influence of the Sogamoso Hydroelectric Power Plant. Results: A total of 705 Lutzomyia were collected, distributed in 21 species, and some that are vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis stood out for their abundance and importance including: Lutzomyia gomezi, L. panamensis, and L. ovallesi, and L. longipalpis prevailed in visceral leishmaniasis. Two new reports are presented for Santander: L. sanguinaria and L. strictivilla. Conclusion: The significant presence of vectors involved in the transmission of leishmaniasis represents a risk for this disease to occur in the populations in the study area.

AB  - In hydrological surveys, observation through representative location is essential due to temporal and spatial limitations and constraints. Regarding the use of hydrological data and the accuracy of the data, there are still insufficient observatories to be used in a specific watershed. In addition, since there is virtually no standard for the location of the current evapotranspiration, this study proposes a method for determining the location of the evapotranspiration. To determining the location of evapotranspiration, a grid is selected in consideration of the operating range of the Flux Tower using the eddy covariance measurement method, which is mainly used to measure evapotranspiration. The grid of representative location was calculated using the factors affecting evapotranspiration and satellite data of evapotranspiration. The grid of representative location was classified as good, fair, and poor. As a result, the number of good grids calculated was 54. It is judged that the classification of the grid has been achieved regarding topography and land use as a characteristic that appeared in the classification of the grid. In particular, in the case of elevation or city area, there was a large deviation, and the calculated good grid was judged to be a group between the two distributions.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The occurrence of Silla's gold crown was not caused by the unilateral spread of advanced culture. It was produced by the creation of groups in Silla and Gaya based on the social concepts of the worldview and the state-owned land shared with neighboring countries. There is an opinion that the origin of Silla's gold crown was regarded as a direct origin, and that it was spread to the Korean Peninsula by using the Seonbi official residence in the basin of the Daeneung River as an intermediate stop. This is a method of finding the genealogy of culture based on the propagation and system of the origin of the Silla tree-shaped gold crown. This recognizes the origin of culture from the perspective of unilateral advanced culture-centeredness that does not reflect the social concepts of the intellectuals.Similar wooden coffins do not all have the same meaning. In other words, there is a difference in the perspective of recognizing gold crowns depending on the region. In most cases, similar cultural elements such as sacred trees and spiritual birds are used to symbolize various worldviews that have been re-established, depending on various countries and regions.It is unreasonable to think that the gold crown, which was produced at the earliest time, was recognized as a circular shape, and that what was produced at the time was an imitation of the oldest. The view that the direct origin is placed on the gold crown produced at the oldest time may be an unreasonable idea. The metal crown of the early Silla period is the exclusive property of the king, and there are many opinions that it is considered a symbol of authority. However, it seems that the gold crown was mainly used as a funeral ritual for the king or the upper aristocracy. Throughout the mid- to late-term period, the function and social role of the metal pipes excavated from the Silla tombs also changed.The early Silla gold crown was not produced by a single genealogy from the Daewolgeum crown, which was recognized as a form of relief. Early Silla gold crowns were based on post-tax customs on tree of life and birds conceived in the northern grassy nomadic culture of Mongolia, Altai, South Russia, and Scyto Siberian culture on the northern coast of the Black Sea. Based on the nomadic culture of the northern meadow and the Taoist worldview formed in China, the Silla people and Gaya in the Nakdonggang River basin can be seen as being creatively produced by Silla people.

T2  - REVISTA AGROGEOAMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing and digital processing of images is increasingly present in the monitoring and analysis of environmental data, mainly due to the ease of obtaining orbital images and the advanced methods of image classification. Temporal evaluation of restoration of native vegetation surrounding springs is important for the protection of water resources. A project named Water Conserver (Conservador das Aguas) was developed between 2005 and 2015, involving 380 springs in Extrema, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, focused on the preservation of water sources. The present study was carried out to quantify and analyze Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA) surrounding these water bodies. Free orbital images with spatial resolution of 30 m were acquired from the satellites Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 in 2003 and 2021, respectively. Object-oriented classification was used to evaluate the total PPA of restored springs over 18 years. The success of the Water Conserver Project resulted in a total restoration of more than 82% of areas surrounding springs up to 2021.

TI  - Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of schistosomiasis in mainland China: Evidence from a multi-stage continuous downscaling sentinel monitoring
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the spatiotemporal distribution of Schistosoma (S.) japonicum infections in humans, livestock, and Oncomelania (O.) hupensis across the endemic foci of China.Methods: Based on multi-stage continuous downscaling of sentinel monitoring, county-based schistosomiasis surveillance data were captured from the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of China from 2005 to 2019. The data included S. japonicum infections in humans, livestock, and O. hupensis. The spatiotemporal trends for schistosomiasis were detected using a Joinpoint regression model, with a standard deviational ellipse (SDE) tool, which determined the central tendency and dispersion in the spatial distribution of schistosomiasis. Further, more spatiotemporal clusters of S. japonicum infections in humans, livestock, and O. hupensis were evaluated by the Poisson model.Results: The prevalence of S. japonicum human infections decreased from 2.06% to zero based on data of the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of China from 2005 to 2019, with a reduction from 9.42% to zero for the prevalence of S. japonicum infections in livestock, and from 0.26% to zero for the prevalence of S. japonicum infections in O. hupensis. Analysis using an SDE tool showed that schistosomiasis-affected regions were reduced yearly from 2005 to 2014 in the endemic provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, as well as in the Poyang and Dongting Lake regions. Poisson model revealed 11 clusters of S. japonicum human infections, six clusters of S. japonicum infections in livestock, and nine clusters of S. japonicum infections in O. hupensis. The clusters of human infection were highly consistent with clusters of S. japonicum infections in livestock and O. hupensis. They were in the 5 provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, as well as along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Humans, livestock, and O. hupensis infections with S. japonicum were mainly concentrated in the north of the Hunan Province, south of the Hubei Province, north of the Jiangxi Province, and southwestern portion of Anhui Province. In the 2 mountainous provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan, human, livestock, and O. hupensis infections with S. japonicum were mainly concentrated in the northwestern portion of the Yunnan Province, the Daliangshan area in the south of Sichuan Province, and the hilly regions in the middle of Sichuan Province.Conclusions: A remarkable decline in the disease prevalence of S. japonicum infection was observed in endemic schistosomiasis in China between 2005 and 2019. However, there remains a long-term risk of transmission in local areas, with the highest-risk areas primarily in Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake regions, requiring to focus on vigilance against the rebound of the epidemic. Development of high-sensitivity detection methods and integrating the transmission links such as human and livestock infection, wild animal infection, and O. hupensis into the surveillance-response system will ensure the elimination of schistosomiasis in China by 2030.

AB  - This paper presents a multitemporal analysis aimed at investigating the spatial and temporal consistency of Surface Soil Moisture (SSM), retrieved from optical satellite data by means of multispectral indexes, in a test area in central Italy. In particular, multitemporal series of images acquired by Landsat satellites were processed to obtain SSM estimates by using multispectral indices proposed in the literature. Retrieved SSM values and their temporal trends were compared in order to verify their consistency with the pluviometric data of the same period and the correlation between them. The results have highlighted the usefulness of multispectral indices for monitoring wide areas over long periods of time, yet with some factors, such as geology, pedology and phenology, that can affect the quality of the results and reduce the correlation with pluviometric trend.

AB  - Intensity and severity of bushfires in Australia have increased over the past few decades due to climate change, threatening habitat loss for numerous species. Although the impact of bushfires on vertebrates is well-documented, the corresponding effects on insect taxa are rarely examined, although they are responsible for key ecosystem functions and services. Understanding the effects of bushfire seasons on insect distributions could elucidate long-term impacts and patterns of ecosystem recovery. Here, we investigated the effects of recent bushfires, land-cover change, and climatic variables on the distribution of a common and endemic dragonfly, the swamp tigertail (Synthemis eustalacta (Burmeister, 1839)), which inhabits forests that have recently undergone severe burning. We used a temporally dynamic species distribution modeling approach that incorporated 20 years of community-science data on dragonfly occurrence and predictors based on fire, land cover, and climate to make yearly predictions of suitability. We also compared this to an approach that combines multiple temporally static models that use annual data. We found that for both approaches, fire-specific variables had negligible importance for the models, while percent of tree and non-vegetative cover were the most important. We also found that the dynamic model outperformed the static ones when evaluated with cross-validation. Model predictions indicated temporal variation in area and spatial arrangement of suitable habitat but no patterns of habitat expansion, contraction, or shifting. These results highlight not only the efficacy of dynamic modeling to capture spatiotemporal variables, such as vegetation cover for an endemic insect species, but also provide a novel approach to mapping species distributions with sparse locality records. Data is stored as comma-separated values (CSV) for occurrences, Tag Image File Format (.tiff) for environmental variable raster data, and R for programming and data manipulation. Programs required to open data include R and RStudio and QGIS.Funding provided by: National Science FoundationCrossref Funder Registry ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/100000001Award Number: 2002473Funding provided by: Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceCrossref Funder Registry ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691Award Number: Occurrence Records We acquired occurrence records of adult S. eustalacta from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, DOI: https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.c256kv). We first subsetted the raw data by selecting occurrence records identified as museum samples, curated research-grade community science observations, and published sightings from scientific surveys. We then filtered out records without coordinate information and those recorded outside the years 2001-2020. Finally, we restricted our analysis dataset to records from scientific institutions (Australian Museum, Queensland Museum, Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Murray Darling Basin Authority), community science websites (iNaturalist, Atlas of Living Australia), and governmental organizations (New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry, and Environment, South Australia Department for Environment and Water). In total, we acquired 483 occurrences (Table 1). Further occurrence filtering consisted of removing sightings with erroneous localities (specimens located at known institutions). Environmental Data We generated yearly sets of environmental predictor variables for modeling that included bioclimatic variables, as well as vegetation cover and seasonal burned area for the years 2001-2020. All analyses were conducted using the statistical programming language R v. 4.1.2 (Team, 2021), and all layers have a geographic coordinate system (i.e., degrees) with a WGS84 datum. We acquired monthly minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation rasters for Australia at 2.5 arcminutes resolution (approx. 5 km at the equator), produced by the Australia Bureau of Meteorology (Jones et al., 2009). From these rasters, we created a set of 19 bioclimatic variables representing means, variabilities, and extremes for temperature and precipitation using the dismo package (Hijmans et al., 2017). Due to known spatial artifacts, we omitted four of these variables that include temperature-precipitation interactions (bio08, bio09, bio18, bio19) from the analysis (Moo-Llanes et al., 2021). We also acquired remotely sensed variables from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using the MODISstp package (Busetto and Ranghetti, 2016). Landscape variables describing fire and land cover have been shown to be important predictors of dragonfly range (Jolly et al., 2022). Increases in regional fire frequency lead to higher rates of river contamination via burned carbon and metal leaching (Kelly et al., 2020; Nasirian and Irvine, 2017; Nunes et al., 2018). Tree cover heavily affects other odonate species in terms of landscape patchiness (Dolny et al., 2014; Rith-Najarian, 1998; Suhonen et al., 2010; Suhonen et al., 2013). Loss of plant cover due to fires increases ambient temperature, which can drastically affect odonate survival (Castillo-Perez et al., 2021). Based on this information and on knowledge of the species, we selected variables that we hypothesized were drivers of S. eustalacta distribution (Collins and Mcintyre, 2015; Theischinger and Hawking, 2006): vegetation continuous fields (VCF; defined as percent of pixel covered by each field) for percent tree cover, non-tree cover, and non-vegetated cover (percent tree cover subtracted from percent non-tree cover) (MOD44B, 250 m yearly resolution), annual evapotranspiration (MOD16A3, 500 m yearly resolution), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; MOD13A2, 1 km monthly resolution), and Burned Area data product (MDC64A1, 500 m monthly resolution). We calculated yearly averages of each MODIS variable to capture annual variability and resampled all variables to the coarsest resolution (2.5 arcminutes). Pixel values for Burned Area Product range from 0 (unburned) to 365 (366 for leap year), corresponding to the days of the year. From these data, we generated annual Burned Area layers by converting these values to binary (pixel values [greater than]1 = burned, 0 = unburned). Finally, we acquired categorical rasters representing Australia's major vegetation groups from The Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL, https://bccvl.org.au/), and global terrestrial ecoregions from the World Wildlife Fund (https://www.worldwildlife.org). All raster analyses were conducted with the R package raster v3.5-29 (Hijmans et al., 2021). Species Distribution Modeling Before modeling, we processed our occurrences to account for sampling bias, delineated a study extent to sample background points, and omitted highly correlated environmental variables. We spatially thinned occurrences by 10 km to reduce the effects of sampling bias and artificial clustering (Veloz, 2009) using the spThin package (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2015), which resulted in more even sample sizes across years (n = 133 total; Table 1). Synthemis eustalacta is endemic to southern Australia and disperses roughly 500 m from streams in early adulthood, but upon reaching maturity, returns to its site of emergence (Theischinger and Hawking, 2006). We thus chose a study extent to include potentially unsampled areas yet exclude large areas outside the species' dispersal limitations (Peterson and Soberon, 2012), defined as a minimum convex polygon around all localities (2001-2020) buffered by 1 degree (approx. 111 km at equator). Within this extent, we randomly sampled 50,000 background points for modeling and extracted their yearly environmental values. We used these values to calculate correlations between variables using the 'vifcor' and 'vifstep' functions in the usdm package v 1.1-18 (Naimi, 2017) and filtered out variables by year with correlation coefficients higher than 0.9 and a VIF threshold of 10. Finally, we retained variables for analysis which were kept among all yearly environmental backgrounds. To model the distribution of S. eustalacta, we used the presence-background algorithm Maxent v3.4.4 (Phillips et al., 2017), which remains one of the top-performing models for fitting SDMs with background data (Valavi et al., 2021). To automate model building and evaluation with different complexity settings and reporting of results, we used the R package ENMeval 2.0.0 (Kass et al., 2021). We constructed both dynamic models that incorporated data across years and static models that used year-specific data (Fig. 1). For the dynamic models, we extracted the environmental predictor values for each year from the occurrence and background points for that year and assembled them into a single training dataset. To construct a single background point dataset for the dynamic models, we extracted yearly environmental values for the same set of background points, then averaged these values across years per background point (we used the mode for categorical variables; Fig. 1). We evaluated models using random k-fold cross-validation, in which occurrences are randomly partitioned into a specified number of groups (i.e., "folds"), then models are sequentially trained on all groups but one (training data) and evaluated on the withheld group (validation data) (Hastie et al., 2009)-we used four folds (k = 4) for our evaluations. As random partitioning can result in spatial autocorrelation due to clustering within folds, spatial block cross-validation techniques are often prescribed to address this (Roberts et al., 2017). However, as our occurrences varied not only in space but also in time, and as we lacked enough records per time bin to additionally separate by temporal block, we chose to use simpler random partitioning for evaluation. In contrast to the single dynamic model, we also constructed one static model per year that used only occurrence and background environmental values for that year. For this approach, we did not make models for years with fewer than five associated occurrences (Phillips et al., 2017; Phillips and Dudik, 2008). For static models, we partitioned our data using the 'leave-one-out' strategy (referred to as "jackknife" in ENMeval), whereby one occurrence record is withheld from each model during cross-validation (k = n, or the number of occurrences). This cross-validation technique is most appropriate for small sample sizes, as it allows for the largest training datasets possible for model-building during cross-validation (Pearson et al., 2006; Shcheglovitova and Anderson, 2013). All final models were fitted to the full datasets. As Maxent models can lead to very different results when complexity settings are changed (Radosavljevic and Anderson, 2014; Warren and Seifert, 2011), we compared dynamic and static models with settings representing "simple" and "complex". Feature classes determine the shape of the model fit, while regularization multipliers control how much complexity is penalized-high regularization multipliers can result in predictor variable coefficients shrinking to zero and thus dropping out of the model (Phillips et al., 2017). Model tuning consists of varying complexity settings, running models with combinations of these settings, and selecting optimal settings based on performance metrics. For tuning, we chose a simple model with a single linear feature class (L) and a complex model with a combination of linear, quadratic, and hinge feature classes (LQH). Hinge features provide flexible linear fits that can change direction and can considerably inflate the number of model parameters when included (Phillips and Dudik, 2008). To both allow for flexibility in the growth of model complexity and simplify comparisons between models, we set the regularization multiplier to one (the Maxent software default) for each model. We assessed the dynamic and static models using averages of threshold-dependent (omission rate) and threshold-independent (AUC) discrimination performance metrics calculated on withheld validation data, but also checked the results against the Akaike Information Criterion with correction for small samples sizes (AICc; calculated on the full dataset) (Warren and Seifert, 2011). Omission rate measures the proportion of withheld occurrence localities (i.e., those in the validation dataset) that fall outside a designated model prediction threshold. We assessed the 10-percentile omission rate, which sets this threshold as the lowest suitability value for occurrences after removing the lowest 10% suitability values-this avoids choosing very low thresholds that may represent outliers (Kass et al., 2021; Radosavljevic and Anderson, 2014). Validation AUC is a measure of discrimination accuracy that can be used to make relative comparisons between SDMs with different settings fit on the same data (Radosavljevic and Anderson, 2014), but is problematic to use as an absolute performance measure for presence-background models (Lobo et al., 2008). To investigate model behavior, we examined predictor variable importance values and compared background density distributions of important variables for intense fire years between models. First, we recorded the permutation importance values for predictor variables reported by Maxent. These values are calculated by randomly permuting the values of all variables but one, building a new model, then calculating the difference between each model's training AUC and that of the empirical model (Phillips, 2021). Next, as we attributed summaries of predictor variables to the background points for the dynamic models, it was possible that years with extreme values (i.e., intense fire years) may have environmental distributions that are very different than these summaries, which would indicate that dynamic models could have overly smooth predictions for such years. To determine if any key differences existed between the dynamic model's averaged background and the static models' yearly backgrounds, we plotted background density distributions of variables with high importance for the years 2009 and 2019, then compared the shapes of these distributions with pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirov goodness-of-fit (KS) tests. We chose these two years because as they had the largest and most intense bushfires in the past 20 years in southern Australia (Van Eeden et al., 2020), we expected them to have the most extreme environmental differences between yearly and averaged backgrounds. For these plots, we chose the top three variables with the highest permutation importance shared between the simple and complex settings separately for the dynamic and static models. We made habitat suitability predictions for S. eustalacta over the study extent for each year using both the simple and complex settings for the dynamic and static models. We generated predictions by transferring all models onto our environmental variables, creating an envelope of suitability across our study extent. Maxent raw predictions were transformed to a scale of 0-1 to approximate probability of occurrence using the 'cloglog' transformation (Phillips et al., 2017). We generated predictions for all years with the dynamic models, but only for years with sufficient ([greater than]4) occurrence records for our static models. As an additional check for differences between the two approaches, we mapped the difference in predictions of our simple and complex dynamic and static models for the intense fire years of 2009 and 2019. To better visualize raster subtractions, we generated a binary threshold prediction for our fire-prone years, calculated from the 10-percentile omission rate from our model evaluation.

To determine if any key differences existed between the dynamic model's averaged background and the static models' yearly backgrounds, we plotted background density distributions of variables with high importance for the years 2009 and 2019, then compared the shapes of these distributions with pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirov goodness-of-fit (KS) tests. We chose these two years because as they had the largest and most intense bushfires in the past 20 years in southern Australia (Van Eeden et al., 2020), we expected them to have the most extreme environmental differences between yearly and averaged backgrounds. For these plots, we chose the top three variables with the highest permutation importance shared between the simple and complex settings separately for the dynamic and static models. We made habitat suitability predictions for S. eustalacta over the study extent for each year using both the simple and complex settings for the dynamic and static models. We generated predictions by transferring all models onto our environmental variables, creating an envelope of suitability across our study extent. Maxent raw predictions were transformed to a scale of 0-1 to approximate probability of occurrence using the 'cloglog' transformation (Phillips et al., 2017). We generated predictions for all years with the dynamic models, but only for years with sufficient ([greater than]4) occurrence records for our static models. As an additional check for differences between the two approaches, we mapped the difference in predictions of our simple and complex dynamic and static models for the intense fire years of 2009 and 2019. To better visualize raster subtractions, we generated a binary threshold prediction for our fire-prone years, calculated from the 10-percentile omission rate from our model evaluation.

AB  - This report completes our series of short notes on Albert Schweitzer's ethical concept. It aims to consider the asocial nature of Schweitzer's ethical concept and worldview. The scientific novelty of the research is determined by the analysis of an assumption that "individualism and immoralism" of Schweitzer's ethics act as insurmountable obstacles to its social reception. The results obtained consist in the discussion of the conceptual idea of a society as an ethical person, i.e. an ethical-oriented formation. At the same time, we consider whether the development of the society from the individual to the general through an individual ethically motivated self-development of each person is possible and necessary.

AB  - The 21st Century Policing: Cross-Site, Multi-Stakeholder Sentinel Event Review (SER) Project, seeks to test and learn from the application of the Sentinel Event Review methodology in police departments in a cross-site evaluation over three years. The goal is to learn how SER's can be sustained by local law enforcement organizations when working in a multi-stakeholder environment. The purpose of this study is to increase knowledge and understanding of sentinel event review (SER) models, as applied to criminal justice, in order to better understand root causes that can be mitigated to reduce or eliminate critical events in complex settings with multiple stakeholders. Sentinel events can include such things as the wrongful conviction of an innocent person, premature release from prison of a dangerous offender, or even a near miss that could have led to a bad outcome if not caught. The surveys were administered either in-person or via web-based surveys. For SER 1 participants, there were separate data collection periods for pre, post, and follow-up surveys. For SER 2 participants, there were separate data collection periods for pre and post/follow-up surveys. Due to time constraints, post and follow-up survey data were collected via a combined survey. For SER 2, the post/follow-up survey included a screening item that directed participants to first select which SER they participated in; they were then directed to complete the rest of the survey.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a historical and cultural approach to highlighting the activities of Ukrainians and their studies in leading European universities, in particular, in Poland during a long historical period: XVI-XIX centuries. The defining role of representatives of the Little Russian nobility in the processes of national cultural revival, preservation of the traditions of Ukrainian culture, as well as the integration of Ukraine and Ukrainianness into the European space of that time is characterized. It is emphasized that it is culture and education that reflected the inherent way of life of Ukrainians, thinking, worldview, aesthetic preferences, moral and legal norms, political aspirations and cultural and educational orientations. Ukrainian youth, being in European universities, adopted the latest knowledge, technologies, cultural and educational trends that were spread in Ukraine and Europe at that time. There has been a significant expansion of boundaries for intellectual influences and cultural forms of cooperation in the field of science, culture and education. This is connected with the desire for cultural and educational reforms in Ukraine, the initiators and authors of which were representatives of the new generation of the "leading layer" of Ukraine in the 18th-19th centuries. All these facts testify that the direction in the development of education in Ukraine has acquired a nationwide character.

AB  - The frequent occurrence of natural hazards in a touristic site have brought many challenges to the mountain ecosystem. This phenomena has severely destroyed the local ecology of the scenic spot. To understand ecological resilience, a quantifiable evaluation index system is established. This index uses the Remote-Sensing techniques and InVEST model for the calculation of the resilience value of mountain scenic spot. This index system is a useful reference for the resilience capacity construction of scenic spots.

TI  - Large Area Aboveground Biomass and Carbon Stock Mapping in Woodlands in Mozambique with L-Band Radar: Improving Accuracy by Accounting for Soil Moisture Effects Using the Water Cloud Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture effects limit radar-based aboveground biomass carbon (AGBC) prediction accuracy as well as lead to stripes between adjacent paths in regional mosaics due to varying soil moisture conditions on different acquisition dates. In this study, we utilised the semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) to account for backscattering from soil moisture in AGBC retrieval from L-band radar imagery in central Mozambique, where woodland ecosystems dominate. Cross-validation results suggest that (1) the standard WCM effectively accounts for soil moisture effects, especially for areas with AGBC <= 20 tC/ha, and (2) the standard WCM significantly improved the quality of regional AGBC mosaics by reducing the stripes between adjacent paths caused by the difference in soil moisture conditions between different acquisition dates. By applying the standard WCM, the difference in mean predicted AGBC for the tested path with the largest soil moisture difference was reduced by 18.6%. The WCM is a valuable tool for AGBC mapping by reducing prediction uncertainties and striping effects in regional mosaics, especially in low-biomass areas including African woodlands and other woodland and savanna regions. It is repeatable for recent L-band data including ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, and upcoming SAOCOM and NISAR data.

AB  - The need for effective crop monitoring in large geographical scales has become increasingly important in recent years and constitutes a technological and scientific challenge for remote sensing applications. In Europe, member states of the European Union collect geospatial data in the framework of the Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) for agricultural management and subsidizing farmers. These data can be exploited as training datasets of machine learning classifiers for crop-type mapping applications. However, the way the LPIS data are being generated, concerning primarily errors in the farmers' declarations in terms of crop-type labels, exact geometries, etc, constrains their direct use in such classification frameworks. In this study, we present and assess a methodology for filtering LPIS data based on geometric and spectral criteria in order to build a trustworthy training dataset for machine learning croptype classifiers. A new nomenclature was developed, oriented towards the spectral discrimination of crop-type classes and subclasses in Greece. The filtering methodology was applied at national scale for the agricultural year of 2019 and resulted in the selection of a sub-set of the LPIS parcels that were assessed as the most suitable and reliable to represent the different levels of the nomenclature. The developed filtering procedure was validated against actual crop-type labels derived from field visits, while the resulted filtered data were successfully utilized on various crop-type mapping experiments in Greece.

AB  - How does political ideology affect the processing of information incongruent with ones worldview? The disagreement in prior research about this question lies in how ones ideology interacts with cognitive ability to shape motivated numeracy, or the tendency to misinterpret data to confirm ones prior beliefs. Our study conceptually replicates and extends Kahan et al. (2017) by testing whether monetary incentives for accuracy lessen motivated reasoning when high- and low-numeracy partisans interpret data about mask mandates and COVID-19 cases. This research leverages the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, as Americans are polarized along party lines regarding an appropriate government response to the pandemic.

AB  - David Landgrebe, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Director of the Purdue University Laboratory for Applications of Remote Sensing (LARS), was a primary innovator in the field of digital image analysis and remote sensing of the environment. He and his LARS colleagues, along with a selected few other researchers at institutions including the University of Michigan, University of California Berkley, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and NASA Johnson Space Center, defined and developed remote sensing technology to monitor the Earth's terrestrial environment. This research led to the Landsat program, which has continued to monitor the Earth's land areas for a half century. These technologies have defined new fields of scientific query in digital image analysis, biophysical remote sensing, as well as remote sensing science and applications. Dr. Landgrebe's contributions to these research areas were substantial and profound. Understanding the early evolution of work is critical to understanding how this technology is still advancing today. The authors hope that current and future students of these fields will benefit from understanding how this all began.

AB  - Cloud detection is one of the most important image preprocessing steps that can be performed on-board satellites. It may allow us to reduce the amount of data to analyze or downlink by pruning the cloudy areas, or to make the satellites more autonomous through data-driven image acquisition re-scheduling of the areas obscured by clouds. Thus, building the cloud detection algorithms that can be ultimately deployed in orbit became an important research avenue. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the fully-convolutional neural networks for cloud detection against the atmospheric conditions that resemble real acquisition settings of the Intuition-1 mission. Our experiments, performed over the original and simulated Landsat-8 images, with the latter reflecting target conditions, shed more light on the performance of deep models and showed how can we verify their robustness in Earth observation tasks for which real images do not exist yet.

AB  - The pollution of aquatic ecosystems by sodium pentachlorophenolate (Na-PCP) has assumed serious proportions due to their toxicity and accumulative effect in organisms and environment. The objective of this experimental study was to examine and quantify the histopatological effects of Na-PCP on the structure of hepatopancreas and gill, as two most important organs targeted by phenol entries, in the freshwater snail, Holandriana holandrii. Results indicate serious structural changes in tissue and epithelial cells of both organs and were accelerated with increase of Na-PCP concentrations and more pronounced related to exposed period. In hepatopancreas, tubular lumen, vacuole surface and number per tubule, exudate area in the tubular lumen, all increased with increase in concentration. Opposite trend of decreased height was observed for digestive and basophil cells. Significant gill structural changes appeared as a progressive necrosis at epithelial cells and the epithelial lining was interrupted, while connective tissue exhibited vacuolization, formation of large irregular spaces and damaged chitinous rods. Histomorphometrical approach in quantification of toxicant effects on the organism tissue could be used in legislative prevention of hazardous effects in freshwater ecosystems and H. holandrii may serve as a reliable and sentinel indicator of freshwater deterioration.

TI  - Reconstruction of Satellite Time Series With a Dynamic Smoother
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series reconstruction methods are widely used to generate smooth and gap-free time series using imagery acquired at coarse spatial resolution and high frequency return intervals. However, as interest has grown in leveraging the nearly 40-a record of Landsat to study long-term changes in terrestrial ecosystems at 30-m spatial resolution, new methods are required to reconstruct time series of Landsat imagery, which have lower temporal density than coarse resolution sensors such as AVHRR or MODIS. To address this need, we introduce a dynamic temporal smoothing (DTS) method that reconstructs sparse and noisy signals into dense time series at regular intervals. The DTS is a weighted smoother with parameters that adjust dynamically to variation in time series and can be applied to both dense and sparse time series measurements. Because the DTS smoother we describe is specifically designed to reconstruct high-quality time series of optical imagery, it has utility for applications focused on land cover and vegetation remote sensing over long time periods at moderate spatial resolution. We present the DTS algorithm that we have implemented and illustrate the ability of the DTS to reconstruct time series of Landsat imagery across multiple sensors (TM, ETM+, and OLI). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTS algorithm we apply it and evaluate results across a diverse range of land cover and vegetation types in the South American Southern Cone region.

TI  - Recognition of Polar Lows in Sentinel-1 SAR Images With Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we explore the possibility of detecting polar lows in C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images by means of deep learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of Sentinel-1 images divided into two classes, representing the presence and absence of a maritime mesocyclone, respectively. The dataset is constructed using the ECMWF reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) dataset as baseline and it consists of 2004 annotated images. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind to be publicly released. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model to classify the labeled images. Evaluated on an independent test set, the model yields an F1 score of 0.95, indicating that polar lows can be consistently detected from SAR images. Interpretability techniques applied to the deep learning model reveal that atmospheric fronts and cyclonic eyes are key features in the classification. Moreover, experimental results show that the model is accurate even if: 1) such features are significantly cropped due to the limited swath width of the SAR; 2) the features are partly covered by sea ice; and 3) land is covering significant parts of the images. By evaluating the model performance on multiple input image resolutions (pixel sizes of 500 m, 1 km, and 2 km), it is found that higher resolution yield the best performance. This emphasizes the potential of using high-resolution sensors like SAR for detecting polar lows, as compared to conventionally used sensors such as scatterometers.

TI  - IDENTIFYING TIME PATTERNS AT THE FIELD SCALE FOR RETRIEVING SUPERFICIAL SOIL MOISTURE ON AN AGRICULTURAL AREA WITH A CHANGE DETECTION METHOD: A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - A preliminary analysis based on the application of a change detection method for remote sensed soil moisture retrieval at high resolution is presented. Sentinel-1 SAR images are used for studying agricultural areas in Spain, where in situ soil moisture data are available through the International Soil Moisture Network. The total backscattered SAR signal is modelled as the sum of vegetation and soil contributions. At first, the relationship between soil moisture and the co-polarized band of Sentinel-1 was analyzed for all the measurement stations of the area, and the ones with stronger relation were selected. Time series analyses were then conducted at the field scale for studying the interactions between some SAR parameters and the in situ data. The two polarizations and the polarization ratio were analyzed with respect to in situ soil moisture observations and precipitation data in order to identify homogeneous time domains in which the method can be applied in a consistent manner. Analyses show that the main driver of wide range SAR signal variations is the presence of precipitation events. Moreover, SAR coherence and polarization rate manifest specific behaviors that can be exploited either for deepening the knowledge on the role of model parameters and identifying suitable time and space extends in which operate separate estimations of vegetation, soil moisture and soil roughness parameters. Identification and isolation of precipitation driven patterns, as long as the selection of homogeneous time spans and space regions is the basis for improving the capability of satellite based soil moisture retrieval models.

AB  - Documentation of Carry-Over Effects (COEs), defined as effects resulting from events that occurred in a previous time period, has largely been observational and understanding of specific mechanisms underlying COEs is still lacking. To investigate this, we simulated an environmental perturbation during the spring migration of a long-lived bird species and looked at the subsequent effects on various breeding parameters. We captured female greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) on their spring staging sites and maintained individuals in captivity for up to four days before releasing them. We re-observed females 3000 km North, on their Arctic breeding grounds, to estimate their breeding propensity (i.e., probability of initiating a reproductive event for a given year), and measure their arrival date, laying date, clutch size, and nesting success. Only proxies of breeding propensity were affected by our manipulation, which decreased as the time spent in captivity increased. However, females were able to overcome the effects of captivity in two out of the three years of experimentation with normal or good environmental conditions at the breeding site. When facing the additional challenge of poor environmental conditions, many individuals manipulated during migration apparently curtailed their reproductive effort by skipping breeding. This experiment is the first to show that breeding propensity is an important parameter affected by COEs resulting from stressful events prior to reproduction in long-lived species.

TI  - Rethinking the One: A.F. Losev and Twentieth-century European Henology
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The attention of modern philosophy to the ancient concept of the One has led to the emergence of an independent intellectual stream - henology. Although the concept came out from European studies, within Russian philosophy it is best developed by Alexey Losev, Losev characterized "The One" as fundamental category of philosophical knowledge. In this article analyzes the importance of the topic and pays attention to its value for modern ontology and the state of metaphysics in general. It is noted that the discussion of the Oneness is built around one aspect - the crisis of metaphysics and solutions to this problem. Due to the fundamentality of the question, it revolves around the figure of Plato and the Platonic philosophy, but goes different ways. It is noted that, on the one hand, apologists for the One find in Platonism new and valuable ways to justify the position on the impossibility of overcoming metaphysics - the apophatic henology. On the other hand, postmodernists criticise Plato for idealism and apology of hierarchical worldview. In this point of view, concept of the One closes to totalitarian mythologies. It is shown that the concept of henology is contradictory, there are several disputable positions about that. Some authors tend to understand the One only as radical structurally indistinguishable apophatic, others, following the tradition of Christian metaphysics, on the contrary, as a complex system of apophatic and cataphatic character. It is made the conclusion that the systems of henologists in the XX century are united by the attention to ontology in general. Henology thus unites in its dialogue european and russian thought, metaphysical and post-metaphysical, bringing back twentieth-century thinkers to contemplate the foundations of being.

TI  - Data from: Environmental drivers of population-level variation in the migratory and diving ontogeny of an Arctic top predator
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - The development of migratory strategies that enable juveniles to survive to recruitment is critical for species that exploit seasonal niches. For animals that forage via breath-hold diving this requires a combination of both physiological and foraging skill development. Here, we assess how migratory and dive behaviour develop over the first months of life for a migratory Arctic top predator, the harp seal, tracked using animal-borne satellite relay data loggers. We reveal similarities in migratory movements and differences in diving behaviour between juveniles from breeding populations in the Northwest Atlantic and Greenland Sea. In both regions, periods of resident and transient behaviour during migration were associated with proxies for food availability; sea ice concentration and water depth. However, while ontogenetic development of dive behaviour was similar for both groups of juveniles over the first 25 days, after this time Greenland Sea animals performed shorter and shallower dives and were more closely associated with sea ice than Northwest Atlantic animals. Together, these results highlight the role of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in shaping early-life behaviour. Differences in the environmental conditions experienced during early-life may shape how populations respond to the rapid changes occurring in the Arctic ocean ecosystem. This datafile contains the movement and dive dataused by Grecian et al. to examine the drivers of variation in the migratory and diving ontogeny of juvenile harp seals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim is to assess the state of ecological education in student youth and determine its relationship to the level of students' health.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The research was conducted on the basis ofthe Polissya National University (Zhytomyr, Ukraine) and the Sumy State Pedagogical University named after A.S. Makarenko (Sumy, Ukraine) in 2018-2020. The ascertaining experiment, which was conducted to assess the state of ecological education of students according to the questionnaire developed by us involved 503 students. The formative experiment aimed at studying the relationship between the level of ecological education and the level of students' health involved 59 students.RESULTS: Results: The ascertaining stage of the experiment showed that the vast majority of students of different specialties revealed a low level of mastery of the components of ecological education. The formative stage of the experiment showed that the EG students significantly improved the level of all components of ecological education, as well as the level of their health (p < 0.001). No significant changes were revealed in the CG (p > 0.05).CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The research showed that purposeful work on the formation of ecological education in the process of fitness and health recreation activities has a positive effect on all its components (knowledge, character building, worldview, culture) and the level of students' health. In general, it will help to improve the efficiency of the educational process of students, improve indicators of their life-sustaining and future professional activities..

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new methodological approach for analysing the impacts of climate change on the urban habitat and improving the quality of life for citizens. The study falls within the diagnostic phase of the Climate Change and Urban Health Resilience (CCUHRE) research project applied to the rationalist neighbourhood of Monticelli, a suburb of Ascoli Piceno (Italy). The methodological approach tests innovative and multidisciplinary cognitive tools to quantify the impacts of climate change and create refined risk maps combining remote sensing, spatial data, satellite images, and thermal fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. These tools created an atlas of green areas and surfaces using scientific indexes that describe the relationship between the urban form and heat and between the type of ground and materials. The information yielded by geoprocessing will allow critical aspects in the context to be addressed with site-specific strategies. In fact, through downscaling, it is possible to analyse the thermal fluid dynamics characteristics of the most significant urban areas and identify the related weather/climate characteristics, perceptual scenarios, and thermal stressed regions. The results have provided a dataset that defines the degree of vulnerability of the neighbourhood and identifies the areas exposed to thermal risk.

TI  - INTERPRETATION OF FATE AND GUILT IN ARMENIAN AND EUROPEAN EPICS
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of the current article is that, for the first time in the study, the issues of the relationship between fate and sin in European-Armenian heroic epics were analyzed using historical, comparative methods.Perceptions of both fate and guilt are quite different in French, German, Spanish and Armenian epics. This approach examines the works of epic heritage, not so much external plot similarities and differences but internal worldview perceptions.The purpose of the study is to reveal the internal commonalities and peculiarities between European and Armenian epics.As a result, the authors put forward the thesis that, in European epics, fate is alienated from a person and is personified in "Sasna Tsrer", it originates from the individual and returns to him and is not personified. As a result, in European epics, guilt is seen as a consequence of an act; in "Sasna Tsrer", guilt is a state that turns into a national destiny.

T2  - APPLIED IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR MORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PRAME (P Referentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma) is a tumor-associated antigen that was recently found to be expressed by malignant melanocytic lesions but not by benign ones, thus resulting useful in this diagnostic field. PRAME could also be expressed by some normal tissues and nonmelanocytic tumors, suggesting as caution should be adopted to use PRAME as a "pan-melanoma" marker for the differential diagnosis with other malignant tumors. Until now, PRAME expression was exclusively investigated through single staining with a monoclonal antibody targeting PRAME and with double staining for Melan A/PRAME found to be useful in specific diagnostic sets. Herein, we studied the expression of PRAME in 40 melanocytic lesions and 23 nonmelanocytic ones using PRAME, Melan A/PRAME, and novel double staining for HMB45/PRAME. Although our results need to be validated, they support the adoption of HMB45/PRAME, alone or in combination with PRAME and Melan A/PRAME, as a helpful marker in the diagnosis of melanocytic neoplasms with a high concordance rate between primary melanoma and corresponding metastases.

T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article reconstructs the philosophical dialogue between B. P. Vysheslavtsev and L. N. Tolstoy. Since the beliefs of these thinkers on philosophical, legal, religious and socio-economic issues are at first glance opposite, the article examines both their differences and their similarities. It looks at the texts in which Tolstoy is mentioned, analyses the context and identifies a number of ideas that could help in studying the worldview of both philosophers and the problems that they raise. At first glance, Tolstoy's themes in works of Vysheslavtsev are concentrated in the field of philosophy of law, but a deeper discussion allows us to see that these themes have religious motives. The article also investigates the significance of the figure of P. I. Novgorodtsev in the formation of Vysheslavtsev as a dialectic. The philosopher draws a monumental image of Tolstoy, at the same time noting the naivety of his decisions and trying to comprehend the objective reasons for his rebellion. In this regard, the reasons for the uprising of Vysheslavtsev himself, who actively opposed all kinds of totalitarianism and violent social actions, become more understandable and justified. In his opinion, power can only be justified by a transition to a completely different existential state, that is, into a state of relative anarchy. Such a state of socio-political structures is "law" and "democracy" (a phenomenon opposite to "dictatorship"). Vysheslavtsev reflects on the antinomy of the absolute and the relative and concludes that the absolute can be realised in the relative only in relative forms. However, the absolute is not only an idea that drives a person on the path of self-improvement and social development, but also the highest element of human nature, on the basis of which, according to the Christian promise, the divine dispensation of life is formed. The realisation of the idea of personal morality requires a properly organised state. Such a state, in his opinion, is quite possible. However, analysing the complexity of his times, summing up the results of the last period of the development of industrial culture (the 1950s), the philosopher declares a very disappointing result, which, however, does not deprive him of optimism about the ways of finding new constructive solutions.

TI  - Soviet Secularisation: the Experience of the Old Believers in Eastern Latvia
T2  - HISTORICKA SOCIOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides the first overview on Soviet secularisation and the response of priest-less Old Believers in Latvia. Unlike Russia, Latvian Old Believers had the experience of longterm living in democracy before they were incorporated in the Soviet system. This fact played a crucial role in the strategies of preserving religiosity under atheism. The studied oral life-stories demonstrate that the majority of Old Believers chose living a double life of a trustworthy Soviet citizen in public and a devoted follower of the faith in private. Overcoming restrictions in social career, education and personal realisation allowed passing the religious traditions to the further generations. At the same time, the lack of systematic religious practice and all-round social pressure contributed to the diminution of the role of religion in people's life and their worldview.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Properties for Near-Real-Time Applications Using the Metop Series of Satellites: Concept, Detailed Description, and First Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Polar Multi-Sensor Aerosol product (PMAp) is based on the synergistic use of three instruments from the Metop platform, GOME-2, AVHRR, and IASI. The retrieval algorithm includes three major steps: a pre-identification of the aerosol class, a selection of the aerosol model, and a calculation of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). This paper provides a detailed description of the PMAp retrieval, which combines information provided by the three instruments. The retrieved AOD is qualitatively evaluated, and a good temporal as well as spatial performance is observed, including for the transition between ocean and land. More quantitatively, the performance is evaluated by comparison to AERONET in situ measurements. Very good consistency is also observed when compared to other space-based data such as MODIS or VIIRS. The paper demonstrates the ability of this first generation of synergistic products to derive reliable AOD, opening the door for the development of synergistic products from the instruments to be embarked on the coming Metop Second Generation platform. PMAp has been operationally distributed in near-real-time since 2014 over ocean, and 2016 over land.

TI  - The human conscience between witnessing and discernment: Heidegger, Ricoeur and beyond
T2  - SCIENTIA ET FIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the problem of human conscience as an attentional mode of being that effectuates an original capacity for discernment. Such an undertaking, after the necessary terminological and phenomenological clarifications, requires one to cope with its specific background, especially the critique of the moral worldview and the postmetaphysical setting of contemporary thinking. Taking into consideration the Heideggerian view of the matter, I reflect on the doubts Ricoeur addressed to the former, and take advantage of Ricoeur's early philosophy to reinterpret and develop his own stance as expounded in Oneself as Another. His later work on ideology and utopia may contribute to helping to establish some criteria for the functioning of the conscience.

TI  - Impact of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy on Treatment Decision and Survival in Patients Aged ≥70 Years with Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Study
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Whether sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed in patients >= 70 years old with early-stage invasive breast cancer is controversial. We examined the effect of sentinel lymph node biopsy on the treatment and outcomes in this population. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, patients aged >= 70 years who were treated for invasive breast cancer with sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by mastectomy or lumpectomy between 2010 and 2019 were identified from our database. Patients were compared according to sentinel lymph node status. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox multivariate analysis. Results: Of the 376 patients enrolled in this study, 311 (82.7%) were sentinel lymph node-negative and 65 (17.3%) were sentinel lymph node-positive. The median follow-up duration for all patients was 70 months. Systemic treatment and radiation were similar between sentinel lymph node-negative and -positive groups. Disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, overall survival were not significantly different between groups (88.2% vs 87.6%, 96.7% vs 94.8%, 96.2% vs 93.6%, and 93.5% vs 90.0%, respectively). Sentinel lymph node status, tumor size, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and adjuvant radiation were included in Cox multivariate analysis. None of the variables were found to significantly affect disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. Conclusions: Our analysis indicated that sentinel lymph node status may not affect systemic treatment decisions or survival in patients aged >= 70 years with breast cancer.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Estimate Maize Lodging Area With PolSAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing crop lodging at the regional scale is an important requirement for breeding lodging-resistant varieties and harvest planning. Accurately and continuously estimating crop lodging area from remote sensing data remains challenging due to the high randomness scattering signal of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and the insufficient number of applicable optical images. This study developed a new framework for estimating crop lodging area based on SAR data using the spatial aggregation approach of field units, overcoming the deficit of the traditional pixel-based approach susceptible to speckle noise and spatial heterogeneity. We aggregated the field's pixel in SAR images using the spatial aggregation approach. The lodging area estimation models of dual- pol and quad- pol were established using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The Sobol approach evaluated the uncertainty and sensitivity at a regional scale. Finally, we analyzed the scattering mechanisms of the lodging field. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves the high performance of the lodging area estimates at the regional scale, in the testing set, with R-2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) model being 0.57 and 18.63%, respectively, and the Sentinel-1 model is 0.49 and 20.59%. Besides, the uncertainties of models are below 10% and are insensitive to the variation of parameters intercorrelation. The depolarization effect and scattering randomness gradually weaken with the increase of lodging percentages. In contrast, the surface scattering quickly increases and finally dominates the total scattering after lodging percentages greater than 80%. This proposed approach would help develop a real-time crop lodging monitoring system using SAR data.

TI  - Updated Surge-Type Glacier Inventory in the West kunlun mountains, Tibetan Plateau, and Implications for Glacier Change
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surging is a dynamic instability that affects the flow of some glaciers, modifying the glacier area, surface velocity, and surface elevation. It is also among the major causes of ice dams and glacier lake floods. Previous studies have shown that in the West Kunlun Mountains) (WKM) where a cluster of surge-type glaciers had been found, the glaciers were relatively stable in recent years. Nevertheless, the surge cycle and its impact on glacier changes on a regional scale are poorly understood. In this study, we updated the surge-type glacier inventory of the WKM using the detailed changes in glacier length, surface velocity, and surface elevation during the 1972-2020 period using 78 Landsat optical images, 86 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and three digital elevation models of the WKM. The updated results show that among the 423 glaciers in the WKM, 10 are confirmed as surge-type glaciers, three are likely surge-type glaciers, and five are possible surge-type glaciers. Furthermore, these 18 glaciers account for 63% of the total glacier area. During the period analyzed, there were marked changes in the lengths, areas and surface elevations of all surge-type glaciers, while those of the non-surge-type glaciers were relatively stable. These results appear to indicate that the observed regional trends of glaciers in the WKM recently may be related to the existence of surge-type glaciers. Furthermore, the surge-type glacier underwent advance after accelerating for 3-4 years, which could be used to forecast when glacier termini may advance and avoid the possible catastrophic damages.Plain Language Summary Glacier surging is a form of irregular motion of a glacier, which rapidly transports a volume of ice, followed by a longer slowdown period. In this study, we employed a vast archive of optical and synthetic aperture radar satellite images to monitor the glaciers change in the West Kunlun Mountains (WKM). The results revealed the existence of 18 surge-type glaciers (10 confirmed, 3 likely, and 5 possible) which accounted for 63% of the total area in the WKM. Furthermore, non-surge-type glaciers experienced little changes in recent decades, while surge-type glaciers showed large ice loss. The existence of surge-type glaciers may affect the assessment of glacier change in this region.

T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article is devoted to the study of the artistic originality of the lyrical cycles of travels in the works of V. Gadaev. The analyzed scientific problem fits into the complex of studies of domestic literary' criticism concerning the issues of genre synthesis. The subject of the analysis is the problem-thematic and compositional features of the lyrical cycles of travels of V. Gadaev.Objective: to identify the poetic features of the lyrical cycles of travels in the works of the modem poet of Mordovia V. Gadaev.Research materials: travel cycles written by V. Gadaev: "The Crimean Paradise" , The Black Sea","Hills and Castles" and "In Poland''.Results and novelty of the research: today in Russian-speaking poetry of Mordovia the lyrical travel cycle is becoming one of the significant forms reflecting the main trends of the modern poetic process. In the works of V. Gadaev a complex compositional structure of cycles marked by the presence of a real geographical route, the image of a traveler, comprehending the cultural and historical atmosphere of the visited country/city, reflects the system of the author's worldview. The opposition "the native - the foreign" becomes the plot-forming beginning of his works, where the image of the Mordovian region turns out to be the semantic artistic center. Continuing the traditions of Russian classical poetry, V. Gadaev creates lyrical travel cycles about Crimea, in which not only its cultural. historical and geographical space is mythologized. but also the Cimmerian myth is reinterpreted, where the image of a small motherland, Mordovia, is projected onto Voloshin's image of Koktebel. The distinctive feature of the cycles of travels inspired by the trips to European countries is the comprehension not of the specific sights of countries, but of its historical past; the motif of memory, retrospection does not allow the hero-traveler to fully enjoy the modem cultural and historical image of the country. In the cycle devoted to the East, the dominant role of the travel route is lost: the "Eastern" dominant becomes a mean of finding both the spiritual path of the lyrical hero and the projection on the understanding of the role of a working man in the history of his country.

AB  - The purpose of this article is related to the study of the ideas of the modern Christian theologian Richard Swinburne; in addition, attention is drawn to the fundamentals of the new theistic cosmology proposed by the theologian. The author mainly focused on studying the most general provisions of the Christian religious-theological paradigm developed by Swinburne. The author was also interested in identifying and interpreting the problem of a convincing justification of faith. The main result of the study of the problem was the conclusion that the idea of a new theistic cosmology developed by the theologian is carried out by Richard Swinburne from the standpoint of probabilism, based on the selection of inductive evidence for the existence of God; all this should ultimately demonstrate the proper likelihood of the central position of the religious worldview - "God exists."

TI  - Agricultural plant cataloging and establishment of a data framework from UAV-based crop images by computer vision
T2  - GIGASCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based image retrieval in modern agriculture enables gathering large amounts of spatially referenced crop image data. In large-scale experiments, however, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a complex canopy architecture. Especially for the observation of temporal effects, this complicates the recognition of individual plants over several images and the extraction of relevant information tremendously.Results In this work, we present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial identification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as "cataloging" based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the workflow on 2 real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of Cercospora leaf spot-a fungal disease-in sugar beet over an entire growing cycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The plant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over multiple time points. This gathers a large-scale spatiotemporal image dataset that in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including various data layers.Conclusion The presented approach improves analysis and interpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly. By validation with some reference data, our method shows an accuracy that is similar to more complex deep learning-based recognition techniques. Our workflow is able to automatize plant cataloging and training image extraction, especially for large datasets.

AB  - In this work we analyse how training datasize affects the ability of a deep neural network to deal with noisy training labels in a semantic segmentation task with labels from Open-StreetMap. To this end, several versions of the training set were created by introducing varying amounts of label noise, and a model was then trained on subsets of varying size of these versions. The results indicate that the relationship between noise level and model performance is largely independent of the datasize except for very small datasizes where adding label noise has an even more deteriorating effect than usual.

AB  - This case study evaluates the seasonal variability of the Pearson's linear correlation coefficient of land surface temperature (LST) with some spectral indices like NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, and NDBaI by using a series of Landsat images for 1991-92, 1995-96, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2014-15, and 2018-19. The results from the average correlation of the entire period of all-season show that the LST builds a positive correlation with NDBI (0.71) and NDBaI (0.52) while it builds a negative correlation with NDVI (-0.44). The LST-NDWI correlation is insignificant. The best correlation is noticed in the post-monsoon period, while the least correlation is observed in the winter season. This study can support the environmental planning to build a sustainable city under a similar environment. (c) 2021 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

AB  - With the accelerating of urbanization, the impact of urban heat island effect on vegetation phenology is receiving more attention. MODIS data and products (MOD11A2, MCD12Q2, MOD13Q1) were used in combination with other related data to analyze the urban heat island effect and spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of vegetation phenology in the Urumqi-Changji, Shihezi-Manas, and Wusu-Kramay-Kuidun regions. In addition, the major urban clusters of the Tianshan Northslope Economic Belt and the relationship between them were analyzed. The results of the study show that the urban heat island intensity (UHII) was most pronounced in the Urumqi-Changji region among the three major urban agglomerations, with a range of 0.39-2.49 degrees C. The overall performance show that the heat island intensity at night was higher than that during the day. The vegetation phenology distribution along the urban-rural gradient direction showed obvious differences. Start of growing season (SOS) was earlier, end of growing season (EOS) was later, and the vegetation growth season (GSL) was longer in urban than in suburban and rural areas. Among them, the vegetation in the Urumqi. Changji region had the earliest SOS, the latest EOS, and the longest GSL. The vegetation distribution phenology along the urban. rural gradient was significantly correlated with UHII, which showed a significant negative correlation with Delta SOS and a high positive correlation with Delta EOS and Delta GSL. The effect of UHII on vegetation phenology was more obvious at night. The results of this study are helpful in understanding the influence of vegetation phenology on urban heat island effect along the urban-rural gradient in the Tianshan Northslope Economic Belt and can also provide a theoretical basis and reference for improving the ecological environment of urban clusters in this economic zone.

TI  - Research funding for male reproductive health and infertility in the UK and USA [2016 - 2019]

AB  - There is a paucity of data on research funding levels for male reproductive health (MRH). We investigated the research funding for MRH and infertility by examining publicly accessible webdatabasesfrom the UK and USA government funding agencies. Information on the funding wascollected from the UKRI-GTR, the NIHR's Open Data Summary, and the USA's NIH RePORT webdatabases.Funded projects between January 2016 and December 2019 were recorded andfunding support was divided into three research categories: (i) male-based; (ii) female-based;and (iii) not-specified. Between January 2016 and December 2019, UK agencies awarded a totalof 11,767,190 to 18 projects for male-based research and 29,850,945 to 40 projects forfemale-based research. There was no statistically significant difference in the median fundinggrant awarded within the male-based and female-based categories (p=0.56, W=392). The USA NIH funded 76 projects totalling $59,257,746 for male-based research and 99 projects totalling$83,272,898 for female-based research Again, there was no statistically significant difference inthe median funding grant awarded between the two research categories (p=0.83, W=3834).This is the first study examining funding granted by main government research agencies fromthe UK and USA for MRH. These results should stimulate further discussion of the challenges oftackling male infertility and reproductive health disorders and formulating appropriate investmentstrategies. When going through the excel sheets: For the UK, the data collection was divided between UKRI-GTR and NIHR as they used different databases, and reported different Project IDs/Reference values for an individual to look up. The funding awarded for UKRI project MR/N022556/1 is for a Core centre rather than an individual project. EG and CB have decided to include it because it would entail that the funding received to run the MRC core centre will go into supporting active projects ran by the group of researchers. Thus, will go into furthering infertility and reproductive health research. For the USA, an additional column was added: The Last Fiscal Year of Funding Reported. Since the data collection period ran between October 2020 to December 2020, and for a brief time in January 2021, there are several projects that are active and have incomplete funding due to the nature of how the US reports their funding activity and division of their Fiscal Year. Thus, those projects that were found as currently 'active' at the time of data collection and analysis (between December 2020 to early February 2021) had their most recent awarding fiscal yearfor that project added (shown in the RePORTER database). Once the data analysis was performed, the datasets/datasheet was updated to see if the currently active projects had updated their funding. We only included the firstproject reference ID of the research study. The funding periods/fiscal years were added to the scripts used for the data analysis. The .txt files were used in the statistical analyses and plot production. The files were imported to RStudio using the Import Datasetwith the "from Text (read)" function. When importing all .txt files, the Delimiter was set to Tab. For the UKdata_for_plots and USdata_for_plots files, thecolumns were set to be the following: 'Type' was set asFactor and waslisted as: 'Male-based, Female-based, Not-Specified' The 'Funding Period' / 'Fiscal Year' was set asCharacter The 'Funds' was set as Numeric For the UKdata_for_stats_tests and USdata_for_stats_tests .txt files, the three columns (male, female, and not-specified) were all set asNumeric. Experimental Design: Publicly accessible UK Research and Innovation (UKRI),National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), andNational Institutes of Health (NIH) funding agency databases covering awards from January 2016 toDecember 2019 were examined (see SupplementaryTable 1). Following the inclusion and exclusion criteriaoutlined within Supplementary Tables 2,3, fundingdata were collected on research proposals investigatinginfertility and reproductive health. For simplicity,these are referred to collectively as 'infertility research'.As the primary focus of this research is on infertility,the data were divided into three main categories: (i)male-based, (ii) female-based, and (iii) not-specified(Supplementary Table 2). The first two groups coveredprojects whose primary aim, based on the informationpresented in the research abstracts, timeline summariesand/or impact statements, was male- or female-focussed."Not-specified" includes research projectsthat have either not specified a primary focus towardseither male or female or have explicitly stated a focuson both. The process was conducted and reviewed byE.G. with C.L.R.B. Total funding for all three groups,funding over time, and comparison with overall fundingfor a particular agency was examined.Briefly, E.G. retrieved the primary data and producedthe first set of data for discussion with C.L.R.B.Both went through the complete list and discussedeach study/project and decided whether: (a) it should be included or not, and (b) what category does it fellunder (male-, female-, or not-specified). The abstracts,which were almost always available and provided byeach research study, were all examined and scrutinisedby both E.G. and C.L.R.B together. If there was cleardisagreement between E.G. and C.L.R.B, which werevery rare, the project would not be included. UK Data Collection: From April 2018 the UK research councils, Innovate UK, and Research England are reported under one organization, the UKRI (2019). The councils independently fund research projects according to their respective visions and missions; however, until 2018/19, their annual funding expenditures were reported under the UKRI's annual reports and budgets. The UKRI's Gateway to Research (UKRI-GTR) web database allows users to analyse the information provided on taxpayer-funded research. Relevant search terms such as "male infertility" or "female reproductive health" (see Supplementary Table 2) were applied with appropriate database filters (Supplementary Table 1). The project award relevance was determined by assessing the objectives in project abstracts, timeline summaries, and planned impacts. Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 3 provide the search filters and the reference criteria for inclusion/exclusion utilized for analysis. The UKRI-GTR provides the total funding granted to the projects within a designated period. Data obtained from the NIHR had minor differences. The NIHR has 6 datasets. The Open Data Summary View dataset was used as it provided details on funded projects, grants, summary abstracts, and project dates. Like the UKRI data, the NIHR excel datasheet had specific search terms and filters applied to sift out irrelevant projects (Supplementary Tables 1-3). The UKRI councils and NIHR report their annual expenditure and budgets for 1st April to 31st March. Thus, the projects will fall under the funding period of when their research activities begin (e.g. if a project's research activities undergo between May 20th, 2017, to March 20th, 2019, this project will be categorized under the funding period 2017/18). The projects collected would begin their investigations between January 2016 to December 2019, therefore 5 consecutive funding periods were examined (2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20).The UK data collection period ran between October 2020 to December 2020. USA Data Collection: The NIH has a research portfolio online operating tools sites (RePORT) providing access to their research activities, such as previously funded research, active research projects, and information on NIH's annual expenditures. The RePORT-Query database has similar features as the UKRI-GTR and NIHR such as providing information on project abstracts, research impact, start- and end-dates, funding grants, and type of research. Like the UK data collection, appropriate search terms were inputted with the database filters applied and followed the same inclusion-exclusion criteria (Supplementary Tables 1, 2, and 3). The UK and US agencies present data on funded research under different calendar and funding periods because the US' federal tax policy requires federal bodies to report all funding expenses under a fiscal year (FY). The NIH's FY follows a calendar period from October 1st to September 30th (e.g., FY2016 comprises funding activity from October 1st, 2015, to September 30th, 2016). Projects running over one calendar period are reported several times under consecutive fiscal years and the funds are divided according to the annual period of the project's activity. During data collection, 74 projects were found as active with incomplete funding sums as the NIH divides the grants according to the budgeting period of every FY. The NIH are in the process of granting funds for the FY2021, so projects ending in 2020 or 2021 provide a complete funding sum. For the active projects ending after 2021, incomplete funding data is provided. It is assumed the funding will increase in value by the time the research ends in the future, but the final awarded sum is unknown. To remain consistent with the UK data, projects granted funding are totalled as one figure and recorded under the FY the project first began research, whether they are active or completed. Thus US funding is referred to as "Current Total Funding". When going through the REPORTER database, the NIH present the same research project multiple times for every funded fiscal year with consecutive project reference IDs. Therefore, for simplicity, we only included the first project reference ID.For more information on deciphering NIH's project's IDs, see https://era.nih.gov/files/Deciphering_NIH_Application.pdf. For the USA, the initial data collection period ran between October 2020 to December 2020 but then restarted for a brief period in January 2021 to add up the remainingfunding values for some ofthe active research projects. Data Analysis: The data was divided into three main groups and organized into the funding period or FY the project was first awarded.R-Studio (Version 1.3.1093) was utilized for the data analysis. Box-and-whisker plots are presented with rounded P-values. Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were generated to assess any statistical significance. The data was independently collected and does not assume a normal distribution, so the rank-based, non-parametric tests such as the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank Sum were used. Research Project Details Included in the Collection Datasets: For both, the UK and USA data, we included the following details: The project (or study) titles The Project IDs (also referred to as Project Reference or Project Number) The project Start and End Dates The project's Status (identified by the end dates or if explicitly stated in the database) The Funding Organisation (for the UK) and Admin Institute (for the USA) that are funding the research The project Category (i.e. Research Grants or Fellowships) The Amount Granted (for the USA, the funding values were summed up to the most recent awarding date). Rearranging/Processing Data for Analysis: After the data collection has been completed, the data was processed into a simpler format in Notepadin order to perform the statistical analyses using RStudio. For that, only the essential details were included and organisedthat the RStudio system would recognise and analyse the information effectively and efficiently.The project Type (male, female or not-specifieded), funding sum for the respective research project Type, and the funding period (UK) /FY(USA) were included. These details were then arranged appropriately toproduce box-and-whisker plots with P-values, perform the chosen statistical analysis tests, and produce thedata statistics in RStudio. As mentioned earlier, the funding period/fiscal years were added following the timeframes set out by the respective countries. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

TI  - Assessing potential locations for flood-based farming using satellite imagery: a case study of Afar region, Ethiopia
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dry lowlands of Ethiopia are seasonally affected by long periods of low rainfall and, coinciding with rainfall in the Amhara highlands, flood waters which flow onto the lowlands resulting in damage to landscapes and settlements. In an attempt to convert water from storm generated floods into productive use, this study proposes a methodology using remote sensing data and geographical information system tools to identify potential sites where flood spreading weirs may be installed and farming systems developed which produce food and fodder for poor rural communities. First, land use land cover maps for the study area were developed using Landsat-8 and MODIS temporal data. Sentinel-1 data at 10 and 20 m resolution on a 12-day basis were then used to determine flood prone areas. Slope and drainage maps were derived from Shuttle RADAR Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model at 90 m spatial resolution. Accuracy assessment using ground survey data showed that overall accuracies (correctness) of the land use/land cover classes were 86% with kappa 0.82. Coinciding with rainfall in the uplands, March and April are the months with flood events in the short growing season (belg) and June, July and August have flood events during the major (meher) season. In the Afar region, there is potentially >0.55 m ha land available for development using seasonal flood waters from belg or meher seasons. During the 4 years of monitoring (2015-2018), a minimum of 142,000 and 172,000 ha of land were flooded in the belg and meher seasons, respectively. The dominant flooded areas were found in slope classes of <2% with spatial coverage varying across the districts. We concluded that Afar has a huge potential for flood-based technology implementation and recommend further investigation into the investments needed to support new socio-economic opportunities and implications for the local agro-pastoral communities.

TI  - Sea Surface Wind Direction Retrieval Based on Convolution Neural Network and Wavelet Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface wind streak is one of many geophysical phenomena in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which is often used to obtain sea surface wind direction. At present, the recognition of wind streaks mainly depends on artificial experience, and the recognition efficiency and accuracy are not high. In this article, the transfer learning based convolutional neural network architecture of Inception v3 was introduced to the recognition of sea surface wind streaks. Four categories of geophysical phenomena imaged by Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR from 2019 to 2020 were chosen for retraining of the full pre-retrained Inception v3 model. Then, we use the retrained model to identify the wind streak of GF-3 in 2018 and use it to retrieve the sea surface wind direction. The results show that the transfer learning method is effective. The recognition accuracy of the model can reach 92.0% and 95.2% after data is augmented. Compared with the reanalysis data of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the root-mean-square error of the retrieved wind direction is 9.12 degrees, which further verifies the ability of the training model to identify wind streaks.

AB  - Ship detection in remote sensing images is important for maritime surveillance. With the rapid development of earth observation technology, high-resolution imaging satellites can provide more observational information. In the face of massive remote sensing data, object-level annotation requires a lot of time and manpower. Weakly supervised object detection is trained using only image-level annotations, thus reducing the requirement for object-level annotations. However, there are still some problems in the detection of weakly supervised ships in remote sensing images, because of the complex, dense distribution and diverse scale characteristics of the ship environment. We propose a weakly supervised object detection method that combines Transformer with weakly supervised learning for ship detection in remote sensing images. First, Proposal Clustering Learning (PCL) for weakly supervised object detection is used as the baseline to detect ships, and the network is continuously refined for better detection performance. Second, the prior location and size information is added to the features of the proposal through the transformer module. These additional information can be used as an important basis for judging whether the proposal is optimal, thereby improving the detection performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on a complex dataset of large-scene remote sensing ships. Experimental results show that our method achieves better detection performance than other methods.

TI  - A Flexible Object-Level Processing Strategy to Enhance the Weight Function-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion technique provides a cost-efficient way to achieve dense time series observation. Among all categories of spatiotemporal fusion methods, the weight function-based method attracted considerable attention. However, this kind of method selects similar pixels in a regular window without considering the distribution of features, which will weaken its ability to preserve the structure information. Besides, the weight function-based method carries out pixel-by-pixel fusion computation, which leads to computational inefficiency. To solve the aforementioned issues, a flexible object-level (OL) processing strategy is proposed in this article. Three popular spatiotemporal fusion methods include the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the enhance STARFM (ESTARFM) and the three-step method (Fit-FC) were selected as examples to analyze and validate the effectiveness of the OL processing strategy. Four study sites with different surface landscapes and change patterns were adopted for experiments. Experimental results indicated that the OL fusion versions of STARFM, ESTARFM, and Fit-FC can better preserve the structural information, and were 102.89-113.71, 92.77-115.73, and 30.51-36.15 times faster than their original methods. Remarkably, the OL fusion versions of Fit-FC outperform all competing methods in one-pair case fusion experiments, especially in Poyang lake wetland (PY) area (root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.0343 versus 0.0380, correlation coefficient ( r ) is 0.7469 versus 0.6986 compare with Fit-FC). Additionally, the OL processing strategy can also be adopted to enhance other methods which use the principle of combining similar adjacent information.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - With the increasing demand of observation, multi-source remote sensing data has been widely used. Hyperspectral Images (HSI) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have shown the great potential in land cover classification. However, the redundant information of multi-source data influences the effectiveness of heterogeneous data features, which reduces the accuracy of joint classification. To tackle this problem, a dual graph convolution joint dense networks is proposed for HSI and LiDAR classification. In this method, a dual graph convolution network (GCN)is extracted the spectral feature from euclidean graph and cosine graph, which contains the spectrum absolute and relative differences. A dense network is employed to acquire spatial feature from LiDAR data. Finally, a fully connected network fuses the spectral and spatial feature for classification. Experiments conducted on the Huston dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on joint classification.

TI  - Performance of deep learning in mapping water quality of Lake Simcoe with long-term Landsat archive
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides full-coverage and dynamic water quality monitoring with high efficiency and low consumption. Deep learning (DL) has been progressively used in water quality retrieval because it efficiently captures the potential relationship between target variables and imagery. In this study, the multimodal deep learning (MDL) models were developed and rigorously validated using atmospherically corrected Landsat remote sensing reflectance data and synchronous water quality measurements for estimating long-term Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) in Lake Simcoe, Canada. Since TP and TN are non optically active, their retrievals were based on the fact that they are closely related to the optically active constituents (OACs) such as Chl-a. We trained the MDL models with one in-situ measured data set (for Chl-a, N = 315, for TP and TN, N = 303), validated the models with two independent data sets (N = 147), and compared the model performances with several DL, machine learning, and empirical algorithms. The results indicated that the MDL models adequately estimated Chl-a (mean absolute error (MAE) = 32.57%, Bias = 10.61%), TP (MAE = 42.58%, Bias =-2.82%), and TN (MAE = 35.05%, Bias = 13.66%), and outperformed several other candidate algorithms, namely the progressively decreasing deep neural network (DNN), a DNN with trainable parameters similar to MDL but without splitting input features, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting, the support vector regression, the NASA Ocean Color two-band and three-band ratio algorithms, and another empirical algorithm of Landsat data in clear lakes. Using the MDL models, we reconstructed the historical spatiotemporal patterns of Chl-a, TP, and TN in Lake Simcoe since 1984, and investigated the effects of two water quality improvement programs. In addition, the physical mechanism and interpretability of the MDL models were explored by quantifying the contribution of each feature to the model outputs. The framework proposed in this study provides a practical method for long-term Chl-a, TP, and TN estimation at the regional scale.

TI  - Assessing Snow Phenology and Its Environmental Driving Factors in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important water source and even an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Assessing snow phenology and its driving factors in Northeast China will help with comprehensively understanding the role of snow cover in regional water cycle and climate change. This study presents spatiotemporal variations in snow phenology and the relative importance of potential drivers, including climate, geography, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), based on the MODIS snow products across Northeast China from 2001 to 2018. The results indicated that the snow cover days (SCD), snow cover onset dates (SCOD) and snow cover end dates (SCED) all showed obvious latitudinal distribution characteristics. As the latitude gradually increases, SCD becomes longer, SCOD advances and SCED delays. Overall, there is a growing tendency in SCD and a delayed trend in SCED across time. The variations in snow phenology were driven by mean temperature, followed by latitude, while precipitation, aspect and slope all had little effect on the SCD, SCOD and SCED. With decreasing temperature, the SCD and SCED showed upward trends. The mean temperature has negatively correlation with SCD and SCED and positively correlation with SCOD. With increasing latitude, the change rate of the SCD, SCOD and SCED in the whole Northeast China were 10.20 d/degree, -3.82 d/degree and 5.41 d/degree, respectively, and the change rate of snow phenology in forested areas was lower than that in nonforested areas. At the same latitude, the snow phenology for different underlying surfaces varied greatly. The correlations between the snow phenology and NDVI were mainly positive, but weak correlations accounted for a large proportion.

TI  - Unsupervised Domain-Invariant Feature Learning for Cloud Detection of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of clouds in remote sensing (RS) images is an important task, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to perform it. However, supervised cloud detection CNNs rely heavily on a large number of samples annotated at pixel level to tune their parameter. Annotating RS images is a labor-intensive procedure and requires expert-level human knowledge. To reduce the labeling cost, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach to enable the model trained on labeled source satellite images to generalize to unlabeled target satellite images. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained feature alignment (FGFA) domain adaptation strategy that encourages a cloud detection network to extract domain-invariant representations, which improves the accuracy of cloud detection in unlabeled target satellite images. The proposed FGFA strategy consists of two steps: 1) fine-grained class-relevant feature selection based on an attention-guided mechanism and 2) class-relevant feature alignment (FA) based on a proposed grouped FA approach. Experimental results on the "Landsat-8 -> ZY-3" and "GF-1 -> ZY-3" domain adaptation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority to existing state-of-the-art UDA approaches.

TI  - Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cloud Detection Based on Grouped Features Alignment and Entropy Minimization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cloud detection methods are built upon the supervised learning framework that requires a large number of pixel-level labels. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to manually annotate pixelwise labels for massive remote sensing images. To reduce the labeling cost, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach to generalize the model trained on labeled images of source satellite to unlabeled images of the target satellite. To effectively address the domain shift problem on cross-satellite images, we develop a novel UDA method based on grouped features alignment (GFA) and entropy minimization (EM) to extract domain-invariant representations to improve the cloud detection accuracy of cross-satellite images. The proposed UDA method is evaluated on "Landsat-8 -> ZY-3" and "GF-1 -> ZY-3" domain adaptation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art UDA approaches. The code of this paper has been made available online (https://github.com/nkszjx/grouped-features-alignment).

TI  - Percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound for localization and qualitative diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes in cutaneous malignant melanoma of lower extremities: a preliminary study
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To explore the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracing by percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (pCEUS) in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) and the ability to enhance patterns of SLNs in diagnosing lymph nodes (LNs) metastases.Methods: Fifty-three patients with CMM of the lower extremities treated at our hospital were included in the study. All the participants received pCEUS preoperatively. The enhanced lymphatic channels (LCs) and associated SLNs were observed and tracked in real-time. The number of enhanced LCs and enhancing patterns of SLNs were recorded. Subsequently, SLNs localized by pCEUS were pathologically examined.Results: Of the 53 cases, SLNs were successfully localized by pCEUS in 48 cases. In total, there were 59 detected SLNs averaging 1.23 +/- 0.42 SLNs per case. The main lymphatic drainage patterns (LDPs) were the following: one enhanced LC pointed to one or more than one SLN, and multiple enhanced LCs pointed to one or multiple SLNs. There were four enhancing patterns of SLNs (uniform, annular, uneven, and no enhancement), among which the first two were considered benign nodes, while the latter two were considered metastatic nodes. With pathological results as the gold standard, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity by pCEUS were 90.9% and 75.0%, respectively.Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) is a feasible approach for SLN identification in patients with CMIVI of the lower extremities. Enhancing patterns of SLNs may help predict metastasizing SLNs. This novel method may be a promising technique for clinical application.

TI  - A Deep Learning Model for Green Algae Detection on SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a textural-enhanced deep learning (DL) model based on the classic U-net framework for green algae detection in Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Four special modifications are made in the framework: texture-fused input dataset, texture concatenation to effectively use the texture information, weighted loss function to settle the imbalance of algae-seawater samples, and an attention module to facilitate model focus on the discriminative features efficiently. To build the proposed model, we collected 119 Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired in the Yellow Sea and manually labeled 8441 samples, among which 4421/1896/2124 were used as the training/validation/testing dataset, respectively. Experiments show that the classification achieves the mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 86.31%, outperforming previous DL methods. Furthermore, each modification is effective, and the weighted loss function plays the most critical role. Moreover, we monitored green tide in the Yellow Sea from 2019 to 2021 using the proposed model and analyzed the relationship between green tide interannual variation and two primary environmental factors: nitrate concentration and sea surface temperature (SST). The interannual variation is characterized via three crucial indexes: bloom duration, coverage area, and nearshore damage. The detection results reveal that the bloom duration is the longest (shortest) in 2019 (2020), corresponding to the biggest (smallest) coverage area in 2019 (2020). In addition, the nearshore damage is the heaviest (lightest) in 2021 (2020). We also found that the interannual variation of green tide scales is partly related to the available nitrate concentration and SST variation in algae-distributed regions.

TI  - Comparison of Multiple Scatterer Detection Methods in Differential SAR Tomography
T2  - SEVENTH ASIA PACIFIC CONFERENCE ON OPTICS MANUFACTURE (APCOM 2021)

CP  - 7th Asia Pacific Conference on Optics Manufacture (APCOM)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography is a technique that offers new perspectives in the 4-D reconstruction (3-D spatial information plus deformation information), particularly, of urban areas. SAR tomography allows resolving layovers by handle the situation where multiple scatterers exist within a resolution cell. The detection of scatterers is however a critical and challenging issue. Single scatterers can be simply detected by the amplitude dispersion method, but it does not meet the application needs of urban buildings. In this paper, we study a variety of methods for scatterer detection in differential SAR Tomography. We mainly investigate three detection approaches based on signal estimation and detection: sequential generalized likelihood ratio test (SGLRT), sup-GLRT, and fast-sup-GLRT. Firstly, theoretical performances of each method are analyzed in details. Secondly, experimental validation is carried out through simulation data and real data from TerraSAR-X satellite corresponding to a building-North Star Times Tower in Beijing, China. Finally, we compared the signal detecting based methods involved in this paper, with the compressed sensing (CS) methods (e.g., regularized orthogonal matching pursuit (ROMP) and L-1-norm regularization). The results demonstrate that the CS methods achieve only the spatial information of the scatterers, whereas the signal detecting based methods are capable of obtaining the backward scattering power information of each scatterer in parallel with the spatial information. This leads to the conclusion that the signal detecting based methods gain more information about the scatterer than the CS-based methods. Furthermore, the detection accuracy and time cost of the aforementioned methods are presented and discussed.

TI  - Prevalence of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika Viruses in Febrile Pregnant Women: An Observational Study at a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are arboviruses that can affect maternal and fetal outcome if acquired during pregnancy. This study was done to estimate the positivity of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in febrile pregnant women attending a tertiary care hospital in north India. Symptomatic pregnant women were tested for these viruses by IgM ELISA and/or by Trioplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Their symptoms and laboratory parameters were recorded and were followed up till delivery to know their immediate delivery outcome. Of 104 women tested, 50 (48.1%) were positive for viral markers. Of these, evidence of infection by DENV, CHIKV, and both was found in 34 (32.7%), 10 (9.6%), and 6 (5.8%), respectively. ZIKV was not detected in any woman. Maximum DENV positivity occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy and in women residing in urban than rural areas. Chills and rigors, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, anemia, and vaginal bleeding were more commonly associated with DENV positivity. Backache, arthralgia, jaundice, and vaginal bleeding were more common in CHIKV positives but the difference between positives and nonpositives regarding these symptoms was not statistically significant. Dengue infections were associated with more frequent hospitalizations (OR = 8.38, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 3.29-21.30) and mortality (OR = 19.0, 95% CI = 1.01-357.10). Hence, to conclude, in India wherever possible, all symptomatic pregnant women should be screened for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV as part of sentinel surveillance for ZIKV.

AB  - Quantum computers consisting of hundreds of noisy qubits are already available and can run specific quantum algorithms although a large-scale fully error-corrected quantum computer is decades away. It is important to study their application to real-life computational problems. One such problem is Land Use and Land Cover classification of Earth Observation data set collected from the earth observation satellite mission using quantum machine learning methods. In this work, we compare the performance of the classical neural network on the re-labeled dataset of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, when the model has access to Projected Quantum Kernel features. We show that classical neural network training accuracy increases drastically when the model has access to Projected Quantum Kernel features. This study shows the potential for quantum machine learning methods to Earth Observation data and provides key evidence for further investigation.

TI  - Effects of rising urban temperatures on the wellbeing of the residents: A case study of Kolkata Metropolitan Region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban climate changes and the warming of the cities are serious issues that cannot be overlooked. One of the most common inferences for these changes is unprecedented and unplanned urbanization, which further causes a rise in local, regional, and even global temperatures. Although the rate of urbanisation defines and greatly influences the city's socioeconomic worth and GDP per capita, if the urban expansion is hap-hazardous, it can cause serious environmental harm.There has been a steep rise in global urban population over the past three decades, and the highest growth rates have been observed in Asian and African cities. These two continents have been predicted to contribute to almost 90% of the total urban growth from the present to 2050. India is one of the few highly susceptible countries to the harsh effects of climate change in terms of rise in temperatures. After 1990s', India has observed substantial changes in the landscape due to urbanization, which has led to a significant rise in the surface and ambient air temperatures, further affecting the planet's health. Elevated temperature drastically affects the health of urban dwellers leading to a rise in stress and discomfort levels. Estimation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) can play a vital role in understanding the region-specific alterations in temperatures as it uses satellite data that captures the entire region and provides the information in the form of pixels. Traditionally, the temperature was measured at meteorological stations and extrapolated for the entire region,whichinduces inaccuracies. This ambiguity can be amended by developing a relationship between LST and ambient air temperature. This communication focuses on LST estimation using Radiative Transfer Equation algorithm corresponding to various Landuse categories. The study also attempts to create a relationship between the LST and the ambient air temperature observed at two meteorological stations. An overall assessment of the number of days under stress for the residents was also performed over several years. Kolkata Metropolitan Area was considered the study area to represent the results and understand the complete analysis. A rise of 6.77 degrees C was observed in LST over the study period (2000-2019) due to an increment of 200% in the urban area. Analysis of the number of days under stress showed an increasing trend for the study area due to alterations in urban temperatures. These results and the suggestions from the scientific community, urban planners, and climate experts will help develop or modify the current policy frameworks for creating a balance between development and the environment, thus creating sustainable urban development.

AB  - Forest fires would be a global disaster if they were not addressed seriously? From 2015 to 2021, the number of forest fires in India nearly tripled. According to FSI, the North Eastern Himalayas, one of UNESCO's 36 Biodiversity Hotspots, account for 36% of forest fires in India. This state is dominated by tribal population which practices shifting agriculture. It's 76.01% of total forest cover is highly prone to Forest fires. Despite this, there hasn't been any time-series research on forest fires in this region. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR), Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI 1600), and Land Surface Temperature may all be linked to forest fires (LST). For Mizoram, India, random samples were taken every 16 days using Landsat 8 satellite data across different land cover types, including dense forest, sparse forest, farmland, and bare land etc. The study was conducted on a bimonthly basis from January 2016 to June 2021. The findings of this work show that an automated temporal analysis utilizing GEE may be used successfully over a wide range of land cover types, providing critical data for future monitoring of such threats.

TI  - A systematic review on estimating population attributable fraction for risk factors for small-for-gestational-age births in 81 low- and middle-income countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Small for gestational age (SGA) is a public health concern since it is associ-ated with mortality in neonatal and post-neonatal period. Despite the large magnitude of the problem, little is known about the population-attributable risk (PAR) of various risk factors for SGA. This study estimated the relative contribution of risk factors for SGA, as a basis for identifying priority areas for developing and/or implementing interventions to reduce the incidence of SGA births and related mortality and morbidity. Methods We conducted a literature review on 63 potential risk factors for SGA to quanti-fy the risk relationship and estimate the prevalence of risk factors (RFs). We calculated the population-attributable fraction for each of the identified RF for 81 Countdown countries and calculated regional estimates. Twenty-five RFs were included in the final model while extended model included all the 25 RFs from the final model and two additional RFs. Results In the final and extended models, the RFs included in each model have a to -tal PAF equal to 63.97% and 69.66%, respectively of SGA across the 81 LMICs. In the extended model, maternal nutritional status has the greatest PAF (28.15%), followed by environmental and other exposures during pregnancy (15.82%), pregnancy history (11.01%), and general health issues or morbidity (10.34%). The RFs included in the final and extended model for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region have a total PAF of 63.28% and 65.72% of SGA, respectively. In SSA, the top three RF categories in the extended model are nutrition (25.05%), environment and other exposure (13.01%), and general health issues or morbidity (10.72%), while in South-Asia's it was nutrition (30.56%), environment and other exposure (15.27%) and pregnancy history (11.68%). Conclusions The various types of RFs that play a role in SGA births highlight the im-portance of a multifaceted approach to tackle SGA. Depending on the types of RFs, in-tervention should be strategically targeted at either individual or household and/or com-munity or policy level. There is also a need to research the mechanisms by which some of the RFs might hinder fetal growth.

AB  - Green house gas (GHG) satellites such as Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO2), Sentinel 5P (TROPOMI), GHGSat offer global coverage of measuring column averaged carbon-di-oxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4). Though GHG satellites are a scalable method of measuring GHG emissions, they are limited by coarse spatial and/or temporal resolutions and missing data. Based on the statistical interpolation technique, fixed rank kriging (FRK), in this work, we have developed a novel nested kriging approach, N-FRK to address the above challenges of GHG satellite data, in particular of OCO2 satellite. Compared to the spatio-temporal resolution of 1.2x2.2km(2) and 16 days of OCO2 satellite, we have increased the temporal resolution to 1 day and spatial resolution to 1.11x1.11km(2) using N-FRK. The daily spatial maps at 111, 11.1, 1.11 km resolutions have been generated using FRK and N-FRK techniques and validated across 13 or subset of the 13 sensor sites of total carbon column observing network (TCCON) for the year 2019. As part of validation, we present the R-2, root mean square error (RMSE), and bias metrics and we see good agreement between the estimated data and sensor data.

TI  - Using ECOSTRESS to Observe and Model Diurnal Variability in Water Temperature Conditions in the San Francisco Estuary
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Bay Delta) is a highly sensitive and critical habitat for the Delta Smelt, an endangered endemic fish, with water temperature being a key determinant of habitat suitability. This study investigates the relationship between open water surface and subsurface conditions from spaceborne thermal measurements (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and Landsat-8) and in situ sensor data from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC) to produce estimates of spatially continuous bulk temperature in the Bay Delta. We found that ECOSTRESS and Landsat-8 surface temperature measurements are well-correlated with hulk water temperatures (N = 236 and r = 0.907 and N = 226 and r = 0.976, respectively). For the ECOSTRESS-in situ comparison, accounting for time of day improved the correlation between surface and subsurface conditions (r = 0.946, 0.881, and 0.944 for morning, midday, and evening, respectively). We found that ECOSTRESS surface temperatures were warmer than hulk temperatures in the midday period (2 degrees C peak at 2 P.M.) and cooler in the morning and evening periods (-1 degrees C peak at 6 A.M.). We also found that a simple harmonic regression model can capture the diurnal variability of the skin effect to predict bulk water temperature (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.809 degrees C). With ECOSTRESS, we found that across the Bay Delta, including open waters and pelagic bays, temperature conditions causing stress and mortality for the Delta Smelt were persistent throughout the day during summer months. ECOSTRESS is a unique dataset capable of informing conservation efforts in the Bay Delta.

TI  - Recent NDVI trends in Andalusia (southern Spain): the limits of vegetation greening
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA ASOCIACION DE GEOGRAFOS ESPANOLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and anthropogenic factors control vegetation dynamics, and its study provides indicators to address the multi-scale analysis of environmental trends. In this article, an inter-annual analysis of NDVI 2000-2020 trends in Andalusia was conducted using the MODIS Vegetation Index Products. The main findings show: 1) the annual median NDVI showed a significant trend (p-value <0.05) in 42% of the study area, with significant increasing trends of 95.5%; 2) the annual median NDVI showed a significant trend (p-value <0.05) in 44.1% of the study area, with significant increasing trends of 93.1%; and, 3) the annual median NDVI showed a significant trend (p-value <0.05) in 64.9% of the study area, with significant increasing trends of 98.4%. This greening trend was found both in agricultural and forest covers. However, this greening was more relevant in some land cover types: olive groves and fruit trees; and sclerophyll scrubs with scattered trees and forests. The findings suggest the importance of anthropogenic factors and how they interact with climate change, while also cautioning against the limitations of vegetation greening.

TI  - Contributions of Ethnoeducation to Religious Freedom respecting of School Religious Edu- cation
T2  - UNI-PLURIVERSIDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - Colombia has a wide cultural diversity due to the contribution of indigenous, peasant, Afro-descendant, Raizal, and gypsy communities and the great variety of worldviews that are built as an interpretation of contextual realities that enrich the understanding of the world of life. However, it is also evident the invisibility that these communities have had in Colombian schools in what corresponds to the religious diversity that underlies this multicultural fabric, producing, on the one hand, ignorance of their knowledge, their spirituality, and their worldview. experience and, in the worst case, pejorative stigmatization of their identity and their religious practices. This paper informs a documentary research based on the method of a systematic review of literature by Barbara Kitchenham. Accord-ing to Colombian current regulations, this paper informs that the area of School Religious Education can be an appropriate academic field to promote a religious pluralism through the recognition of the contribution and wealth of these original communities. As conclusion, ethnic-educational articulation is possible that pro-motes an integral education where the spiritual dimension is accentuated, also, a subject of reflection, cultivation, development, and perfection without the spirit of religious proselytism.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine King Jeongho’s Theory of Gunsa(君師論). King Jeongjo used the concept of Hwanggeuk(皇極) as a standard for the king to establish the status of the ‘Gun(君)’. He used the Hwanggeuk theory of the science of xiangshu(象數學) derived from the Gunsa king Wu rather than the Li-ki theory of Neo-Confucianism, the symbol of the nobleman, to give the effect of gaining an advantage among monarch and liege. Through this, King Jeongjo tried to establish the status of royal authority by gaining the upper hand among monarch and liege.In order to establish its status as a ‘Sa(師)’, King Jeongjo opened a new chapter of learning through a lecture Gyeongsa-Gangui(經史講義) with Chogyemunsin(抄啟文臣). King Jeongjo continued to hold academic discussions with scholars from Chogyemunsin, Seonggyungwan, and the private school and local student of Confucianism, showing the aspect of ‘Sa(師)’ and compiled thousands of Eojeongseo(御定書) and Myeongchanseo(命撰書). Conclusively, King Jeongjo studied The Great Learning(大學), The Extended Meaning of The Great Learning(大學衍義), and The Extended Meaning Assistant of The Great Learning(大學衍義補) with Munsin and student of Confucianism, and compiled The Kind Meaning of The Great Learning(大學類義) that integrated the Gundo(君道) and the Sado(師道). Through a series of efforts, King Jeongjo realized his monarchy, GunSa(君師), and completed the project by announcing the Master of Ten Thousand Rivers and the Moon(萬川明月主人翁).This work shows the worldview of King Jeongjo, where reality becomes the main focus and ideology becomes assistant, and becomes an example of the changes in study in the late Joseon Dynasty.

AB  - This study aims to unpack the phrase “Korean Christianity has become Presbyterianized” and attempts to find out why Korean Christianity was forced to adopt Presbyterian ecclesiastical structures. Korea’s unique social worldview has Korean churches to focus on the position of “the Elder.” Among the studies conducted so far, ample research points out the problems of having ecclesiastical positions in Korean Christianity.However, no study diagnoses the root of Korean Christianity accepting Presbyterian ecclesiology.This study looked at earlier studies to confirm the socio-cultural properties unique to Korean Christianity. At the same time, this researcher conducted interviews with seven research subjects of various denominations to determine how Korea's unique social culture affected the structures in Korean churches.Korean Christianity became more Presbyterianized or hierarchically structured, because of the attitudes of early Western missionaries. They instilled in Korea hierarchical ecclesiology. Such a mindset has typified and affected every aspect of Korean life which was already shaped by the Confucian worldview. Korean Christians created various ecclesiastical positions to placate “success” driven individuals.

TI  - Evaluating the suitability of Sentinel-1 SAR data for offshore wind resource assessment around Cyprus
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore wind offers an excellent opportunity for domestic renewable energy production with a vast potential for future energy systems. Offshore wind resource assessment, however, can be challenging. Remote sensing data e.g., Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), provide high spatial resolution detailed information on the spatial variability of offshore wind and have been used for wind resource assessment, as well as for the long-term validation of wind speed estimates from other sources (e.g. Numerical Weather Prediction models). This paper focuses on the evaluation of a 26-month time-series of Sentinel-1 SAR Level 2 OCN products for wind resource assessment in the offshore areas around Cyprus. Sentinel data were evaluated against a 10-year regional reanalysis dataset (UERRA) time-series and wind measurements from 5 coastal meteorological stations in Cyprus. Comparison revealed an overall agreement between the fitted stations and Sentinel Weibull distributions while discrepancies exist between the two data sources and UERRA. Bias observed between Sentinel and UERRA Weibull-derived statistics appears to be spatially dependent. Preliminary wind power assessment results indicate a significant wind power potential for the southwestern offshore areas of Cyprus, surpassing 400 W/m(2) on average, offering thus economically viable solutions in terms of a future offshore wind power project development.

AB  - The creation of universe and life is the subject of research by all mankind. “How does this universe exist?” or “Who made life?” The purpose of this article is to break the fixed and narrow-minded idea that the universe and life were created by God or that they consisted of four primary elements(4大: earth, water, fire, and wind). Baek Sung-wook recognizes the history of mankind, which is familiar with the Western straight and creative perspectives for a long time, and defines Buddhism's circular and anthropocentric worldview as a regular and orderly idea. In particular, mankind imagines that the possibility of change in the four primary elements(4大: earth, water, fire, and wind) from a long time ago constitutes the universe and life. Buddhist scriptures also recognize the history of the four primary elements being evaluated as the substances that make up the universe and humans. “The Greater Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint” refers to the impermanence of the Four primary elements being subject to destruction and extinction change. The obsession with relying on the four primary elements makes us understand impermanence, correcting the illusion of "mine", "I," and "my self." It is based on the imagination that the beginning of the world is not made up of the composition of the four elements, but is made up of four elements by people who are obsessed with desire and ignorant. Baek Sung-wook presupposes a specific situation in which he relies on the four elements due to his fine mind. Immediately refers to the inseparability of mind and material. Desire becomes its medium, and only when the mind relies on matter can it exist in various forms(形), materials(色), and objects(物). Abidarma's philosophy(Buddhist Metaphysics) solves this difficult point by mentioning the beginning of the world and the beginning of mankind. The "imagination and illusion" that the beginning of the universe and humans took place from the four elements, and Baek Sung-wook says it is the beginning of the world and mankind. Baek Sung-wook says that the beginning of the universe and humans is the "imagination and illusion" that came from the fourt elements, and that this illusion is the beginning of the world and mankind. In addition, it emphasizes that it is only the result of desire according to ignorance or obscurity.

AB  - Although the Cheoyong Cultural Festival has as many advantages as its long history, it is currently on the verge of extinction. From the recent festival, it can be assumed that the collapse of the festival's identity by focusing only on "expanding the size of the festival and diversifying the program" further encouraged the crisis. However, as interest in K-Culture is higher than ever, it is too bad to give up the Cheoyong Cultural Festival, which can be said to be a "best practice for using local folktale content." Fortunately, however, as a result of the study, the way to overcome this crisis was not far away, and it was to highlight the Cheoyong spirit (worldview) implied in the "Cheoyong Story" in the festival. In other words, rather than focusing only on Cheoyong's ability to kick out the traitor in Cheoyong's Tale, we should pay more attention to Cheoyong's resolute attitude, crisis response method, and actively use it in content development.There is a limit to using only characters without their own worldview or leading the festival with only some abstract messages, and it is easy to become an imitator. Therefore, rather than focusing on providing characters and materials, the direction of developing local narrative content should be to find and promote the "philosophical value" that people around the world can sympathize with and touch in our literature.

AB  - This article clarifies the meaning of the voice of a woman who bitterly criticizes the patriarchal society of the time by analyzing Lee Tae-jun’s novel Three Daughters, focusing on the conflict and confrontation between the values of the three sisters. This novel is interesting in that an ideological gap appears between the character ideally created by the author and the character who conveys the subject according to the narrative development. These characteristics were acquired in the process of creating new characters while changing the format of many contemporary family novel and observing and diagnosing the reality of women at the time. Such exploration of form and content in a novel serialized in a newspaper is also a product of the artist's efforts to not give up its value as an art while considering its popularity.The character Jung-guk, who embodies the spirit of women in the new era, is unique in that it conflicts with the ideal value that the artist wanted to draw through female characters, even though she was created by the author. Jungkook is a person who criticizes the whole product of patriarchy, such as the sacredness of motherhood and the marriage system, and asks fundamental questions about the conditions and values of the family. However, in contrast to the emphasis on the radical and disturbing voice of the political situation, the thoughts and actions of the characters appear to be insufficient reproduction without specificity at the end. These characters exceed the artist's worldview and reveal a voice criticizing the reality of the time. These female characters engrave progressive meanings in the discourse of women and families of the time, while at the same time looking at Lee Tae-joon's literary world from a different perspective.

AB  - The frequency and intensity of natural disasters (i.e. wildfires, storms, floods) has increased over recent decades. Extreme weather can often be linked to climate change, and human population expansion and urbanization have led to a growing risk. In particular floods due to large amounts of rainfall are of rising severity and are causing loss of life, destruction of buildings and infrastructure, erosion of arable land, and environmental hazards around the world. Expanding urbanization along rivers and creeks often includes opening flood plains for building construction and river straightening and dredging speeding up the flow of water. In a flood event, rapid response is essential which requires knowledge which buildings are susceptible to flooding and which roads are still accessible. To this aim, SpaceNet 8 is the first remote sensing machine learning training dataset combining building footprint detection, road network extraction, and flood detection covering 850km2, including 32k buildings and 1,300km roads of which 13% and 15% are flooded, respectively.

TI  - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data Fusion for Urban Change Detection Using a Dual Stream U-Net
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is progressing rapidly around the world. With sub-weekly revisits at global scale, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imager (MSI) data can play an important role for monitoring urban sprawl to support sustainable development. In this letter, we proposed an urban change detection (CD) approach featuring a new network architecture for the fusion of SAR and optical data. Specifically, a dual stream concept was introduced to process different data modalities separately, before combining extracted features at a later decision stage. The individual streams are based on U-Net architecture that is one of the most popular fully convolutional networks used for semantic segmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated using the Onera Satellite CD (OSCD) dataset. The proposed strategy outperformed other U-Net-based approaches in combination with unimodal data and multimodal data with feature level fusion. Furthermore, our approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on the urban CD problem posed by the OSCD dataset. Our Sentinel-1 SAR data and code are available on https://github.com/SebastianHafner/DS_UNet.

CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its extensive coverage and regular data acquisition all over the globe, has become one of the most valuable assets for flood monitoring in recent years. However, the strong influence of incidence angle on backscatter measurement of Sentinel-1 data makes it challenging to mosaic Sentinel-1 tracks for systematic flood mapping over large areas. This study uses a cosine squared normalization of Sentinel-1 data based on Lambert 's law for optics to homogenize SAR data from different tracks. Then, it combines normalized data from ascending and descending passes forms 12-day mosaics covering Bangladesh from January 2017 to December 2021. Afterward, it estimates flood evolution by segmentation of the country-wide mosaics of data and calculates a flood frequency map. The flood frequency map, along with the population information, is then used to estimate the flood risk to the Bangladesh population. The results show that normalization can reduce inconsistencies between different tracks of Sentinel-1 data. Furthermore, it shows the potential of Sentinel-1 data for systematic flood mapping at large scales. Such analysis can help implement flood management measures on a national scale to reduce the flood risk.

TI  - Assessments of Doppler Velocity Errors of EarthCARE Cloud Profiling Radar Using Global Cloud System Resolving Simulations: Effects of Doppler Broadening and Folding
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth Clouds, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) is a satellite mission jointly developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the European Space Agency (ESA). One challenging feature of this mission is the observation of Doppler velocity by the Cloud Profiling Radar (EC-CPR). The Doppler measurement accuracy is affected by random errors induced by Doppler broadening due to the finite beamwidth and Doppler folding caused by the finite pulse repetition frequency. We investigated the impact of horizontal (along-track) integration and unfolding methods on the reduction of Doppler errors, in order to improve Doppler data processing in the JAXA standard algorithm. We simulated EC-CPR-observed Doppler velocities from pulse-pair covariances with the latest EC-CPR specifications using the radar reflectivity factor and Doppler velocity fields simulated by a satellite data simulator and a global cloud system resolving simulation. Two representative cases of a cirrus cloud and precipitation were examined. In the cirrus cloud case, the standard deviation of random error was decreased to 0.5 m/s for x2212;10 dB after 10-km horizontal integration. In the precipitation case, large falling speeds of precipitation caused Doppler folding errors due to larger Doppler velocities than that in the cirrus cloud case. When is larger than x2212;15 dB the standard deviations of random error were less than 1.0 m/s after 10-km horizontal integration and unfolding.

TI  - DETERMINATION OF OPTIMISED PICK-UP AND DROP-OFF LOCATIONS IN TRANSPORT ROUTING - A COST DISTANCE APPROACH
T2  - TRANSPORT PROBLEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the emergence of dynamic passenger transport systems, such as demand-responsive transport (DRT) and ride-sharing without predetermined stop locations as used for static bus routes, accurate routing for these flexible door-to-door transport services is needed. Routing between two addresses requires the assignment of addresses to suitable, so-called snapping points as reference points on the road network. Therefore, many conventional routing machines use perpendicular distance to identify the nearest point on the road network. However, this technique tends to produce inaccurate results if the access to a building is not reachable from the road segment with the shortest perpendicular distance. We provide a novel approach to identify the access to buildings (paths) based on remote sensing data to obtain more reasonable stop locations for passenger transport. Multispectral images, OpenStreetMap data, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used to perform a cost distance analysis based on vegetation cover, building footprints, and the slope of the terrain to identify such optimised stop locations. We assumed that the access to buildings on the shortest route to the building's entrance consists of little vegetation cover and minimal slope of the terrain; furthermore, the calculated path should not cross building footprints. Thus, snapping points on the road network can be determined based on the most likely path between a building and the road network. We validated our results based on a predetermined ideal snapping area considering different weightings for the parameters slope, vegetation, and building footprints. The results were compared with a conventional routing machine that uses perpendicular distance. This routing machine shows a validation rate of 81.4%, whereas the validation rate of our presented approach is as high as 90.3%. This new approach provides increased accuracy and better comfort for flexible passenger transport systems.

TI  - Identification and Monitoring of Surface Elements in Open-Pit Coal Mine Area Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining has brought a series of environmental problems. Local government departments have issued relevant governance policies, but the premise of scientific prevention and control is to correctly grasp the actual distribution of various ground objects in the mining area. Using classification methods to extract ground object information based on remote sensing images can effectively realize mining area monitoring and provide reference for land and space planning and environmental protection in the mining area. Therefore, it is very important to select the appropriate scale and method to identify the ground object information of remote sensing image. in this paper, Landsat 8 images of the Wucaiwan mining area and GF-2 images of the Tebian coal mine were taken as the research objects, and unsupervised classification, supervised classification and object-oriented classification were used to identify and monitor the mining area's surface. The results showed that: (1) the classification effect of the Mahalanobis distance method was the best in terms of comprehensive operation process and classification accuracy. This method had high classification accuracy for GF-2 and Landsat 8 images. When classifying GF-2 images, the kappa coefficient reached 0.90, and the overall classification accuracy was 94.27%. When classifying Landsat 8 images, the kappa coefficient reached 0.85, and the overall classification accuracy was 90.02%. (2) The factors causing the classification error were 'homospectral foreign bodies' and 'mixed pixels'. (3) When combined with the actual needs and image characteristics, the extensive use of medium and high-resolution remote sensing images to identify and monitor the surface elements of mining areas can greatly improve the work efficiency and minimize

TI  - Pelvic lymph node dissection in high-risk prostate cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL BRAZ J UROL
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The therapeutic role of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in prostate cancer (PCa) is unknown due to absence of randomized trials. Objective: to present a critical review on the therapeutic benefits of PLND in high risk localized PCa patients.Materials and Methods: A search of the literature on PLND was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline database. Articles obtained regarding diagnostic imaging and sentinel lymph node dissection, PLND extension, impact of PLND on survival, PLND in node positive "only" disease and PLND surgical risks were critically reviewed.Results: High-risk PCa commonly develops metastases. In these patients, the possibility of presenting lymph node disease is high. Thus, extended PLND during radical prostatectomy may be recommended in selected patients with localized high-risk PCa for both accurate staging and therapeutic intent. Although recent advances in detecting patients with lymph node involvement (LNI) with novel imaging and sentinel node dissection, extended PLND continues to be the most accurate method to stage lymph node disease, which may be related to the number of nodes removed. However, extended PLND increases surgical time, with potential impact on perioperative complications, hospital length of stay, rehospitalization and healthcare costs. Controversy persists on its therapeutic benefit, particularly in patients with high node burden.Conclusion: The impact of PLND on biochemical recurrence and PCa survival is unclear yet. Selection of patients may benefit from extended PLND but the challenge remains to identify them accurately. Only prospective randomized study would answer the precise role of PLND in high-risk pelvis confined PCa patients.

TI  - M-CORE: A Novel Approach for Land Cover Fraction Mapping Using Multisite Spectral Libraries
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of a generic spectral library (GSL), i.e., a structured collection of image spectra sampled from various optical remote sensing images covering different sites and points in time, has been suggested in previous studies to facilitate the tedious process of producing training data for remote sensing-based land cover (LC) mapping. When using multisource libraries collected over different sites, library pruning approaches are needed to extract an apt set of labeled spectra to perform mapping on a specific area. Library pruning mainly aims to discard image-irrelevant and redundant spectra, while limiting spectral confusion during the mapping process. Most library pruning approaches focus only on one of these aspects, which has been shown to negatively affect mapping accuracies. This article emphasizes the need for a multistep approach to optimize a GSL for site-specific mapping. We propose a new library pruning method called M-CORE, specifically designed to facilitate LC fraction mapping. The method extends multiple signal classification (MUSIC) with a confusion reduction (CORE) component. Vegetation-impervious-soil (VIS) fraction mapping experiments on a Sentinel-2 image of Brussels, using a GSL with and without local spectra, show the added value of M-CORE over previously proposed library pruning methods and demonstrate the feasibility of GSL-based mapping in an urban context.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water area is the most dominating land class, which is increased the cooling capacity of the area because due to high population density, urban development and industrial development are increased the heat stress, temperature variation, and green space deficiency. But water body decreased the heat balance and thermal dissimilarity in the study area. Remote sensing techniques are widely used for detecting the water area and land use and land cover (LU/LC) classes of different satellite imageries like Landsat data, Sentinel-1 and 2, LISS, and many others. Sentinel-2 data of different years (2016 and 2020) were used for LU/LC classes and spectral indicators were used for vegetation and water area delineation in Canning-I and Canning-II blocks, South 24 Parganas, India. Sentinel-2 data was used for LULC classes and spectral indicators because of high resolution (10 m) to detect the land classes with enhanced visibility. Remote sensing-based geospatial indicators have been used for generating the vegetation and water bodies' area change in the study area. Water bodies were increased 37.76 sq. km (9.375%) area and the area was located in north, north-east, and north-west parts of this area. In the year 2016, the water body was shown 88.16 sq. km and after anthropogenic activities, climatic conditions, and extreme events, the water bodies located 125.92 sq. km (31.262%). The vegetation area has been decreased around 58.44 sq. km (14.51%) from 2016 to 2020. This study results are helpful for administrators, policymakers, and others stakeholders for the overall development of this study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The word 'sejahtera' or in English known as well-being or prosperity is widely used in Nusantara as a fundamental concept of human existence which is usually applied to various dimensions of life: physical, spiritual, intellectual, emotional, economic, political, governance, educational, social, cultural and religious. Furthermore, the Malay concept of 'sejahtera' has received wide attention from our community during this pandemic COVID19 to ensure communities health. It is an important concept that deals with the issue of quality of life, society and civilisation as well. Given its importance, nurturing, and sustaining of a humane, peaceful, balanced and prosperous civilisation in this period of heightened global crises, in which most of mankind are currently starving for 'sejahtera' and struggling against an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Malay concept of 'sejahtera' will be reviewed from an Islamic thought perspective to build an alternative paradigm of holistic and sustainable development from the worldview of Tawhid. The study found that the Malaysian government's MySejahtera programme, which uses a digital platform to serve as a one-stop shop, can help in a way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in line with national law in achieving Maqasid al-Shari'ah.

AB  - Fast flood extent monitoring with SAR change detection using Google Earth Engine This dataset surveys flood extents from two hurricanes using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) change detection and thresholding techniques on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform. Indices such as the Normalized Difference Flood Index (NDFI) are often used to delineate floods, yet there are known challenges associated with thresholding that make geographic generalizability a hurdle. To address the issue, we devised a novel framework that consists of programmatic index computation and sensitivity analytics to calibrate thresholds and produce SAR-based flood extents that are effective across geographies. GEE code was developed by Ebrahim Hamidi; Figures was created by Brad G. Peter. This tool accompanies a publication in preparation by Hamidi et al. (forthcoming): Hamidi, E., Peter B. G., Munoz, D.

TI  - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), 1998-2019, V4.GL.03
T2  - NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center
M3  - Data study
AB  - The Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), 1998-2019, V4.GL.03 consists of annual concentrations (micrograms per cubic meter) of all composition ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5). This data set combines AOD retrievals from multiple satellite algorithmsincluding the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 6.1 (MODIS C6.1), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer Version 23 (MISRv23), MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Collection 6 (MAIAC C6), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) Deep Blue Version 4. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model is used to relate this total column measure of aerosol to near-surface PM2.5 concentration. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is used with global ground-based measurements from the World Health Organization (WHO) database to predict and adjust for the residual PM2.5 bias per grid cell in the initial satellite-derived values. These estimates are primarily intended to aid in large-scale studies. Gridded data sets are provided at a resolution of 0.01 degrees to allow users to agglomerate data as best meets their particular needs. Data sets are gridded at the finest resolution of the information sources that were incorporated, but do not fully resolve PM2.5 gradients at the gridded resolution due to influence by information sources at coarser resolution. The data are distributed as GeoTIFF files and are in WGS84 projection.

TI  - The degradation of forest areas in Morocco: Case of Benslimane province
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to shed light on the process of known degradation of the forest area of Benslimane province during the pe-riod 1990-2020 and to specify the most important human causes which contributed to it (quarries, extension of the built-up area, the impact of agricultural activities, grazing and collection of firewood), by using remote sensing techniques (spatial images for the years 1990-2000-2010-2020) to produce Land Cover maps. The following satellite images were used, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI, with a spatial precision of 30 m, the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) in QGIS was used for atmospheric correction, and the Spectral Angle Mapping algorithm for the images' classification. The rating evaluation of the Kappa coefficient shows the following ratios for the years 1990-2000-2010-2020 respectively ; 0.89-0.90-0.90-0.93. The results showed that the forest area of Benslimane province has declined by 11.4% or about 6,027.7 ha between 1990-2020 at the rate of 200 ha/year, which has been turned into matorral land or bare land. This forest also lost 35.2% of its vegetative density and has become much sparser, while the original grazing areas surrounding it have been reduced by 50.4%. Moreover, the area of quarries increased by 1,097.4%, the percentage of built-up area increased by 328.2%, and the agricultural area expanded by 32.7%. These results can be used as preliminary data for future studies and can help policymakers focus on the real drivers of forest degradation, in order to develop interventions to ensure the sustainability of natural resources.

TI  - Urban sprawl and expansion of road networks and its impacts on the environment using sensor and socio-economic data: Macta watershed, western Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl and the road networks have profoundly modified the space of the Macta watershed in western Algeria. The fragmentation of the landscape within this territory is gradually changing in order to meet different socio-economic needs. Damage to natural environments caused by pollution, business development, management of agricultural land and spatial modification of the morphology of urban constructions are remarkable. Our research is part of a complex study of the rate of evolution of urban sprawl and road networks expansion from 1987 to 2018; to better understand the issues of human activities and their impacts on the environment. The methodology adopted consists of using Landsat and Google-Pro images. Their capabilities enable us to trace the influence of human activities in time and space on the environment. The results obtained show a weak trend in urban sprawl during the period 1987/1998, while it reaches significant levels in the years 2010 and 2018. The distribution of the surface area occupied by towns and cities during this study period shows a concentration of the population in the major provinces. In addition, the extension of the East-West motorway shows a weak trend in 2018. The lengths of the roads built are significant and show a 50% growth rate. The digital analysis using sensor data has an important advantage in detecting the evolution and progression of the spaces occupied by urbanization and road networks in the Macta watershed over 31 years, which has been marked by intense demographic growth.

AB  - The aricle is to discuss how the Christian traditional understanding of ‘prayer’ can be re-interpreted in view of contemporary (modern-postmodern) language-experience-directed thoughts, and what its theological implications are. There is not a definite turningpoint borderline between modernity and postmodernity, but the two, inter-mixed, coexist, mutually illuminating each other. ‘Contemporary’ in this study indicates such a mixed and fluid state. The author views ‘language’ and ‘experience’ as the core keywords of contemporary thoughts. The matrix for the so-called ‘linguistic turn’ is the modern empiricism and structuralism. The postmodern inherits the materialistic immanentism and subjectivism (self-consciousness) from the modern, and turns them into the problematics of language (sign) and particularity of individuals. The problems of language and experience for modernity was a clue to the rational interpretations for the world and humanity, but they for postmodernity become a pretext for overturn and deconstruction. No matter which side, the contemporary lies on the time-spirit dominated by discourses on language and experience. And this time-trend basically tends to stand against Christianity.The strategy of the study is to use the discourse on ‘language’ and ‘experience.’ which is used to tear down the Christian worldview, conversely as a means for defending this and rather proving its excellency. This strategy, of course. is never new in Christian theological traditions. Borrowing the time-honored wisdom from the tradition, the study particularly deals with the matter of ‘prayer.’ Prayer is, while being possibly regarded as a universal phenomenon of humanity, the authuor presupposes, particularly the core praxis for the Christian spirituality and theology.  Nevertheless, ‘prayer’ is also a subject that cannot avoid negatively being understood in the contemporary discourse on language and experience. Paying attention to the fact that prayer has to do with the problems of language and experience above all, the article shows that the characteristics of Christian prayer deconstructs the contemporary discourse of language and experience, and exposes its contradiction and limitation. The aim is, of course, not to attack the contemporary thoughts as such, but to demonstrate that the uniqueness and survival power of the Christian prayer, emerged against the contemporary thoughts, can newly answer the contemporary questions.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the characteristics of all-time, all-weather, strong penetrating power and high spatial resolution. The monitoring of flood using remote sensing based on the SAR data is of great significance to scientifically manage and analyze the flood disasters. The flood disaster in China's Yi River Basin in 2020 was selected to realize the monitoring of floods and disaster assessment based on Sentinel-1B SAR data. First, the Sentinel-1 Dual- Polarized Water Index (SDWI) was adopted to enhance the water body information, and the object-oriented threshold method was used to extract the water area. Next, high spatial resolution images were obtained to verify the accuracy of water extraction. Finally, combined with land classification data, the assessment of disaster-affected areas was carried out. The results shows that the producer precision, user precision, and overall precision of water extraction in the disaster-affected area are all higher than 95%, which indicate that the stability and reliability of this method.

TI  - Combining Sentinel-1 and-3 Imagery for Retrievals of Regional Multitemporal Biophysical Parameters Under a Deep Learning Framework
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regions with excessive cloud cover lead to limited feasibility of applying optical images to monitor crop growth. In this article, we built an upsampling moving window network for regional crop growth monitoring (UMRCGM) model to estimate the two key biophysical parameters (BPs), leaf area index (LAI), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) during the main growth period of winter wheat by using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-3 optical images. Sentinel-1 imagery is unaffected by cloudy weather and Sentinel-3 imagery has a wide width and short revisit period, the organic combination of the two will greatly improve the ability to monitor crop growth at a regional scale. The impact of two different types of SAR information (intensity and polarization) on the estimation of the two BPs was further analyzed. The UMRCGM model optimized the correspondence between inputs and outputs, it had more accurate LAI and CCC estimates compared with the three classical machine learning models, and had the highest accuracy at the green-up stage of winter wheat, followed by the jointing stage and the heading-filling stage, and the lowest accuracy was found at the milk maturity stage. The estimation accuracies of CCC were slightly higher than that of LAI for the first three growth stages of winter wheat, while lower than that of LAI for the milk maturity stage. This article proposes a new method for regional BPs (especially for CCC) estimation by combining SAR and optical imagery with large differences in spatial resolution under a deep learning framework.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper started with the intention of grasping the overall status and character of prose works contained in Yeong-nam Nam-in anthology. The prose included in the miscellaneous writings of Yeong-nam Nam-in anthology has a side that asks for reflection on what researchers have not paid attention to. To this end, this paper first reviewed the rough status of the prose data in the Yeong-nam Nam-in anthology, and pointed out several points that the Yeong-nam Nam-in anthology is noted as an important character of prose.First, in the case of prose contained in Yeong-nam Nam-in anthology, it can be seen that a number of works borrowed from the mythical writing method are included. This shows the relationship between the political reality of Yeong-nam Nam-in and the way they write, and it is understood that the lewd writing method was summoned in a way that could easily digest the literary outburst of Yeong-nam Nam-in's self-consciousness, worldview, and political and social reality of the time. Second, many animals and anthropomorphic objects have been found as the subject of writing. Prose works represented by ‘Dong-mul-seol’ show that they are being used in an important way to express their inner feelings in a roundabout way among various writings. Third, it is confirmed that many of the works appear in the prose of Han yu and Yoo Jong-won, which are typical of the Tang Song's Ancient Writing. This is understood to have been written for the exemplum virtutis sentence learning of Han Yu and Yoo Jong-won, and at the same time, it is interpreted as a result of the combination of the intention to utilize the allegory of Tang Song's Ancient Writing.This paper has a poetic nature of seeking perspective and direction to clarify the overall nature of Yeong-nam Nam-in prose, which has not been spotlighted so far, through the organization and analysis of prose in Yeong-nam Nam-in anthology. Therefore, rather than focusing on in-depth interpretation of the data, there is an aspect of focusing on finding and organizing data that have not been discovered or introduced. This point will be continuously supplemented through more detailed research in the future based on several research directions presented in this paper.

TI  - Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Gaofen-1 Images, Sentinel-1 Images, and Machine Learning Algorithms: A Case Study of the Dabie Mountain Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitatively mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is of great significance for the study of terrestrial carbon storage and global carbon cycles, and remote sensing-based data are a valuable source of estimating forest AGB. In this study, we evaluated the potential of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) by integrating Gaofen-1 (GF1) images, Sentinel-1 (S1) images, and topographic data for AGB estimation in the Dabie Mountain region, China. Variables extracted from GF1 and S1 images and digital elevation model data from sample plots were used to explain the field AGB value variations. The prediction capability of stepwise multiple regression and three MLAs, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and backpropagation neural network were compared. The results showed that the RF model achieved the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 16.26 t/ha), followed by the SVM model (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 18.03 t/ha) for the testing datasets. Some variables extracted from the GF1 images (e.g., normalized differential vegetation index, band 1-blue, the mean texture feature of band 3-red with windows of 3 x 3), S1 images (e.g., vertical transmit-horizontal receive and vertical transmit-vertical receive backscatter coefficient), and altitude had strong correlations with field AGB values (p < 0.01). Among the explanatory variables in MLAs, variables extracted from GF1 made a greater contribution to estimating forest AGB than those derived from S1 images. These results indicate the potential of the RF model for evaluating forest AGB by combining GF1 and S1, and that it could provide a reference for biomass estimation using multi-source images.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-6/WFV Sensor Using MODIS Images With Different BRDF Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide field of view (WFV) imaging system of the GaoFen-6 (GF-6) satellite processes four popular spectral bands [blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR)] and four new spectral bands (costal, yellow, and two red edges). However, the corresponding reference spectral bands for these eight spectral bands from one reference sensor are insufficient in the cross-calibration process of the WFV; therefore, current cross-calibration methods should be improved. To address this problem, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which has high radiometric performance with the aid of an onboard calibration system, is used as a reference sensor, and cross-calibration methods using the top of atmosphere (TOA) and the bottom of atmosphere (BOA) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models are developed and compared. The results reveal that the cross-calibration results in eight spectral bands with the BOA BRDF model that can obtain higher consistency with the official calibration coefficients (OCCs) compared with the TOA BRDF model. In addition, after various influencing factors are comprehensively analyzed, the spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) correction in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands can be neglected; moreover, by using five spectral bands (blue, green, red, NIR, and SWIR) of the MODIS sensor, the BOA BRDF model and the cubic polynomial interpolation method provide optimal cross-calibration schemes for WFV sensor. The total radiometric cross-calibration uncertainties of the proposed cross-calibration methods with the BOA BRDF model and the TOA BRDF model are less than 5.73% and 6.32%, respectively.

AB  - This paper intends to become an entry point for analysis and research on Hu Shih’s way of thinking about science and limitations regarding his scientific metaphysics. Hu’s disbelief in ghosts and gods and his advocacy for the abolition of feudal superstition became a theoretical foundation for his atheism, which undergirded both his scientific way of thought and his belief system.

AB  - This paper intends to become an entry point for analysis and research on Hu Shih’s way of thinking about science and limitations regarding his scientific metaphysics. Hu’s disbelief in ghosts and gods and his advocacy for the abolition of feudal superstition became a theoretical foundation for his atheism, which undergirded both his scientific way of thought and his belief system. This paper highlights Hu’s ideas regarding “science” and “worldview” to discover the meaning behind his perspective on science and specify limitations in this way of thought.It is a matter of common knowledge that Hu was deeply influenced by science and firmly believed that science would bring about fundamental changes in China, even to the point of completely changing the old ideas and concepts of the Chinese people. Hu’s scientism amidst the difficult process of China’s modernization showed its own unique ideological characteristics, which were more clearly manifested in the debate between science and metaphysics in 1923. Hu’s science-focus was mainly reflected in his emphasis on basing everything on a “scientific perspective” and on utilizing the “scientific method,” taking science as the foundation for people’s “worldview.” It is noteworthy that while Hu’s Scientific Metaphysics is not only limited to the level of Hu’s knowledge and understanding of science, it can also be an important strategy for advancing in “ideological enlightenment.” However, Hu’s Scientific Metaphysics also has its own limitations. First, his idea of Scientific Metaphysics could have come to be regarded as the Chinese people’s view of life and the ideological consciousness of the modernization of Chinese culture. Yet, the sharing of his idea of Scientific Metaphysics was mainly limited to the circle of intellectuals, and was used to oppose the ideological propositions and related activities of the metaphysics school. In effect, it was not widely recognized by the people at that time. Secondly, although Hu’s Scientific Metaphysics did have remarkable significance for progress, it could not completely eradicate traditional elements of Chinese culture. In addition, Hu’s Scientific Metaphysics is based not only on Ding’s religious view and Wu’s naturalistic cosmology, but also on his own “social immortality theory.” Therefore, Hu’s Scientific Metaphysics also inevitably falls into a traditional Confucian ideology.I argue that Hu used “science” to reshape a new “outlook on life,” which opened up a new path for ideological enlightenment, but he could neither entirely break from traditional thinking nor completely eliminate the tension between “science” and “metaphysics.” Hu could not perfect his scientism and failed to gain the general recognition and support of the people at that time. As a result, science became merely Hu’s own personal belief system.

TI  - Hypothetical Visible Bands of Advanced Meteorological Imager Onboard the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A Using Data-To-Data Translation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - True-color imagery of satellites provides various atmospheric and surface information for intuitive understanding and visualization. This article presents a conditional generative adversarial network method for generating daytime and nighttime hypothetical visible (VIS) bands of the advanced meteorological imager (AMI) sensor onboard the geostationary Korea multipurpose satellite. The AMI datasets in the form of albedo and brightness temperature (${{\boldsymbol{T}}}_{\boldsymbol{B}}$) were normalized and denormalized between 0 and 1 data-to-data (D2D) translation. The D2D model was trained and tested using data pair of the albedos at AMI VIS bands and AMI infrared (IR) bands or ${{\boldsymbol{T}}}_{\boldsymbol{B}}$ differences between two AMI IR bands. The constructed D2D model showed that the statistical results of bias, root-mean-square-error, and correlation coefficient between the observed and D2D-generated AMI VIS bands during daytime were -0.006 and 0.047 in albedo, and 0.941 for the blue band; -0.007 and 0.05 in albedo and 0.939 for the green band; -0.01 and 0.061 in albedo, and 0.917 for the red band, respectively. The proposed D2D method is being officially used by the Korea meteorological administration. Except for simulating desert areas as clouds at night, the D2D model demonstrated excellent performance, generating hypothetical AMI VIS bands at day and night. Consequently, this article could significantly contribute to the monitoring and understanding of meteorological phenomena over one-third of the Earth. Additionally, the method can be extended to other geostationary weather satellites, including Himawari-8, Fengyun-4A, meteosat third generation, and geostationary operational environmental satellites.

TI  - Monitoring Oasis Cotton Fields Expansion in Arid Zones Using the Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in the Ogan-Kucha River Oasis, Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate mapping of the spatial distribution of cotton fields is helpful to ensure safe production of cotton fields and the rationalization of land-resource planning. As cotton is an important economic pillar in Xinjiang, accurate and efficient mapping of cotton fields helps the implementation of rural revitalization strategy in Xinjiang region. In this paper, based on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, we use a random forest machine-learning algorithm to classify Landsat 5 and 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite images to obtain the spatial distribution characteristics of cotton fields in 2011, 2015 and 2020 in the Ogan-Kucha River oasis, Xinjiang. Unlike previous studies, the mulching process was considered when using cotton field phenology information as a classification feature. The results show that both Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellites can successfully classify cotton field information when the mulching process is considered, but Sentinel 2 satellite classification results have the best user accuracy of 0.947. Sentinel 2 images can distinguish some cotton fields from roads well because they have higher spatial resolution than Landsat 8. After the cotton fields were mulched, there was a significant increase in spectral reflectance in the visible, red-edge and near-infrared bands, and a decrease in the short-wave infrared band. The increase in the area of oasis cotton fields and the extensive use of mulched drip-irrigation water saving facilities may lead to a decrease in the groundwater level. Overall, the use of mulch as a phenological feature for classification mapping is a good indicator in cotton-growing areas covered by mulch, and mulch drip irrigation may lead to a decrease in groundwater levels in oases in arid areas.

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Technologies (ICAIT)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Cyanobacteria bloom is a kind of natural phenomenon that algae multiply and congregate in water body, which is the result of various meteorological factors to some extent. Based on Landsat remote sensing data from 1999 to 2018, planktonic algae index (FAI) method was used to identify and extract cyanobacteria bloom information in Dian Lake, then, the FAI values were classified according to the classification method of cyanobacteria bloom intensity in relevant literatures, and then the temporal and spatial distribution data of cyanobacteria bloom were obtained. Combined with the meteorological data of Kunming meteorological monitoring station and analyzed by SPSS software, the relationship between the temporal and spatial distribution of cyanobacteria bloom in Dian Lake and meteorological factors was obtained. The results show that during the 20 years from 1999 to 2018, Dian Lake Bloom generally occurred in the first half of the year in the northeastern, central and northern, and coastal parts of the Southern Open Sea of northern Caohai Lake, and in the second half of the year, Dian Lake Bloom spread from the northern part of the open sea to the Lake Center, the degree of bloom in Caohai has also increased, especially from June to August. It was found that the outbreak of blue-green algae in Dian Lake had a positive correlation with temperature and precipitation, but a negative correlation with sunshine hours.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a new scattering model to describe the polarimetric scattering information of the real part of T-23 in the coherency matrix. To achieve this goal, by combining the dihedral corner reflector scattering model and the polarimetric orientation angle (POA), a rotated dihedral scattering model is proposed. The proposed model is embedded into Singh's six-component decomposition model, and we further develop a seven-component decomposition model. The proposed method was validated by polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets acquired by the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and AIRSAR systems. The results show that, compared with the existing decomposition methods, the proposed method has a superior ability to distinguish oriented buildings from vegetation.

TI  - Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction Using Multi-scale Fusion Learning
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging is a promising imaging modality that simultaneously captures several images for the same scene on narrow spectral bands, and it has made considerable progress in different fields, such as agriculture, astronomy, and surveillance. However, the existing hyperspectral (HS) cameras sacrifice the spatial resolution for providing the detail spectral distribution of the imaged scene, which leads to low-resolution (LR) HS images compared with the common red-green-blue (RGB) images. Generating a high-resolution HS (HR-HS) image via fusing an observed LR-HS image with the corresponding HR-RGB image has been actively studied. Existing methods for this fusing task generally investigate hand-crafted priors to model the inherent structure of the latent HR-HS image, and they employ optimization approaches for solving it. However, proper priors for different scenes can possibly be diverse, and to figure it out for a specific scene is difficult. This study investigates a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based method for automatic prior learning, and it proposes a novel fusion DCNN model with multi-scale spatial and spectral learning for effectively merging an HR-RGB and LR-HS images. Specifically, we construct an U-shape network architecture for gradually reducing the feature sizes of the HR-RGB image (Encoder-side) and increasing the feature sizes of the LR-HS image (Decoder-side), and we fuse the HR spatial structure and the detail spectral attribute in multiple scales for tackling the large resolution difference in spatial domain of the observed HR-RGB and LR-HS images. Then, we employ multi-level cost functions for the proposed multi-scale learning network to alleviate the gradient vanish problem in long-propagation procedure. In addition, for further improving the reconstruction performance of the HR-HS image, we refine the predicted HR-HS image using an alternating back-projection method for minimizing the reconstruction errors of the observed LR-HS and HR-RGB images. Experiments on three benchmark HS image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both quantitative values and visual qualities.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study is aimed to examine ‘Park Saeng-gwang's painting focusing on the pursuit of Korean image’ from a humanities perspective based on empirical data. Until now, research on Park Saeng-gwang has been written within the framework that his painting expresses the beauty of the Korean people. Specifically, many of the papers focused on material and color in terms of the works’ forms or traditional elements such as folklore, shamanism, and folk painting in terms of the contents. Those studies were written while focusing on the point that Park Saeng-gwang sublimated our folklore or religious elements through the bold use of color in the aspects of reinterpreting tradition. It was attempted to find the meaning by stressing the aspect of rediscovering the beauty of Korea and reinstating our color painting; however, this author deems that it was not enough to interpret the fundamental ground of Park Saeng-gwang's works.It is difficult to analyze the true significance of his works without considering why he paid attention to shamanism in his later years and what he wanted to express through his works. Therefore, it should be prioritized to interpret the nature of shamanism, and we should never be too silly to analyze his works only fragmentarily.The meaning of Park Saeng-gwang's works is in the fact that he broke away from the existing worldview and restored the base culture of the Korean people with shamanism that other people were reluctant to pay attention to. Shamanism was what was despised by the ruling class in the Joseon Dynasty, persecuted as the people's faith during the Japanese colonial period, and underestimated as irrational superstition by Western values after the liberation; however, it has continued to exist till now with its tenacious vitality. For this reason, this study attempts to understand the nature of Korean image he pursued and extend the discussions that have been carried out by exploring shamanism preferentially.

TI  - Multisource Remote Sensing Classification for Coastal Wetland Using Feature Intersecting Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remote sensing monitoring of wetland ground objects is of great significance for ecological protection. In this letter, a convolutional neural network based on feature intersecting learning (FIL-CNN) is designed for wetland classification using multisource remote sensing data. The multi-layer shift feature fusion (MSFF) and attention feature selection (AFS) modules are designed to extract the complementary merits. Specifically, the MSFF is applied to each feature extraction unit, and the asymmetric information fusion is achieved through the spatial position shift of grouped features. Thus, the diversified feature representation is achieved. In the prediction stage, the AFS is executed to explore the channel mutually exclusive relationship between multisource features, resulting in emphasizing the meaningful features and eliminating the unnecessary ones. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FIL-CNN on the wetland datasets.

TI  - Long-Term Geomorphological Evolution of the Mouth Bar in the Modaomen Estuary of the Pearl River over the Last 55 Years (1964-2019)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on mass bathymetric data and remote sensing data in the Modaomen Estuary, this study explored the long-term evolutionary characteristics of the mouth bar in the Modaomen Estuary of the Pearl River from 1964 to 2019. In the past 55 years, due to the impact of human activities, such as shoal reclamation and estuarine regulation in the Modaomen Estuary, the river mouth moved out of the shallow sea covered by several islands and faced the South China Sea directly. Therefore, the mouth bay became a siltation center in the estuarine region and expanded outwards, gradually evolving a geomorphic pattern with three shallow shoals and two distributary branches; a west branch as the main branch accompanied by a small east branch. Over the past decade, high-intensity sand dredging activities in the mouth bar have led to a considerable deepening of the water depth and a significant refinement of bed sediments, forming a discharge pattern of a wide and shallow channel flowing into the sea. Therefore, the evolutionary characteristics of the mouth bar have become abnormal in recent years, so additional field bathymetric data and hydrological data are required for further research regarding the subsequent evolution of the mouth bar, against the background of a significant reduction of sediment discharge and high-intensity human activities.

TI  - SYMBOLIC CHANGES IN THE SPACE OF THE CITY: ADDRESS URBANONYMS OF KHMELNYTSKYI IN THE XX CENTURY
T2  - ISTORIYA-HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Symbols are a significant resource in preserving historical memory. Influencing the consciousness of people, they contribute to the unity of different ways of life, worldview values and individual human experience. In the complex nature of symbols ideological, educational and spiritual potential lies, taking into account a culture of memory formed. The names of the streets of Khmelnitsky city in the twentieth century received an ideological connotation and were intended to fulfill the function of demonstrating the symbolic strength of Soviet power. Many streets of the city were named after a certain person. The symbolic marking of the streets of Khmelnitsky is significantly focused on the militarist component. In such conditions, the symbolic image of the city lost its uniqueness, acquired universal features that were inherent in many average Ukrainian cities of the Soviet period. An analysis of the symbolism of the modern city of Khmelnytskyi testifies to significant shifts towards the democratization of this process and the ideological decolonization of the toponymic system of verbal markers. Historical amnesia remained virtually unchanged in relation to the multicultural issues of Khmelnytskyi in the past.

TI  - Possibilities of Implementing the Transhumanism Experience into Educational Domain
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of possibilities of implementing the experience of transhumanism into the educational sphere. It is concluded that education, as a culturally creative component of society and human life, not only transfers the experience of the past, but also outlines the orientations of the future, preparing a person for life in a society where intellectual resources and innovations play a decisive role. Its effectiveness is predetermined by the degree to which a person is prepared for changes, effective actions to solve the contradictions of social development. Methodological potential of the experience of transhumanism in educational development has been revealed in this research as the realities of the present form a number of new challenges to education.The concept of transhumanism focuses the educational process upon the need to find and create identical and cultural forms by the human being according to social requests; it points up the worldview-axiological and purposeful foundations of human objective reality. In the educational domain, the methodological possibilities of transhumanism are directed to the discovery of the individual nature of a human being. Educational activity is increasingly focused upon developing learning capacity which is considered as a process of self-knowledge, self-creation, self-building of the environment and a human being. The interaction of a human being and the world implies a state of creative inspiration.

AB  - Satellites allow spatially precise monitoring of the Earth, but provide only limited information on events of societal impact. Subjective societal impact, however, may be quantified at a high frequency by monitoring social media data. In this work, we propose a multi-modal data fusion framework to accurately identify periods of COVID-19-related lockdown in the United Kingdom using satellite observations (NO2 measurements from Sentinel-5P) and social media (textual content of tweets from Twitter) data. We show that the data fusion of the two modalities improves the event detection accuracy on a national level and for large cities such as London.

AB  - The development of machinery and artificial intelligence due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution has led to changes in the labor market by replacing human labor. In addition, the superintelligence of artificial intelligence has resulted in artificial intelligence solving problems on its own. However, the development of artificial intelligence and technology has resulted in threatening human dignity. Changes in human society indicated the need for educational transformation. The purpose of this study is to interpret future education based on  reformed beliefs and Christian worldviews to consider 'Human Dignity', 'Community Competency', 'Unselfish Concern' necessary for future education. 'Human Dignity', 'Community Competency', 'Unselfish Concern' necessary for future education interpreted based on  reformed beliefs and Christian worldviews can be interpreted as follows. In the case of an understanding of human dignity, it starts from the creatures created in the form of God. And, in the case of Unselfish Concern can be understood as a right to respect and treatment as an object created in the form of God. Also, in the case of community competency, it can be understood that humans created in the form of God cooperate for the development of the community through consideration and communication with others.

Global forests are influenced by legacies of past inter-annual temperature variability. Environmental Research:Ecology 1, 011001.  Abstract: Inter-annual climate variability (hereafter climate variability) is increasing in many forested regions with climate change. This variability could have larger near-term impacts on forests than decadal shifts in mean climate, but how forests will respond remains poorly resolved, particularly at broad scales. Individual trees and even forest communities often have traits and ecological strategies - the legacies of exposure to past variable conditions - that confer tolerance to subsequent climate variability. However, whether local legacies also shape global forest responses is unknown. Our objective was to assess how past and current climate variability influences global forest productivity. We hypothesized forests exposed to large climate variability in the past would better tolerate current climate variability than forests where past climate was relatively stable. We used historical (1950-1969) and contemporary (2000-2019) temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure deficit and the remotely-sensed Enhanced Vegetation Index to quantify how historical and contemporary climate variability relate to patterns of contemporary forest productivity. Consistent with our hypothesis, forests exposed to large temperature variability in the past were more tolerant of contemporary temperature variability than forests where past temperatures were less variable. Forests were 19-fold less sensitive to contemporary temperature variability where historical inter-annual temperature variability was 0.66°C (2 standard deviations) greater than the global average historical temperature variability. We also found that larger increases in temperature variability between the two study periods often eroded the tolerance conferred by legacy effects of historical temperature variability. However, the hypothesis was not supported in the case of precipitation and vapor pressure deficit variability, potentially due to physiological tradeoffs inherent in how trees cope with dry conditions. We conclude that sensitivity of forest productivity to imminent increases in temperature variability may be partially predictable based on legacies of past conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the characteristics of the temporal changes of ecological environment quality in the mining area of the Ili Valley from 2013-2021 to provide a scientific basis for improving the ecological environment in the region. Based on 5 issues of Landsat8 OLI data from 2013-2021, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was constructed by using principal component analysis and selecting Normalised differential vegetation index (NDVI), the wetness component of the tasseled cap transformation (WET), the dryness index synthesised by the building index and the normalised difference soil index (NDSI), and the land surface temperature (LST). The RSEI is classified into 5 levels by reclassification, and the centre of gravity migration of RSEI levels I-V is analysed according to the centre of gravity migration method, and the spatial change pattern of RSEI is analysed to realise the dynamic monitoring and evaluation of ecological environment quality in the mining area of Ili Valley by using RSEI. The experimental results show that: (i) The ecological environment condition of the mining area in the Ili Valley is significantly improved in 2013-2021, in which the area with an increasing trend accounts for 38.36% of the total area of the mining area, and the NDVI and WET have a greater impact on the ecological environment quality of the mining area; (ii) The ecological environment quality of the mining area is mainly level I, II and III, and the migration of level IV and V is larger and the centre of gravity moves to the northeast and southeast of the mining area. The ecological and environmental quality of the mining area in the Ili Valley shows a general upward trend from 2013 to 2021, which is influenced by the growth of vegetation and human activity factors.

AB  - To adopt sustainable crop practices in changing climate, understanding the climatic parameters and water requirements with vegetation is crucial on a spatiotemporal scale. The Planetscope (PS) constellation of more than 130 nanosatellites from Planet Labs revolutionize the high-resolution vegetation assessment. PS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps are one of the highest resolution data that can transform agricultural practices and management on a large scale. High-resolution PS nanosatellite data was utilized in the current study to monitor agriculture's spatiotemporal assessment for the Al-Qassim region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The time series of NDVI was utilized to assess the vegetation pattern change in the study area. The current study area has sparse vegetation, and exposed soil exhibits brightness due to low soil moisture, constraining NDVI. Therefore, a machine learning (ML) based Random Forest (RF) classification model was used to compare the vegetation extent and computational cost of NDVI. The RF model has been compared with NDVI in the current investigation. It is one of the most precise classification methods because it can model the complexity of input variables, handle outliers, treat noise effectively, and avoid overfitting. Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was implemented to compare the performance of both NDVI and RFbased classification. RF model provided good accuracy (98%) for all vegetation classes based on user accuracy, producer accuracy, and kappa coefficient.

AB  - From among philosophical concepts of explanation those referring to causes have been the most influential. The aim of this paper it to show that a particular kind of causal explanations, namely dispositional explanations are particularly suited to explain the workings of the world. Apart from purely philosophical arguments, I claim that the view treating dispositions as important elements of the basic ontology of nature is in line with the Christian worldview and the ways God impacts the world. Also, this paper shows that dispositional explanations are not only appropriate in the domains studied by natural sciences but also in the ones being under investigation in social sciences, and thus the case of economics.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of a chlorophyll-a based biomass index and influence of coastal sources of enrichment in the Algerian Basin
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the spatial distribution and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) biomass in the Algerian Basin (AB) along its meridional and cross-shore dimensions, focusing on coastal enrichments. After correcting most atmospheric disturbances in the daily MODIS Level-2 data series between 2003 and 2018, a fortnightly climatology of 1-km resolution Chl-a has been generated to account for specific coastal features previously poorly evidenced from 4-km Level-3 data. The AB is characterised by two extreme seasons of high and low biomass, separated by sharp transitions, that characterise the offshore domain. The coastal area (< 10 km) reveals an intense and distinct dynamic associated with highly productive local hotspots rather than seasonal variability. A biomass index is proposed as the horizontally integrated Chl-a concentration from the coastline to the most offshore extension of the 0.5 mg m(-3) Chl-a isopleth. This index separately quantifies the cumulative biomass of both offshore and coastal domains with large alongshore variability. Low values (< 5 g m(-2)) were observed in the offshore area during summer and high values during the spring blooms (up to 40 g m(-2)), while maximum values (> 50 g m(-2)) were locally observed in the coastal domain. The narrow coastal area alone represents 44% of the total biomass, with coastal hotspots where the enrichment is up to 5 times higher than offshore. Multivariate modelling of the potential factors favouring coastal enrichments shows that the phytoplanktonic biomass in coastal waters is mainly associated with enrichments from wadis and seasonally from city sewage as well as by the presence of a bay. A separate source of enrichment is undoubtedly associated with the presence of aquaculture cages.

TI  - Coping with Dismantling Forces: Traditional Management and Transformations of Szekely-Hungarian Village Commons of Transylvania, in the 16-21th Centuries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Szekelyfold region of Transylvania, Romania is a unique social-ecological system and a traditional farming landscape with rich biological and cultural diversity. Commons institutions have ancient roots here, and are still prevalent today. In this paper, we attempt to give an overview of the traditional organisation, accelerating challenges, transformations and reorganisations of the Szekely commons over their history based on existing literature, covering the interval between the 16th and 21th centuries. Based on this overview, we also identify key drivers for resilience that counteracted dismantling forces, to account for the long persistence and transformability of these institutions. We found that between the end of the 16th and the mid-19th centuries, Szekely commons showed remarkable stability in their functioning based on village bylaws, and these documents also demonstrate that most communities could be characterised by Ostrom's design principles in this period. From the 19th century, the pressures of state centralisation, market integration, new technologies, population growth, polarisation and changing values intensified, creating significant dismantling forces. However. Szekely commons survived, and we argue that the harsh mountainous environment and isolation, coupled with locally rooted identity, worldview and a rich institutional memory, and also the traditional notions of equity and the widespread availability of common resources constituted elements of resilience, which helped to prevent dissolution. We conclude that as direct human-nature links lie at the heart of many of the identified drivers for resilience, nurturing these links seems essential for the survival of traditional local institutions and management practices that maintain biological and cultural diversity in a globalised world.

Biodiversitas 23: 514-520. Benthic habitats have very high complexity and are home to many types of aquatic organisms. Benthic habitats have various functions, including habitat for flora and fauna, sediment traps, nursery areas, and foraging areas for aquatic fauna that are susceptible to damage due to human activities or natural factors. Therefore, more accurate spatial information is needed. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of object-based classification techniques for mapping shallow waters benthic habitats using Sentinel 2A imagery. The two classification algorithms used are support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The input image layer (IIL) used for classification is the natural color band (Band 432). The results showed that the SVM and RF classification algorithms could classify eight classes of benthic habitats. The overall accuracy (OA) of the SVM algorithm is 65%, while the RF accuracy is 67%, with kappa values of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively. The significant test applied to Sentinel 2 images with SVM and RF algorithms for benthic habitats has a Z test value of-0.41. These results indicate that the classification results between the SVM and RF algorithms are not significantly different.

TI  - Integrating geospatial techniques and field survey to assess the changing nature of meander movements and meander geometry of Raidak-I River in the Himalayan foothills, West Bengal
T2  - BULLETIN OF GEOGRAPHY-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel migration and resultant meander movements are the two important fluvial processes found in the riparian environment of a river basin. The present research explores the changing nature of the meander movements and meander geometry of the Raidak-I River in the Himalayan foothill region using geospatial tools. The study incorporated Landsat data (satellite imageries) for the years 1972, 1980, 1988, 2004, 2012 and 2021 and the whole study has been segmented into five periods i.e., 1972-1980, 1980-1988, 1988-2004, 2004-2012 and 2012-2021 to examine which type of meander movement dominates in the Raidak-I River within a particular time frame and how the nature of the meander movements is being changed over time. Bank lines of different periods have been superimposed with the help of the overlay analysis method in ArcGIS software (Version 10.8) to obtain the results. Furthermore, Arc-Extension tools have also been used to measure the meander geometry. Twelve active river bends have been identified to study meander geometry of sinuosity indices, meander length, meander width, meander-ratio, channel width and radius of curvature from 1972 to 2021. Initially, lateral movements predominated but, in the late-stage, rotational movement became much more prominent, which indicates dynamicity of the river channel in recent time. The cross-sectional study revealed that a convex bank has frequently been replaced with a concave bank and vice versa. The study finds human intervention - especially the construction of embankments is the main reason behind such meander dynamics. The method we have used here is very simple, and thus can be considered for any part of the world and is very beneficial for identifying suitable sites for embankment construction, river restoration and channel management.

TI  - REIMAGINING PUBLIC SAFETY
T2  - NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, abolitionists were repeatedly asked to explain what they meant by "abolish the police "-the idea so seemingly foreign that its literal meaning evaded interviewers. The narrative rapidly turned to the abolitionists' secondary proposals, as interviewers quickly jettisoned the idea of literally abolishing the police. What the incredulous journalists failed to see was that abolishing police and prisons is not aimed merely at eliminating the collateral consequences of other social ills. Abolitionists seek to build a society in which policing and incarceration are unnecessary. Rather than a society without a means of protecting public safety, abolitionists desire a society where the entire public is safe. That safety requires security in all our material needs, not merely protection from private violence. Abolition democracy challenges us to envision a society where all people have the respect, education, economic resources, civil rights, and franchise necessary to participate fully in all significant aspects of public life-a society in which we are both safe and free. This challenge to our worldview is further compounded by the prevalence of inequality and a culture of violence in American society. In this Article, I meet that challenge with a groundbreaking look at how such a vision requires us to look at public safety not as a zero-sum game between liberty and security, but as a collaborative promotion of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for all.

TI  - Linear Feature-Based Triangulation for Large-Scale Orthophoto Generation Over Mechanized Agricultural Fields
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with imaging and ranging sensors have become an effective remote sensing data acquisition tool for digital agriculture. Among potential products derived from UAVs, high-resolution orthophotos play an important role in several phenotyping activities, such as canopy cover estimation and flowering date identification. Current structure from motion (SfM) tools for image-based 3-D reconstruction and orthophoto generation cannot perform well when working with large-scale imagery over mechanized agricultural fields. This failure is mainly due to their inability to identify enough conjugate points among overlapping images captured at low altitudes. This study addresses such limitation through a new strategy that uses plant row segments as linear features in the triangulation process. The linear features are derived in two steps. First, an automated approach is implemented to extract plant row segments from the LiDAR data which are then back-projected to the imagery using available trajectory and system calibration parameters. In the second step, a machine-assisted strategy is used to adjust the line segments in image space for deriving accurate linear features. In the proposed framework, the triangulation process is conducted by investigating two mathematical models-referred to as object-space and image-space coplanarity constraints-for incorporating linear features in the bundle adjustment (BA). The orthophoto is generated using the refined trajectory and system calibration parameters derived from the BA process. Several experimental results over an agricultural filed show that the proposed framework outperforms commonly used SfM tools, e.g., Pix4D Mapper Pro and Agisoft Metashape in terms of generating orthophotos with high visual quality and geolocation accuracy. Also, results indicate that the object-space coplanarity constraint is more robust against potential noise in line measurements when compared to the image-space coplanarity model. However, both models lead to high absolute accuracy in the range of +/- 2-4 cm when the noise level in the image measurements of points along the line is reasonable, i.e., similar to 5-10 pixels.

T2  - ACTA MONTANISTICA SLOVACA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Absheron Peninsula is the biggest urbanized area in Azerbaijan. Along with the growth of the massive oil production, the role of the Peninsula has increased, and big ecological problems have arisen. In this research, the investigation of the possibility of detecting hydrocarbons in sandy soil through Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 A satellite and drone images and chemical analysis was conducted. The main study was based on the satellite imagery of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A, employing NDVI calculations and analyses. In order to calculate NDVI, ESRI ArcGIS 10.3 software has been used. The multispectral images with 30m spatial resolution of Landsat 8 and 10 m resolution multispectral images of Sentinel 2 were used. Additionally, drone observations lead to obtaining high-resolution data about soil pollution in the study area. Also, field samples were taken to the laboratory, and necessary chemical analysis was performed for validation purposes.This study showed that multispectral remote sensing can be used to detect hydrocarbons in the soil in oil production areas. Hydrocarbon-bearing substances' absorption into the soil results in a low value of NDVI in the study area. The observations in the winter and summer seasons show that the seasonal changes in weather conditions affect both the amount of oil contamination in the soil and the detection process of soil pollution by oil using remote sensing.

TI  - ON ONE MORE CONCEPT OF "NEOLITHIC" BASED ON THE POSTMODERNISM APPROACH
T2  - ARHEOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Valerii Manko and Guram Chkhatarashvili published their article in the "Arheologia", No. 2, 2022. In the paper, they discussed the migration of bearers of four Neolithic flint industries from Southwest Asia through the Caucasus to the south of Eastern Europe from the final Pleistocene to the early Atlantic. According to the authors, stable connections between these remote areas led to the emergence of four "information networks", which they called "Cultural-Historical Regions" (CHR). The authors believe that the first region of such type in human history was the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) in the Near East. Therefore, they call the "theoretical basis" of their study "the idea of understanding the Neolithic as an epoch of the formation of global information networks, within which innovations created in the Near and Middle East were disseminated."V. Manko began to develop the described theoretical views in 2010 when he wrote that the reason for the emergence of the CHR is the ability to communicate, formed due to the mental changes of inhabitants of the PPNA large settlements. The statement about specific psyche and worldview as the basis of Neolithic has been expressed as an idea of Post-Processual archaeology long before V. Manko announced it. In particular, Trevor Watkins developed this concept in detail. However, V. Manko does not mention works by any post-processualists in his publications.The statement about the formation of the ability to communicate only in the Neolithic is V. Manko's novelty. He based it on one reference to a publication of Alexey N. Sorokin, who allegedly claimed that the bearers of different flint industries did not contact each other in the central part of European Russia in the Mesolithic. V. Manko misinterpreted this particular subjective observation and gave it the meaning of a global pattern. Thus, his definition of the Neolithic is controversial, because of using this erroneous premise. Generally, V. Manko's theoretical reasoning is full of contradictions, logical errors, terminological chaos, and rhetoric in the postmodernism style. It is noteworthy that V. Manko himself does not fully adhere to his previous theoretical views in his later works.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluations of cancer etiology and safety and effectiveness of cancer treatments are predicated on large numbers of patients with sufficient baseline and follow-up data. To assess feasibility of FDA's Sentinel System's electronic healthcare data for surveillance of malignancy onset and examination of product safety, this study examined patterns of enrollment surrounding new-onset cancers.METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort of patients based on administrative claims, we identified incident events of 19 cancers among 292.5 million health plan members from January 2000 to February 2020 using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes. Annual incident cases were stratified by sex, age, medical and drug coverage, and insurer type. Descriptive statistics were calculated for observable time prior to and following diagnosis.RESULTS: We identified 10,697,573 incident cancer events among members with medical coverage. When drug coverage was additionally required, number of incident cancers was reduced by 41%. Medicare data contributed 61% of cases, with similar duration trends as other insurers. Mean duration of follow-up prior to diagnosis ranged from 4.0 to 4.6 years, whereas follow-up post diagnosis ranged from 1.1 to 3.3 years. Approximately a third (36.1%) had at least 2 years both prior to and following diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: The FDA Sentinel System's electronic healthcare data may be useful for characterizing relatively short latency cancer risk, examining cancer drug utilization and safety after diagnosis, and conducting surveillance for acute adverse events among patients with cancers.IMPACT: A national distributed system with electronic health data, the Sentinel system provides opportunity for rapid pharmacoepidemiologic assessments relevant in oncology.

AB  - Jean-Philippe Rameau's music-theoretical concepts were pathbreaking for the development of harmony. However, his ideas are partially inspired by the natural philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This article examines several aspects of the contemporary understanding of nature - especially Newton's and Descartes' perspectives - that can also be found in Rameau's Traite de l'harmonie (1722) and Generation harmonique (1737). As a result, it is revealed that the concepts of impulses and cyclic motion around a center are essential in both a mechanistic worldview as well as in Rameau's musical thought.

AB  - A measurement called "local spot scan (LSS)" reveals the detailed local performance of the X-ray Mirror Assembly (XMA) of the XRISM satellite. A 6.4 keV 10 mm x10 mm pencil beam was tiled across the mirror aperture. We extracted three local performance metrics at each spot: effective area (EA), image shift, and image profile. The EA maps on the aperture of all the quadrants (QTs) are quantitatively very similar to each other. The inner region has two times larger local EA than the outer one because of the difference in reflectivity at shallower incident angles. The pattern of the image shift is different per QT. The pattern indicates systematic shifts of reflectors by the reflector alignment structures rather than random shifts, and most area of the XMA aperture has a longer focal length than the design. The image profile was quantified using the Half Power Diameter (HPD). There is much less variation in the HPD maps than in the image shift. The inner region has better HPD because of its better conical approximation and figure error of the reflectors. Patterns visible in the HPD maps are associated with alignment structures at a certain radial range. The local performances acquired by the LSS will be compiled into the Calibration Data Base (Ca1DB) files.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Advanced Land Observing Satellite-3 (ALOS-3) is one of the follow-on missions of ALOS, also called "DAICHI" (2006-2011), and it takes over the optical mission from ALOS. The goal of the ALOS-3 mission is to contribute to the disaster monitoring and updating of geo-spatial information, as well as the environmental monitoring of coastal and vegetation areas. The main payload of ALOS-3 is an optical camera, named wide-swath and high-resolution optical imager (WISH). It has a resolution of 80 cm (panchromatic) and 3.2 m (multispectral) at nadir together with a wide-swath of 70 km by employing an off-axis large FMA (Four Mirror Anastigmat) telescope. The detectors on the focal plane are TDI-CCDs, with observational bands of panchromatic and six multispectral bands, including "coastal (0.40 - 0.45 mu m)" and "RedEdge (0.69 - 0.74 mu m)" in addition to red, green, blue, and near-inferred.In order to achieve high optical performance, the technical challenges specific to this satellite telescope have been required in all the processes of design, manufacturing, and testing. This paper presents an overview of the WISH and the development result of each process. All the processes have been completed without critical problems, and all the required pre-flight performance has been verified and reviewed.

TI  - Application of Feature Tracking Using <i>K</i>-Nearest-Neighbor Vector Field Consensus in Sea Ice Tracking
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A feature-tracking algorithm algorithm utilizing the proposed K-nearest-neighbor vector field consensus (KVFC) to filter outliers is developed to monitor the dynamic changes of sea ice retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The KVFC is based on vector field consensus and combines with local neighborhood correspondences to optimize the elimination of outliers while retaining inliers as many as possible. The proposed KVFC was evaluated and compared with several algorithms on three standard datasets and Sentinel-1 image pairs in the Fram Strait and the Beaufort Sea. The KVFC obtained more sea-ice drift vectors than the nearest neighbor similarity ratio (NNSR) with a 0.7 threshold and generated dense distribution of sea-ice drift vectors combined with the HH and HV channels. Using buoy datasets to calculate the sea-ice drift speed and evaluate algorithm performance, the proposed approach yielded a lower mean error (KVFC: -0.150 cm/s, NNSR: 0.407 cm/s), lower root mean square error (KVFC: 0.476 cm/s, NNSR: 1.817 cm/s), and lower angle deviation (KVFC: 3.542 degrees, NNSR: 10.318 degrees) compared to the NNSR.

TI  - Bayesian Temporal Tensor Factorization-Based Interpolation for Time-Series Remote Sensing Data With Large-Area Missing Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is widely used in the field of time-series remote sensing. However, due to the influence of cloud cover, the large area of LST data observation is missing, which seriously affects the later data analysis. In the past research, various effective interpolation methods have been developed, but they usually cannot effectively interpolate the image data with large observation missing. In this article, a new method for interpolating these missing data called Hilbert tensor rearrangement with Bayesian temporal tensor factorization (HTR-BTTF) is proposed. This method requires tensor rearrangement of remote sensing data, combined with BTTF method for interpolation. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we select three real study areas with different climates, Wuhan, Harbin, and Kunming LST data during day and night, and add cloud covers with different sizes to the cold and warm season layers each year. BTTF, inverse distance weighted (IDW), harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS), and GapFill are used as comparison methods. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) is a comprehensive evaluation index of interpolation results. Experiments have shown that HTR-BTTF is an effective method for interpolating missing observations, which is better than other methods. In the simulation experiment of the largest cloud cover size, on average, the RMSE of the data filled using the HTR-BTTF method was 17.2% lower than that of BTTF and 54.9% lower than that of the GapFill method, and it shows good robustness and high accuracy.

AB  - With the development of oil/gas production, its adverse impact has drawn much attention. Therefore, automated detecting oil/gas well sites become important. Current research has been focused on detection using sole source RGB images, which was not the common case in remote sensing. In this study, we explored the use of a combination of the Residual Channel Attention Network (RCAN) and the state-of-the-art object detection method, You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4, to detect oil/gas well sites from multi-sensor images. To testify the feasibility of the combination, we selected 18 RapidEye and 15 WorldView images which cover the oil sands area in Alberta, Canada. We applied a pre-trained RCAN to unify the spatial resolution of different images to 2m/pixel. To maximize the feature space, we preserved 5 bands which were available in both images. YOLO v4 was applied on cropped image patches to detect oil/gas well sites. The experiment results showed that using the framework proposed in this study, oil/gas well sites can be localized accurately although the bounding boxes of the sites may not perfectly align with the objects.

TI  - Applying the New MODIS-Based Precipitable Water Vapor Retrieval Algorithm Developed in the North Hemisphere to the South Hemisphere
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new algorithm to retrieve water vapor from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared (NIR) channels using the ensemble-based empirical regression model, which was developed based on the North Hemisphere (western North America) data, was for the first time applied and validated to the South Hemisphere, mainly the Australia and its surrounding regions. By employing the empirical regression algorithm to retrieve water vapor from MODIS Level 1 reflectance data, the wet bias of MODIS product has been significantly reduced. Validation against global positioning system (GPS) water vapor observations over the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 in and around Australia shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) of water vapor data obtained from MODIS/Terra has reduced by 58.53x0025; from 5.712 to 2.369 mm when using two-channel ratio transmittance and has reduced by 56.14x0025; to 2.505 mm when using three-channel ratio transmittance. For the data obtained from MODIS/Aqua, the RMSE has reduced by 49.17x0025; from 5.170 to 2.628 mm using two-channel ratio transmittance and has reduced by 46.60x0025; to 2.761 mm using three-channel ratio transmittance, respectively. In addition, validations of the retrieved water vapor results over such a large research area (0x00B0;-55x00B0;S in latitude and 95x00B0;-180x00B0;E in longitudes) also show no temporal or spatial dependence, implying that the algorithm is homogeneous, accurate, and robust.

AB  - Due to obtaining Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) thermal infrared remote sensing (TIRS) data being difficult, a few works are proposed based on TIRS images. In addition, these mosaic methods usually face dislocation and distortion problems when facing a large number of TIRS images. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a mosaic method for large-amount TIRS images with less distortion. By using the prior sequence and coordinates information recorded during UAV flight, we can obtain a reliable panoramic image. We build a UAV TIRS image dataset containing a total of 500 images, and we conduct experiments on this dataset. Our method achieves low RMSE value and satisfying mosaicked results, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

AB  - Calibration accuracy can affect the interpretation of microwave radiometer observations and it is the premise of quantitative microwave remote sensing. To calibrate the microwave radiometers is to establish a quantitative relationship between output (voltage or voltage digital) and input noise temperature. On-orbit calibration uses the calibration target of the sensor and the cold space as reference sources. It has been found that the performance of the same microwave instrument will be degraded with the aging components. Observations from microwave instruments of different satellite generations may be inconsistent, and with different systems the receiving radiance for the same atmospheric scene could be also different. To calibrate the microwave payloads onboard FengYun satellite, the calibration/validation is performed based on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) retrievals, focusing on the sounding mechanisms of microwave and the GNSS occultation payloads on FengYun polar-orbiting meteorological satellites. For GNSS occultation data, the detection accuracy above 3 km is better than that of the microwave radiometer. Within the time window of 30 min and the spatial resolution of 0.5 degree both in latitude and longitude, the brightness temperature deviation is better than 3 K for clear sky. The results show that the FengYun meteorological satellite can not only provide global all-weather temperature and humidity profiles but also realize self-cross-calibration for microwave sounders with complementary instruments onboard.

AB  - This paper aims at Radiation characteristics of brightness temperatures over the Tibetan Plateau observed by the FY-3C/D Microwave humidity and temperature sounder (MWHTS) oxygen absorbing channels. To demonstrate the characteristics of the data over Plateau site, time series of monthly averages of the brightness temperatures are constructed for January, April, July, and October. The measured uncertainty distributions of brightness temperatures with frequencies centered at 118.75 GHz are investigated in terms of nonlinear-calibration inaccuracy, antenna pattern correction and angular-dependent cohesive noise mitigation. Data used in this study are collected for 2014 for one month in each season with humidity analysis is described in detail.

AB  - The MWHTS onboard FY-3C/D/E satellite has 15 channels at frequencies ranging from 89-191 GHz, which allows simultaneous retrieval of the atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles with good temporal and spatial sampling under all weather and all day. On-orbit, without the benefit of known calibration sources at intermediate brightness temperatures (such as were available during T/V testing), it is not possible to directly measure the nonlinearity. But, the nonlinearity correction is a function of the physical temperature of the detectors. So, on-orbit, we will rely on temperature readings from temperature sensors located near the detectors to determine the correction values to apply. Depending on the magnitude of the estimated nonlinearity and its rate of change, a decision can be made regarding how often the correction value needs to be updated. This has potential implications for climate data records.

AB  - Radiation characteristics of brightness temperatures over the PUER rain forest observed by the FY-3C/D Microwave humidity and temperature sounder (MWHTS) oxygen absorbing channels are studied. To demonstrate the characteristics of the data over PUER rain forest site, time series of monthly averages of the brightness temperatures are constructed for August from 2013 to 2020. The measured uncertainty distributions of brightness temperatures with frequencies centered at 118.75 GHz are investigated in terms of angular-dependent cohesive noise mitigation. Observations data used in this study are collected from April 2019 to March 2020 every orbit for FY-3C/D satellites. Such a close resemblance and stable pattern of uncertainty distributions from the two satellites with different equator crossing times are potentially useful for post launch calibration of future microwave radiometers. Results show that there are cohesive distributions in measurements during PUER observing from each satellite. Therefore these measurements provide a practical approach to obtain the calibrated model of inter-satellite data.

TI  - Evaluation and Validation of the Net Primary Productivity of the Zoige Wetland Based on Grazing Coupled Remote Sensing Process Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Zoige wetland is located in the southeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in recent years, the wetland local area grassland productivity decline, land sanding, and other serious degradation phenomenon. Using remote sensing and hydrology data combined with the basic principles of vegetation ecology, we applied the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model to invert the net primary productivity (NPP) of the Zoige wetland ecosystem and then identified the deficiencies of the two models. In this article, we tested the factors that influence the light use efficiency of vegetation and considered the effects of livestock grazing on grassland ecosystems and wetland moisture content on vegetation growth. A new grazing coupled remote sensing process (GCRSP) model suitable for the productivity of the Zoige wetland was proposed. Field survey data were combined with the CASA model, BEPS model, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NPP product, and the accuracy of the proposed GCRSP model was analyzed at regional level. The results show that after fitting the field measurements to the GCRSP model, the fitted variance between the model and the measured data is 0.84, which is larger than the variance between the other two methods and the measured data. In addition, the variance of the linear fit between the GCRSP model and the MODIS NPP product was 0.11, which was relatively small, indicating that the regional-scale GCRSP model was relatively accurate for the Zoige wetland NPP. Therefore, this model was suitable for the inversion of regional-scale NPP. The results indicated that the average grassland NPP of the Zoige wetland was 487.57 gC/m(2), and larger NPP values were distributed near the rivers and wetland and smaller NPP values were distributed in the mountain glacier and desertified land areas. These results were consistent with the regional characteristics. This article provided technical and theoretical support for the desertification management of the Zoige grassland and a new method for studying vegetation NPP, and the findings could help improve the accuracy of regional-scale vegetation NPP estimates.

TI  - Investigation of Polarimetric Decomposition for Arctic Summer Sea Ice Classification Using Gaofen-3 Fully Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article was to investigate the potential of polarimetric decomposition of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) C-band fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data for Arctic sea ice classification during summer season. Five different polarimetric decomposition approaches, including the Cloude-Pottier decomposition (Cloude), the Freeman three-component decomposition (Freeman3), the Freeman three-component decomposition using the extended Bragg model (Freeman3X), the Yamaguchi three-component decomposition (Yamaguchi3), and the nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition (NNED) were analyzed using 35 scenes of GF-3 PolSAR data collected over the Fram Strait, Arctic from June 14-18, 2017. Polarimetric features extracted from these five methods were evaluated and utilized to train random forest classifiers to classify open water (calm water and rough water) and sea ice types (melted ice, unmelted ice, and deformed ice). The results show that NNED could ensure physically valid decomposed powers while the other three model-based decompositions had negative values. In terms of sea ice classification, NNED had the highest feature importance scores and achieved an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of about 86.18% and 0.82, respectively. Inclusion of radar incidence angle as a feature in the classifier could slightly improve the classification accuracy by about 3%. The influence of incidence angle on sea ice classification accuracy was also investigated and it was found that high incidence angles (39 degrees-46 degrees) were superior to low incidence angles (21 degrees-27 degrees) due to the overall higher accuracies.

TI  - Multi-Object Tracking in Satellite Videos With Graph-Based Multitask Modeling
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, satellite video has become an emerging means of earth observation, providing the possibility of tracking moving objects. However, the existing multi-object trackers are commonly designed for natural scenes without considering the characteristics of remotely sensed data. In addition, most trackers are composed of two independent stages of detection and reidentification (ReID), which means that they cannot be mutually promoted. To this end, we propose an end-to-end online framework, which is called TGraM, for multi-object tracking in satellite videos. It models multi-object tracking as a graph information reasoning procedure from the multitask learning perspective. Specifically, a graph-based spatiotemporal reasoning module is presented to mine the potential high-order correlations between video frames. Furthermore, considering the inconsistency of optimization objectives between detection and ReID, a multitask gradient adversarial learning strategy is designed to regularize each task-specific network. In addition, aiming at the data scarcity in this field, a large-scale and high-resolution Jilin-1 satellite video dataset for multi-object tracking (AIR-MOT) is built for the experiments. Compared with state-of-the-art multi-object trackers, TGraM achieves efficient collaborative learning between detection and ReID, improving the tracking accuracy by 1.2 multiple object tracking accuracy. The code and dataset will be available online (https://github.com/HeQibin/TGraM).

AB  - Agriculture is the largest water user worldwide, the water it consumes is far more than other kinds of water consumption. Although the potential role of agriculture in international water conflict can be inferred from the existing literature, few research have comprehensively investigated it. The main reason is the scarcity of agricultural land data for each country within shared river basins. This study fills this gap by creatively using remotely sensed data, and empirically examines the impact of agriculture on conflicts over international river basins from 2001 to 2007 in Asia. We calculate the area of agricultural land for each country within specific international river basins based on Moderatere-solution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover data and Transboundary Freshwater Spatial Database (TFSD). The results testify to the role of agriculture in international water conflict.

AB  - Agricultural aid is crucial for sub-Saharan Africa to promote agricultural development as countries in this region usually lack sufficient investment to agricultural sectors and farmers. Yet, its effectiveness is still under debated. The conventional empirical literature mostly rely on data of agricultural production and GDP. However, collecting these data is time-consuming. As such, they tend to be outdated, poorly reflecting the effectiveness of agricultural aid timely. This study creatively employs remotely-sensed data to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural aid in sub-Saharan Africa. We use Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) third generation NDVI (NDVI3g) dataset from 2001 to 2012. The results demonstrate the advantages of remotely sensed data.

AB  - The weight function (WF) of the microwave radiometer channel plays an important role in the development of the theory of microwave remote sensing and the design of microwave remote sensing instruments. A deep neural network (DNN) is used to describe the relationship between the atmospheric parameters and the channel WF for Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) onboard Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite, and a DNN-based WF calculation model is developed. The experimental results show that the calculated results of WF for MWHTS from the DNN-based WF calculation model are almost equal to those of the traditional radiative transfer model, and the accuracy of the distribution of the peak WF height is high. In addition, the DNN-based WF calculation model has higher computational efficiency compared with the traditional radiative transfer model.

M3  - Article
AB  - Both the Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) and the Microwave Temperature Sounder-II (MWTS-II) operate on the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellite platform, which provides an opportunity to retrieve the sea surface barometric pressure (SSP) with high accuracy by fusing the observations from the 60 GHz, 118.75 GHz, and 183.31 GHz channels. The theory of retrieving SSP using passive microwave observations is analyzed, and the sensitivity test experiments of MWHTS and MWTS-II to SSP as well as the test experiments of the contributions of MWHTS and MWTS-II to SSP retrieval are carried out. The theoretical channel combination is established based on the theoretical analysis, and the SSP retrieval experiment is carried out based on the Deep Neural Network (DNN) for the theoretical channel combination. The experimental results show that the retrieval accuracy of SSP using the theoretical channel combination is higher than that of MWHTS or MWTS-II. In addition, based on the test results of the contributions of MWHTS and MWTS-II to the retrieval SSP, the optimal theoretical channel combination can be built, and can further improve the retrieval accuracy of SSP from the theoretical channel combination.

AB  - Forest tree species are an important factor in stand structure surveys, which are the basis for forest ecological planning and the development of related forest policies. Since the number and types of tree species are related to ecosystem parameters such as biodiversity and habitat quality. An accurate and detailed assessment of tree species is a prerequisite for effective ecosystem management. Complex mountainous areas are surrounded by clouds all year round, making it difficult to obtain clean and usable images. Change Continue Detection and Classification(CCDC) is a method for land cover change detection and is able to produce synthetic Landsat images at any moment based on the time series model. The purpose of this paper is to verify the feasibility of synthetic Landsat imagery for tree species classification. In this study, a harmonic function model was built by using 518 images of northern Sichuan province of China from 2000 to 2020. The harmonic function model was used to generate synthetic Landsat images, then, three ensemble classification models were used to classify the trees based on the synthetic images. The total accuracies of the three classifications were 85% (RF), 60% (AdaBoost), and 78% (GBDT), respectively. The results show that Landsat synthetic images can be well applied to tree species classification in complex environments.

TI  - RSI-Net: Two-Stream Deep Neural Network for Remote Sensing Images-Based Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - For semantic segmentation of remote sensing images (RSI), trade-off between representation power and location accuracy is quite important. How to get the trade-off effectively is an open question, where current approaches of utilizing very deep models result in complex models with large memory consumption. In contrast to previous work that utilizes dilated convolutions or deep models, we propose a novel two-stream deep neural network for semantic segmentation of RSI (RSI-Net) to obtain improved performance through modeling and propagating spatial contextual structure effectively and a decoding scheme with image-level and graph-level combination. The first component explicitly models correlations between adjacent land covers and conduct flexible convolution on arbitrarily irregular image regions by using graph convolutional network, while densely connected atrous convolution network (DenseAtrousCNet) with multi-scale atrous convolution can expand the receptive fields and obtain image global information. Extensive experiments are implemented on the Vaihingen, Potsdam and Gaofen RSI datasets, where the comparison results demonstrate the superior performance of RSI-Net in terms of overall accuracy (91.83%, 93.31% and 93.67% on three datasets, respectively), F1 score (90.3%, 91.49% and 89.35% on three datasets, respectively) and kappa coefficient (89.46%, 90.46% and 90.37% on three datasets, respectively) when compared with six state-of-the-art RSI semantic segmentation methods.

AB  - The natural surface soil is often mixed with a lot of sand and gravel. In this paper, a new soil moisture inversion method for gravel areas from polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data is proposed. First, the backscattering of gravel areas is divided into two parts: surface scattering and volume scattering, which are obtained by the polarimetric decomposition method. For the volume scattering part, the Dense Medium Radiative Transfer (DMRT) model is used to obtain the soil moisture, and the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) and the Oh model are used for the surface scattering part. Finally, the weighted sum of the inversion results of the two parts is taken as the final inversion result. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by field soil moisture data from Wuhai city, Inner Mongolia and ALOS-2 PolSAR data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in China's coastal areas has caused major losses to the economy and society and has seriously threatened the coastal marine environment. Based on 30 years of relevant statistical data and satellite remote sensing data from 1990 to 2019, we analyze spatial-temporal distribution of HABs in China's coastal areas. Our results show that 1557 HABs occurred in China's coastal areas from 1990 to 2019: (1) 961 HABs occurred in offshore China from 2001 to 2012, a period with many HABs, accounting for 62.00% of the HABs of the study period. The numbers of HABs (1998 to 2019) in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea were 198, 133, 813, and 249, respectively. 536 HABs occurred from April to September, accounting for 88.00% of the total occurred from 2009 to 2019. (2) Spatially, based on the kernel density estimation, HABs were mainly concentrated in Bohai Bay, the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas, and other regions with relatively dense populations and relatively developed economies, especially in Zhejiang Province and in the Yangtze River Estuary. Imagery-derived information on the build-up of HABs provides coastal communities with objective information to plan and deal with the adverse environmental and health effects associated with an HAB.

AB  - Stray light contamination is an important factor affecting the nighttime remote sensing image quality, especially affecting the quantitative application of low-light-level remote sensing data. VIIRS Day/Night Band(DNB) data is the most widely used nighttime low-light-level data in the world. However, the stray light contamination impacts the DNB sensor's nighttime scenes. In this paper, we analyzed the characteristics of VIIRS DNB stray light and designed a simple and effective stray light correction method based on automatic region division. We preprocessed the data that meet certain solar zenith angle(SZA) requirements to obtain the true stray light data. An automatic region division method according to the SZA is designed to find the specific area affected by stray light and get the boundary of different region. Polynomial curve fitting based on least square method was used to get the mathematical model of the stray light. Then the mathematical model was used to do the stray light correction. We use the DNB northern hemisphere Earth view data to verify this method. Experimental result shows that the proposed method can effectively remove stray light and restore the surface information while preserving the radiation information.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Dehazing Based on an Attention Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze may affect the quality of optical remote sensing images, thus limiting the scope of their application. Remote sensing image dehazing has become important in remote sensing image preprocessing, promoting the use of remote sensing data and the precision of target recognition. Existing remote sensing dehazing methods based on simplified atmospheric degradation models are not suitable for the removal of heterogeneous haze that exist in remote sensing images. For this purpose, this study proposes an end-to-end convolutional neural network based on attention mechanism, in which the residual block structure combines both channel and spatial attention mechanisms, and establishes a synthetic high-resolution haze image dataset for full training. Thus, it obtains the desired dehazing model. Finally, this study investigates the dehazing model using a GF-1 image and compares it with existing dehazing methods. The results show that the proposed method improved the image similarity, color authenticity, and haze residue level.

AB  - Demon Slayer is a serialized manga that appeared in WEEKLY JUMP from 2016 to 2020. Parts of it were aired as an animated TV series in 2019, followed by its release as an animated feature film in 2020. This film, which was so popular that it set a new all-time box office record in Japan, received an enthusiastic response in Korea, but also caused a boycott due to claims that the work reflects Japanese nationalism.The controversy is triggered in the scene where the main character, Tanjiro, wears earrings with a pattern similar to the Rising Sun Flag, which has long been regarded as a symbol of Japanese imperialism. This paper seeks to break away from a focus on linking the main character's earrings to the Rising Sun Flag and further to Japanese imperialism, and examine instead the perspective towards the world reflected in Demon Slayer along with what the earrings represent in the work. It cannot be said that Demon Slayer is free from Japanese nationalism.  The fact that the background of the work is the Taisho period, when Western customs and Japanese traditions coexisted, and that the main character Tanjiro in Kimono uses a sword to fight the axis of evil, while Muzan is portrayed in a suit and shooting a gun can be cited as evidence to support the argument.  Here the imagery of Samuraihood and a sword pitted against a gun shows the composition of the conflict.However, Demon Slayer also represents a worldview that imitates Japanese mythology. The image of Yamato Takeru who subjugated Kumaso and  Emish was projected on Tanjiro and he defeats evil spirits with the protection of the Sun God, Amaterasu. The role of the earrings resembling the Rising Sun Flag symbolizes “the protection of the Sun God,” and Tanjiro wearing the earrings is modeled after the figure of a hero in Japanese mythology. The “Pivot to Japan” theme in Demon Slayer exemplifies the type of Japanese nationalism which is on-going in the 21st century.

AB  - In this study, we first examined the correlation with NDVI, a type of vegetation index that measures the concentration of air pollutants(CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, SO2) and vegetation vitality for Seoul, the symbol of industrialization/urbanization as a research target area and compared and analyzed changes in spatial distribution patterns using the spatial statistical analysis. For this, the NDVI was calculated by selecting the images dated May 1, 2015 and April 28, 2020, which have a similar period among the Landsat 8 satellite image data provided by USGS and the cloud amount is less than 10%. Data on air pollutants were obtained from the Air Korea site, which coincided with the satellite image data used for NDVI calculation. In order to estimate the value of the unobserved area, it was surfaced using IDW(Inverse Distance Weighting) among spatial interpolation techniques, and then the spatial distribution pattern was visualized based on this. In order to determine the correlation between air pollutants in each region and NDVI, we converted it into a data format suitable for statistical analysis, performed the correlation analysis, and compared and analyzed spatial change patterns based on variables found to be statistically significant. In addition, it is expected that the analysis of changes in spatial patterns between air pollutants and vegetation by cycle can be used in urban planning and urban development-related policies to maintain a sustainable city.

AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to examine the current status of old stories combined with metaverse media in the metaverse era, and to suggest ways to transform and spread old stories in metaverse. Chapter 2 looked at the types of old stories combined with metaverse media. From the circular storyline and the birth of an active character type, the old story of <A Fairy Tale of NnohJeong> cyclically combines various narratives and unfolds frantically like the title of the webtoon, creating new character types. In the modern and exaggerated image implementation, <Yeoni girl and Beodeul boy>, implemented in ZEPETO, the playground of Generation Z, also emphasized the character’s face in the classic background, and the images of Yeoni and stepmother were refined to the extent that there is no age difference. Rather than revealing the character’s age, gender, and personality, it is a modern image that transcends age, gender, and personality, and is beautifully decorated. An interactive story is a story that leads to a different ending by choosing an outcome. In <Daughter-in-law who fart>, a story about the choice of kicking out the fart daughter-in-law and how to live together without being expelled is added. It overcame the disaster and brought economic benefits as well.In Chapter 3, the possibility of transformation and spread of old stories in the metaverse era was discussed, and the similarities between the metaverse platform worldview and the old story worldview were discussed. Similarities were also discussed in the metaverse’s avatars and the characters of old stories.Old stories transcend time and space and unleash infinite imagination. The modern metaverse transcends time and space, overcomes obstacles, and secures fun and empathy through new worldviews and avatars. It is expected that the open and free nature of the old story will be further expanded in the metaverse worldview.

AB  - This paper aims to examine a cinematic realization style combining film and fantasy through the comparison of techniques in a form of films as seen in ‘Save the Green Planet!’ (2003) directed by Jang Joon-hwan, and ‘Pan’s labyrinth’ (2006) directed by Guillermo del Toro Gomez.This article sought to explore a cinematic technical level corresponding to a historical memory when a fantasy genre took historical subject matter and based it on a fantasy film genre. Both films ‘Save the Green Planet!’ directed by Jang Joon-hwan and ‘Pan’s labyrinth’ directed by Guilllermo del Toro, as a B-level sentiment, show an eccentric imagination that turns away from an institutional cinematic discourse. This can be regarded as a distinctive worldview regarding political imagination or reality/fantasy as imitation and distortion. When considering that generally there are merits and losses of logic development which ‘compares’ and ‘analyzes’ two subjects in the thesis, this article tried to focus on minor senti- ments of hybridism and a mystery breaking away from the institutional sentiments and sen- sitivity rather than analysis through a mechanical comparison. Thus, it aimed to look into one aspect of subversive worldview free from a relation between good and evil according to Hollywood-centered worldview and Christian dichotomy through two films in the spa- tial antipodes of East and West. It also tried to pay attention to two aspects of a, approachable film technique when a history genre was fantasized.The film ‘Save the Green Planet!’ shows ‘fantasy’ to confront modern capital power which suppresses the memory as a personal scar and considers it a posthumous memory that results from the delusion of grandeur, derangement, and, perversion. The con- frontation between fantasy and reality, and its subversive reversal can be regarded as allegory of a contemporary reality in which we live. On the contrary, the film ‘Pan’s Labyrinth’ makesfantasy clash and juxtapose with the reality. Through this, it shows unhesitatingly that fan- tasy is consists of a cruel world of isomorphism which resembles the reality. Although they show a B-level sentiment as fantasy of the East and the West, there is a certain similarity rather than showing the contradiction in regards to western oriented theory of orientalism. They tried different technical approaches, but the worldview formed in two films can be seen as the worldview of a hybrid. This type of similar imagination and worldview is related to national local and historical characteristics from which two films are made.

Youth inside and outside of the church get confused due to the incomplete worldview. The concept of ‘double-layered Christianity’ does not show much difference. Thus, the fundamental direction of youth missions must be presented upon the biblical Christian worldview. The researcher presents Hebel, fearing God, and Helek, the core ideas of the worldview from the Book of Ecclesiastes. This idea stops people living in the world of limitation from the arrogance of judging and lets them see the true meaning of life in their Creator God. Hevel, fearing God, and Helek’s worldview sets lives to the Creator and provides alternatives, solutions, and hope in the infinite possibilities in God.

AB  - Damages by heavy snow does not occur very often, but when it does, it causes damage to a wide area. To mitigate snow damage, it is necessary to know, in advance, the depth of snow that causes damage in each region. However, snow depths are measured at observatory locations, and it is difficult to understand the spatial distribution of snow depth that causes damage in a region. To understand the spatial distribution of snow depth, the point measurements are interpolated. However, estimating spatial distribution of snow depth is not easy when the number of measured snow depth is small and topographical characteristics such as altitude are not similar. To overcome this limit, satellite images such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be analyzed using Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) method. DInSAR uses two different SAR images measured at two different times, and is generally used to track minor changes in topography. In this study, the spatial distribution of snow depth was estimated by DInSAR analysis using dual polarimetric IW mode C-band SAR data of Sentinel-1B satellite operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). In addition, snow depth was estimated using geostationary satellite Chollian-2 (GK-2A) to compare with the snow depth from DInSAR method. As a result, the accuracy of snow cover estimation in terms with grids was about 0.92% for DInSAR and about 0.71% for GK-2A, indicating high applicability of DInSAR method. Although there were cases of overestimation of the snow depth, sufficient information was provided for estimating the spatial distribution of the snow depth. And this will be helpful in understanding regional damage-causing snow depth.

TI  - Integrating Domain Knowledge in Data-Driven Earth Observation With Process Convolutions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The modeling of Earth observation (EO) data is a challenging problem, typically approached by either purely mechanistic or purely data-driven methods. Mechanistic models encode the domain knowledge and physical rules governing the system. Such models, however, need the correct specification of all interactions between variables in the problem and the appropriate parameterization is a challenge in itself. On the other hand, machine learning approaches are flexible data-driven tools, able to approximate arbitrarily complex functions, but lack interpretability and struggle when data are scarce or in extrapolation regimes. In this article, we argue that <italic>hybrid learning schemes</italic> that combine both approaches can address all these issues efficiently. We introduce <italic>Gaussian process (GP) convolution models</italic> for hybrid modeling in EO problems. We specifically propose the use of a class of GP convolution models called <italic>latent force models</italic> (LFMs) for EO time series modeling, analysis, and understanding. LFMs are hybrid models that incorporate physical knowledge encoded in differential equations into a multioutput GP model. LFMs can transfer information across time series, cope with missing observations, infer explicit latent functions forcing the system, and learn parameterizations which are very helpful for system analysis and interpretability. We illustrate the performance in two case studies. First, we consider time series of soil moisture (SM) from active Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and passive [SM and ocean salinity (SMOS), advanced microwave scanning radiometer-2 (AMSR2)] microwave satellites. We show how assuming a first-order differential equation as governing equation, the model automatically estimates the e-folding time or decay rate related to SM persistence and discovers latent forces related to precipitation. In the second case study, we show how the model can fill in gaps of leaf area index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical time series by exploiting their relations across different spatial and temporal domains. The proposed hybrid methodology reconciles the two main approaches in remote-sensing parameter estimation by blending statistical learning and mechanistic modeling.

TI  - HED-UNet: Combined Segmentation and Edge Detection for Monitoring the Antarctic Coastline
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based coastline detection algorithms have begun to outshine traditional statistical methods in recent years. However, they are usually trained only as single-purpose models to either segment land and water or delineate the coastline. In contrast to this, a human annotator will usually keep a mental map of both segmentation and delineation when performing manual coastline detection. To take into account this task duality, we, therefore, devise a new model to unite these two approaches in a deep learning model. By taking inspiration from the main building blocks of a semantic segmentation framework (UNet) and an edge detection framework (HED), both tasks are combined in a natural way. Training is made efficient by employing deep supervision on side predictions at multiple resolutions. Finally, a hierarchical attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively merge these multiscale predictions into the final model output. The advantages of this approach over other traditional and deep learning-based methods for coastline detection are demonstrated on a data set of Sentinel-1 imagery covering parts of the Antarctic coast, where coastline detection is notoriously difficult. An implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/khdlr/HED-UNet.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the leading causes of mortality globally, resulting in millions of deaths each year. Efficient monitoring is important to measure exposure and enforce legal limits. New low-cost sensors can be deployed in greater numbers and in more varied locations, motivating the problem of efficient automated placement. Previous work suggests Bayesian optimisation is an appropriate method, but only considered a satellite data set, with data aggregated over all altitudes. It is ground-level pollution, that humans breathe, which matters most. We improve on those results using hierarchical models and evaluate our models on urban pollution data in London to show that Bayesian optimisation can be successfully applied to the problem.

TI  - Sentinel-1-Based Water and Flood Mapping: Benchmarking Convolutional Neural Networks Against an Operational Rule-Based Processing Chain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of several convolutional neural network architectures (AlbuNet-34/FCN/DeepLabV3+/U-Net/U-Net++) for water and flood mapping using Sentinel-1 amplitude data is compared to an operational rule-based processor (S-1FS). This comparison is made using a globally distributed dataset of Sentinel-1 scenes and the corresponding ground truth water masks derived from Sentinel-2 data to evaluate the performance of the classifiers on a global scale in various environmental conditions. The impact of using single versus dual-polarized input data on the segmentation capabilities of AlbuNet-34 is evaluated. The weighted cross entropy loss is combined with the Lovasz loss and various data augmentation methods are investigated. Furthermore, the concept of atrous spatial pyramid pooling used in DeepLabV3+ and the multiscale feature fusion inherent in U-Net++ are assessed. Finally, the generalization capacity of AlbuNet-34 is tested in a realistic flood mapping scenario by using additional data from two flood events and the Sen1Floods11 dataset. The model trained using dual polarized data outperforms the S-1FS significantly and increases the intersection over union (IoU) score by 5%. Using a weighted combination of the cross entropy and the Lovasz loss increases the IoU score by another 2%. Geometric data augmentation degrades the performance while radiometric data augmentation leads to better testing results. FCN/DeepLabV3+/U-Net/U-Net++ perform not significantly different to AlbuNet-34. Models trained on data showing no distinct inundation perform very well in mapping the water extent during two flood events, reaching IoU scores of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively, and perform comparatively well on the Sen1Floods11 dataset.

AB  - Wetlands provide different environmental services and contribute to global biodiversity and climate mitigation. However, these priceless environments have been damaged by direct and indirect interference of human activities. Monitoring wetland's hydroperiod over large study areas became feasible only by recent advances in cloud computing platforms and free archive of Landsat time-series. We used the Dynamic Surface Water Extent algorithm for the unsupervised classification of time-series images. This unsupervised algorithm showed 86.7% overall accuracy for 2020 results. Then hydroperiod maps were produced based on the water occurrence of each pixel, and a differencing change detection method was used to produce change maps.

T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - Soil property and class maps for the continent of Africa were so far only available at very generalised scales, with many countries not mappedat all. Thanks to an increasing quantity and availability of soil samples collected at field point locations by various government and/or NGOfunded projects, it is now possible to produce detailed pan-African maps of soil nutrients, including micro-nutrients at fine spatial resolutions. Inthis paper we describe production of a 30 m resolution Soil Information System of the African continent using, to date, the most comprehensivecompilation of soil samples (N  150, 000) and Earth Observation data. We produced predictions for soil pH, organic carbon (C) and totalnitrogen (N), total carbon, Cation Exchange Capacity (eCEC), extractable  phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg),sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn)  silt, clay and sand, stone content, bulk density and depth to bedrock, at three depths (0, 20 and50 cm) and using 2-scale 3D Ensemble Machine Learning framework implemented in the mlr (Machine Learning in R) package. As covariatelayers we used 250 m resolution (MODIS, PROBA-V and SM2RAIN products), and 30 m resolution (Sentinel-2, Landsat and DTM derivatives)images. Our 5-fold spatial Cross-Validation results showed varying accuracy levels ranging from the best performing soil pH (CCC=0.900) tomore poorly predictable extractable phosphorus (CCC=0.654) and sulphur (CCC=0.708) and depth to bedrock. Sentinel-2 bands SWIR (B11,B12), NIR (B09, B8A), Landsat SWIR bands, and vertical depth derived from 30 m resolution DTM, were the overall most important 30 mresolution covariates. Climatic data images  SM2RAIN, bioclimatic variables and MODIS Land Surface Temperature  however, remainedas the overall most important variables for predicting soil chemical variables at continental scale. The publicly available 30-m soil maps aresuitable for numerous applications, including soil and fertilizer policies and investments, agronomic advice to close yield gaps, environmentalprograms, or targeting of nutrition interventions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study used the technique based on remote sensing to analyze and study the dynamics of an alfalfa crop and to estimate the production of fresh biomass in the climatic conditions of the agricultural year 2021-2022. Alfalfa culture in year III, was under non-irrigated cultivated conditions, in the perimeter of DER, University of Life Sciences "King Michael I" from Timisoara, Romania. A period between March 22 and July 23, 2022 was considered, the period during which 14 sets of images from the Sentinel 2 system were acquired. Based on the spectral information contained in the images, the MSAVI, NDMI, NDVI and NBR indices were calculated to characterize the dynamics of the alfalfa crop and estimate the production of fresh biomass. Three harvests (mowing) were made, on May 25 with a production of 10 t ha-1 fresh biomass, on July 1 with a production of 7.5 t ha-1 fresh biomass and on July 26 with a production of 7.5 t ha-1 fresh biomass. Spline models have described most accurately and under statistical safety conditions ( epsilon= 0.000493 for MSAVI; epsilon= 0.391963 for NDMI; epsilon = 0.002972 for NDVI; epsilon = 0.006759 for NBR) the dynamics of the indices calculated in relation to the time during the study period, also associated with the moments of fresh biomass harvested. The regression analysis facilitated obtaining predictive models of fresh biomass production, under statistical safety conditions (RMSEP=0.019289 for the combination of MSAVI and NDMI). 3D and isoquants graphic models described the variation of biomass production in relation to the pairs of indices used in the analysis.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study used remote sensing-based techniques to monitor a maize crop, the Pioneer 9911 hybrid, and thus predict the production for crop and farm management. The Sentinel 2 satellite system was used to obtain the satellite scenes. Satellite images were taken at 10 different times, between April 26 and October 3, 2021. Based on spectral information, the NDMI, NDVI, CIG and NBR indices were calculated, and they were used to describe the dynamics of maize crop during the study period and prediction of maize production. The dynamics of maize cultivation was quantified based on NDMI, NDVI and CIG indices in statistical accuracy conditions at the level of R-2= 0.943 to R-2= 0.976, p <0.001, and based on the NBR index at the level of R-2= 0.802, p = 0.0156. The prediction of maize production was possible based on the indices calculated in statistical accuracy conditions (p<0.001, R-2>0.990). The errors calculated between predicted production (YP) and real production (YR) varied according to the image capture time and the combination of indices used in the regression analysis.

AB  - The main aim of the current research has been to quantify and map the pattern of changes in land use coverage (LULC), using free data. The study area has been the northern area of the Diversity and Life Strip, located in the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve, considered to be a biodiversity hotspot. The processes performed in order to apply LULC on the Diversity and Life Zone (DLZ) were 1) data collection and analysis, 2) remote sensing data processing, 3) thematic land cover and 4) transformation from raster to vector. The analysis period was of about 10 years (2009-2018), where Landsat 7-8 satellite images were used. The classified classes were forest, traditional productive system, herbaceous vegetation, infrastructure and water. It was determined that the forest decreased by 3.63%, while the herbaceous vegetation increased by 3.03%. Therefore, the preliminary data from this study provide a benchmark for decision makers and take action in order to minimize deforestation.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node status is a crucial prognosis factor for melanomas; nonetheless, the invasive surgery required to obtain it always puts the patient at risk. In this study, we develop a Deep Learning-based approach to predict lymph node metastasis from Whole Slide Images of primary tumours. Albeit very informative, these images come with complexities that hamper their use in machine learning applications, namely their large size and limited datasets. We propose a pre-training strategy based on self-supervised contrastive learning to extract better image feature representations and an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning approach to enhance the model's performance. With this work, we quantitatively demonstrate that combining both methods improves various classification metrics and qualitatively show that contrastive learning encourages the network to output higher attention scores to tumour tissue and lower scores to image artifacts.

TI  - Use of Satellite Images and the Split Window Algorithm to Detect Fugitive Methane in Tlalnepantla De Baz Landfill
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, the increase in land surface temperature has been attributed to the concentration of greenhouse gases. However, there is no record of timely information that shows which types of land cover relate to major increases in surface temperature. The main aim of this paper is to identify the specific sites in a landfill where biogas is released into the atmosphere. A second objective is to try to find a spatial correlation between the concentration of methane emitted to the atmosphere with the observed surface temperature gradients. The recoverable and fugitive methane fluxes were validated with in situ information, using a LICOR gas accumulation chamber. The surface heat estimate was obtained from the Split Window algorithm, using the TIRS sensor of the Landsat 8. With data obtained in previous studies, both in situ and remote, it was possible to spatially correlate the methane flux released into the atmosphere with the temperature distribution plume within the landfill. The importance of our research is related to the continuous need for surface temperature monitoring on the planet. The use of technological tools such as the one presented here reduces the cost and execution time of environmental studies.

AB  - Remote sensing is also benefiting from the quick development of deep learning algorithms for image analysis and classification tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the classification performance of a well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, such as ResNet50, using a transfer learning approach. We compare the performance when using vector-features acquired from general purpose data, such as the ImageNet [1], versus remote sensing data like BigEarthNet [2], UCMerced [3], RESISC45 [4] and So2Sat [5]. The results show that the model pre-trained on RESISC-45 data achieved the highest accuracy when classifying the Eurosat [6] testing dataset. This was followed by the model pre-trained on Imagenet with 95.94% and BigEarthNet with 95.93%. When presented with diverse remote sensing data, the classification improved in regards to large quantities of general-purpose data. The experiments carried out also show, that multi modal (co-registered synthetic aperture radar and multispectral) did not increase the classification rate with respect to using only multispectral data.

AB  - This paper describes the semi-automated procedure implemented for the production of Water Quality Parameters (WQP) maps obtained processing Sentinel-3 and Landsat-8 imagery in the framework of SIMILE Interreg project. The processing chain includes the use of the C2RCC processor to obtain Chl-a (Chlorophyll-a) and TSM (Total Suspended Matter) and the Barsi method to produce maps of water surface temperature. The maps were filtered to exclude anomalous values due for example to clouds, water reflection (such as glint), or mixed pixels and compared to in-situ data. The filtering included an outlier rejection performed with the 36 rule. The values singled out as local anomalies where checked with respect to possible local behaviours, such as the presence of very small gulfs and inflow/outflow streams and providing guidelines with visual examples, to support the operator. The idea of a procedure as much as possible automated and guided is to foster the WQP maps production after the end of SIMILE project.

AB  - Monitoring the polar regions is of outmost importance for climatological studies. Human-induced climate change is leading to global warming, which, among other effects, is causing glaciers' melting. This has significant implications for sea level rise and ocean circulation.This study focuses on the temporal analysis of the d'Iberville glacier ice edge using C-band synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery. First, the profile of the d'Iberville glacier is extracted from synthetic aperture radar imagery. To accomplish this task, an unsupervised method based on a global threshold constant false alarm rate approach is applied to the HH-polarized normalized radar cross section measurements. Then, the ice edge variability is quantified using two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images acquired in 2015 and 2022.The experimental results show that the d'Iberville glacier experienced a remarkable retreat of about one square kilometer from 2015 to 2022.

TI  - CHANGES IN THE AIR-CONDITIONING FUNCTION OF FOREST STANDS AS A RESULT OF THEIR DECAY AFTER THE GRADATION OF <i>IPS TYPOGRAPHUS</i>
T2  - REPORTS OF FORESTRY RESEARCH-ZPRAVY LESNICKEHO VYZKUMU
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the change in the air-conditioning function of forest stands and agricultural landscape in the wider vicinity of Dacice town (328 km(2)) in the period 1990-2019. The air-conditioning function is manifested by the values of the surface temperature on sunny days in the growing season, with high amount of incoming solar radiation (up to 900 Wm(-2)). The surface temperature of the land cover is given mainly by the ratio between the evapotranspiration (latent heat of vaporization) and heating (sensible heat flux). The cooling ability of forest stands is evaluated by the difference between the surface and air temperature above the stand. In the case study we verify the thesis of the gradual loss of water and vegetation cover in the hills of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands leading to an increase in surface temperatures, increasing difference between surface and air temperature, higher release of sensible heat at the expense of evapotranspiration (latent heat of vaporization). We then pay special attention to the effect of extensive decay of spruce stands after the gradation of the bark beetle (Ips typographus) on the distribution of solar energy and temperature. Landsat satellite images were used for the assessment, in combination with meteorological data. Energy fluxes were spatially quantified using a gradient approach implemented in the QGIS module SEBCS (Module for spatial computing of energy balance, intensity of evapotranspiration and crop water stress using satellite data). We discuss the importance of dry superheated surfaces for landscape drying, when moisture is carried away by the rising flow of heated air.

TI  - Combining Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 Does Not Improve Classification Accuracy of Tropical Selective Logging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play a key role in the global carbon and hydrological cycles, maintaining biological diversity, slowing climate change, and supporting the global economy and local livelihoods. Yet, rapidly growing populations are driving continued degradation of tropical forests to supply wood products. The United Nations (UN) has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme to mitigate climate impacts and biodiversity losses through improved forest management. Consistent and reliable systems are still needed to monitor tropical forests at large scales, however, degradation has largely been left out of most REDD+ reporting given the lack of effective monitoring and countries mainly focus on deforestation. Recent advances in combining optical data and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have shown promise for improved ability to monitor forest losses, but it remains unclear if similar improvements could be made in detecting and mapping forest degradation. We used detailed selective logging records from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon to test the effectiveness of combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 for selective logging detection. We built Random Forest models to classify pixel-based differences in logged and unlogged regions to understand if combining optical and SAR improved the detection capabilities over optical data alone. We found that the classification accuracy of models utilizing optical data from Landsat 8 alone were slightly higher than models that combined Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8. In general, detection of selective logging was high with both optical only and optical-SAR combined models, but our results show that the optical data was dominating the predictive performance and adding SAR data introduced noise, lowering the detection of selective logging. While we have shown limited capabilities with C-band SAR, the anticipated opening of the ALOS-PALSAR archives and the anticipated launch of NISAR and BIOMASS in 2023 should stimulate research investigating similar methods to understand if longer wavelength SAR might improve classification of areas affected by selective logging when combined with optical data.

AB  - Flood mapping is an essential component of planning flood mitigation. The availability of remote sensing data makes rapid flood mapping possible. This article develops an accurate method for rapid flood mapping using satellite imagery. Sentinel-2 imagery was tested by acquiring data before and after a flood event in a lowland area. Flooding extraction was performed using the newly developed Flood Inundation Extraction Index (FIEI) and compared to the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the most commonly used index. Based on the choice of threshold, the results are divided into flooded and non-flooded areas. Evaluation of the performance accuracy based on the total and kappa coef-ficients showed that the FIEI approach is more accurate than the MNDWI approach.

TI  - SYED MUHAMMAD NAQUIB AL-ATTAS' EXPOSITION ON THE CONCEPT OF ETHICS
T2  - AFKAR-JURNAL AKIDAH & PEMIKIRAN ISLAM-JOURNAL OF AQIDAH & ISLAMIC THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, is a prominent Malay thinker who has promoted Islamization of present-day knowledge as a solution for the dilemma of Muslims. With that, he has also developed his original thought in various fields. His thought in the field of ethics, the content of adab, the central concept in his system of thought, and the essential teaching of Islam, is hardly elaborated. Thanks to that, it seems crucial to look into his view on ethical norms - its basis and principles - in such a way that his Islamization of ethics by means of infusing worldview of Islam into universal concept of ethics - a concept whose definition is universal, because its element can be found in any specific definition belonging to any worldview - can be known subsequently. Theory of Islamization of present-day knowledge - isolation and infusion process - is used for analyzing al-Attas' view on ethical norms and theory of transparent worldview is applied also for analyzing his Islamization of ethics. Finally, according to al-Attas, the basis of ethics is religion approved by sound reason, knowledge, and the freedom of the will, whereas its principles are self-perfection, freedom, true faith and knowledge, happiness, and individual contract. As for his Islamized concept of ethics, it is a permanent attitude, action, assertion, and consideration belonging to spiritual aspect of man in his relation to his self, God, society, and state.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) products from thermal infrared imaging rely on information about the spatial distribution of Land Surface Emissivity (LSE). For portable, broadband thermal cameras for drone- or ground-based measurements with camera to object distances up to a few kilometres and with meter-scale resolution, threshold-based retrieval of LSE from Fractional green Vegetation Cover (FVC) can be used. As seasonal changes in vegetation LSE over the year cannot be accounted for by single satellite images or aerial orthophotos, this study evaluates an approach for FVC retrieval via permanently installed RGB webcams and derived Excess Green vegetation index (ExG) time series at a high-mountain test site in the European Alps. Daily ExG values were derived from the imagery of 27 days between 12/07/2021 and 30/10/2021 and projected to a 0.5 m Digital Surface Model (DSM). FVC reference data from 765 in-situ vegetation plots were used to assess the relationship between ExG and the vegetation cover and to determine the thresholds of ExG for no vegetation cover and full vegetation cover. Despite the bad correlation between ExG and in-field FVC with an R-2 score of 0.15, an approach using a well-tested orthophoto-retrieved NDVI for FVC retrieval performs just slightly better. The comparison of the remotely sensed data and the field measurements therefore remains complex. Time series analysis of both ExG and FVC for highly vegetated areas showed a significant decrease from summer to autumn, which reflects the seasonal changes of LSE for senescent vegetation. Calculated emissivities for vegetated pixels ranged from the minimum of 0.95 to the maximum of 0.985 over the season, while emissivity values for less vegetated pixels stayed constant during the season. The results of this study will be used as input to a correction model for remote LST measurements in the context of micro-scale investigations of the thermal niche of Alpine flora.

TI  - Study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Ait Daoud ou Ali (Central High Atlas, Morocco) Forest using geospatial techniques
T2  - REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS ANDALUCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, Man has been looking for the exploitation of natural resources for daily purposes. Thus, the current scientific and technological development has facilitated and given him real opportunities for the overexploitation of these resources in general and the plant cover in particular. In order to show this exploitation, we want, in this article, to study the evolution of the vegetation cover of the forest of Ait Daoud or Ali, located in the Central High Atlas on an area of 30 860 ha, between 1972, 1999 and 2020, based on remote sensing and GIS tool. Regarding the methodology of work, the multi-chronic study of the dynamics of the vegetation cover of the study area, is based on the spatio-temporal analysis and processing of satellite images by remote sensing space. Indeed, in this paper we have opted for this approach which is based on the use of data from LandSat satellite images of three types; these are the images of type MSS, ETM and Oli, for three dates 1972, 1999 and 2020 (period of 48 years) to identify the spatial differences of the vegetation cover between the three selected dates. Indeed, the study of the dynamics of the vegetation cover of the forest of Ait Daoud or Ali between 1972, 1999 and 2020, showed a very important spatio-temporal variation, linked essentially to several factors (natural and human). The comparison of the results of the classification of Landsat images, showed a decline and a significant degradation of vegetation cover between 1972 and 1999 of 12% of the total area of the study area. This degradation is justified by the intervention of several factors, including climatic conditions and dry periods that Morocco has experienced in this period. For the second period (1999-2020), the treatment showed an increase in vegetation cover of about 10%. In this study, we have highlighted the impact of natural factors and especially anthropic actions on the dynamics of the forest of Ait Daoud or Ali located in the Central High Atlas, based on the use of geospatial techniques that have allowed us to have very precise information on the spatio-temporal dynamics of plant cover.

AB  - This study aims to offer insight into Nathaniel Hawthorne’s views on mortality and religion through an analysis of his negative portrayal of potions and elixirs. To this end, three distinct threads are analyzed. The first thread takes a historical approach, investigating the rudimentary state of medicine during Hawthorne’s lifetime in the 1800s. The second thread analyzes Hawthorne’s stories “Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment,” “The Birthmark,” “Rappaccini’s Daughter,” and “A Virtuoso’s Collection” to explore the author’s recurring theme that what is wrong with humans cannot be made right on this earth. The final thread takes evidence from “A Virtuoso’s Collection” and “Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment,” as well as Hawthorne’s unpublished novel Septimius Felton, to conclude that the author believed that when physical life is prolonged, spiritual life begins to deteriorate. A careful study of these three intertwined threads concerning potions and elixirs leads us to a greater understanding of Hawthorne’s worldview.

AB  - Among future multi-directional polarimetric spaceborne missions that will advance cloud and aerosol studies, the Multi-viewing, Multi-channel, Multi-polarisation Imager (3MI) on the MetOp Second Generation - A (MetOp-SG-A) satellite is a direct successor of the classic and successful design of Polarisation and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) sensors. The POLDER design comprises of three essential elements: a wide field-of-view lens, a rotating wheel holding spectral and polarizer filters, and a two-dimensional imaging sensor. This presentation demonstrates a new geometric calibration technique for an airborne prototype of the 3MI and other POLDER-like sensors.Geometric calibration is often challenging for an airborne sensor because it is frequently mounted to and dismounted from the aircraft. The rotation of the instrument with respect to the aircraft reference frame must be calibrated every time when the instrument is reinstalled, but the opportunity for a stable flight leg over ground control points is limited because of weather and air-traffic conditions. In addition, the precise aircraft position is often more difficult to obtain than the precise aircraft attitude.To mitigate this difficulty, our new technique derives the instrument rotation by detecting three natural angular features: rainbow, glory, and hot spot. These features are often observed during scientific data acquisitions over clouds and land surface, thus enable the direct validation of the geometric calibration quality for every eligible image under the actual acquisition condition. We present the automatic detection technique of these angular features in in-flight data and derived rotation angles and errors for the AEROCLO-SA field campaign.

TI  - Ideal Pharmaceutical Education Viewed from Quality Assurance on Third-party Accreditation
T2  - YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Review
AB  - The first-phase third-party accreditation conducted by the Japan Accreditation Board for Pharmaceutical Education between FY 2013 and 2019 revealed various issues regarding current pharmacy education programs. In addition, the report of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Study Group on the Training and Quality Improvement of Pharmacists, which was published in 2021, identified a broad range of issues in pharmaceutical education related to pharmacist training and quality improvement. Many of these issues are concerned with university curricula; thus, in order to ensure and enhance the quality of pharmaceutical education and develop pharmaceutical human resources that society demands, it is extremely important for each university to improve its curricula. Since revision of the model core curriculum for pharmaceutical education is currently underway, in this symposium, we held a discussion to identify points that need to be improved regarding the current model core curriculum to ensure and enhance the quality of pharmaceutical education in light of the above-mentioned issues, and incorporate the corresponding measures into the basic policy for revision of the model core curriculum.

AB  - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Earth Observation Research Center (EORC) has produced a high-resolution land-use and land-cover classification map for Japan indicating the average cover in 2018-2020. The classification accuracy was improved by using a combination of Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data. We developed a convolutional neural network-based algorithm specialized for pattern recognition in multispectral and time-series feature spaces, and achieved an overall accuracy of 88.85% in 12 classifications. This is the most accurate high-resolution land-cover map ever produced by JAXA. This highly accurate product is being used for the calculation of SDGs global indicators such as 15.4.2 "Mountain Green Cover Index".

TI  - SPATIAL-TEMPORAL GEODYNAMICS MONITORING OF LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGES IN STEBNYK, UKRAINE BASED ON EARTH REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the analysis and monitoring of land-use/land cover (LULC) changes considering the case study of Stebnyk, Lviv region, Ukraine, as an area of increased anthropogenic hazard impact (characterized by the karst sinkholes creation which is the result of extracting the potassium salt from underground mines and the violation of their conservation). The extraction was carried out without backfilling the underground excavations, resulting in the void formation of about 33 million m(3) lying under the residential sector and road infrastructure, and could potentially be the site of future landslides/sinkholes that threaten the inhabitants and landscape ecosystem of the region as a whole. The research is based on Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images (made in February 2002 and December 2019, respectively), and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper) data. Supervised classification conducted by maximum likelihood method was used to identify and analyze the spatial and temporal LULC changes on the territory divided into four classes. Vegetation indices NDVI have been calculated, analyzed and featured for further supervised classification. The accuracy of the obtained data had been improved by raster image filtering. A post-classification comparison approach was used to analyze LULC changes over the research period. It was established that for the period 2002-2019 the built-up area has increased by 5.61 %, and the areas of forests and fields have decreased by 2.77 % and 2.36%, respectively. The area of water bodies has undergone the least changes (+0.37%). The accuracy estimation of carried out classifications showed that the classification based on RGB images is more accurate than the classification based on the NDVI; the filtered classification showed more accurate results for most classes, than the unfiltered one. LULC monitoring for balanced regional, local and national development, as well as territorial planning, is a new area of the application of the Earth remote sensing (ERS) data in Ukraine. It allows assessing the state of the geocomponents system and predicting their further changes. The study of anthropogenic activity makes it possible to predict dangerous technogenic processes and thus avoid or reduce their consequences. The results of the research can be used as a basis for further monitoring of the Stebnyk region. They will also be useful to territorial communities for harmonious, sustainable development and land management of the studied area.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper examines the issue of euthanasia, which is a matter of bioethics, including legal issues from the perspective of Buddhism with acting life and chiropractic ethics, and furthermore, it aims to summarize Buddhism's bioethics and euthanasia legal issues, especially the current law in Korea.Individual organisms to life metabolize, reproduce, and evolve, so if you understand life phenomena as these three concepts, they are all interdependence and acting, so Buddhism's worldview is an acting worldview that teaches you to escape obsession by realizing that the basis of all worlds is acting. Given that the Buddhist ethics of Jiak Su-seon require discrimination between good and bad, it is necessary to eliminate sense itself, and even if it is necessary to judge good and bad on ethical issues related to human life, such as euthanasia, from a Buddhist perspective, it can only be judged as it is in the state of Muah and Gong. In this state of Muah and Gong, since mercy is bound to spread beyond oneself to self-immolation, all judgments of Buddhism related to bioethics should be made in a direction that can contribute to the practice of mercy.On the other hand, regarding the permission of euthanasia, in the case of negative but passive euthanasia, the suspension of life-sustaining treatment is limitedly recognized by associating it with death with dignity according to the trend that certain requirements are met. In the case of active euthanasia, it is common to see that it is illegal to protect life and prevent abuse of euthanasia, but for patients with imminent fraud and modern medical conditions, it is considered as a legitimate act that respects the patient's right to self-determination and does not violate social norms.

TI  - Compressed SAR Interferometry in the Big Data Era
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions provide an unprecedented massive interferometric SAR (InSAR) time series. The processing of the Big InSAR Data is challenging for long-term monitoring. Indeed, as most deformation phenomena develop slowly, a strategy of a processing scheme can be worked on reduced volume data sets. This paper introduces a novel ComSAR algorithm based on a compression technique for reducing computational efforts while maintaining the performance robustly. The algorithm divides the massive data into many mini-stacks and then compresses them. The compressed estimator is close to the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound under a realistic C-band Sentinel-1 decorrelation scenario. Both persistent and distributed scatterers (PSDS) are exploited in the ComSAR algorithm. The ComSAR performance is validated via simulation and application to Sentinel-1 data to map land subsidence of the salt mine Vauvert area, France. The proposed ComSAR yields consistently better performance when compared with the state-of-the-art PSDS technique. We make our PSDS and ComSAR algorithms as an open-source TomoSAR package. To make it more practical, we exploit other open-source projects so that people can apply our PSDS and ComSAR methods for an end-to-end processing chain. To our knowledge, TomoSAR is the first public domain tool available to jointly handle PS and DS targets.

TI  - Variation in behavior drives multiscale responses to habitat conditions in timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus)
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Variations in both the behavior of wildlife and the scale at which the environment most influences the space use of wild animals (i.e., scale of effect) are critical, but often overlooked in habitat selection modeling. Ecologists have proposed that biological responses happening over longer time frames are influenced by environmental variables at larger spatial scales, but this has rarely been empirically tested. Here, we hypothesized that long-term patterns of behavior (i.e., lasting multiple weeks to months) would be associated with larger scales of effect than more sporadic behaviors. We predicted site use by 43 radio-telemetered timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) exhibiting four distinct, time-varying behaviors (foraging, digestion, ecdysis, and gestation) using remotely-sensed environmental variables related to forest structure and landscape topography. Among sites used by snakes, warmer temperatures and higher levels of forest disturbance were predictive of behaviors dependent on thermoregulation including gestation and ecdysis while more moderate temperatures and drier, more oak-dominated sites were predictive of foraging. Long-term behaviors were associated with larger spatial scales across most variables, supporting our hypothesis that the scale at which habitat selection occurs is linked to the temporal scale of relevant behaviors. Management recommendations based on single-scale models of habitat use that do not account for fine-scale variations in behavior may obscure the importance of potentially limiting habitat features needed for infrequent behaviors that are important for growth and reproduction of this and related species. We modeled site use with generalized linear mixed effects Bernoulli models in a Bayesian framework using the brms package in R. The "dat_use_5m.csv" dataset is only used to run the general site use model (called in the "[greater than] Site Use Model" section of the R code). The four scale-specific datasets ("dat_5m.csv", "dat_25m.csv","dat_55m.csv","dat_105m.csv") are used to run the respective behavioral models. Telemetry - We captured individual timber rattlesnakes and surgically implanted intraperitoneal transmitters (Holohil SI-2T)and then tracked snakes between dawn and dusk, regularly shiftingthe order in which individuals were tracked daily to avoid systematic bias. Upon visually locating a snake, we recorded the location with a Global Positioning System (Garmin GPSmap 64s) to an estimated [less than] 5m spatial accuracy. Raw snake location data in the form of X, Y coordinates are not included in this dataset as they are sensitive and not necessary to run the models used in our analysis. Instead, each unique point location is given an alpha numeric code in the "Point" column. Each row represents a unique snake observation for a given date (indicated by the "Date" column) and individual snake (indicated by the "Snake" column).The "dat_use_5m.csv" also contains paired random points that do not represent snake observations (indicated by a 0 in the "Used" column). Behavior Classification - We identified four behavioral and physiological states (hereafter referred to as "behaviors"): foraging, digestion, ecdysis, and gestation. We considered snakes to be foraging when they were observed in a stereotyped foraging posture. Our observations of snakes digesting a recent meal are limited by the difficulty in detecting a small bolus in a large-bodied snake, but we noted this whenever possible. These observations are, therefore, inherently biased toward snakes digesting larger, more obvious meals and may be prone to a high false negative detection rate. We noted observations of snakes in ecdysis as indicated by snakes having blue-gray eyes and dusky skin coloration. We confirmed observations of gestating females by sonogram shortly after snake emergence in April and May. We excluded all locations in which a snake was not visible and presumably underground or actively moving. When not moving and not clearly participating in the aforementioned behaviors, we designated snake behavior as resting. We excluded snake observations from analyses when there was uncertainty about behavioral classification. For each snake observation, we indicatewhich of these four behaviors, if any, were observed in their respective behavioral columns ("Forage", "Ecdysis", "Digest", and "Gestate"; a 1 indicates the behavior was observed). The dat_use_5m.csv file does not contain any behavioral columns as it is only to be used when running the general site use model. Geospatial Habitat Features - We incorporated 15 geospatial habitat features, characterizing vegetation structure, plant species composition, and environmental variation, at varying resolutions (5-30 m), in our analysis of multiscale rattlesnake habitat use. Digital canopy height ("chm") and elevation models were developed from LiDAR data provided by the Ohio Geospatial Reference Program, collected in 2007 (http://ogrip.oit.ohio.gov/; accessed 13 October 2014). The LiDAR data featured two returns pulse-1 with an average spacing and density of 1.27 m and 0.27 returns m-2, respectively. The canopy height and elevation models incorporated conventional methods, using bilinear interpolation, at 5 m resolution. From the elevation models, we developed layers on slope ("slope"), solar radiation ("sol_rad"), and the Beer's transformed aspect ("beers"). In addition to canopy height represented in the "chm" column, we developed three penetration ratios (number of returns [less than]2 m in height divided by the number of returns [less than]50 m and [less than]10 m, including returns [less than]2m; and the number of returns [less than]1 m divided by the number of returns [less than]5 m, including returns [less than]1 m) to characterize overstory ("ove"), midstory ("mid"), and understory ("und") vegetation density at 30 m resolution. Woody plant composition was represented by three ordination axes within a gradient modeling approach developed from a separate study by B. Adams within the study area. Vegetation plot data, incorporating relative abundance profiles of trees and shrubs, including 99 woody plant taxa, were ordinated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and projected onto the landscape with terrain data and seasonal multispectral imagery provided by Landsat 8/OLI. Three subsequent floristic gradients synthesized moisture ("ndms1"), successional ("ndms2"), and elevational ("ndms3") variation among species responses within the vegetation data, at 30-m resolution. In addition, the plot data were used to develop geospatial layers on mean tree basal area ("rf_tba"; m2 ha-1) and density ("rf_tde"; stems ha-1). From April 2017 to December 2017 we collected temperature data across the property using HOBO Pendant data loggers (Model # UA-001-08) set to one-hour logging intervals. We placed 150 loggers randomly across our study site by staking each logger in place at ground level on the north side of a tree to limit the influence of canopy structure on thermal data. We used these temperature data as a response variable in a linear mixed effects model with topographic and LiDAR-derived variables serving as predictive covariates. The final fitted model was used to predict the mean near-ground mid-summer temperature across our landscape("meanT"). Finally, stand age ("stnd_age") was provided from the ODNR and a flowlines layer was transformed to a spatial grid (5 m) and used to summarize distances to the nearest stream ("strm_dist"; https://nationalmap.gov/). We extracted values for each covariate at all snake and random locations within different spatial scales of effect and centered and scaled all covariates prior to fitting statistical models.

TI  - Estimating Visible Band Albedo from Aerial Orthophotographs in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo is an important parameter in many environmental and renewable energy models. Satellite sensors can be used to derive broadband or narrowband albedos. However, the spatial resolution of such data can be insufficient in urban areas with complex morphology and land cover diversity. In this study, we propose the use of widely available aerial orthophotographs to derive visible band albedo in urban surfaces that can be effectively used in high-resolution applications. The solution is based on the estimation of the reflected irradiance captured by an RGB sensor and approximated by the brightness component in the hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) color model and incident solar irradiance modelled by the r.sun module in GRASS GIS. The visible band albedo values are calibrated by published reference values for selected land cover classes or, alternatively, by a spectroradiometer. The method is applied to the central part of Kosice and compared to visible band albedo derived from the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A sensors and previously published typical albedo values for various land cover classes, resulting in reasonable agreement. The proposed methodology is implemented using standard GIS tools that are easily applicable to any high-resolution urban data.

TI  - Formation of a perspective of identity and conscience as the civic basis of the nation
T2  - CUESTIONES POLITICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to substantiate the concept of national worldview, which underlies the effective unity of a person with his state. Currently, purposeful actions are being carried out in Ukraine directed against the sovereign statehood, threatening the territorial integrity of the country, national identity and its infrastructure. The revival of the sense of nationhood is considered an important task of the youth, as it is the basis of love for the national community of which one is a part. The present work is an essay close to political philosophy. It is concluded that in conditions of crisis and uncertainty, the requirements for the formation of a worldview of sense of the country, the development of which is based on the benefit of the people of Ukraine as a social democratic state, ready to form a responsible society, increase. Definitely, civic worldview is an integral part of the holistic idea of educational consolidation of society, which includes the breadth of understanding of the country's borders, the degree of love for fellow citizens, goodwill and awareness of being part of own unique social organism, the Ukrainian nation.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variation Characteristics of Water Bodies and Their Climatic Drivers Over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2002-2020
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal characteristics of water bodies and their response to climatic factors are significant for the study of the water budget and the ecological environment. As Asia's water tower, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has abundant surface water bodies, whose distribution and duration are sensitive to climate change. In this article, the surface water of the QTP in the recent 20 years was extracted from Landsat series TM/ETM+/OLI data combined with the Joint Research Centre of European Commission water body dataset. In addition, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the surface water area over the QTP were analyzed, and the climatic factors driving its dynamic change were explored based on 13 climatic variables. Results showed the following: First, from 2002 to 2020, the area of permanent water body in QTP increased from about 46 300 km(2) to about 54 700 km(2), showing the characteristics of increase in the north and decrease in the south. The area of seasonal water area decreased from about 8900 km(2) to about 6600 km(2), which were characterized by increase in the west and decrease in the east. Second, with 13 climatic variables reflecting the overall, seasonal, and extreme values of climate changes, the annual total precipitation had the strongest effect on the permanent water area over the total QTP, and the autumn mean air temperature was most relevant with the seasonal water area. Third, the predicted permanent water area of the QTP showed a trend of first slow and then fast increasing during 2021-2025, and expanded by 294 km(2) in 2025 compared with 2021, whereas the seasonal water area first increased by 131 km(2) and then decreased by 203 km(2). These results will help provide important references for water resource management and ecological environment protection in QTP.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The Later Han mirror has been appeared throughout China and the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago for 400 years. The inflow into the Korean Peninsula was during the Three Kingdoms period, which is largely classified into four types. The classified mirrors are as follows. There are Mirror with Animal Design, which decorates an envoy or ordinal tree with a theme pattern, Mirror with wave bands and dragons with horned dragon and tiger patterns, and deity and beast mirror, which expresses the statue of a god and a dragon and tiger based on fresh ideas. In addition, there is a Pictorial mirror that contains a variety of patterns and mythical content than the deity and beast mirror.Among them, the iconography of the “Pictural Mirror” adopted the longing for the new world, including the widely distributed legends of the King Father of the East and the Queen Mother of the West. What I found interesting was that it depicted figures who lived a Confucian adult life or heroic deeds in the context of Confucianism becoming a state religion at the time. For example, the main figures of Confucianism, such as Yao and Shun, King Wen of Zhou, and the death of the filial son Dong Yong, are in line with the Confucian worldview. Through this, if the Bronze Mirror focused on the afterlife as a burial product before the Later Han Dynasty, it can be estimated that it was expressed for the purpose of enlightenment, that is, the direction of the present world after the Later Han Dynasty.Later Han mirror, which expresses Confucianism in this way, seems to have been newly created by condensing the longing for the afterlife and the desire for the present world into the small space of the bronze mirror as Confucianism became a state religion. Therefore, it is understood that so far, not only has it deviated from the existing exhibition method of mainly explaining Phrases based on fresh ideas, but its function has also changed to gifts for edification purposes, not prestige goods. Through this, it is expected that the meaning of the Later Han mirror painting can be newly evaluated at the museum exhibition.

AB  - Ground subsidence, particularly in urban environments, poses a significant geohazard risk to private and public infrastructure. The subsidence can be caused by anthropogenic activity, such as excessive groundwater pumping, underground excavation, land reclamation, or geological forces (e.g., slow fault movement and earthquakes, and volcanic activity). Although terrestrial measurements using a Global Satellite Navigation Systems ( GNSS) or in-situ leveling survey provide accurate ground displacement information with a variable temporal resolution, such measures are limited due to their sparse spatial sampling. Furthermore, terrestrial measurements are associated with a high cost to survey the ground deformation. We present time-series analyses of ground subsidence in the southeastern part of Korea using multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. We investigate if ground subsidence can be retrieved with recent SAR observations that will be processed using several approaches for Interferometric SAR (InSAR) time-series, including Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) techniques. Preliminary results using COSMO-SkyMed and ALOS-2 SAR observations will be presented.

AB  - This study examines the meaning of the inherent meaning of child rearing based on parent’s worldview (Sire, 2004/2007). Their worldview determines what they are, where/what their value in life, and how they recognize, interpret, and discern situations and environments. We distinguished “child rearing by human standard” based on Humanistic worldviews pursuing atheism and relativity and “child rearing by God’s standard” based on Biblical worldview that recognize monotheism and absoluteness. The meaning and characteristics of parenting according to each worldview were compared and analyzed. The results revealed that child rearing based on a Biblical worldview that formed an ontological identity as a creature in God’s image (Genesis 1:27) under the pronunciation of the eternal word of the absolute is more suitable for capturing the essential meaning. We hope that parents will be able to think deeply and honestly about what kind of worldview raising children should be based on, and further change their worldview.

AB  - COVID-19 has brought many changes to society and encouraged mankind to reflect on its civilization. The pandemic has revealed that our health care systems and community solidarity are far more fragile than we believed. It made us rethink the solidarity of human civilization and community, and more fundamentally, reconsider the global ecosystem beyond human society. This paper claims that COVID-19 was an inevitable result of the anthropocentric perspective, and argues that it is necessary to change the perception to an ecological worldview and practice ecological justice in order to solve this situation. First, it analyses the ecological reasons for the regular outbreak of zoonotic diseases, including COVID-19, and then it examines Naess's deep ecology with regard to a fundamental change of perception, but also finds several weaknesses in this.Third, this paper focuses on Zhu Xi's philosophy in order to compensate for the weaknesses of deep ecology. It argues for the importance of human roles and obligations in relation to the safety and health of the environment based on his philosophy, and explains ecological justice by applying his social equality theory to ecology. Finally, it sheds new light on Zhu Xi's theory of investigation of things (gewu) as a practical way of implementing ecological justice.

AB  - This paper analyzes a Japanese physiologist’s activities and writings during the Sino-Japanese and the Pacific Wars. Uramoto Masasaburo (浦本政三郎, 1891-1965) was one of the leading physiologists of prewar Japan, whose expertise spanned from general physiology, reflex theory, kinesiology to sports medicine. As a founding member of the Physiological Society of Japan (PSJ) and physiology professor at the Tokyo Jikei University of Medicine, Uramoto actively engaged in the public discourse regarding the relationship between nation (minzoku), science, national vitality, and the role of physiology/medicine in society. Ultimately, he resonated with a group of his contemporaries who sought to construct nationally defined philosophy of science and medicine. This particularistic approach to science and medicine faced fierce criticism and was often labeled as “unscientific and irrational Japanism (nihonshugi)” by critically minded scientists, especially the Marxist scientist group. Although Uramoto and his like-minded physiologists have long been forgotten, his active involvement in the conceptual and institutional pursuit of wartime medical new order (ikai shintaisei) – centering on the role of a nation-state –left lasting legacies in postwar Japan.

AB  - This study investigates the history, cultural heritage, tradition, and way of life of African minority tribes pertaining to the origin of human civilization with a culture that developed along with nature and sophisticated artistic spirit. The purpose of this paper is to study the unique philosophy of African minority tribes with reference to past research. This paper intends to give knowledge to the next generation regarding cultural inheritance and values of ethnic minorities, and to recommend the necessity of further related research. The significance of this study is that the study can be used as a means of raising children through information sharing, a strong program area of parent education, which is inherited and based on the knowledge of the ancestors. The results of the study are as follows. Through the study of ethnic identity, the mystical wisdom of African indigenous people has an important meaning in the inheritance and education of the culture for the next generation. The need to preserve the customs, traditions, and cultural heritage of African minority tribes is raised by examining the influence of the geographical characteristics of their ethnic identity. An emphasis is given on the coexistence of the spiritual life, a worldview of the balance with nature and a philosophy of life, which have a relationship between the individual and nature. The results of this study will allow the sharing of knowledge by educating people’s worldview and philosophy from the perspective of nature conservation, sustainability, and how African minority tribes have been able to preserve their unique culture for centuries.

AB  - Conventional multi-beam pattern design in Geostationary (GEO) satellite communication systems consists of a regular grid of non-reconfigurable beams, where the beams overlap is typically assumed at the point where the beam edge reaches a 3-dB loss in the antenna pattern (with respect to the beam center). For certain high demand areas, this 3dB loss has a significant impact. To overcome this issue, in this paper we evaluate the potential gain of beam densification, i.e. considering an increased number of beams (keeping the same beam size and shape) to cover hot-spot areas, with the aim to push the beam overlap and increase the beam gain. In particular, we compare two beam patterns (kindly provided by ESA): One with regular beam grid, and one with densification in a particular hot-spot area. We provide a comparison in terms of per-beam average SINR and capacity, as well as an overall system analysis considering the whole densified region.

TI  - 1930년대 소비에트 문학논쟁의 거울로서 레닌의 톨스토이론
T2  - 러시아연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - Lenin’s Theory on Tolstoy was regarded as the methodological starting point of various literary debates in the 1920s and 30s, such as proletarian literature, companion writers, and socialist realism. Lenin’s views and methodology were the absolute guidelines in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 30s. And even today, evaluation of Lenin’s theory on Tolstoy continues. One thing is clear, that Lenin’s Theory on Tolstoy is still recognized as an important method for interpreting Tolstoy. In this paper, I try to argue that the core issues and opposing positions in the Soviet literary debate stem from differences in interpretation of Lenin’s Theory on Tolstoy. If P. F. Yudin (П. Ф. Юдин) and I. M. Nusinov (И. М. Нусинов) maintained a worldview-centric stance, M. Rosenthal (М. Розенталь), M. Lifshitz (Мих. Лифшиц), and G. Lukacs were closer to method-centrism. In the context of the Soviet literary debate at the time, the former is connected with G. V. Plekhanov (Г. В. Плеханов)’s tendency to sociology of art, which emphasized the class nature of art. On the other hand, the latter interpreted realism based on the theory of reflection, and emphasized the active role of realism rather than worldview in the creative process. However, the concept of worldview and method of creation was close to the philosophical and aesthetic categories. In other words, the debate about worldview and method of creation was more like a philosophy and aesthetic debate than a literary one. This is the decisive reason why this debate was ignored by the writers at the time.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of topos in Park Yong-rae's poetry. Topos is the concept of ‘place’ that embraces the meaning of space. The purpose of this study is to elucidate topos as a literary meaning through Park Yong-rae's poetry. Park Yong-rae mainly used the places of his hometown, natural objects, and houses as the subject matter of his poetry. The place of the poem acts as an emotional medium that connects the speaker and the poetic object. Park Yong-rae's poetry uses private relationships as poetic objects, and through these experiences, he evokes the universal experience of the community at the time. This study intends to take a fresh look at Park Yong-rae's topos.The first Park Yong-rae's topos has the characteristics of a local narrative. The local name is connected to the origin of Park Yong-rae's poetry. Park Yong-rae's poetry is in a symbol system that aims for the essence. Park Yong-rae's poetry embraces the material of rural communities with its surface structure. In the inner structure, a method of hiding the human archetypal symbol is chosen. The second Park Yong-rae's topos is the topos of memory. Most of Park Yong-rae's poems start from memory. The subject that summons the memory becomes the subject of the event. By summoning memory as the subject of the event, minority and marginality are established. The topos is visually revealed through the place the subject looks at.This study focuses on the fact that Park Yong-rae's topos does not stop at the level of material, but takes an ideal place as his hometown. The topos is connected with the subject's worldview. To explain this, the image community was interpreted through the concept of local narrative. The subject of the image was interpreted from the point of view of memory. In other words, it is the characteristic of this paper to connect place, subject, and image.

TI  - Host preferences inhibit transmission from potential superspreader host species
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Host species that are particularly abundant, infectious, and/or infected tend to contribute disproportionately to symbiont (parasite or mutualist) maintenance in multi-host systems. Therefore, in a facultative multi-host system where two host species had high densities, high symbiont infestation intensities, and high infestation prevalence, we expected interspecific transmission rates to be high. Instead, we found that interspecific symbiont transmission rates to caged sentinel hosts were an order of magnitude lower than intraspecific transmission rates in the wild. Using laboratory experiments to decompose transmission rates, we found that opportunities for interspecific transmission were frequent, where interspecific and intraspecific contact rate functions were statistically indistinguishable. But most interspecific contacts did not lead to transmission events due to a previously unrecognized transmission barrier: strong host preferences. During laboratory choice experiments, the symbiont preferred staying on or dispersing to its current host species, even though the oligochaete symbiont is a globally distributed host generalist that can survive and reproduce on many snail species. These surprising results suggest that when managing symbiont transmission, identifying key host species is still important, but it may be equally important to identify and manage transmission barriers that keep potential superspreader host species in check. This repository contains a detailed metadata file that describes each script and dataset. Though Chaetogaster limnaei has a broad host distribution, two snail genera, Helisoma and Physa, have been the focus for most prior experiments and are especially abundant in ponds in North America. Therefore, for all field and laboratory studies, we used H. trivolvis snails as the focal host species (i.e., the species in which we quantified infestation rates) and P. gyrina as the alternative host species. We especially focused on interspecific transmission from P. gyrina to H. trivolvis (alternative to focal host transmission; hereafter alternative-focal), which complements prior work that quantified intraspecific transmission among H. trivolvis snails (focal to focal host transmission; hereafter focal-focal). We used a sentinel host approach to quantify the rate that uninfested focal hosts (H. trivolvis) that had been raised in the laboratory became infested when caged in the field due to contacts with wild H. trivolvis and P. gyrina through the mesh on the field cages. We then decomposed the estimated interspecific transmission rate using two laboratory experiments that quantified interspecific contact rates and interspecific transmission success. The three R script files correspond to the analyses of the field data, interspecific contact rate experiment, and interspecific transmission success experiment. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

We then decomposed the estimated interspecific transmission rate using two laboratory experiments that quantified interspecific contact rates and interspecific transmission success. The three R script files correspond to the analyses of the field data, interspecific contact rate experiment, and interspecific transmission success experiment. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

AB  - Correctable single event upsets observed in a SRAM memory on-board of Sentinel 2A and 2B are studied, with the aim of identifying a correlation between space weather activity and the orbital time and position of occurrence of SEU. Sentinel 2A and 2B are two identical ESA satellites flying at an average altitude of 786 km. The SRAM memory under study is part of the memory system supervisor.Event rate, sampled at one orbital period, is heavily superimposed by normal variance due to intrinsic Poisson distribution of SEE. A moving average filter extracts features attributed to the solar cycle, the South Atlantic Anomaly (SSA) seasonal behaviour and device degradation. Further data is needed to study the response to geomagnetic storms, since available ones are relative to a prolonged 'solar lull' period.Position data is filtered similarly, which is expected to show the movement of the SAA as seen by single events. The two satellites' filtered event positions show common features, but also peculiar, currently unexplained, short-term differences.

TI  - Sat U-Net: A Fusion Based Method for Forensic Splicing Localization in Satellite Images
T2  - MULTIMODAL IMAGE EXPLOITATION AND LEARNING 2022
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Multimodal Image Exploitation and Learning
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Satellite images are widely available to the public. These satellite images are used in various fields including natural disaster analysis, meteorology and agriculture. As with any type of images, satellite images can be altered using image manipulation tools. A common manipulation is splicing, i.e., pasting on top of an image a region coming from a different source image. Most manipulation detection methods designed for images captured by "consumer cameras" tend to fail when used with satellite images. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach, Sat U-Net, to fuse the results of two exiting forensic splicing localization methods to increase their overall accuracy and robustness. Sat U-Net is a U-Net based architecture exploiting several Transformers to enhance the performance. Sat U-Net fuses the outputs of two unsupervised splicing detection methods, Gated PixelCNN Ensemble and Vision Transformer, to produce a heatmap highlighting the manipulated image region. We show that our fusion approach trained on images from one satellite can be lightly retrained on few images from another satellite to detect spliced regions. We compare our approach to well-known splicing detection methods (i.e., Noiseprint) and segmentation techniques (i.e., U-Net and Nested Attention U-Net). We conducted our experiments on two large datasets: one dataset contains images from Sentinel 2 satellites and the other one contains images from Worldview 3 satellite. Our experiments show that our proposed fusion method performs well when compared to other techniques in localizing spliced areas using Jaccard Index and Dice Score as metrics on both datasets.

TI  - New trends in the surgical treatment of axilla in breast cancer
T2  - Magyar sebeszet
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Oncosurgical treatment of breast tumors involves the removal of metastatic axillary lymph nodes. In the last 30 years, the diagnosis and treatment of axillary lymph nodes have also undergone significant changes. The introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy in 1993 made axillary block dissection with high morbidity safely omitted in a significant proportion of patients, and similarly, the staging of breast tumors and thus oncology and complex treatment became significantly more accurate. Shortly after the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy, intraoperative examination of sentinel lymph nodes (e.g. imprint cytology) also appeared, which significantly reduced the number of surgeries performed in the two sessions, thereby significantly reducing patient burden and surgical costs. The results of our study indicate that axillary block dissection is required in the treatment of axilla in an ever-decreasing group of patients and this proportion will decrease further in the future, with the increasing use of alternative axillary radiotherapy. The imprint cytological examination of sentinel lymph nodes taking into account current guidelines, no longer provides demonstrable benefits and its routine use is not justified. According to the latest international recommendations, intraoperative examination of the sentinel lymph node may be indicated in connection with mastectomy (when postoperative radiotherapy is not planned) and after neoadjuvant treatment. Our results suggest that the detection of suspected lymph nodes during preoperative axillary ultrasound may predict the stage of the disease. Based on our research results confirm that in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, in addition to the preoperative size of the tumour (≤20mm,P= 0.002), the preoperative size of the lymph node (≤15mm,P= 0.04) may also be used to predict that the stage of the disease is N0-1.

AB  - Oases agriculture is one of the most vulnerable anthropogenic landscapes to climate change and human activates. Central Asia is one of the arid regions highly vulnerable to water scarcity. Located in Central Asia, Kazakhstan is characterized as a semi-arid region which includes dry steppe land in the south. Agriculture carried out in this area is typically oasis farmland with water taken from local rivers used for irrigation. During the former Soviet Union, irrigation projects were widely carried out to expand agricultural land, and large-scale irrigation projects were created in several areas. Therefore, many irrigated farmlands were abandoned due to the collapse of the former Soviet Union. However, China's investment in Kazakhstan agriculture is cultivating once abandoned agricultural land and developing new oases agricultural land. Our study focusses on the vulnerability of oasis agriculture and extract changes in agricultural land for about 30 years from 1989 to the present using Landsat series and Sentinel series and visualized them using RGB color combined techniques. The results show that agricultural land is disappeared or desertified at the Ili River basin and at the foot of the zhongar-Alatau Mountain and that there are several years of fallow even in areas where agriculture is active. Using the Zharkent region in the irrigated alluvial fan of zhongar-Alatau Moun-tain of eastern Kazakhstan as an example, we classify the farm field changing using Landsat TM and Sentilel-2 satellite imagery and identify of vulnerability to the disappearance of oases farmland. China's investment in agriculture could lead to the depletion of water resources in the region.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - Crop yield forecast is important, but determining productivity is an on-going challenge for agricultural communities including policy makers. An increase in the number of satellites, improved temporal and spatial resolutions and more open data policies, are leading to wider interest by the agricultural sector in exploiting space-based data at moderate spatial resolutions (10-30 m) and varying wavelengths (optical and microwave) for crop yield monitoring. This study evaluated Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric data to forecast soybean yields one month before the harvest at field scales over a site in central Argentina. Specifically, polarimetric features were extracted from the Sentinel-1 data using the M-Chi decomposition. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was trained using a time series of the single-bounce and volume scattering parameters derived from M-Chi from stacks of data acquired during the growing season. To estimate soybean yield from the ANN model, an innovative iterative retrieval method was developed. This retrieval approach improved the accuracies of the soybean yield forecast delivering a final coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.81 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 755.81 kg/ha and mean absolute error (MAE) of 581.65 kg/ha. These accuracies demonstrate a high potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 for soybean yield forecast at field scales.

TI  - Areal Precipitation Coverage Ratio for Enhanced AI Modelling of Monthly Runoff: A New Satellite Data-Driven Scheme for Semi-Arid Mountainous Climate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides useful gridded data for the conceptual modelling of hydrological processes such as precipitation-runoff relationship. Structurally flexible and computationally advanced AI-assisted data-driven (DD) models foster these applications. However, without linking concepts between variables from many grids, the DD models can be too large to be calibrated efficiently. Therefore, effectively formulized, collective input variables and robust verification of the calibrated models are desired to leverage satellite data for the strategic DD modelling of catchment runoff. This study formulates new satellite-based input variables, namely, catchment- and event-specific areal precipitation coverage ratios (CCOVs and ECOVs, respectively) from the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) and evaluates their usefulness for monthly runoff modelling from five mountainous Karkheh sub-catchments of 5000-43,000 km(2) size in west Iran. Accordingly, 12 different input combinations from GPM and MODIS products were introduced to a generalized deep learning scheme using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Using an adjusted five-fold cross-validation process, 420 different ANN configurations per fold choice and 10 different random initial parameterizations per configuration were tested. Runoff estimates from five hybrid models, each an average of six top-ranked ANNs based on six statistical criteria in calibration, indicated obvious improvements for all sub-catchments using the new variables. Particularly, ECOVs were most efficient for the most challenging sub-catchment, Kashkan, having the highest spacetime precipitation variability. However, better performance criteria were found for sub-catchments with lower precipitation variability. The modelling performance for Kashkan indicated a higher dependency on data partitioning, suggesting that long-term data representativity is important for modelling reliability.

TI  - The SEKO assignment. Efficient and fair assignment of students to multiple seminars
T2  - OPERATIONS RESEARCH AND DECISIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seminars are offered to students for education in various disciplines. The seminars may be limited in terms of the maximum number of participants, e.g., to have lively interactions. Due to capacity limitations, those seminars are often offered several times to serve the students' demands. Still, some seminars are more popular than others and it may not be possible to grant access to all interested students due to capacity limitations. In this paper, a simple, but efficient random selection using key objectives (SEKO) assignment strategy is proposed which achieves the following goals: (i) efficiency by utilizing all available seminar places, (ii) satisfying all students by trying to assign at least one seminar to each student, and (iii) fairness by considering the number of assigned seminars per student. We formulate various theoretical optimization models using integer linear programming (ILP) and compare their solutions to the SEKO assignment based on a real-world data set. The real-world data set is also used as the basis for generating large data sets to investigate the scalability in terms of demand and number of seminars. Furthermore, the first-in first-out (FIFO) assignment, as a typical implementation of fair assignments in practice, is compared to SEKO in terms of utilization and fairness. The results show that the FIFO assignment suffers in realworld situations regarding fairness, while the SEKO assignment is close to the optimum and scales regarding computational time in contrast to the ILP.

AB  - As an effective tool to investigate time-series of ground deformation resulting from human activities or natural disasters, persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry requires a large amount of computing resources especially for continuous routine monitoring over large areas. Powered by open-source software packages including the SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) from ESA and the Stanford Method of Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS), a fully automatic PS-InSAR framework is built to process large-volume Sentinel-1 data. The processing time is reduced tremendously with the parallelizable procedures in the end-to-end processing pipeline boosted by High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Embedding in the web GIS developed in CRISP, the framework also provides interfaces in browsers to visualize the resulting deformation time-series and ground displacement rate maps. The automatic framework executable in HPC also enables routine monitoring of ground subsidence over major cities in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Reconstructing a Gap-Free MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index Product Using a Long Short-Term Memory Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric disturbance, sensor malfunctions, and other factors can cause serious gap pixels in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference snow index (NDSI) products. In this article, MODIS NDSI gap pixels are reconstructed in a highly heterogeneous area with drastic snow accumulation and melting changes using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Three LSTM-based MODIS NDSI gap pixel reconstruction schemes, i.e., forward, backward, and bidirectional LSTM networks that separately use earlier, subsequent, and integrated earlier and subsequent timestamp information, are developed. NDSI information for the gap pixel is restored using the long-term spatiotemporal information for this pixel and its adjacent pixels. A case study of NDSI reconstruction in the source area of the Yellow River, northwestern China, during the 2018-2019 snow season, demonstrates that all three LSTM-based schemes can reliably generate spatiotemporally continuous NDSI data with an accuracy comparable to that of the original MODIS NDSI products under clear-sky conditions. The bidirectional LSTM-based scheme, which has the best performance, can achieve a desirable overall accuracy of 89.93%, with an omission error of 3.82% and a commission error of 6.25%, in terms of dichotomous evaluation based on in situ snow depth observations. The R-2, average RMSE, overestimation error, and underestimation error are 0.95, 5.13%, 5.39, and 6.40%, respectively, in terms of the continuous value assessment based on the gap pixels assumption. Our results demonstrate the reliability and feasibility of the LSTM-based schemes in recovering the missing values in MODIS NDSI products by deeply excavating the spatial continuity and long-time series dependence of the snow cover.

TI  - The seasonal response of vegetation water use efficiency to temperature and precipitation in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), which integrates ecosystem carbon and water cycles, is an important index for evaluating ecosystem sensitivity to climate change. Based on MODIS remote sensing data and meteorological data, this paper quantitatively studied the variation in seasonal vegetation WUE in the Loess Plateau over the period 2001-2019. Temperature and precipitation threshold effects on seasonal WUE of different vegetation types were also discovered using regression and partial correlation analysis methods. The results showed that seasonal WUE decreased with time in each season studied, with the rate of decrease of WUE in summer being the most significant of the three seasons studied. The following was the order of change in vegetation WUE values over time in different seasons: summer > autumn > spring. WUE of different vegetation types showed seasonal differences as well as varying responses to temperature and precipitation. The WUE of shrubland and grassland both tended to decrease over the study period from spring to autumn, with grassland WUE decreasing the most. When compared to grassland and shrubland, the negative relationship between forest WUE and the temperature was highest in spring and summer. The proportion of the area of vegetation where WUE was negatively correlated with temperature and precipitation in the three seasons, was largest in summer. In the relationship between seasonal WUE and either temperature or precipitation, there was a threshold effect. In spring, summer, and autumn, the optimum precipitation thresholds were 50-80 mm, 280-370 mm, and 65-125 mm, respectively, and the corresponding optimum temperature thresholds were > 14 degrees C, 15-19 degrees C, and 6-13 degrees C, respectively.

TI  - RFSDAF: A New Spatiotemporal Fusion Method Robust to Registration Errors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is commonly used in remote sensing to generate fine spatial-temporal resolution images. Among most present spatiotemporal fusion methods, the registration error results in a mismatch in the reflectance and class abundance information within the MODIS pixel to be analyzed during the spatiotemporal fusion. In this article, a new spatiotemporal fusion model, robust flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (RFSDAF), is proposed; in other words, this method is robust to registration errors. The RFSDAF method uses a multiscale fusion strategy that is adaptive to different degrees of coregistration error. It incorporates multiscale information, which extends the analysis of the reflectance and class fraction from per-MODIS pixel to inter-MODIS pixels, and it is robust to coregistration errors. This method does not require high-accuracy preprocession coregistration algorithms and can automatically reduce the effect of the registration error to a great extent. The RFSDAF method is compared with four spatiotemporal image fusion algorithms, and the effectiveness of the method in resolving the registration error is demonstrated using both a simulated dataset and two actual satellite datasets. The experimental results show that the RFSDAF method can better reduce the impact of the registration error than the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and FSDAF, which adopts the phase cross-correlation algorithm to preprocess and coregister the MODIS-Landsat image through real image experiments. Consequently, the RFSDAF method has a great robustness for real spatiotemporal image fusion with registration errors and has the potential for monitoring land surface dynamics.

TI  - Mastectomy and Immediate Breast Reconstruction with Pre-Pectoral or Sub-Pectoral Implant: Assessing Clinical Practice, Post-Surgical Outcomes, Patient's Satisfaction and Cost.
T2  - Journal of surgery and research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) rates increase during last years and implant-based reconstruction was the most commonly performed procedure. We examined data collected over 25 months to assess complication rate, duration of surgery, patient's satisfaction and cost, according to pre-pectoral or sub-pectoral implant-IBR. All patients who received an implant-IBR, from January 2020 to January 2022, were included. Results were compared between pre-pectoral and sub-pectoral implant-IBR in univariate and multivariate analysis. We performed 316 implant-IBR, 218 sub-pectoral and 98 (31%) pre-pectoral. Pre-pectoral implant-IBR was significantly associated with the year (2021: OR=12.08 and 2022: OR=76.6), the surgeons and type of mastectomy (SSM vs NSM: OR=0.377). Complications and complications Grade 2-3 rates were 12.9% and 10.1% for sub-pectoral implant-IBR respectively, without significant difference with pre-pectoral implant-IBR: 17.3% and 13.2%. Complications Grade 2-3 were significantly associated with age <50-years (OR=2.27), ASA-2 status (OR=3.63) and cup-size >C (OR=3.08), without difference between pre and sub-pectoral implant-IBR. Durations of surgery were significantly associated with cup-size C and >C (OR=1.72 and 2.80), with sentinel lymph-node biopsy and axillary dissection (OR=3.66 and 9.59) and with sub-pectoral implant-IBR (OR=2.088). Median hospitalization stay was 1 day, without difference between pre and sub-pectoral implant-IBR. Cost of surgery was significantly associated with cup-size > C (OR=2.216) and pre-pectoral implant-IBR (OR=8.02). Bad-medium satisfaction and IBR-failure were significantly associated with local recurrence (OR=8.820), post-mastectomy radiotherapy (OR=1.904) and sub-pectoral implant-IBR (OR=2.098).Conclusion: Complications were not different between pre and sub-pectoral implant-IBR. Pre-pectoral implant-IBR seems a reliable and faster technique with better patient satisfaction but with higher cost.

TI  - Sea Snots in the Marmara Sea as Observed From Medium-Resolution Satellites
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisensor medium-resolution satellite images from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI), and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) are used to study spatial and temporal distributions of sea snot features in the Marmara Sea between 2000 and 2021. Suspicious image slicks are identified in most years, and spectral diagnostics indicate sea snot features in 2007, 2008, and 2021, with the record-high sea snot event occurring in spring-summer 2021. In other years, when similar image slicks are found, they appear to be from surface scums of red Noctiluca scintillans, a heterotrophic dinoflagellate responsible for red tides. Based on the medium-resolution images, the 2021 sea snot event started from March 14 and ended on June 27, with its peak time around May 4 when the sea snot features are found in the entire Marmara Sea covering an area of 1160 km(2). When all sea snots are aggregated together, the estimated areal coverage during the peak time is 50 km(2), suggesting significant patchiness in the surface scums.

TI  - On-Board Thermal Motion Compensation Method for Pointing Errors of the Remote Sensor Aboard a Three-Axis Stabilized Geostationary Satellite
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - For earth observation from a three-axis stabilized geostationary (GEO) remote-sensing satellite, a highly accurate onboard thermal motion compensation (TMC) method for real-time correction of the satellite sensor's line-of-sight (LOS) pointing error due to thermally induced structural distortion internal to the sensor during the diurnal cycle remains a global concern to date. In this letter, we propose a novel TMC method for GEO sensors. Compared with the traditional TMC methods, this method has the following two advantages. First, we define the LOS misalignment angle to model the comprehensive impact of the sensor's internal thermal misalignment angles on the sensor's LOS pointing behavior, which makes the optical path modeling simpler and more generic. Second, we fit the repeatable diurnal variations of the LOS misalignment angle based on long time-series star observations; therefore, the calculation and the use of the TMC amount are no longer limited to the assumption that the sensor's internal thermal misalignment angles remain constant within a certain period of time, as in the traditional method. The proposed TMC method is theoretically applicable to all types of GEO sensors, including optical and microwave sensors, and is verified by Fengyun-4A advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (FY-4A/AGRI) TMC experiments.

M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the dynamic change of wet-snow facies (WSF) in Greenland is important in investigating the mass balance of Greenland ice sheets and assessing global sea level rise. In this study, we proposed a rapid WSF extraction algorithm, referred to as difference method, for extracting WSF at a continental scale and with high spatial resolution using the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data available on Google Earth Engine. We used this method to extract the WSF in Greenland from May to October in recent 6 years. Accuracy of the extracted results was evaluated using air temperature data from Greenland automatic weather station. Results suggested that the difference method has good precision in extracting WSF from Sentinel-1 SAR data, and can process a large amount of data simply, quickly, and effectively.

TI  - Distribution and Evolution of Supraglacial Lakes in Greenland during the 2016-2018 Melt Seasons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has become one of the major causes of global sea-level rise. Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are typical hydrological features produced on the surface of the GrIS during the melt seasons. The existence and evolution of SGLs play an important role in the melting process of the ice sheet surface. To understand the distribution and recent changes of SGLs in Greenland, this study developed a random forest (RF) algorithm incorporating the texture and morphological features to automatically identify SGLs based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Sentinel-2 imagery was used to map the SGLs inventory in Greenland during the 2016-2018 melt seasons and to explore the spatial and temporal variability characteristics of SGLs. Our results show changes in SGLs from 2016 to 2018, with the total area decreasing by ~1152.22 km(2) and the number increasing by 1134; SGLs are mainly distributed in western Greenland (SW, CW, NW) and northeastern Greenland (NE), where the NE region has the largest number of observed SGLs and the largest SGL was with the surface area of 16.60 km(2) (2016). SGLs were found to be most active in the area with the elevation of 800-1600 m and the slope of 0-5 degrees, and showed a phenomenon of retreating to lower elevation areas and developing to steeper slope areas. Our work provided a method for rapid inventory of SGLs. This study will help monitor the mass balance of the GrIS and predict future rapid ice loss from Greenland.

AB  - With the increasing of remote sensing data sources and collection methods, its application scenarios are continuously migrating and developing. However, it is difficult to meet the demand for real-time detection due to the problems of low automation of data and poor timeliness of information extraction. After extensive research, a new method of remote sensing image classification based on the ResNet model is selected, which can shorten the training time and improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, the self-made remote sensing image dataset HN-7 and the feature classification dataset of the Shang Tang remote sensing image competition are used. Experiments were conducted on the improved network model and with a weight-shifting training method. The experimental results show that the improved network model and the robustness of the model are enhanced by the weight-shifting training method. The availability of input features is improved by combining multi-scale feature extraction and channel attention. The experimental results show that the improved network model and the weight transfer training method can improve the classification accuracy without increasing the training time.

TI  - Characterization of Brightness Temperature Biases at Channels 13 and 14 for FY-3C MWHS-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The second-generation Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS-2) onboard Fengyun (FY)-3C has a data quality comparable to that of counterpart microwave moisture sounders. However, channels 13 and 14 have large biases that are negatively correlated with the instrument temperature and prevent the operational assimilation of the data of these two channels. To better understand the biases of channels 13 and 14, the correlation of the observation minus simulation data (O-B bias) of different channels with the instrument temperature and other factors is investigated for FY-3C MWHS-2 in this article. A sensitivity analysis using a gradient boosting decision tree indicates that the instrument temperature and scan position are the two dominant factors, with total bias-contribution scores exceeding 0.8 for both channels 13 and 14. This conclusion is verified through further analysis of the bias distributions for the scan position, scene brightness temperature, and ascending/descending orbits. Using 12-week data recorded in 2016, the correlations of the O-B bias with the scan position and instrument temperature are specifically investigated and a correction algorithm is formulated, with which data for 2016 and 2017 are corrected. The corrected data in both channels have smaller, more stable biases, and are less affected by the instrument temperatures and scan position. The bias contributions associated with these two factors should thus be further studied.

TI  - LCDNet: Light-Weighted Cloud Detection Network for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is one of the important links in high-resolution remote sensing image processing. Cloud detection methods can be mainly divided into the following three categories: threshold methods, clustering methods based on machine learning, and deep learning methods. The traditional threshold method needs cumbersome manual calibration, which has high cost and poor universality. The generalization of clustering-based method is very poor. In addition, existing deep learning methods tend to have many model parameters and high training costs. To solve the abovementioned problems, a light-weighted cloud detection network (LCDNet) based on deep learning method is proposed. The network can complete the task of high-precision segmentation with less parameters and computation. Its light-weighted bottleneck layer can quickly capture the multiscale feature information in the image and segment the cloud with high efficiency. The gated channel excitation module can effectively reduce the feature redundancy in the network, so as to highlight the details of the cloud layer and improve the detection accuracy. The function of light-weighted self attention module is to quickly establish the spatial location information in the feature map, so as to locate the unpredictable targets and reduce the false detection rate. The experimental results show that the model shows an excellent performance on cloud and cloud shadow datasets with 353.76 k parameters and 456.28 Mmac computation. In addition, the training results on GF1_WHU and L8 Biome datasets further show that our model has an excellent generalization performance, which is of great significance for the efficient implementation of cloud detection.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Downscaling Method of Land Surface Temperature Based on Daily Change Model of Temperature
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most crucial variables of surface energy processes. However, the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing data has greatly limited the availability of concurrently high-spatiotemporal resolution LST data for wide applications. Existing downscaling methods are easily affected by null values of LST data and effective time distribution of high-resolution LST data, resulting in large downscaling errors at sometimes. Within this context, this study proposes a novel spatiotemporal fusion model of LST based on diurnal variation information (BDSTFM) to predict LST data with a high temporal resolution and spatiotemporal continuity based on FY-4A and MODIS. Results indicated that the accuracy of the downscaling results was comparable to that of MODIS LST products. The BDSTFM model exhibited the following characteristics: use low-spatial resolution data to establish a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model for scale deduction, and retention of the temporal distribution characteristics of LST data; extend the observation time of high-spatial resolution data to improve the accuracy and stability of the model; add an invalid pixel reconstruction step that considers the LST spatiotemporal continuity, and can obtain a realistic and reliable 1-km seamless LST datasets at hourly intervals under clear skies. Compared with the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), 4-parameter DTC model, and Random Forest model, the BDSTFM model attained a higher downscaling accuracy.

TI  - Research on water body extraction based on a joint probability model of convolution neural network and spectral information
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - This paper proposes a method of water body extraction from remote sensing images based on deep learning. Using Landsat images to establish a joint probability model of convolution neural network in which the full connection layer is replaced by the multi-layer perceptron and combined with spectral information. This paper trains the CNN model firstly and then puts the extracted features into the MLP classifier. Since the full connection layer of the CNN can obtain full information, using MLP to replace the full connection layer to train the neural network has a higher identification ratio. In addition, due to the insufficient utilization of spectral information from remote sensing images by CNN, and NDWI can highlight the water body characteristics in remote sensing images, using the joint probability model can effectively improve the water body extraction accuracy. In this paper, two water bodies in Jilin Province of China, Jinyue Lake, and Chagan Lake, are selected as the study areas. The water body extraction method based on a joint probability model of convolutional neural network and spectral information is compared with the common water body extraction methods, and the new algorithm has a kappa coefficient of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 93.17% for the water body extraction of Jinyue Lake, And it has a kappa coefficient of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 93% for the water body extraction of Chagan Lake.The new algorithm has improved the kappa coefficient and overall accuracy compared with other water body extraction methods, which proves the high identification ratio.

TI  - SGT: A Generalized Processing Model for 1-D Remote Sensing Signal Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a generalized feature extraction framework for 1-D remote sensing data. This approach streamlines the processing for extracting features by eliminating the need for some preprocessing, such as data normalization, data filtering, and spectrogram generation, which explicitly encode domain-specific knowledge of the tasks. The main component of the new framework, called shifted-grad Transformer (SGT), includes the shift module, grad module, smooth module, raw embedding module, Transformer encoder module, and additional essential module. Extensive experiments on datasets, such as hyperspectral image (HSI) data, magnetic signal data, and other 1-D data, have demonstrated that the SGT performs significantly better than the existing methods and provides a new solution to the 1-D data processing problem. Our training code and data are available at https://github.com/wfnian/SGT.

AB  - Climate change by anthropogenic warming leads to increases in dry fuels and promotes forest fires. Multispectral images' quality is easily affected by poor atmospheric conditions. SAR satellite sensors can penetrate through clouds and image day and night. However, the burned area mapping methods widely used for optical data are not feasible to be applied for SAR data owing to the differences in imaging mechanisms. Recent advances in deep image translation can fill this gap by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this research, we apply a GAN-based model for SAR to optical image translation over fire-disturbed regions. Specifically, Sentinel-1 SAR images are translated into Sentinel-2 images using the ResNet-based Pix2Pix model, which is trained on 281 large fire events and tested on the other 23 events in Canada. The generated images preserve the spectral characteristics well and show high similarity to the real images with Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) over 0.59.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - a new flood extraction method which combines semi-automatic thresholding and change detection is proposed. First, a line across land and water is drawn manually. The locally optimal threshold is calculated automatically along the line from two endpoints to middle. Using this threshold, the low backscattering regions are extracted to generate a preliminary flood map. Then, the neighborhood-based change detection method combined with the entropy thresholding is adopted to detect the changed area. Finally, pixels in both the low backscattering regions and the changed regions are marked as "flood". The effectiveness and practicality of the flood extraction method was demonstrated by a set of Sentinel-1A data and ground truth data provided by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS).

TI  - Optimization and Evaluation of SO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Based on WRF-Chem and 3DVAR Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emission inventories are important for modeling studies and policy-making, but the traditional "bottom-up" emission inventories are often outdated with a time lag, mainly due to the lack of accurate and timely statistics. In this study, we developed a "top-down" approach to optimize the emission inventory of sulfur dioxide (SO2) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and a three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) system. The observed hourly surface SO2 concentrations from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center were assimilated and used to estimate the gridded concentration forecast errors of WRF-Chem. The concentration forecast errors were then converted to the emission errors by assuming a linear response from SO2 emission to concentration by grids. To eliminate the effects of modelling errors from aspects other than emissions, a strict data-screening process was conducted. Using the Multi-Resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) 2010 as the a priori emission, the emission inventory for October 2015 over Mainland China was optimized. Two forecast experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the SO2 forecast by using the a priori (control experiment) and optimized emissions (optimized emission experiment). The results showed that the forecasts with optimized emissions typically outperformed the forecasts with 2010 a priori emissions in terms of the accuracy of the spatial and temporal distributions. Compared with the control experiment, the bias and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the optimized emission experiment decreased by 71.2% and 25.9%, and the correlation coefficients increased by 50.0%. The improvements in Southern China were more significant than those in Northern China. For the Sichuan Basin, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta, the bias and RMSEs decreased by 76.4-94.2% and 29.0-45.7%, respectively, and the correlation coefficients increased by 23.5-53.4%. This SO2 emission optimization methodology is computationally cost-effective.

TI  - An Approach of Sea Clutter Suppression for SAR Images by Self-Supervised Complex-Valued Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong reflections from the marine surface reduce the contrast between the target of interest and the background in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and severely affect the interpretation of the image. This letter proposes a framework of SAR sea clutter suppression based on a new self-supervised training strategy referred to as Clutter2Clutter (C2C), which mines self-supervised information from a large number of unlabeled SAR patches for network training. This letter also proposes a complex-valued UNet++ (CV-UNet++) network model to make full use of both amplitude and phase information of the complex SAR image, and the C2C strategy is used to train the CV-UNet++ for sea clutter suppression. Experiments on GF-3 and TerraSAR-X SAR data show that the proposed method has a better effect on suppressing sea clutter and is able to preserve the target-of-interest energy well.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Based on the sea surface remote sensing reflectance products of MODIS/Aqua sensors from 2002-08 to 2021-07, and the PSC remote sensing inversion model constructed by Sun et al. (2019), PSC long-term data set is produced. The dataset contains the phytoplankton size classes (Fm, Fn, and Fp) in the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea from Aug. 2002 to Jul. 2021.  The data set is stored in the standard format of Matlab and contains 228 files in total, which are easy to read by each software.  The statistical results of the long-term distribution of PSCs based on this dataset show that the coastal waters are mainly enriched by microphytoplankton, while the offshore waters are primarily dominated by nanophytoplankton. Judging from the multi-year monthly averaged PSCs in five specific areas, taking microphytoplankton as an example, there are "double peaks" in spring (May) and summer (July) in the center of the Bohai Sea and the mouth of the Yangtze River, while the North Yellow Sea area presents a spring (April), autumn (October) peak feature. Meanwhile, the spring peaks in the offshore waters of the South Yellow Sea and the East China Sea are more significant in April and March, respectively.

TI  - Ecological restoration and rising CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the carbon sink, counteracting climate change in northeastern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of climate change, rising CO2, land-use/land-cover change and land management on the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems has been widely reported. However, only rarely have studies have been conducted to clarify the impact of climate change and rising CO2 on the carbon sink contributed by ecological restoration projects (ERPs). To better understand the impact of climate change and rising CO2 on ERPs, we took the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project zone as an example to set up different scenarios to distinguish the confounding effects of these factors on the regional carbon budget based on a remote sensing data-driven model. Compared with business as usual, our results show that climate change caused a carbon loss of 78.97 Tg C. On the contrary, ERPs contributed a carbon sink of approximately 199.88 Tg C in forest and grassland. Furthermore, rising CO2 also contributed an additional carbon sink of 107.80 Tg C. This study distinguished the individual effects of different factors, and clarified the net carbon sink contributed by ERPs and rising CO2 and their significance for enhancing the regional carbon sink and reversing the adverse effects of climate change on the carbon sink. Furthermore, ERPs can sequester carbon more effectively and faster compared with rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - Assessment of FY-3E GNOS-II GNSS-R Global Wind Product
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two different Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Reflectometry wind products are to be developed for the Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder II (GNOS-II) payload on the FengYun-3E (FY-3E) satellite: A global wind product optimized for global low-to-medium wind speeds and a cyclone wind product optimized for high wind speeds in the tropical and extratropical cyclones. This article presents a comprehensive assessment of the GNOS-II global wind product for both global positioning system (GPS) and Beidou (BDS) product at wind speeds below 25 m/s using its data of first six months. Three datasets, including the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis, HY-2B scatterometer and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) winds, are used for the assessment. The assessment of the Level 1 observables shows that the instrument's performance and calibration are generally stable. For the assessment of retrieved winds, the general performances of GPS and BDS products are similar. The overall wind speed root-mean-square error is 1.54 m/s for GPS-R and 1.44 m/s for BDS-R when compared with ECMWF, 1.48 m/s for GPS-R and 1.36 m/s for BDS-R when compared with HY-2B, and 2.08 m/s for GPS-R and 2.04 m/s for BDS-R when compared with SMAP. The overall wind speed biases for GPS-R and BDS-R are about zeros when compared with each dataset. The assessment is also made by the dependence on time, signal-to-noise ratio, observable, GNSS block, wind speed, incidence angle, and geography. Overall, the FY-3E GNOS-II global wind product is consistent over time and space with an accuracy meeting the requirement of operational use.

TI  - Characterization and Calibration of Spaceborne GNSS-R Observations Over the Ocean From Different BeiDou Satellite Types
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique can measure ocean surface winds and other geophysical parameters from forward scattered Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (Global Positioning System (GPS), BeiDou (BDS), Galileo, etc.) signals. However, most early spaceborne missions only captured GPS signals while the study of spaceborne BDS reflectometry (BDS-R) is limited. The Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder II (GNOS-II) payload onboard China's FY-3E satellite has been operationally collecting a large number of BDS-R data since July 10, 2021. BDS is different from GPS in the orbit, signal frequency, chipping rate, and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). Furthermore, the BDS satellites have different generations and orbits. This article, for the first time, comprehensively characterizes the spaceborne BDS-R observations over the ocean using the FY-3E GNOS-II data from different BDS satellite types including BDS-2 inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO), BDS-2 medium Earth orbit (MEO), BDS-3 IGSO, and BDS-3 MEO. Their spatial coverage, spatial resolution, effective scattering area (ESA), incidence angle, range corrected gain (RCG), EIRP, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) have been analyzed and compared with those of GPS-R. Spaceborne BDS-R shows a lot of uniquenesses compared with GPS-R. The BDS-R observables are then calibrated separately for each type. An intercalibration is also applied to correct extra calibration errors. After calibration, BDS-R observables and retrieved winds are consistent between each type and compared with those of GPS-R. Calibrated observables from FY-3E GNOS-II are also evaluated by comparing them to those measured by the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission and a theoretical model. The results of this article can provide a reference for future BDS-R studies and spaceborne GNSS-R mission design.

TI  - Comparison of Winter Wheat Extraction Methods Based on Different Time Series of Vegetation Indices in the Northeastern Margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: A Case Study of Minhe, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is an agricultural protection area in China's new development plan, and the primary region of winter wheat growth within QTP. Winter wheat monitoring is critical for understanding grain self-sufficiency, climate change, and sustainable socioeconomic and ecological development in the region. However, due to the complex terrain and high altitude of the region, with discontinuous arable land and the relatively low level of agricultural development, there are no effective localization methodologies for extracting and monitoring the detailed planting distribution information of winter wheat. In this study, Sentinel-2A/B data from 2019 to 2020, obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform, were used to build time series reference curves of vegetation indices in Minhe. Planting distribution information of winter wheat was extracted based on the phenology time-weighted dynamic time warping (PT-DTW) method, and the effects of different vegetation indices' time series and their corresponding threshold parameters were compared. The results showed that: (1) the three vegetation indices-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized differential phenology index (NDPI), and normalized difference greenness index (NDGI)-maintained high mapping potential; (2) under the optimal threshold, >88% accuracy of index identification for winter wheat extraction was achieved; (3) due to improved extraction accuracy and resulting boundary range, NDPI and its corresponding optimal parameter (T = 0.05) performed the best. The process and results of this study have certain reference value for the study of winter wheat planting information change and the formulation of dynamic monitoring schemes in agricultural areas of QTP.

AB  - Cloud occlusions obstruct some applications of remote sensing imagery, such as environment monitoring, land cover classification, and poverty prediction. In this paper, we propose the Cloud Transformer Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), taking three temporal cloudy images as input and generating a corresponding cloud-free image. Unlike previous work using generative networks, we design the feature extractor to maintain the weight of the cloudless region while reducing the weight of the cloudy region, and we pass the extracted features to a conformer module to find the most critical representations. Meanwhile, to address the lack of datasets, we collected a new dataset named Sen2_MTC from the Sentinel-2 satellite and manually labeled each cloudy and cloud-free image. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on FS-2, the STGAN dataset, and Sen2 MTC. Our proposed CTGAN demonstrates higher qualitative and quantitative performance than the previous work and achieves state-of-the-art performance on these three datasets.

AB  - Cloud detection of satellite images is an important preprocessing step for remote sensing applications due to the adverse effect of clouds on data analysis. With the development of machine learning methods, an increasing number of studies have applied the state-of-art technology to detect clouds in satellite imagery. However, machine learning-based cloud detection methods are often limited by a small number of training samples with insufficient representativeness. To improve the robustness of cloud detection, developing a method to automatically construct a reliable training sample database is a meaningful issue. This paper explores a hybrid Erosion morphology processing and Disagreement-based Semi-supervised Learning model (EDSL) to refine cloud samples generated by the widely-used Fmask algorithm. Experimental results show that the sample accuracy after refinement could be improved from the original Fmask cloud masks. Further, the random forest model trained by the sample database after EDSL refinement achieves comparable accuracy but higher efficiency with Fmask algorithm, thus proving the effectiveness of the above method.

AB  - Accurate quantification of gross primary production (GPP) in agroecosystems not only improves our ability to understand global carbon budget but also ensures basic human survival supplements. Here, we improved the MODIS-GPP algorithm by two main perspectives: (1) taking the seasonal variations of maximum light use efficiency (LUE) into modeling consideration; (2) separately parameterizing maximum LUE with a recently proposed vegetation index (VI) NIRv during vegetative stage and senescence stage. Performances of the revised and traditional MODIS-GPP algorithms were tested at three FLUXNET crop sites planted with maize and soybean. The revised model was well validated, indicated by the root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2) and Bias being 2.33 gC m(-2) day(-1), 0.91 and 0.48 gC m(-2) da(y)-(1) for maize, respectively, and being 1.51 gC m(-2) day(-1), 0.91 and 0.43 gC m(-2) day(-1) for soybean, respectively. Overall, compared to the traditional MODIS-GPP algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduced RMSE by 29.6% and 27.4%, increased R-2 by 10.9% and 10.9%, and reduced Bias by 41.5% and 36.8% for maize and soybean, respectively. This paper demonstrates that incorporating seasonal fluctuations of maximum LUE into MODIS-GPP algorithm and distinguishing the different photosynthesis rates among vegetative and senescence stages significantly benefit the retrieval accuracy of daily model-estimated GPP.

AB  - Compared with traditional underwater topography measurement methods such as multi-beam or sonar, remote sensing satellites provide a new method for underwater topography detection, but it's difficult to retrieve high-resolution and high-precision underwater topography only using a single SAR image. This paper aims to perform the complementary and synergetic effect of Multi-source SAR data and proposes a shallow sea topography detection model based on Multi-source SAR. We also verified the model with four SAR images of GF-3, Sentinel-1, ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR satellite. The mean relative error of the detected topography is 12.50%, and the correlation coefficient is 0.91. The results show that the model proposed in this paper can effectively retrieve high-precision and high-resolution underwater topography maps.

AB  - Flood disaster is one of the natural disasters with the highest frequency in the Yangtze River, which caused immeasurable losses, particularly catastrophic floods in the Yangtze River Basin during July and August 2020. Nowadays, Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery can monitor and evaluate floods in any weather conditions. In this paper, the spatial-temporal variations of the 2020 catastrophic floods are investigated and evaluated from Sentinel-1 date and Otsu thresholding method in the two perspectives of area disparity and flood duration. Four severe flood sections of the Yangtze River (Yueyang, Hankou, Jiujiang, Chizhou) are taken as study objects. Yueyang and Hankou sections are in the middle reach and the Jiujiang and Chizhou section are in the lower section. The results show that the average water body area in 2020 was 20.40% larger than that in 2019 in four sections of the Yangtze River. The upper sections are suffered more from floods for a longer time. The water area of four sections shows a highly positive correlation with the water level, which is the highest in Jiujiang Section, even to 0.9924. The four sections are affected by the flood events in 2020 with the order as follows: Yueyang section > Jiujiang section > Hankou section > Chizhou section.

TI  - Habitat protection planning for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in deteriorating environments: Knowledge gaps and recommendations for action.
T2  - Aquatic Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - In Chinese and South-east Asian waters, the coastal and estuarine environments are important habitats for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). Coastal and estuarine maritime engineering (CEME), including land reclamation, embankment or shoreline armouring, harbour construction and marine farming, permanently changes coastal environments and threatens the long-term persistence of marine biota and ecosystems. Such impacts on humpback dolphin viability, however, are rarely discussed. Likely core habitat of the humpback dolphin was extrapolated based on present understanding of habitat characteristics, which is much narrower than present data describing the species' range. Some uninvestigated habitats near densely populated landscapes may be prone to intense CEME impacts. CEME impacts compromise humpback dolphin survival through habitat loss, population fragmentation, alteration of ecological regimes and deterioration of ecosystem functionality. A 30% loss of core habitat can catastrophically reduce the population viability of this species. The best strategy to avoid CEME impacts on humpback dolphin viability is to adopt a conservative planning regime from the outset. To inform habitat protection planning, current and past habitat configuration and habitat characteristics of the humpback dolphin can be clarified by systematically designed surveys, local ecological knowledge investigation, long-term satellite remote-sensing data and species distribution modelling exercises. Sound habitat protection planning includes mapping hierarchical marine protected area (MPA) networks using spatial planning algorithms and carefully examining CEME impacts from an ecosystem perspective. To prevent inappropriate CEME planning, the inclusion of citizen science, local community participation, marine environmental education and effective information delivery is proposed. Questions relating to the proposed areas of habitat loss, the extent of environmental change and the status of population-habitat viability under the scenario of CEME impacts are proposed in order to examine and re-examine the environmental impacts of any CEME project.

TI  - Bathymetry and Benthic Habitat Mapping in Shallow Waters From Sentinel-2A Imagery: A Case Study in Xisha Islands, China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of benthic habitats and bathymetry is crucial for sustainable development and assessment of climate change and human activities. In this study, Hyperspectral Optimization Process Exemplar (HOPE) was modified, renamed as M-HOPE, to simultaneously obtain bathymetry and benthic habitat in shallow waters in Xisha Island, China. A local lookup table (LUT) for benthic reflectance spectra was established. Validation using in situ measurements demonstrated good performance of M-HOPE with a R-2 of 0.76 for bathymetry using the local LUT. Application of M-HOPE to Sentinel-2A imagery further proved good accuracy of M-HOPE derived bathymetry with a R-2 of 0.86 against in situ observations and a R-2 of 0.92 against ICESat-2 measurements. M-HOPE-derived benthic classification also agreed well with field observations with probability of detection (POD) > 0.6 and false alarm ratio (FAR) < 0.5. However, uncertainties exist, mainly caused by mixed benthic types, atmospheric correction, and similarity in spectral reflectance of different benthic types.

TI  - RESEARCH ON ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY EVALUATION OF SANDY LAND IN NORTHEASTERN CHINA BASED ON REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has been widely used in ecological environment monitoring in recent years. In this paper, taking the sandy land in northeastern China as an example, the maximum likelihood method and the support vector machine method are used to compare the processing results of remote sensing data. Furthermore, the evolutionary characteristics of the sandy land ecological environment in the region were analyzed. The research results show that the study area mainly consists of three parts: sandy land, grassland and water body. The extraction effect of the support vector machine method on sandy land is better than that of the maximum likelihood method. The ecological environment in the study area is divided into two stages. In recent years, the ecological environment of sandy land has been improved to a certain extent, which is due to the enhancement of human-made ecological protection awareness and the development of ecological protection measures. The important cover types that maintain ecosystem services in this region are grasslands and water bodies, which play a decisive role in improving the ecological environment and enhancing ecosystem functions. The ecological environment index of the main sandy land in the west of the study area is mainly distributed between 30 and 44, and the ecological environment index of the eastern region is mainly distributed between 44 and 80. Among the driving factors of desertification in the study area, total population, livestock carrying capacity, and cultivated land area are the main influencing factors of desertification. and the increase of annual precipitation and the decrease of annual average wind speed can alleviate land desertification to a certain extent. With the development of policies such as returning farmland to grassland, prohibiting grazing, and resting grazing, the ecological environment of sandy land can be significantly improved. This study can provide a scientific basis for the ecological environment protection and comprehensive management of sandy land.

AB  - With the ever-shrinking size of transistors and increasing scale of applications, silent data corruptions (SDCs) have become a common yet serious issue in HPC applications. Selective instruction duplication (SID) is a popular fault-tolerance technique that can obtain a high SDC coverage with low-performance overhead, as it selects the most vulnerable parts of a program for protection with priority. However, existing studies of SID are confined to single program input in the evaluation, assuming that the error resilience of the program remains similar across inputs, leading to a drastic loss of SDC coverage from SID when the protected program runs different inputs. Hence, we proposed Sentinel, an automated compiler-based framework to mitigate the loss of SDC coverage. Evaluation results show that Sentinel can effectively mitigate the loss of SDC coverage (up to 97.00%) across multiple inputs, which significantly hardens existing SID techniques.

TI  - Classifying Sea Ice Types with a U-Net Model from Dual-polarized Sentinel-1 Images and GLCM Texture Feature

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Classifying different types of sea ice plays a significant role in marine navigation, especially on the Northwest Passage in the Arctic. In this paper, a U-Net model is trained to identify multi-year ice (MYI), first-year ice (FYI), and open water (OW) from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. 14 Sentinel-1 A/B Extended Wide (EW) mode images, acquired in the Beaufort Sea and Svalbard between January and March 2020, and their gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture feature are split into chips to be fed into the model for training and testing. The GLCM is a set of images reflecting the comprehensive information of direction, adjacent interval, and variation amplitude of the gray level of original image. It can also be understood as texture features of original image. It is the basis of analyzing local patterns in an image and their arrangement rules. Dissimilarity of HH (HH-Dis) chosen from 20 kinds of available GLCM texture features is combined with horizontal-vertical (HV) polarization, horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization, and incident angle as inputs. The LabelMe software creates labels with visual interpretation. The proportions of FYI and MYI data in training data were adjusted to approximately equal, to avoid bias of model prediction results towards dominant categories. The result shows that the combination of HH, HV, incident angle and HH-Dis has the highest precision of 92.10%, although the precision is 89.35% when only HH and HV information combined. This result reflects the potential of adding GLCM for sea ice classification.

TI  - Reference Network Construction for Persistent Scatterer Detection in SAR Tomography: Ant Colony Search Algorithm (ACSA)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography is a powerful multibaseline technique allowing to reconstruct volume structures by using datasets of the same area with slightly different viewing angles. Nowadays, the reference network technique (RNT) is widely applied in SAR tomography to detect single and double scatterers with no need for preliminary removal of atmospheric phase screen (APS). Therein, reference network (RN) construction as the basis of RNT is vitally important for effective APS calibration to successfully detect persistent scatterers (PSs) over the entire scene. Aiming at whole-scene PS detection, RN should be constructed with global distribution throughout the whole built environment. For the moment, standard RNT cannot achieve this goal because of the damage to network connectivity in the RN construction process. In this article, an ant colony search algorithm (ACSA) is designed for whole-scene RN construction via step-by-step exploring and retaining reliable single scatterers around each ant. The effectiveness of the proposed ACSA for RN construction is demonstrated through the three-dimensional SAR tomography experiments on high-resolution TerraSAR-X SAR data stack in Shenzhen, China.

AB  - This paper focuses on the conflict between Richard II and one of his subjects, Bullingbrook, while also considering the official power structure during Richard II’s reign. Richard II, who had status as a divine and powerful monarch, faced opposition and massive resistance from his subjects, including Bullingbrook and was eventually dethroned due to his own misdeeds and mistakes. Furthermore, this research examines the complex aspects of the conflict between the kingship and the priesthood during the reign of Richard II with its multilayered and complex structure. Through this process, the conflict between the medieval worldview and modern values as well as the conflict between the religious authority symbolizing the power and providence of God and secular kingship are overlapped and can be seen the complex nature of the reign of Richard II. Shakespeare’s ambivalent views on this complex phase of the times and the aspect of conflict between the kingship and the priesthood including the mutual relationship among the characters shown in Richard II are examined.

AB  - The purpose of this sentence is to clarify that the bodhisattva idea of Great Buddhism forms Han Yongun's literary worldview. The Bodhisattva thought that appeared in ≪The Silence of Love≫ was constructed through the realization of Paramita without going through the Buddhist idea as Man Hae’s central thought. In addition, the Boshi(布施) of the Six Brahmi(六波羅蜜) is the source of his privately owned practical enlightenment as the true words and deeds that humankind must have in Man Hae’s Psalms.It unconsciously embodied Great Bodhisattva thought in Man Hae's ≪The Silence of Love≫, and worked as a firm belief in freedom, national liberation, and theistic thought. Man Hae's literature did not follow the trajectory of modern literary history, but became a spiritual foundation for the activities of religious reformers, independence activists, and nationalists during the Japanese colonial period. In other words, Great Bodhisattva Thought provided justification that could lead the great social change on Man Hae consciousness’s basis.It should be noted that Man Hae was able to expand his position as a literary figure and independence activist because of his status as a monk. Today, the fundamental thing that kept Man Hae alive in history is religion, and the Buddhist thought he pursued is reflected in his literature. In this way, Man Hae, as a monk, had Buddhist convictions, and with his undying will, he became the driving force to overcome the reality of the times. As a mediator capable of reconciling divided ideologies and sects on a pan-social level, Great Bodhisattva thought permeated Man Hae's original life.In order to investigate Man Hae's poetic consciousness in terms of Great Bodhisattva thought, I used the first Boshi in Six Brahmi, which prominently appeared in this collection of poems, as a research method. It is a fact that the Boshi that forms Six Brahmi is the central axis of Great Bodhisattva thought and is manifested in Man Hae's Psalms. I looked into the bodhisattva thought built up in Man Hae's Psalms by looking at the three types mentioned in Boshi. In short, Jaesi(財施), Beopsi(法施), Muuisi(無依施) and Non-Seeing are the three types of Boshi, in Man Hae's psalms, which will be discussed, along with the Buddhist doctrines of theistic thought, selflessness thought, and relationship thought, form the literary backbone. As a result, it was revealed that Great Bodhisattva Thought works concretely and practically as Man Hae's firm world view.

TI  - COMPARING SPECTRAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HEALTHY AND EARLY INFESTED SPRUCE FORESTS CAUSED BY BARK BEETLE ATTACKS USING SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2022)

AB  - Detecting forest insect damage before the visible discoloration (green attacks) using remote sensing data is challenging, but important for damage control. In recent years, the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) has damaged large amounts of forest in Europe. However, it is still debatable how early the infestations can be detected with remote sensing data. Some studies showed a spectral difference between healthy and green-attacked spruce trees at the plot level, while others showed that spectral differences existed before attacks. Therefore, a hypothesis is proposed that no spectral difference can be identified between green-attacked forests compared to healthy forests if the differences do not exist before the attacks. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 SWIR images on 24 healthy plots and 24 plots with mild, moderate, and severe attacks. In the results, the severely attacked plots did not show significant spectral differences in the Sentinel-2 images until August, and the sensitivity was found in the blue, red, red-edge, and SWIR band. Only the red band showed a significant difference between the healthy and moderately attacked plots in August, and only the blue, red, and SWIR band showed significant differences in September, October, and November. No significant differences were observed in the WorldView-3 images at the plot or individual tree level. We accepted the hypothesis that green attacks do not show spectral differences with the healthy forests when the differences do not exist before the attacks. We concluded that the SWIR bands were sensitive to attacks in the Sentinel-2 images with 10 m resolution, but not in the WorldView-3 images with 3.7 m resolution. Further studies are needed to explore the methodology of using WorldView-3 SWIR images for the early detection of forest infestation.

TI  - Next Day Wildfire Spread: A Machine Learning Dataset to Predict Wildfire Spreading From Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting wildfire spread is critical for land management and disaster preparedness. To this end, we present "Next Day Wildfire Spread," a curated, large-scale, multivariate dataset of historical wildfires aggregating nearly a decade of remote-sensing data across the United States. In contrast to existing fire datasets based on Earth observation satellites, our dataset combines 2-D fire data with multiple explanatory variables (e.g., topography, vegetation, weather, drought index, and population density) aligned over 2-D regions, providing a feature-rich dataset for machine learning. To demonstrate the usefulness of this dataset, we implement a neural network that takes advantage of the spatial information of these data to predict wildfire spread. We compare the performance of the neural network with other machine learning models: logistic regression and random forest. This dataset can be used as a benchmark for developing wildfire propagation models based on remote-sensing data for a lead time of one day.

AB  - Migratinggrazers and carnivoresrespond to seasonal changes in the environment and often match peaks in resource abundance. However, it is unclear if and how frugivorous animals use phenological events to time migration, especially in the tropics.The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), Africa's most gregarious fruit bat, forms large seasonal colonies throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that aggregations ofE. helvummatch the timing of their migration with phenologies of plant growth or precipitation.Using monthly colony counts from across much of the species' range, we matched peak colony size to landscape phenologies and explored the variation among colonies matching the overall closest phenological event.Peak colony size was closest tothepeakinstantaneousrate of green-up,and sites with closer temporal matching were associated with higher maximum greenness, short growing season, and larger peak colony size.Eidolonhelvumseem to time their migrations to move into highly seasonal landscapes to exploit short-lived explosions of food and may benefit from collective sensing to time migrations.The link between rapid changes in colony size and phenological match may also imply potential collective sensing of the environment. Overall decreasing bat numbers along with various threatsmight cause this property of large colonies to be lost.Remote sensing data, although, indirectly linked to fruiting events,can potentially be used to globally describe and predict the migration of frugivorous species in a changing world. See the attached ReadMe file and see https://github.com/ehurme/EidolonGreenWave and www.eidolonmonitoring.com for the latest updates to the code and counts. Colonies of Eidolon helvum bats were counted by members of the Eidolon Monitoring Network (www.eidolonmonitoring.com) at seventeen sites across Africa. Most colonies were counted by observing the bats at their roost site and multiplying the average number of bats in a cluster, the average number of clusters on a branch, the average number of occupied branches in a tree, and the number of occupied trees at the roost site (Hayman et al. 2012; Fahr et al. 2015). For roosts that were inaccessible without disturbing the colony, observers would count numbers of passing bats during evening emergence and extrapolate their numbers by the area monitored (Sorensen and Halberg 2001). The table includes the longitude and latitude coordinates of the roost, geeID (a unique ID for each location use to extract remote sensing values from Google Earth Engine), country, location (city or park), date of the count, count estimate, and observer names. We calculated the ratio of the colony size as the fraction of the maximum colony size for that site across a moving window of all counts within a year, before and after each count.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy by Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery in a Patient with Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has emerged as an accurate tool to identify lymph node metastases in patients with cervical cancers. This procedure is generally performed by conventional or robotic-assisted laparoscopy, but SLNB by transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) has been described for the surgical staging of endometrial cancer. This transvaginal approach seems to be associated with reduced surgical morbidities and could be of particular interest in managing cancer patients. In this article, we report the use of a retroperitoneal vNOTES approach to perform SLNB in a patient with cervical cancer, and we provide a step-by-step description of the surgical technique. This surgical approach seems to be the least invasive way to perform pelvic SLNB and could represent a valuable approach to properly managing patients with early-stage cervical cancers after a free-margin conization. However, more studies are needed before expanding the use of this surgical approach outside study settings.

AB  - Smart and linked health care is one of the many uses that the Internet of Things (IoT) has made possible. Getting everything in a hurry is one of the biggest demands of the contemporary world. People nowadays want to understand their current health state and demand prompt access to appropriate treatment. Even they have a great deal of challenges while trying to let someone know about their ailment. Networked sensors enable the collection of detailed data pertaining to our physical and mental health, whether they are worn on the body or integrated into our living spaces. Such data may result in a beneficial transformational shift in the health care environment if continuously collected, pooled, and skillfully mined. Specifically, the accessibility of information at already unheard of scales and worldly longitudes joined with another age of savvy handling calculations can: (a) work with a development in clinical practice from the momentum post facto analyze and-treat responsive worldview to a proactive structure for visualization of sicknesses at an early stage, combined with counteraction, fix, and generally speaking administration of wellbeing rather than illness; (b) empower personalization of medical services; and (c) work on the personal satisfaction for individuals by decreasing. In this study, we address the advantages and disadvantages of IoT in achieving this future health care goal.

TI  - Investigating Land Use Change in Kabul, Afghanistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change and land cover are considered as some of the important and effective factors of global environmental change. Therefore, understanding and predicting the causes, processes, and consequences of land use change has become a major global challenge. Kabul is the most populated city in Afghanistan. The face of Kabul has changed after a relatively peaceful period since 2001. The purpose of this study is to analyze land use change in Kabul from 2001 to 2019. We used the quantitative approach to analyse data provided by satellite images of Kabul in 2001 and 2019 from Landsat 8 and 7. Data was processed in ERDAS IMAGINE and Arc Map software to results in the final output. Urban land cover was classified into four classes, namely built-up area, green area, empty space, and mountain, and land cover changes were detected. The results of the image comparison between 2001 and 2019 show that the aggregated built-up area and empty space land cover increased by 69.1749 sq km and, correspondingly, 45.2538 sq km, whereas the green area decreased by 113.4216 sq km. We concluded that land cover has changed improperly. The rate of urban green space per individual is currently very low. These results indicate that the city is in a critical urban situation and the government should provide a comprehensive plan for controlling urban growth and fixing the problems caused by improper land use change in the city.

AB  - After the 1989 revolution, new politicians in the transition period who had to adapt to unfamiliar political atmosphere shared three visions for the future of the country. The first was the restoration of pre-communist history and politics, the second was the declaration of liberalism, and the last was the realization of a social project and political design for this purpose.However, the political situation in the 1990s was grim due to the deterioration of the National Salvation Front (Frontul Salvarii Nationale) and the unrest in the university square, and the new world was slowly approaching because of the old communists. On one hand, Romania in transition had the dual goal of creating representative democracy systems and practices, and establishing a free market economy system on the other hand. This double transformation was premised on the introduction and settlement of neoliberal ideology according to policy decisions between ‘representative democracy’ and ‘market economy’, and social consensus on democratization and transition to a market economy.A successful transition was a task given to president Ion Iliescu, who had to lead at a major turning point in 1990~1996, but the historical reality was far more complex and difficult than could have been anticipated and programmed. From president Emil Constantinescu, who made the first democratic transfer of power in 1996, to Prime Minister Adrian Nastase in 2002, the political declarations and experiments of ‘the end of the transition’ and ‘the beginning of a new era’ were repeated over and over again.Society in the transition had to abandon the paternalistic and authoritarian mindset left behind by the communist ideology and dictatorship of the past. The most important change is the transition from a monolithic system such as a dictatorship to a plural system. Free access to mass media, the opening of the free movement right, and the promise of restoration to Europe have led to a radical acceleration of social change.In that sense, EU accession in 2007 can be regarded as the end of the transition to the post-communist regime. Romania was officially linked with Europe again politically and economically, as it had been before socialism. This long historical process suggests how the experience of communism affected Romanians’ worldview and how real their integration into Europe was.

AB  - This study analyzes the factors affecting ALOS(Average Length Of Stay) for infectious disease patients by identifying the average ALOS according to Korean patient characteristics. This study analyzed 64,322 infectious diseases (A00-B99), excluding B95-B98 (bacteria, virus, and other infectious agents), as the final study subjects. In-depth survey data were accrued from the discharge summaries between 2012 to 2016. In this study, regression analysis was performed by selecting socio-demographic characteristics as control variables, hospital characteristics and medical use characteristics as independent variables, and average ALOS as dependent variables. Results of the analysis revealed an ALOS of 6.05 days. We determined that the factors affecting ALOS of the study subjects were location of the hospital, the number of beds, classification for a poor group, and whether or not the primary operation was performed. We propose that the government and hospital operators need to support medical facilities such as isolated beds. Moreover, poor patient groups need proper categorization so that they can efficiently manage LOS according to the characteristics of the admitting hospital and the characteristics of medical applications.

TI  - Classification of 'potential' forests based on remote sensing data
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to estimate the area with forest vegetation that does not yet meet the criteria formulated in the FAO/UN definition (minimum height 5 m, minimum canopy cover 10%, minimum area 0.5 ha), but will potentially meet them in the future (5 years or more, depending on the individual site conditions), which means that (according to the definition) they also represent forest areas. The study was conducted in the Bia??owie??a Glade. Tree species were classified individually and then divided into two groups: those that will reach a height of 5 m in the future and those that will not (grey willow, hawthorn). Hyperspectral (reduced with MNF transformation) and ALS???based features were used for classification with the SVM algorithm. Classification accuracy based on ALS data was better than that of hyperspectral data for indi??? vidual species but similar for the two species groups ??? 95.5% (Kappa 87.5%). Information about species and height was used to perform the classification of a fishnet layer into ???forests???, ???potential forests??? and ???non???forests???, with an accuracy of 96% (Kappa 87.7%). A map of forests and potential forest vegetation was created in the form of a thematic map, taking into account height, canopy cover, area of the complex and land use. This study provides new solutions in the context of cli??? mate change, deforestation and the need for reporting the forest area by individual countries (including Poland) to the FAO/UN.

AB  - Since the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’ is the first record to compile aspects of filial piety into one category, it occupies a small amount compared to other categories in the Samkuk Yusa but it is a category that cannot be neglected as it can be said to be the starting point of discussions on Buddhist filial piety. In Silla and Goryeo, it is necessary to reconsider the analysis of the contents of the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’ and the discussion on the background of category setting in that the ideological world developed through the coexistence of Confucianism and Buddhism.Accordingly, in the ‘Jinjeongsa-Hyoseon-Ssangmi(眞定師孝善雙美)’, it is revealed that the meaning of Ssangmi (雙美) refers to the obedience of parents to the support of their children and in the ‘Daeseonghyo-Isebumo (大城孝二世父母)’, it was examined whether Buddhist filial piety was said to be the object of both the parents of the past and the present. In ‘Hyangdeugsaji-halgogongchin(向得舍知割股供親), it was noted that Buddhist filial piety was to be wary of extreme sacrificial filial piety. This is continued in ‘Sonsunmaea(孫順埋兒)’, in other words, the fact that the act of Son-soon (孫順), who tried to sacrifice his child for filial piety, was warned through a stone-made bell, was ultimately remembered as the founding of the temple. Lastly, the ‘Binnyeo-Yangmo (貧女養母)’, points out that Buddhist filial piety is not limited to the unilateral support of the child's parents. By noting this point, from the point of view of ‘Ssangmi (雙美)’, it was considered that this was correlated with the first item.As the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’ is the first document in which the story of filial piety consists of one category, it is also necessary to examine the background and meaning of category setting. It is confirmed the fact that the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’ was influenced by Do-se’s ‘Beobwon-Julim (法苑珠林)’ in terms of composition, the fact that ‘Beobwon-Julim’ was written from the point of view of a Buddhist response to the Confucian worldview also provided a starting point for understanding the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’. On the other hand, the story of filial piety recorded in the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’ was formed after the middle of Silla, and the main characters of the story of filial piety are all lay people. Therefore, it was hypothesized that as the status of lay believers increased, interest in filial piety as an ethics in their daily life would have increased. As their understanding of the precepts also increased, it became possible to understand that actions such as cutting one's own flesh or burying a child do not violate the precepts from the point of view of filial piety, which was understood that this was the background for the formation of the filial piety story in the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’. As such, the section ‘Filial Piety and Good Deeds’ is a category organized to emphasize the expansive and multiple meanings of Buddhist filial piety.

AB  - The research on Ryu Ju-hyeon is paradoxically insufficient with his vast work history. Regarding this artist, who is arguably included in the postwar generation's writers group but lacks evaluation and research compared to the quantitative and qualitative achievement of the work, this paper starts with the question of why Ryu Ju-hyeon stood on the periphery in discussing postwar literature. Considering the circumstances of this period, which cannot be separated from personal experience, history, and the fact that Ryu Ju-hyeon's works are often out of the mainstream capture network makes me think again about the category of postwar literature. As an answer to the question, I would like to present the possibility of independent interpretation of the work itself. As the starting point of the study, I would like to lay the foundation for research on Ryu Ju-hyeon's literature by selecting and interpreting works that can be analyzed in common subject words among works in the 1950s, which can be said to be the beginning of the work. During this period, Ryu Ju-hyeon's characters commonly recognize the world through dichotomous planning, which can be said to be an epistemology and a projection of the worldview that the author looks at the time. The world of such dichotomy is also a reproduction and composition of the violent contemporary world. In the face of such a world interpretation, the characters appear hesitating as boundaries and hesitating with worries instead of choosing either side. In addition, the great unit that such characters can choose is characterized by the form of an open ending at the level of questions that does not reveal any direction on the basis of the fragmented circumstances of the past.The confusion after liberation, the political severity after the ideological war, and the moral hazard in poverty are hints at the correlation between the era, writers, and literature, where understanding the circumstances of society at the time and understanding the writer's situation are preceded. In addition to that, we can see again the works of many artists who are not included in the category or discussed when we repeatedly think about the category of postwar literature, or whether it was too single an external category theory. On the contextual basis of the world of prospects and the absence of prospects in the world, works of existential and nihilistic tendencies often acquire a lot of understanding. In this climate, Ryu Ju-hyeon pours out half of his short stories during this period. Ryu Ju-hyeon's works, which are not included in a bold subject such as ideological concerns, invasion of existence, or escape to romance due to disillusionment, read the theory that they are a dichotomy of the common denominator of the works, and read the value of the novel in the 1950s.

TI  - Changes in East Asia’s Maritime View through Pyohaerok and Taewonji
TI  - 표해록을 통해 본 동아시아 해양관의 변화와 <태원지>
T2  - 고전과 해석
M3  - research-article
AB  - This thesis tried to explore the drivers of creating Taewonji through the changes in the view of the sea that appeared in Pyohaerok in the early and late Joseon Dynasty. In the case of the early Joseon Dynasty, attention has been focused on the continent rather than the sea. Not only military threats generally come from the continent, but also the tendency regarding Japan as barbarians increasingly accelerated due to conquest of Tsushima Island and the political situation in Japan. This tendency composed the view of sea as a border that does not need to be opened. Therefore even though the title of Pyohae was used as the title of Pyohaerok, the interests appeared only in the continent through both the narrative attitude and the background of publication. However, interest in the sea began to increase in the late Joseon Dynasty during the Japanese Invasion, and drift was also redefined as an unofficial channel to secure knowledge of not only China but also the entire overseas information and the entire worldview built by it. Accordingly Pyojurok written in the late Joseon Dynasty shows a meticulous observation of Emishi, not China, and the existing worldview is also shaken.Therefore, it was no coincidence that drift appeared as a key material in Taewonji. In the late Joseon Dynasty, drift was like a symbol of interest in the sea and beyond. Therefore the plot of Taewonji, encountering a new continent at the end of the drift, becomes natural in itself. In particular, the fictional drift of Taewonji had unconventionality and creativity beyond even the Pyohaerok. In Taewonji the main characters moved east, not west, and the new continent they met is also shaped as an equally cultural country as existing world.Thus at this point shaping the drift of Taewonji into a the mandate of heaven is strongly justified. The mandate of heaven has brought the main characters who desire change to the optimal space. At this point two questions about the narrative after Taewon could be solved. The first question is the contradiction that Jong-hwang and Pyeong-gei, which refer to the evils of war, start a war in Taewon again. The second is that Taewonji persistently borrows Romance of the Three Kingdoms after the landing in Taewon. In particular, the borrowing of Romance of the Three Kingdoms could not achieve literary achievement in the individual phase of narrative development, so it was necessary to clarify the intention of the borrowing in another aspect. Since the image of Taewon examined in this paper could be an answer, it was intended to embody Taewon as a space of difference not barbarians. Thus, the confrontation pattern in Taewon is evenly combined with the confrontation patterns with Namman, Jojo, and Yujang in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Taewon can be drawn as a space full of talent and loyalty.

AB  - This paper is a literary study on the 10 existing poems by Yeonheon(蓮軒) LeeUimu(李宜茂)(1449～1507), a writer in the early Joseon Dynasty. Yeonheon is the representative writer of transition period in the historical development of Sa-bu(辭賦). And compared to other Sa-bu(辭賦) writers, he left behind a relatively large number of works. The rather short and comprehensive title of Yeonheon Sa-bu(辭賦) follows the characteristics of the Go-bu(古賦) that make it possible to compose a variety of texts. The Sa-bu(辭賦) of Yeonheon is classified as a Go-bu(古賦) in terms of form, but the proportion of Uisoche(擬騷体) is small. In terms of subject matter, works that foresee the trend of Neo-Confucianism Sa-bu(辭賦) are confirmed, and also works that contain the Taoist tradition that inherited the tradition of poetry are confirmed.Most of the works of Yeonheon Sa-bu(辭賦) are present after the age of 33, but the four bu(賦), whose creation date is unknown, criticize the chaotic reality of politics or aim for the Jeon-wonhangeo(田園閑居). Therefore, it is presumed to be a work of the Hongjumogsa(洪州牧使) period. Considering the period of creation of the Chinese poems with similar themes, the one 辭 is presumed to be the work in the early years of his official life.Yeonheon Sa-bu(辭賦) work world clearly reflected the characteristics of the transition period. First, looking at the works emphasizing moral discipline and filial piety, ｢Hyeonghwabu(螢火賦)｣ emphasized the theory of personal discipline while ｢Huiubu(喜雨賦)｣ emphasized the discipline of the monarch. ｢Ujeyusanbu(雨霽遊山賦)｣ and ｢Hwaseogjeongbu(花石亭賦)｣ were created right after Yeonheon finished his funeral after his mother's death. And while inheriting the works of Jinsado(陳師道) and Leedalchung(李達衷), they are not ideological, but connect the artist's experience with the filial piety, delivered experientially.Second, looking at the works that show the remarks and recollections of the historical events, the ｢Pyeongseungnubu(平乘樓賦)｣ related to the historical history of the Hwan-on(桓溫), ｢Souuisajabu(綉衣使者賦)｣ related to the ancient history of Hanmuje(漢武帝), the ｢Sujelyubu(隋堤柳賦)｣ related to the ancient history of the Suyangje(隋煬帝) is a work that shows Yeonheon's critical opinion on the times of the time by using the form of Sa-bu(辭賦). ｢Sabdongbansa(歃銅盤辭)｣, which is related to the historical story of Mosujacheon(毛遂自薦), is a work that shows the aspirations of the author by changing a historical text into a Sa-bu(辭賦).Third, if we look at the works that reflect the Taoist traditions and principles, ｢Cheongjumangseonnubu(淸州望仙樓賦)｣ aims for the envy of paradise and the life of the Jeon-wonhangeo(田園閑居). ｢Hyulyubu(鵂鶹賦)｣ adopted the contents and theme of ｢Bogjobu(鵩鳥賦)｣ of Gaui(賈誼), revealing that it is in sync with the relativistic worldview of the Dao family.

AB  - Web Novels have the characteristics of a snack culture. That doesn't mean that the narrative of a web novel is simple. Among web novels, Singsyong's Omniscient Reader's Point of View is unrivaled in the scale and complexity of the work's worldview. In addition, it actively borrowed various classics from East and West and thus forms a kind of narrative complex system. Therefore, various forms and devices constituting the narrative are competing and conflicting with each other. The device that controls this complex format is the position of the player in the role-playing game based on the Omniscient Reader's Point of View. In other words, it is a dual view that plays the role of a character in the game and looks at it from the perspective of a player located outside the game. In order to pass missions or quests well, the merchant- conscious attitude of immersing himself in it and coldly considering the gains and losses with the next step or level up in mind is consistent with the protagonist of this novel. In addition, there are parts that rely on the rules of forming a “party” between colleagues and cooperating with each other. Each user creates a number of different stories interactive through the play of the game, but what he or she is immersed in is the story he or she plays. However, it is never created without the user's own desire to play games, without the willingness to enter the virtual world of games. In other words, the story newly created through play is ultimately caused by itself. In addition, the general diagnosis that the desire for game play stems from the opposition of various pressures applied from the fierce reality of life in Korean society is also particularly significant compared to Kim's trauma and desire for reading. In this respect, Omniscient Reader's Point of View can be defined as a kind of meta-game narrative that corresponds in many ways to the narrative characteristics and conditions of today's generalized game.

AB  - In this study, it was determine that maps function as a collection of knowledge about the world and a sign of the worldview of the time. Based on this, I tried to see how the worldview changes takes place based on the image of the monster appearing on the maps of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. First, we dealt with the general theory of maps as a visualization tool for recognizing the world. After that, the worldview of the monster's image and the perception of others were discussed. Furthermore, I looked at how the monsters appearing on the maps of the Middle Ages and Renaissance were located, and the structure of the maps where the image of 'monster' appeared among the maps of the Middle Ages and Renaissance and the image of a monster were summarized. Finally, we investigated how the change in the worldview was applied in the monster image of the map.As a result of the study, it was confirmed that the image of the monster undergoes a significant change at the point of transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. At the moment of transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, it was confirmed how human of the day perceived the world, humans, and others. To this end, we first confirmed the worldview and epistemology of the other that monsters contain, and in medieval maps, Bible monsters were placed on the map based on a Christian worldview, and sea creatures and creatures found based on exploration and discovery in the Renaissance map It was confirmed that the newly discovered continental people were placed in images of sea monsters, giants, and cannibals.This study is significant in that it directly targets the map as a visualization tool of the world and a collection of images of the world, and aims to lay the foundation for discussions on each topic in the future through research on 'maps' and 'monsters'.In future studies, Exploring the links between monster images appearing in various literature and monster images appearing on maps, and to examine visual images more directly, including comparisons of map images of contemporary Asia and monster images appearing in a wider range of maps.

T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate-2/Formosa Satellite Mission 7 (COSMIC-2) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) constellation is the follow-on to the highly successful COSMIC-1 program. The GNSS RO atmospheric soundings have historically been used to generate Community Radiative Transfer Model simulated background (B) microwave (MW) brightness temperature data needed to monitor NOAA operational MW sounding instrument observed (O) antenna temperature (Ta) product quality. This study is motivated by the need to determine the impact of COSMIC-2 RO soundings on this critical long-term monitoring capability. This study is based on individual MW sensor O-B Ta bias ( increment T-a) statistics and "double-difference" inter-sensor Ta bias (delta T-a) statistics for two time periods. Time Period 1 (TP1-May 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019) exclusively uses COSMIC-1 and Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-5 soundings, while Time Period 2 (TP2-October 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020) expands the analysis with COSMIC-2 soundings. The TP1 and TP2 increment T-a statistics comparisons indicate COSMIC-2 data population augmentation and latitudinal distribution impact the MW sounder performance monitoring tool transition from TP1 to TP2. COSMIC-2 competently supports long-term MW individual sensor and inter-sensor product monitoring for MW radiometer channels with weighting functions that peak between 8 and 30 km. Individual sensor increment T-a monitoring for other microwave channels that depend on COSMIC-2 data below 8 km and from 30 km to 60 has limitations, but these limitations are shown not to inhibit critical delta T-a monitoring.

AB  - The availability of geo-referenced coupled data of different platforms is essential to train remote sensing (RS) multi-modal classification and bio-phyiscal parameter estimation learning methods. To properly develop a generalizing model different scenes and topographies are required. For this purpose, different multi-modal datasets have been published for the last years. Nevertheless, to our knowledge there is not any dataset composed of Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3) geo-referenced images. In this paper we present SEN23, a dataset composed of 100 complete multi-spectral S2 and S3 paired images of different locations along Europe from the 2021 summer. The coupled images were obtained with a time difference of three or less days, containing less than a 1% of cloud coverage and have a resolution difference of x15. SEN23E is expected to help with the development of new multi-spectral, multi-resolution and multi-modal models for complex tasks which need context and complete images. SEN23E will be available at https://github.com/ibanezdf/SEN23E.

TI  - DAT-CNN: Dual Attention Temporal CNN for Time-Resolving Sentinel-3 Vegetation Indices
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergies between Sentinel-3 (S3) and the forthcoming fluorescence explorer (FLEX) mission bring us the opportunity of using S3 vegetation indices (VI) as proxies of the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) that will be captured by FLEX. However, the highly dynamic nature of SIF demands a very temporally accurate monitoring of S3 VIs to become reliable proxies. In this scenario, this article proposes a novel temporal reconstruction convolutional neural network (CNN), named dual attention temporal CNN (DAT-CNN), which has been specially designed for time-resolving S3 VIs using S2 and S3 multitemporal observations. In contrast to other existing techniques, DAT-CNN implements two different branches for processing and fusing S2 and S3 multimodal data, while further exploiting intersensor synergies. Besides, DAT-CNN also incorporates a new spatial-spectral and temporal attention module to suppress uninformative spatial-spectral features, while focusing on the most relevant temporal stamps for each particular prediction. The experimental comparison, including several temporal reconstruction methods and multiple operational Sentinel data products, demonstrates the competitive advantages of the proposed model with respect to the state of the art. The codes of this article will be available at https://github.com/ibanezfd/DATCNN.

TI  - Masked Auto-Encoding Spectral-Spatial Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has certainly become the dominant trend in hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing (RS) image classification owing to its excellent capabilities to extract highly discriminating spectral-spatial features. In this context, transformer networks have recently shown prominent results in distinguishing even the most subtle spectral differences because of their potential to characterize sequential spectral data. Nonetheless, many complexities affecting HS remote sensing data (e.g., atmospheric effects, thermal noise, quantization noise) may severely undermine such potential since no mode of relieving noisy feature patterns has still been developed within transformer networks. To address the problem, this article presents a novel masked auto-encoding spectral-spatial transformer (MAEST), which gathers two different collaborative branches: 1) a reconstruction path, which dynamically uncovers the most robust encoding features based on a masking auto-encoding strategy, and 2) a classification path, which embeds these features onto a transformer network to classify the data focusing on the features that better reconstruct the input. Unlike other existing models, this novel design pursues to learn refined transformer features considering the aforementioned complexities of the HS remote sensing image domain. The experimental comparison, including several state-of-the-art methods and benchmark datasets, shows the superior results obtained by MAEST. The codes of this article will be available at https://github.com/ibanezfd/MAEST.

M3  - Software
AB  - Invasive species science is heavily geared toward the invasive agent. However, management to protect native species also requires a proactive approach focused on understanding the features affecting community vulnerability to invasion impacts. Vulnerability is likely the result of factors acting across spatial scales, from local to regional, and it is the combined effects of these factors that will determine the magnitude of vulnerability. We introduce an analytical framework that quantifies the scale-dependent impact of biological invasions from the shape of the native species-area-relationship (SAR). We leverage newly available, biogeographically extensive vegetation data from the US National Ecological Observatory Network to assess plant community vulnerability to invasion impact as a function of factors acting across scales. We analyzed more than 1000 SARs widely distributed across the USA along environmental gradients and under different levels of invasion. Results show that a decrease in native richness is consistently associated with invasive species cover, but it is only at relatively high levels of invasion that native richness is compromised. After accounting for variation in baseline ecosystem diversity, net primary productivity, and human modification, ecoregions that are colder and wetter seem to be most vulnerable to losses of native plant species at the local level, while warmer and wetter areas seem most susceptible at the landscape level. We also document how the combined effects of cross-scale factors result in a heterogenous spatial pattern of vulnerability. This pattern cannot be predicted by analyses at any single scale, underscoring the importance of accounting for factors acting across scales. Simultaneously assessing differences in vulnerability between distinct plant communities at local, landscape and regional scales provided outputs that can be used to inform policy and management aimed at reducing vulnerability to the impact of plant invasions.

TI  - Satellite-Based Monitoring of Primary Production in a Mediterranean Islet Post Black Rat Eradication
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive rodents have a detrimental impact on terrestrial ecosystem functioning, this is often exacerbated on small islands. Rat eradication campaigns are often used to deal with this environmental perturbation given their classification as invasive species. Studies assessing the effects of rodent control at ecosystem scale are scarce and thus little is known about the subsequent functional response of vegetation subsequent to rat control. In this work, we use remote sensing to assess the effects of black rat (Rattus rattus) eradication on Mediterranean vegetation productivity in the Sa Dragonera Islet, Mallorca (Spain). Rats feed on seeds, sprouts, and leaves of woody vegetation and hence we expect primary production to increase nine years after the rodenticide campaign. The Break Detection approach for additive season and trend (BFAST method) was adopted to examine changes in vegetation density before and after the eradication campaign in Sa Dragonera Islet (Balearic Islands), using a temporal series of monthly NDVI data extracted from Landsat imagery. The same temporal trends were examined for a control zone where no rat eradication took place, in order to control for weather-driven changes. The results of this study revealed changes across the 21-year monthly NDVI time series. However, the dates, magnitude, and trend of these changes could not be explicitly attributed to the action of rats, when compared to the historical changes on the islet and the changes found to co-occur within the control zone. These finding could, perhaps, be explained by the high resilience of Mediterranean shrubs to browsing including that of rat invasion. However, the results from the study appear to show that rat damage on specific plant species, with little contribution to global NDVI values, would be overshadowed by the effects of broader environmental factors in this remote sensing approach. The results suggest that the current passive restoration scheme imposed following eradication is not sufficient for effective ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Archetypal Plot in the "The Faraway and Nearby Tale," a Short Story by V. P. Astafyev
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the archetypal plot basis of V. P. Astafyev's short story "The Faraway and Nearby Tale." The reconstruction of the figurative and semantic paradigms of a fairy tale in the work allows to see that the reference to folklore contexts is not merely declared here as a metaphor for the spiritual and psychological states experienced by the character, but determines the logic of his development and the events that occur to him. The initiation archetype with its key plot-forming elements is interpreted in the mythologized paradigm of the short story as the boy's journey to the "world of the dead, which resulted in his acquisition of a radically new worldview. Instead of a perception based on duality, antitheses and the fears they generated, the character gets a sense of a deep ambivalent "unity of opposites" of different existential spheres and worlds: the real and the otherworldly, the living and the dead, the homeland and the foreign land. The motif complexes associated with this journey are reflected at different levels of the narratives artistic organization principles: in the system of chronotopes that perform a world-modeling function, at the level of the figurative and symbolic subtext, and in the contexts of its spiritual and moral problems. At the same time, the visual logic of Astafyev's "fairy tale" reveals modifications and inversions of universal mythopoetic schemes, including those in the structure of the initiation plot itself, which, unlike a folk tale, acquires a prolonged and duplicated character. In this context, archetypal models enter into dialogical relations with their own event-actualized plot of the story, and exist in the system of the author's consciousness in figurative and semantic mutual projections with the cultural space as a whole.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of trees is crucial for the management of large areas of forest cultivations, but this process may be costly. However, remotely sensed data offers a solution to automate this process. In this work, we used two neural network methods named You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Mask R-CNN to overcome the challenging tasks of counting, detecting, and segmenting high dimensional Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images taken from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We present a processing framework, which is suitable to generate accurate predictions for the aforementioned tasks using a reasonable amount of labeled data. We compared our method using forest stands of different ages and densities. For counting, YOLO overestimates 8.5% of the detected trees on average, whereas Mask R-CNN overestimates a 4.7% of the trees. For the detection task, YOLO obtains a precision of 0.72 and a recall of 0.68 on average, while Mask R-CNN obtains a precision of 0.82 and a recall of 0.80. In segmentation, YOLO overestimates a 13.5% of the predicted area on average, whereas Mask R-CNN overestimates a 9.2%. The proposed methods present a cost-effective solution for forest monitoring using RGB images and have been successfully used to monitor similar to 146, 500 acres of pine cultivations.

TI  - ENIGMATIC TEXT POETICS IN THE POEM "JULY" BY BORIS PASTERNAK
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an analysis of the poem "July", included in the poetic book of Boris Pasternak "When It Clears Up" (1956-1959). The main purpose of this study is to identify the techniques and principles of the poetics of the enigmatic text, vividly implemented in it. The enigmatic text is a certain kind of language game undertaken in a fiction text, which is based on the technique of "estrangement". Its task is to organize a special perception of an object or phenomenon, to create its "vision", and not "recognition" (B. Shklovsky) and to present it in a fiction text as something strange, as if seen for the first time. The article establishes that, in terms of plot and composition, Pasternak's poem has two parts and is organized with the help of morphological elements of such an enigmatic genre as riddle. The lyrical work is constructed as an allegorical text, in which July, the central object of artistic description, is simultaneously an object of initial concealment and subsequent discovery. The publication demonstrates that the plot of the lyrical work is constructed in such a way that in its first part Pasternak, describing July, actually hides the object of the description; the poet implements a creative strategy of evading its direct nomination, and, as a result, creates an artistic image that is far from simple recognition. The second part of the poem under analysis contains a clue, and the object of the lyrical description is directly named. Structural-semiotic, typological and functional approaches are used to analyze the poetic text. In the process of analysis, the main principles of enigmatic poetics are revealed, on which the author relied when creating the poem "July". The principle of representation is expressed in Pasternak's work by replacing the phenomenon being defined (July) with other objects (ghost, brownie, specter, etc.). The principle of personification of an abstract concept contributes to giving the images-substitutes sensually perceived traits and properties ("a ghost wanders", "a brownie sneaks to the bed, tears the tablecloth off the table", etc.). Substitutive nomination as a technique also takes part in the organization of Pasternak's poem and, within the framework of the poetics of an enigmatic text, is designed to lead the reader along a false path that cannot lead to the solution. In addition, the article establishes that typologically the architectonics of the poem "July" is a kind of projection of a number of plot and compositional elements of the ancient tragedy, which, in turn, often contained enigma, as O. M. Freudenberg noted in her works. The poetics of the enigmatic text is not accidental in Pasternak's work and has a systemic character, being an external, aesthetic expression of his deep worldview, in the center of which is the idea of existence in the form of a riddle, or an enigmatic text.

AB  - Carbon sequestration coupled with flood mitigation and other functions of wetlands, such as water filtration, coastal protection, biodiversity, and providing recreational spots, make wetland mapping and monitoring important for different countries. Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform is becoming a very important tool for lots of environmental studies as it provides a suite of tools and access to data that facilitate large-scale environmental monitoring projects through its powerful parallel processing capabilities. In this study, we use GEE to access multi-source remote sensing datasets and implement an object-based image analysis, and random forest algorithm for the classification of wetlands in the state of Minnesota. Emergent, forested, and scrub-shrub wetland classes, water, as well as urban, forest, and agriculture land cover types were classified using Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, USGS 3D Elevation Program 10-meter DEM, and gridded soil data. NDVI, EVI, BSI, NDBI, and NDWI spectral indices were calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery, VV and VH polarization channels, and their ratio, as well as span parameters, were calculated from Sentinel-1 imagery, and slope and aspect features were extracted from DEM. Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and random forest algorithms were implemented to classify wetlands from the GEE platform. Emergent wetlands, water, urban, and agriculture classes performed well with producer accuracies greater than 90%. Sentinel-1, DEM, and soil datasets improve the identification of wetland classes and highlight the importance of multi-source approaches for wetland mapping.

TI  - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Automatic Crop Classification at Regional Scale using Tabular Remote Sensing Time Series
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF MODERN COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the arrival of European Union's new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP 2020), a paradigm shift in subsidy control is underway. Member states are required to gradually transition from a system of on-the-spot checks, where the presence or absence of a crop is detected manually on the field, to a system of agricultural monitoring based on remote sensing data; primarily - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. This paper presents a classification of regional crop types based on the Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. The approach is based on tabular time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensor data over the entire territory of Latvia. Two types of LSTM architectures are evaluated in this paper - regular and bidirectional. An exhaustive grid search of network hyperparameters with 15 distinct crop types led to the conclusion that the bidirectional variant of LSTM yields the highest overall weighted test accuracy of 89.1%.

AB  - The text examines the fact that the retributive justice theory of Buddhism that occurred in India became widespread in the period of Wei-Jin Southern and Northern dynasties in China, which led to a revolt from traditional Chinese thinkers. So, in the text, the discussion was conducted by comparing the viewpoints of Buddhism and traditional Chinese thinkers. Retributive justice in Buddhism means that if there is a cause of good or evil, there must be a result of joy and suffering. In Buddhism, the concept of karma was connected here, and this karma originally refers to all human actions. In other words, it is connected with the retributive justice that any form of human behavior always brings good and evil, happiness, and unfortunate results. In addition, to this content, three generations of the past, present and future were added to the Chinese worldview.The idea of retributive justice, which was popular in the period of Wei-Jin Southern and Northern dynasties in China, can be said to be a very important idea that forms the root of Buddhist samsara. The retributive justice idea, which is the ideological foundation of the Buddhist samsara during the six dynasties in China, will be discussed, focusing on the background of the controversy between Buddhism and the traditional Chinese idea of retributive justice and the idea of retributive justice.

In terms of history education, ChoiCheok-jeon can be expected to cultivate an understanding of history through the emotional experience of and reflection on the tragedy of war that historical records and textbook descriptions do not convey. In terms of literature education, the horizons of interpretation can be broadened through realistic reflection on the mindset and worldview of the Joseon people of the time regarding the coincidence and unrealistic nature of narrative progression.

TI  - Estimation of the Canopy Height Model From Multispectral Satellite Imagery With Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The canopy height model (CHM) is a representation of the height of the top of vegetation from the surrounding ground level. It is crucial for the extraction of various forest characteristics, for instance, timber stock estimations and forest growth measurements. There are different ways of obtaining the vegetation height, such as through ground-based observations or the interpretation of remote sensing images. The severe downside of field measurement is its cost and acquisition difficulty. Therefore, utilizing remote sensing data is, in many cases, preferable. The enormous advances in computer vision during the previous decades have provided various methods of satellite imagery analysis. In this work, we developed the canopy height evaluation workflow using only RGB and NIR (near-infrared) bands of a very high spatial resolution (investigated on WorldView-2 satellite bands). Leveraging typical data from airplane-based LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), we trained a deep neural network to predict the vegetation height. The provided approach is less expensive than the commonly used drone measurements, and the predictions have a higher spatial resolution (less than 5 m) than the vast majority of studies using satellite data (usually more than 30 m). The experiments, which were conducted in Russian boreal forests, demonstrated a strong correlation between the prediction and LiDAR-derived measurements. Moreover, we tested the generated CHM as a supplementary feature in the species classification task. Among different input data combinations and training approaches, we achieved the mean absolute error equal to 2.4 m using U-Net with Inception-ResNet-v2 encoder, high-resolution RGB image, near-infrared band, and ArcticDEM. The obtained results show promising opportunities for advanced forestry analysis and management. We also developed the easy-to-use open-access solution for solving these tasks based on the approaches discussed in the study cloud-free composite orthophotomap provided by Mapbox via tile-based map service.

TI  - A Deep Multitask Semisupervised Learning Approach for Chlorophyll-a Retrieval from Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the scarcity of labeled data in multitemporal remote sensing image analysis, and especially in the context of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estimation for inland water quality assessment. We propose a multitask CNN architecture that can exploit unlabeled satellite imagery and that can be generalized to other multitemporal remote sensing image analysis contexts where the target parameter exhibits seasonal fluctuations. Specifically, Chl-a estimation is set as the main task, and an unlabeled sample's month classification is set as an auxiliary network task. The proposed approach is validated with multitemporal/spectral Sentinel-2 images of Lake Balik in Turkey using in situ measurements acquired during 2017-2019. We show that harnessing unlabeled data through multitask learning improves water quality estimation performance.

M3  - Article
AB  - Folk ideas about cinematic art and cinematography are studied. The recordings of the speech of the inhabitants of the Vologda Territory, made by the author of the article in the period from 1988 to 2021, as well as citation material recorded in the published issues and card file of the Dictionary of Vologda Dialects, are analyzed. A relatively late entry of cinema into the everyday life of the northern village is established (late 60s - 70s of the XX century). The priority of human biological survival in difficult natural conditions determines the attitude towards cinema as a form of spending free time in accordance with the routine of daily and calendar peasant work. The device of the village society serves as a kind of "filter" for the perception of the plot-thematic, character and aesthetic components of cinema: the rural viewer perceives the sphere of cinema as bright and attractive, but nevertheless redundant for village life and unsafe for public morality. Only that which is within the circle of interests of the peasant, that is of value or anti-value for him, is verbalized. The traditional nature of the dialectal picture of the world is manifested, on the one hand, in the desire to enter a new form of "urban culture" into the circle of rural entertainment, and on the other hand, in the use of well-established lexical and phraseological means and genre forms in the practice of discussing the subject, axiological and actional components of the cinema sphere.

T2  - IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds, together with their shadows, usually occlude ground-cover features in optical remote sensing images. This hinders the utilization of these images for a range of applications such as earth observation, land-cover classification and urban planning. In this work, we propose a deep unfolded and prior-aided robust principal component analysis (DUPA-RPCA) network for removing clouds and recovering ground-cover information in multitemporal satellite images. We model these cloud-contaminated images as a sum of low rank and sparse elements and then unfold an iterative RPCA algorithm that has been designed for reweighted l(1) minimization. As a result, the activation function in DUPA-RPCA adapts for every input at each layer of the network. Our experimental results on both Landsat and Sentinel images indicate that our method gives better accuracy and efficiency when compared with existing state of the art methods.

TI  - Coastline Extraction From SAR Data Using Doppler Centroid Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline extraction by exploiting optical images is challenging during adverse weather conditions. This letter proposes coastline extraction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Since collecting in-situ data is expensive and not always possible, the Doppler parameter is used to delineate coastlines when neither in-situ data nor cloud-free optical images are available. We propose a novel coastline extraction method based on classic coastal dynamic variation, such as Doppler centroid (f(DC)), since the coastline is static and has zero Doppler with respect to the dynamic sea-state. The results of the Doppler-based novel technique allow us to investigate the impact of natural hazards on coastline degradation. We compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art (SOA) coastline extraction methods based on polarimetric correlations and the reference method from Sentinel-2. The results show that using scattering from dual and cross-polarization for coastline extraction is more reliable than using co-polarization. Based on empirical distributions and using the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method, the relevant threshold has been adapted to distinguish land and sea in an unsupervised manner. We compare the results of polarimetric and Sentinel-2 with Doppler-based coastline extraction, which emphasizes the accuracy of the proposed f(DC) method for extracting coastlines at full resolution.

TI  - Estimation of barley yield from Sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 imagery and climatic variables
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - A precise estimation of agricultural production provides relevant information for upcoming seasons, and helps in the assessment of crop losses before harvest in case of adverse situations. The objective of this work is to explore the development of a model capable of estimating barley production of a small agricultural production (127 ha) in Belchite, Spain. Variables adapted to the crop calendar of the growing barley are used to achieve that purpose. The variables have been created with weather data and remote sensing images. These images are acquired in two ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., microwaves and optical spectral range, obtained from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively. Models are defined with a multiple linear regression method using all combinations of the independent variables correlated with production. The best linear regression model has a prediction error of 57.38 kg/ha (4%). The use of spectral variables, derived from radar vegetation index Cross Ratio (CR) and optical Inverted Red Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI), and climatic variables adapted to the crop calendar and climatic conditioning is revealed as an adequate strategy to obtain adjusted models.

TI  - Intertextuality in Oktay ArayIci's Play <i>Rumuz</i> Goncagul: The Reproduction of Artistic Creation Heritage
T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Epic theatre, which Bertolt Brecht laid out and applied as the theatre of the Marxist dialectical worldview in the first half of the twentieth century, is a contemporary synthesis that has been shaped by filtering the aes-thetic principles of various movements and traditions before it. One of the main elements of this synthesis is the Eastern theatre, especially the Far Eastern (China) theatre tradition. Standing out with its anti-illusionist quali-ties that create an aesthetic distance between the audience and the stage, Eastern theatre also forms the basis of traditional Turkish theatre. In the 1960s, when the epic theatre model stepped into Turkish theatre in theory and practice, the similarity between this aesthetics and traditional Turkish theatre, as well as its political-ideological content in accordance with the political, economic and social background of the period and form that focuses on alienation, draws the attention of Turkish playwrights. In these years when a socialist-realist line became clear in Turkey, writers who want to bring social problems to the theatre stage and open them to discussion consider it necessary to build a national theatre understanding in order to establish a close connection with the audience. The inspiration created by Brecht, who sets up a contemporary aesthetics by reckoning with the past and tradition, has an undeniable share in this orientation of the writers. In the sixties and seventies, names such as Haldun Taner, Sermet Cagan, Turgut Ozakman and Oktay Arayici are the leading playwrights who set off with this inspiration and progressed with determination to reach a contemporary national saying. Based on the theatrical tradition of their own society, these authors, who evaluate the common grounds of this tradition with epic theatre, which is the theatre of the scientific age, thus attempt to achieve a synthesis, make a remarkable contribution to the revival of the classical/cultural heritage and at the same time its feeding contemporary thea-tre. Arayici, one of these writers, continues his steady orientation towards tradition with his four plays based on the open form and non-illusionistic theatre from the early seventies. Rumuz Goncagul, written by the author in 1977 as a theatrical comedy just like Nafile Dunya, which is inspired by the tradition of urban-centered folk theatre, is a text produced with a contemporary approach in the extension of the middle play, genre of folk theatre. This contemporary middle play, which was first performed only four years after the date it was written, with Rutkay Aziz's stage order at the Ankara Art Theatre during the 1981-82 theatre period, is an attempt to arrive at a synthesis in which the artistic creation heritage is kneaded with the data of the epic theatre nourished by the same aesthetic structure, thus subjected to a process of recreation. In this article, in which Arayici's search for a synthesis, which is open to be evaluated within the framework of intertextuality, is centered, the preserved and transformed features of the traditional middle play reproduced in Rumuz Goncagul with a creative perspective will be examined, thus the modernization process of the folkloric material will be tried to be re-vealed.

TI  - The diagnostic contribution of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of axillary metastasis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - NEOPLASMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is a reliable method that provides axillary staging in clinical node-negative (cN0) breast cancer patients before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). However, it is not a standard method on its own due to the high false-negative rates (FNR) reported in initially clinical node-positive patients (cN1-cN3). The contribution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to SLND after chemotherapy is not well understood. In our study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of post-NACT MRI to SLND in breast cancer patients receiving NACT. Between January 2014 and December 2020, patients who had MRI images including the axilla after NACT and had axillary lymph nodes evaluation performed simultaneously with SLND were included in the study. MRI images of all patients were re-evaluated by 2 experienced clinicians. MRI and SLND results were analyzed to detect axillary lymph node metastasis. 117 patients were included in the study. The median age of the patients was 49 years. Before chemotherapy, 108 patients (92.3%) had tumor metastases in their axilla pathologically confirmed by tru-cut biopsy. Axillary downstage was obtained in 48.1% (n=52) of the patients after NACT. Of the 56 patients with axillary node positivity, 3 patients had no metastasis in the SLND evaluation (FNR=5.4%). The sensitivity of post-NACT MRI in detecting node positivity was 69.6%, the specificity was 90.2%, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 86.7% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 76.4. SLND together with MRI predicted all node-positive patients (FNR=0%). In summary, SLND may not detect a group of patients with residual axillary lymph node metastases after NACT. We have shown that MRI can contribute to identifying these patients. If no metastases are detected by both methods (SLND and MRI), avoidance of axillary dissection may be an acceptable choice.

TI  - Temporal Variability of Surface Reflectance Supersedes Spatial Resolution in Defining Greenland's Bare-Ice Albedo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice surface albedo is a primary modulator of melt and runoff, yet our understanding of how reflectance varies over time across the Greenland Ice Sheet remains poor. This is due to a disconnect between point or transect scale albedo sampling and the coarser spatial, spectral and/or temporal resolutions of available satellite products. Here, we present time-series of bare-ice surface reflectance data that span a range of length scales, from the 500 m for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer's MOD10A1 product, to 10 m for Sentinel-2 imagery, 0.1 m spot measurements from ground-based field spectrometry, and 2.5 cm from uncrewed aerial drone imagery. Our results reveal broad similarities in seasonal patterns in bare-ice reflectance, but further analysis identifies short-term dynamics in reflectance distribution that are unique to each dataset. Using these distributions, we demonstrate that areal mean reflectance is the primary control on local ablation rates, and that the spatial distribution of specific ice types and impurities is secondary. Given the rapid changes in mean reflectance observed in the datasets presented, we propose that albedo parameterizations can be improved by (i) quantitative assessment of the representativeness of time-averaged reflectance data products, and, (ii) using temporally-resolved functions to describe the variability in impurity distribution at daily time-scales. We conclude that the regional melt model performance may not be optimally improved by increased spatial resolution and the incorporation of sub-pixel heterogeneity, but instead, should focus on the temporal dynamics of bare-ice albedo.

TI  - Dynamics of Tree outside Forest Land Cover Development and Ecosystem Carbon Storage Change in Eastern Coastal Zone, Bangladesh
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree outside forest (TOF) has immense potential in economic and environmental development by increasing the amount of tree vegetation in and around rural settlements. It is an important source of carbon stocks and a critical option for climate change regulation, especially in land-scarce, densely populated developing countries such as Bangladesh. Spatio-temporal changes of TOF in the eastern coastal zone of Bangladesh were analyzed and mapped over 1988-2018, using Landsat land use land cover (LULC) maps and associated ecosystem carbon storage change by linking the InVEST carbon model. Landsat TM and OLI-TIRS data were classified through the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm using Semi-Automated Classification (SAC). In the InVEST model, aboveground, belowground, dead organic matter, and soil carbon densities of different LULC types were used. The findings revealed that the studied landscapes have differential features and changing trends in LULC where TOF, mangrove forest, built-up land, and salt-aquaculture land have increased due to the loss of agricultural land, mudflats, water bodies, and hill vegetation. Among different land biomes, TOF experienced the largest increase (1453.9 km(2)), and it also increased carbon storage by 9.01 Tg C. However, agricultural land and hill vegetation decreased rapidly by 1285.8 km(2) and 365.7 km(2) and reduced carbon storage by 3.09 Tg C and 4.89 Tg C, respectively. The total regional carbon storage increased by 1.27 Tg C during 1988-2018. In addition to anthropogenic drivers, land erosion and accretion were observed to significantly alter LULC and regional carbon storage, necessitating effective river channel and coastal embankment management to minimize food and environmental security tradeoff in the studied landscape.

TI  - Air Quality Monitoring of Bangladesh (AQM): Data Driven Analysis System
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES (ICSOFT)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th International Conference on Software Technologies (ICSOFT)
CL  - Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB  - Air pollution is a major concern for countries around the world. According to World Health Organization (WHO), seven million people die worldwide every year caused by air pollution. Bangladesh has not only serious pollution problems but also it is ranked first among the world's most polluted countries with a PM2.5 reading of 76.9 microgrammes per cubic meter (mu g/m(3)) in the year 2021 (AQI Bangladesh, 2021). In this paper, we propose to develop a data-driven software system for monitoring the air quality of Bangladesh. Our proposed system will provide atmospheric maps and charts for monitoring the current and future Air Quality Index (AQI) of any area. We conducted an experiment for 1-year time span to observe the concentration level and data patterns of PM2.5 in our country focusing on the transportation routes and industrial zones. The data is collected from the sensors and satellites of different stations covering multiple areas. The results are analyzed in the context of divisions, transportation stations, industrial zones, and time. For a variety of air quality indicators, the experimental results were compared to IQAir AirVisual Pro and showed good results, with very small differences between our obtained result and IQAir AirVisual Pro. Our goal is to mainly monitor the industrial zones, power plants, divisions, and transportation routes as most toxic compounds are formed there.

TI  - Monitoring Olive Oil Mill Wastewater Disposal Sites Using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope Satellite Images: Case Studies in Tunisia and Greece
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean countries are known worldwide for their significant contribution to olive oil production, which generates large amounts of olive mill wastewater (OMW) that degrades land and water environments near the disposal sites. OMW consists of organic substances with high concentrations of phenolic compounds along with inorganic particles. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of satellite image analysis techniques using multispectral satellite data with high (PlanetScope, 3 x 3 m) and medium (Sentinel-2, 10 x 10 m) spatial resolution to detect Olive Mill Wastewater (OMW) disposal sites, both in the SidiBouzid region (Tunisia) and in the broader Rethymno region on the island of Crete, (Greece). Documentation of the sites was carried out by collecting spectral signatures of OMW at temporal periods. The study integrates the application of a variety of spectral vegetation indices (VIs), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to evaluate their efficiency in detecting OMW disposal areas. Furthermore, a set of image-processing methods was applied on satellite images to improve the monitoring of OMW ponds including the false-color composites (FCC), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and image fusion. Finally, different classification algorithms, such as the ISODATA, the maximum likelihood (ML), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to both satellite images in order to assist in the overall approach to effectively detect the sites. The results obtained from different approaches were compared, evaluating the efficiency of Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images to detect and monitor OMW disposal areas under different morphological environments.

AB  - Contrary to the sea ice surface melt during Arctic summer, melt ponds on top of the Antarctic sea ice during austral summer are thought to be rare. Their observations are limited to few occasional sightings and no regular dataset is published till now. In this work, we employ an existing remote sensing method which was already applied in the Arctic and for the first time detect potential surface melt areas on top of the Antarctic sea ice at a regional to global scale using Sentinel-3 data. We confirm the occurrence of melt ponds in Lutzow-Holm Bay in the vicinity of the Showa Station observed in situ in January 2017 and detect surface melt in the following years 2018-2020. We also perform global processing of the Antarctic sea ice to detect further regions of potential surface melt.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of modern Russian historiography of criminal and political exile to Siberia. The authors consistently consider the main directions of development of post-Soviet studies, note, first of all, the great interest of historians in various aspects of the penitentiary policy and practice of the empire in Siberia, the features of the imprisonment of political and criminal prisoners. Further, a sharp drop in the attention of specialists to the history of the exile of the Social Democrats, and above all, the Bolsheviks, is stated, and vice versa - a significant increase in works devoted to the stay in exile of representatives of the Socialist Revolutionaries and anarchists. The publications on the history of the exile to Siberia of the Decembrists are analyzed, the content of the discussion about the evolution of their worldview, the role of "noble revolutionaries" in the political history of Russia is conveyed. The authors also briefly analyze the main directions of publications of the Irkutsk collection of scientific articles "Siberian Link", created back in 1973. It is concluded that the history of criminal and political exile to Siberia as a scientific direction in the post-Soviet period continues to develop successfully, acquiring new facets, replenished with specific studies and authors.

T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the crucial tasks of contemporary paremiology as a separate linguistic discipline is a semantic description of proverbs and their classification into semantic types according to various criteria. The article examines the categorization of the semantics of Tuvan proverbs, differentiates and describes their semantic types according to the criterion "attitude to reality" in the empirical and axiological aspects.As a result of the study, it has been found that proverbs of the Tuvan language in terms of their content's relation to extralinguistic reality can either contradict or be consistent with it in the empirical aspect. Proverbs, the content of which does not contradict reality, are divided into nomological and non-nomological, depending on the expression of necessary vs. accidental, essential vs. non-essential, regular vs. irregular connections between multiple objects. Proverbs that have no nomological content are classified into truistic and non-truistic in respect of the fact whether it is widely known vs. not well-known, stereotypical vs. original, evident vs. non-evident. In axiological terms, proverbs that do not have a truistic content express either essential or insignificant for the traditional worldview principles of reality. On this basis, they are differentiated into sentential and gregueric.

TI  - TOPONYMIC LEGENDS OF URAL AMATEUR MINERS
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses the legends of Ural amateur miners (gorshchiks) - people who recover precious stones and gemstones as their private business. The folklore of amateur miners still remains virtually unstudied; that differentiates it from the folklore of professional miners (gorniaks). The research is based on field records of various periods, both published and unpublished. These records are part of the card index Vocabulary, Toponymy, Ethnography of the Stone kept at the Department of the Russian Language, General Linguistics and Verbal Communication (Ural Federal University). The article demonstrates that the legends spring from the real working practices of amateur miners; traditional motifs, including fantastic ones, add to these legends. The research centres on toponymic legends which are considered as a source for deriving the inner form and motivation of the place name (toponym). The author points out that applying to historical records and a comprehensive ethnolinguistic analysis help establish if the motivation of the toponym given in the legend is correct or erroneous. The research reveals that a correlation between a firmly established legendary motif and a firmly established nominative model helps correctly determine the motivation of a toponym. In addition, the amateur miners' legends are seen as a source for studying their way of life and worldview. The article analyses the following motifs characteristic of the amateur miners' legends: the stroke of luck and the chance discovery of gemstones, the not given treasure and the unlucky development of a mine, the prophetic dream, the violation of a taboo and punishment for greed, the miraculous richness of mines. The author highlights specific professional interpretations that well-known folklore motifs acquire in the amateur miners' legends. Specifically, the self-burial of the Chud people is replaced by the motif of treasure burial.

AB  - We propose a fractal dimension estimator for multispectral images. The estimator is based on the probabilistic boxcounting classical approach extended to the multivariate domain of multiband images. In order to validate the estimator, we propose a fractal model for multispectral images based on the fractional Brownian motion. The generated synthetic multispectral fractal images have 7 statistically-independent spectral bands at specific wavelengths in the visible domain We apply the proposed approach for the complexity characterization of a widely-known remotely-sensed data set and conclude the article.

AB  - In Indonesia, extensive tropical peatland has been facing land degradation due to deforestation and drainage canal construction. Such activities lead to the decrease of groundwater level (GWL), accelerating the peat decomposition, followed by peatland subsidence. This study addresses to estimate a three-year (from Jan. 2018 to Jan. 2020) tropical peatland subsidence over Kalimantan, Indonesia, using the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TInSAR) technique by Sentinel-1A. TInSAR analysis revealed the apparent large displacement found in 2019 due to a significant decline of GWL caused by positive Indian-Ocean dipole mode (IOD) event compared to other years. Furthermore, we employed GWL derived from satellite-based remote sensing data to investigate the relationship between subsidence and GWL and showed a mutual relationship.

AB  - Whereas nowadays, diverse readers enjoy picturebooks regardless of their age and background, children will always be the main readers of picturebooks. One of the recent crossover phenomena is the emergence of picturebooks which take the form of children’s literature but set an adult as the implied reader instead of a child. By reviewing Kang Gyeong-Soo's   Troubleshooter Dr. Penguin  , this study aimed to discuss the worldview projected in the text and its implications for children's literature education and picturebook review. For this purpose, this study used Vanhoozer's cultural interpretation methodology which is a threefold analysis of the text itself, ahead of, and behind of the text and finally the worldview implied in this text. As a result, the nihilistic worldview projected in   Troubleshooter Dr. Penguin   is discussed. This study discussed the epistemological and ethical issues regarding the nihilist worldview projected in the text, and the responsibility of the picturebook reviewers to introduce valuable picturebooks to children by enhancing the literacy of adult readers.

AB  - Abstract: Increased wildfire activity and altered post-fire climate in the Southern Rocky Mountains has the potential to influence forest resilience. The Southern Rocky Mountains are a leading edge of climate change and have experienced record-breaking fires in recent years. The change in post-fire regeneration and forest resilience could potentially include future ecological trajectories. In this paper, we examined patterns of post-fire spectral recovery using Landsat time series. Additionally, we utilized random forest models to analyze the impact of climate and burn severity on three fire events in the Southern Rocky Mountains. Fifteen years following the fires, none of the burned stands fully recovered to their pre-fire spectral states. The results suggested that burn severity significantly impacted post-fire spectral recovery, but that influence may decrease as time since fire increases. The biggest difference in forest recovery was among fire events, indicating that post-fire climate may be influential in post-fire recovery. The mean and minimum growing-season temperatures were more significant to post-fire recovery than the variability in precipitation, which is consistent with field-based analysis. The present study indicated that, as warming continues, there may be changes in forest density where forests are not regenerating to their pre-fire spectral states. Additionally, this study emphasizes how high-elevation forests continue to regenerate after fires, but that regenera-tion is markedly affected by post-fire climate. Copyright: Open Access

TI  - Analyzing Effects of Crops on SMAP Satellite-Based Soil Moisture Using a Rainfall-Runoff Model in the US Corn Belt
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - L-band microwave satellite missions provide soil moisture information potentially useful for streamflow and, hence, flood predictions. However, these observations are also sensitive to the presence of vegetation that makes satellite soil moisture estimations prone to errors. In this study, the authors evaluate satellite soil moisture estimations from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity and two distributed hydrologic models with measurements from in situ sensors in the Corn Belt state of Iowa, a region dominated by annual row crops of corn and soybean. First, the authors compare model and satellite soil moisture products across Iowa using in situ data for more than 30 stations. Then, they compare satellite soil moisture products with state-wide model-based fields to identify regions of low and high agreement. Finally, the authors analyze and explain the resulting spatial patterns with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer vegetation indices and SMAP vegetation optical depth. The results indicate that satellite soil moisture estimations are drier than those provided by the hydrologic model, and the spatial bias depends on the intensity of row-crop agriculture. The work highlights the importance of developing a revised SMAP algorithm for regions of intensive row-crop agriculture to increase SMAP utility in the real-time streamflowpredictions.

TI  - Monitoring of the movements of the Mohne dam by satellites
T2  - WASSERWIRTSCHAFT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of infrastructure monitoring, methods of radar remote sensing using satellite data are gaining importance. In particular, the technique of persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) has established itself in various studies as a cost-effective and accurate supplement to traditional surveying techniques. It calculates deformations for rather stable objects on the Earth's surface over a chosen time period. The Sentinel-1 satellite data of the European Copernicus program, which have been freely available since 2014, are particularly suitable for this purpose. Since gravity dams have not been an essential part of previous research in this field, this study examines the applicability of the PSI technique using the Mohne dam (Germany) as an example. Furthermore, statements about the accuracy are made by comparison with geodetic in-situ measurements. By applying the PSI technique, deformations that show high accuracies compared to the in-situ data could be calculated, demonstrating that the technique is applicable to gravity dams.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to compare the articles related to Mahan in literature in each country to examine its realities. Through this, the establishment period, transition process, and collapse period of Mahan were reasonably interpreted.Through the Chinese history book, Sanguozhi (Romance of the Three Kingdoms), it was found that Mahan was founded no later than around the 3rd century BC, and there were 54 (55) nations in the middle and late 3rd century AD. In addition, the article on the exchange of Xinmizhuguo shown in Jinshu shows the reality of the Mahan forces shown in the Southwest coast area, Jeollanam-do with the situation in the second half of the 3rd century. Tongdian writes it was annexed by Baekje during the Qin Dynasty period, and it was perceived that Mahan was subjugated in the West Jin period.On the other hand, the article on Mahan in the reign of King Onjo in Samguksagi (The Chronicles of the Three States) was a distortion of the fact later by the Baekje-centered worldview, and it was understood as the subjugation of the state of the Mokchi in the Asan Bay region through the names of places mentioned. In addition, the process of settling and gradually growing and subjugating Mahan with the help of the leading power of Mahan was contracted by stages.In the article on Year 49 of the reign of Queen Jungu in Nihon Shoki, it is noted that the conquest of the southern barbarian Chimmidarye was made by Baekje, not Wa (Japan) and that it was the conquest of Mahan on the Southwest coast area, Jeollanam-do. The surrender of the Jeollabuk-do area draws attention in that it is connected to the construction of the Gosaburi Fortress shown in the reign of King Onjo period. In this article, too, the process of the conquest and subjugation of Mahan was abridged as in Samguk Sagi, showing the phased process.Based on this, the reality of Mahan was investigated by comparing and examining the history books of three countries. The content of the Han Section of the Sanguozhi, which shows what early Mahan was like was collected between 238 and 246. The article on the negotiation of Xinmizhuguo in Jinshu shows that the power in the Southwest coast area, Jeollanam-do, who was against Baekje-centered power reorganization, sought measures for overcoming it in response to the Cao-Wei Dynasty’s active eastern policy. The Gobu area, Jeollabuk-do was recorded in the history books of all three countries, which shows that Baekje in the early 4th century reaches the whole area of Jeollabuk-do. All nations in the whole area of Jeollabuk-do surrendered in the article on the reign of Queen Jungu in Nihon Shoki the whole area of Jeollabuk-do, which confirms this situation. The article on the reign of Queen Jungu is centered around the conquest and subjugation of the Southwest coast area of Jeollanam-do, called Namman. Through the above examination, Baekje’s conquest of Mahan was completed through a step-by-step process, which is consistent with the record it was annexed to Baekje after the Qin Dynasty period in Chinese history books. However, the foundation for the native forces of Mahan did not break up, and their autonomy grew through Baekje’s policy of ruling utilizing the families of the native forces. It is judged that the rise of Mahan culture was caused by this particularity.

AB  - In Canada, wetlands cover a large extent of landscape, providing necessary services to ecosystems. Wetland mapping and monitoring utilizing satellite Earth Observation (EO) imagery are of great importance for natural resource management. This study established a two-stream deep learning framework based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for wetland classification. The proposed architecture includes a dedicated information source for each stream, wherein Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 that are independently fed to GCN and CNN networks, respectively. The final classification result is achieved by concatenating the features extracted by each stream. The study area is a part of the Avalon site located on the Island of Newfoundland in Canada, where we have collected ground truth data for different wetland types. The result was compared to that obtained using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The overall accuracies were 87.68%, 85.52%, and 83.7% for the proposed method, the RF, and the SVM, respectively.

AB  - In wetland mapping, a lot of uncertainty is related to the task of selecting an appropriate classification approach. Although the individual models are available and well-established in the literature for the classification task, the combination approaches have become popular recently. Hence, selecting an appropriate method is challenging, whether an individual approach or combination. In this work, a meta-learning study is performed to prove that combining the result of individual machine learning models could be better than using the best single model. This study investigates the applicability of the meta-learning method for wetland classification. We will first explore the importance of extracted features for each model. Then, the essential features are fed to the model with the welltuned hyper-parameters. Finally, the voting classifier as a meta-learning approach is adopted to improve the classification result. The classification map of the study area reached the highest accuracy (Overall Accuracy = 93.9% and Kappa= 0.92) when the proposed ensemble classifier was employed. The results show the superiority of a combination of methods over simple model selection approaches. The results of this study can provide new insights for researchers to find new combination strategies to improve the classification results.

AB  - Detailed information on the extent and composition of tree species in a forest is crucial for scientific studies and forest management plans. In the recent years, remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool in gathering different vegetation biophysical parameters. Further, the advancements in the state-of-art machine learning techniques have enhanced the process of combining multi-temporal, multi-sensor datasets, handling and analyzing large variable datasets to produce results with higher precision and accuracies. Ground-based census and mapping of tree species is a cumbersome, time taking and expensive exercise. Thus, Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) based classification of remotely-sensed datasets has become a topical aspect of research interest. There are only a handful of studies mapping the distribution of forest tree species in the Western Himalayas using satellite imagery. The present study is amongst the pioneer studies undertaken in India to map one of the dominant tree species i.e. Pinus roxburghii, commonly known as Chir pine, by integrating machine learning techniques with the remote sensing technology. A supervised Random Forest MLA has been employed to discriminate between tree species based upon various spectral and topographical variables from Sentinel imagery. The methodology employed produced reliable maps of distribution of Chir pine forests in the study area, Uttarakhand, India with adequate accuracy. As the study has been undertaken using open and freely-available datasets such as Sentinel, Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and ML libraries, it has the potential for adoption in countries like India for forestry research and inventory in a cost-effective manner. The methodology can be reproduced for delineation of different forest tree species to produce distribution maps with enhanced accuracies.

AB  - Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) plays a significant role in maintaining the earth's ecological balance and generating electricity in photovoltaic systems. While the satellites have more range, they have been shown to over/under-estimate the true values of GHI that are observed at the ground-based stations. Hence, this study aims at analyzing the relationship between these two sources of GHI data in order to better and effectively utilize the reach of satellites for GHI analysis. The paper identifies a near linear relationship between the two and thereby concludes that an approximate mapping from satellite- to ground-based GHI values can be obtained.

AB  - With an increasing number of overdose cases yearly, the city of Chicago is facing an opioid epidemic. Many of these overdose cases lead to 911 calls that necessitate timely response from our limited emergency medicine services. This paper demonstrates how data from these calls along with synthetic and geospatial data can help create a syndromic surveillance system to combat this opioid crisis. Chicago EMS data is obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health with a database structure using the NEMSIS standard. This information is combined with information from the RTI U.S. Household Population database, before being transferred to an Azure Data Lake. Afterwards, the data is integrated with Azure Synapse before being refined in another data lake and filtered with ICD-10 codes. Afterwards, we moved the data to ArcGIS Enterprise to apply spatial statistics and geospatial analytics to create our surveillance system.

TI  - Modeling and Predicting Land Use Land Cover Spatiotemporal Changes: A Case Study in Chalus Watershed, Iran
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is a main driver of global environmental change and has destructive effects on the structure and function of the ecosystem. This study attempts to detect temporal and spatial changes in LULC patterns of the Chalus watershed during the last two decades using multitemporal Landsat images and predict the future LULC changes and patterns of the Chalus watershed for the year 2040. A hybrid method between segment-based and pixel-based classification was applied for each Landsat image in 2001, 2014, and 2021 to produce LULC maps of the Chalus watershed. In this study, the transition potential maps and the transition probability matrices between LULC types were provided by the support vector machine algorithm and the Markov chain model, respectively, to project the 2021 and 2040 LULC maps. The achieved K-index values that compared the simulated LULC map with the actual LULC map of the year 2021 resulted in a Kstandard = 0.9160, Kno = 0.9379, Klocation = 0.9318, and KlocationStrata = 0.9320, showing good agreement between the actual and simulated LULC map. Analysis of the historical LULC changes depicted that during 2001-2021, the significant increase of agricultural land (14317 ha) and barren area (9063 ha), and the sharp decline of grassland (26215 ha), and forest cover (5989 ha) were the major LULC changes in the Chalus watershed. The model predicted that forest cover will continue to decrease from 29.46 % (50720.2667 ha) in 2021 to 25.67 % of area (44207.78694 ha) in 2040, as well as, unceasing expansion of barren area, agricultural land, and built-up area will be expected by 2040. Therefore, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC change is extremely important to implement essential measures and minimize the destructive consequences of these changes.

AB  - The Halayeb area is one of the most important Egyptian places, occupying a portion of the country's southeastern desert zone and serving as a strategic border with Sudan. The major goal of this study is to combine existing data on landforms, soil qualities, and climate data to define agro-ecological zones (AEZ) that are suitable for agricultural development. Thirty-two soil profiles were dug throughout the study region to represent physiographic units, and a digital soil map was generated based on an analysis of the digital elevation model and Landsat 8 satellite data, as well as climatic data from nine sites within the study area. Using the Model Builder in ArcGIS software, AEZ were created based on overlay maps of topography, soil chemical and physical properties, temperature, and precipitation maps. Zone (I) represents highly suitable areas (2.6 percent), zone (II) represents suitable areas (12.4 percent), zone (III) represents moderately suitable areas (26.5 percent), and zone (IV) represents marginally suitable areas (37.3 percent) . highly suitable(S1), suitable (S2), and moderately suitable(S3) were the most appropriate classes for all of the crops studied. The findings will aid decision-makers in developing various development plans based on the research area's conditions. The study's methodology and findings can be used to evaluate which land is best suited for agricultural productivity growth.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in classifying complex remote sensing scenery, particularly in the classification of wetlands. State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing ( NLP) algorithms, on the other hand, are transformers. In this paper, we illustrate the effectiveness of the cutting-edge Swin Transformer for the classification of complex wetlands in New Brunswick, Canada. The precision of the proposed transformer is 0.66, 0.71, 0.75, 0.78, 0.82, 0.83, 0.84, 0.90, 0.90, 0.95, and 0.98 for the recognition of shrub, fen, forested wetland, crop, bog, freshwater marsh, coastal marsh, aquatic bed, grass, urban, and water, respectively. Based on the results, with a relatively high level of overall accuracy of slightly less than 80%, the proposed Swin Transformer is highly capable of complex wetland classification.

TI  - Swin Transformer and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Coastal Wetland Classification Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of machine learning algorithms to classify complex landscapes has been revolutionized by the introduction of deep learning techniques, particularly in remote sensing. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in the classification of complex high-dimensional remote sensing imagery, specifically in wetland classification. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) algorithms are transformers. Although the transformers have been studied for a few remote sensing applications, the integration of deep CNNs and transformers has not been studied, particularly in wetland mapping. As such, in this study, we explore the potential and possible limitations to be overcome regarding the use of a multi-model deep learning network with the integration of a modified version of the well-known deep CNN network of VGG-16, a 3D CNN network, and Swin transformer for complex coastal wetland classification. Moreover, we discuss the potential and limitation of the proposed multi-model technique over several solo models, including a random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), VGG-16, 3D CNN, and Swin transformer in the pilot site of Saint John city located in New Brunswick, Canada. In terms of F-1 score, the multi-model network obtained values of 0.87, 0.88, 0.89, 0.91, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.93 for the recognition of shrub wetland, fen, bog, aquatic bed, coastal marsh, forested wetland, and freshwater marsh, respectively. The results suggest that the multi-model network is superior to other solo classifiers from 3.36% to 33.35% in terms of average accuracy. Results achieved in this study suggest the high potential for integrating and using CNN networks with the cutting-edge transformers for the classification of complex landscapes in remote sensing.

AB  - The emergence of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the use of machine learning algorithms to classify complicated environments, notably in remote sensing. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown considerable promise in classifying challenging high-dimensional remote sensing data, particularly in the classification of wetlands. State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, on the other hand, are transformers. Despite the fact that transformers have been utilized for a few remote sensing applications, they have not been compared to other well-known CNN networks in complex wetland classification. As such, for the classification of complex coastal wetlands in the study area of Saint John city, located in New Brunswick, Canada, we modified and employed the Swin Transformer algorithm. Moreover, the developed transformer classifier results were compared with two well-known deep CNNs of AlexNet and VGG-16. In terms of average accuracy, the proposed Swin Transformer algorithm outperformed the AlexNet and VGG-16 techniques by 14.3% and 44.28%, respectively. The proposed Swin Transformer classifier obtained F-1 scores of 0.65, 0.71, 0.73, 0.78, 0.82, 0.84, and 0.84 for the recognition of coastal marsh, shrub, bog, fen, aquatic bed, forested wetland, and freshwater marsh, respectively. The results achieved in this study suggest the high capability of transformers over very deep CNN networks for the classification of complex landscapes in remote sensing.

TI  - Performance Ratio Analysis Based on Energy Production for Large-Scale Solar Plant
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an industrial approach to assess the performance of large-scale solar plants (LSSPs) has been developed using a novel performance ratio (PR) formula model based on energy production. The PR is an important quality indicator used for the LSSP projects with a nominal installed capacity of 20 MWdc upward. When solar power plants are put into operation on the national grid, the PR can be used as a performance indicator to ensure the energy guarantee and the plant's efficiency required to guarantee a level of performance. Then, PR gives the real face of the plant's efficiency. This is not an easy task because it has no constant value over the years due to the effective incident global irradiation (GlobInc) value always not being available. For this purpose, the proposed PR formula model is used to compute the correct performance guarantee of the grid-connected 100MWdc-LSSP in Pakistan's Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park (QASP). The main purpose of this study is to incorporate a PR formula based on energy production evaluation to achieve the energy guarantee (excess energy, bonus energy, or energy shortfall) in LSSPs. The 1-year on-site plant data is utilized to investigate the plant's performance energy inputs such as production, irradiance, PR, and the excess energy. Based on the actual annual energy output and irradiance of the plant, the following results are obtained: Actual PR is achieved at a higher level than the target benchmark, so no shortfall or liquefied damage (LD) is imposed due to excess energy. Thus, 100MWdc-LSSP's power generation is found to be 5% higher than expected by using the theoretical calculations of PR. In FY (2018-2019), the system fed 0.34% higher PR, with an actual PR of 76.58% higher than the target PR of 76.24%, and extra energy of 710.72MWh produced, as well as bonus energy of 142,143.62 USD. The majority of LSSP projects are determined to be successfully operational and generate a significant amount of power, but they fail to meet the contractual requirements for energy guarantee because they use the incorrect PR formula and also fail to provide the desired energy to stakeholders owing to a poor theoretical assessment of the PR criteria based on energy production. As a result, solar power plants confront a great energy shortfall for many years to come.

TI  - Severe influenza A in a Tunisian ICU sentinel SARI centre: Epidemiological and clinical features.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Influenza A virus infection is a contagious acute respiratory infection which mostly evolves in an epidemic form, less frequently as pandemic outbreaks. It can take a severe clinical form that needs to be managed in intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical aspects of influenza A, then to determine independent predictive factors of ICU mortality in Abderrahmen Mami hospital, Ariana, Tunisia.METHODS: It was a single-center study, including all hospitalized patients in intensive care, between November 1st, 2009 and October 31st, 2019, with influenza A virus infection. We recorded demographic, clinical and biological data, evolving features; then multivariate analysis of the predictive factors of ICU mortality was realized.RESULTS: During the study period (10 consecutive seasons), 120 patients having severe Influenza A were admitted (Proportion = 2.5%) from all hospitalized patients, with a median age of 48 years and a gender-ratio of 1.14. Among women, 14 were pregnant. Only 7 patients (5.8%) have had seasonal flu vaccine during the year before ICU admission. The median values of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment were respectively 26, 10 and 3. Virus strains identified with polymerase chain reaction were H1N1 pdm09 (84.2%) and H3N2 (15.8%). Antiviral therapy was prescribed in 88 (73.3%) patients. A co-infection was recorded in 19 cases: bacterial (n = 17) and aspergillaire (n = 2). An acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed in 82 patients. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was conducted for 72 (60%) patients with success in 34 cases. Endotracheal intubation was performed in 59 patients with median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation 8 [3.25-13] days. The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n = 50, 41.7%), shock (n = 48, 40%), hospital-acquired infections (n = 46, 38.8%) and thromboembolic events (n = 19, 15.8%). The overall ICU mortality rate was of 31.7% (deceased n = 38). Independent predictive factors of ICU mortality identified were: age above 56 years (OR = 7.417; IC95% [1.474-37.317]; p = 0.015), PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 95 mmHg (OR = 9.078; IC95% [1.636-50.363]; p = 0.012) and lymphocytes count ≤ 1.325 109/L (OR = 10.199; IC95% [1.550-67.101]; p = 0.016).CONCLUSION: Influenza A in ICU is not uncommon, even in A(H1N1) dominant seasons; its management is highly demanding. It is responsible for considerable morbi-mortality especially in elderly patients.

AB  - The height of forest canopy is a valuable information to estimate or predict of aboveground live biomass in places such as natural reserves or parks. Many of these sites use satellite data based on Lidar or radars to run carbon stock models. The parks in low income countries can not afford to use these expensive solutions. Airborne and small radars tailor made for a given specific area can be deployed as alternative solution. In this paper, we present an algorithm that contains a complete technique for the signal processing needed to estimate canopy height. The algorithm includes a simulator of SAR raw data and SAR images based on impulse response. This algorithm enable testing of focus algorithms and generate three-dimensional images. We use a rigorous and extensive method to implement the SAR image processing part of the algorithm based on the Omega-k algorithm. To confirm the validity of the algorithm we use Quad polarized images of trees from a Polarimetric SAR simulator. Finally, we use SAR raw data acquired by the ERS-2 satellite to test and validate the overall process. The technique is shown to be effective and simple, since even signals with only one and two polarization are sufficient. Height results were compared with Range Doppler based techniques available in the literature.

TI  - Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation using Acute Respiratory Infections sentinel system of Catalonia (PIDIRAC) during the 2019-2020 season: A retrospective observational study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn the context of COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia (Spain), the present study analyses respiratory samples collected by the primary care network using Acute Respiratory Infections Sentinel Surveillance System (PIDIRAC) during the 2019-2020 season to complement the pandemic surveillance system in place to detect SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study is to describe whether SARS-CoV-2 was circulating before the first confirmed case was detected in Catalonia, on February 25(th), 2020. MethodsThe study sample was made up of all samples collected by the PIDIRAC primary care network as part of the Influenza and Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) surveillance system activities. The study on respiratory virus included coronavirus using multiple RT-PCR assays. All positive samples for human coronavirus were subsequently typed for HKU1, OC43, NL63, 229E. Every respiratory sample was frozen at-80 degrees C and retrospectively studied for SARS-CoV-2 detection. A descriptive study was performed, analysing significant differences among variables related to SARS-CoV- 2 cases comparing with rest of coronaviruses cases through a bivariate study with Chi-squared test and statistical significance at 95%. ResultsBetween October 2019 and April 2020, 878 respiratory samples from patients with acute respiratory infection or influenza syndrome obtained by PIDIRAC were analysed. 51.9% tested positive for influenza virus, 48.1% for other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 was present in 6 samples. The first positive SARS-CoV-2 case had symptom onset on 2 March 2020. These 6 cases were 3 men and 3 women, aged between 25 and 50 years old. 67% had risk factors, none had previous travel history nor presented viral coinfection. All of them recovered favourably. ConclusionSentinel Surveillance PIDIRAC enhances global epidemiological surveillance by allowing confirmation of viral circulation and describes the epidemiology of generalized community respiratory viruses' transmission in Catalonia. The system can provide an alert signal when identification of a virus is not achieved in order to take adequate preparedness measures.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Drought events in the Philippines have resulted in a significant loss in crop production. This study investigated the drought development during the 2019 weak El Nino using different drought indices at a country and local scale. Satellite data from MODIS were used to derive Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomaly, Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and Standardized Vegetation and Temperature Ratio (SVTR), while TRMM was used for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). These indices were compared with crop production data at national scale and crop damage reports at local scale. The results showed consistency in the spatiotemporal variation of drought events, where drought peak occurred during March to April in most indices and indicators. Based on the values of SPI, the areas with rainfall deficit increased from January to April (25% to almost 100%), but looking at vegetation stress, around 50% was affected, as seen by SVTR and VHI. Yield loss during the first and second quarter after the El Nino peak increased up to 20%, especially in the western region in the Philippines. Overall findings demonstrate the relevance of utilizing multiple drought indices and indicators that characterize drought evolution, from drought onset to the peak of agricultural drought, which is essential in developing a robust drought metric for the Philippines.

T2  - 문학과 종교
M3  - research-article
AB  - Abstract: As a translation of the Dutch play Elckerlijc, Everyman follows the tradition of religious themes and dramatic motifs in the liturgy of the medieval church. The religious features of the morality drama, such as chastity, temptation, repentance, and salvation, are reproduced in Everyman. The play dramatizes Catholic teachings centered on the sacraments and uses biblical texts and doctrines for didactic purposes to share a Christian worldview through a pilgrimage for Everyman’s final journey. Everyman teaches that by relying on grace and doing good deeds in a state of grace, souls can be saved from the sins of the world at the moment of death. This study briefly examines the scope of religious thought at the time in relation to the dramatic purposes and considers how Everyman reflects and reveals the religious discourse of that time. In particular, this study investigates the spiritual self-awareness of the protagonist regarding death and salvation and the diversity of ways in which medieval Catholic doctrine and moral norms operate within religious practices in the final pilgrimage. It also explores the didactic strategy and narratives related to allegorical figures in the religious context of the Middle Ages in England before and after the Reformation.

AB  - Introduction: Radiation monitoring of professionally exposed workers is obligatory in nuclear medicine departments. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the radiation exposure dose received by medical workers during radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer and endometrial cancer patients.Methods: Radiation exposure dose of medical staff was prospectively recorded during 35 radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures in a 6-month period. All patients received 4 mCi [(99)mTc]Tc-SENTI-SCINT on the day of surgery. Thermoluminescent dosimeters in the shape of a bracelet, ring and badge were used for recordings and data was compared to dose limits imposed by the regulations.Results: Mean time interval between activity administration and surgery was 223.63 min and mean duration of surgery was 142.5 min. The recorded 6-month cumulative dose was 0.33 mSv for the senior surgeon, 0.25 mSv for the surgeon's first assistant, 0.24 mSv for the anesthesiologist and 0.54 for both nuclear medicine physician and resident. The approximately equivalent dose for the surgical staff in each procedure was 9.7 mu Sy, 7.3 mu Sy and 7.05 mu Sy respectively, which means that the senior surgeon could perform 106 and 2127 sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures per year in order to reach the annual dose limit for a public member and a radiation worker.Conclusion: Occupational radiation exposure dose of medical staff during radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy is low and under annual dose limits, requiring no routinely personal dosimetry for surgical staff performing the procedure.

TI  - Preoperative detection of sentinel lymph node in patients with endometrial cancer - comparison of planar lymphoscintigraphy, SPECT and SPECT/CT
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping allows minimal invasive assessment of lymph node status in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer (EC). Intraoperative detection of SLNs is based on the results obtained from preoperative nuclear medical images. The purpose of this study was to compare the data obtained from planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and SPECT with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for preoperative SLN detection in patients with EC. Material and methods: A total of 44 images in 22 patients with early-stage EC (22 PL, 9 SPECT and 13 SPECT/CT) were analyzed. The scans were performed in the period 2018-2020 at the Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine in Skopje. Thirteen patients underwent PL and SPECT/CT and nine patients underwent PL and SPECT after cervical injection of 4 mCi 99mTc-SENTI-SCINT on the day of surgery. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test, and Spearman rank R coefficient were used for data analyses. Results: Twenty-two patients with mean age of 61.1 +/- 7.5 and body mass index (BMI) 34.62 +/- 6.4 kg/m(2) were included in the study. In four patients (18.2%) SLN was not detected on PL. Detection rate on SPECT and SPECT/CT was 100%. The average number of detected SLN was 1.4 +/- 1.05, 2.2 +/- 1.1 i 2.15 +/- 1.1 on PL, SPECT and SPECT/CT respectively. We found a statistically significant difference in the number of detected SLNs on PL vs. SPECT/CT (p = 0.0077). The most common SLN location on SPECT/CT was the right internal iliac followed by the left common iliac region. Conclusions: The results of the presented study indicate a higher diagnostic value of SPECT/CT in terms of SLN detection and exact anatomic localization as compared to planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL).

TI  - Atypical ulcer arising on stasis dermatitis: achromic melanoma.
T2  - Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Due to venous insufficiency, a vascular ulcer frequently occurs with the progression of stasis dermatitis. Achromic melanoma, a rare form of pigmentless melanoma frequently located on the sole of the foot, is often and easily confused with a typical wound. Diagnosis of ulcerated achromic melanoma is thus often delayed and associated with a poor prognosis.CASE REPORT: The authors report a very rare case of malignant melanoma in a 70-year-old female with stasis dermatitis. The painless ulcer was present for 1 year before the first visit. Upon clinical examination, a 2-cm diameter hypergranulating ulcer with irregular and pigmented borders was present. Dermoscopy revealed the presence of red globules, a gray-to-blue veil, irregular vessels, and the remains of a pigmented ridge pattern. Histological analysis showed infiltration of atypical melanocytes in the dermis, 2 mitoses, and ulceration. Diagnosis of melanoma was confirmed by positive MART-1 immunochemistry. After removal of the melanoma, the area was covered with an autologous skin graft excised from the inner thigh. In accordance with the guidelines, sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, and the result was negative for lymph node involvement. A comprehensive clinical dermoscopic evaluation led to the correct diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: The current case highlights the importance of evaluating a chronic, atypical, nonhealing ulcer clinically and dermoscopically as well as through a biopsy procedure.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter used to control a broad range of environmental applications. An increasing attention has been recently given to machine learning (ML) methods for SM retrieval that provide promising performance. Nevertheless, most of them are based on a supervised learning strategies that depend on the used labeled training samples. In fact, they are unaffordable or costly. In this letter, new teacher-student for SM estimation, called (TS-SME), relying on teacher-student (TS) framework using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data, was proposed to estimate SM. The main advantage of this framework is to enroll a large amount of unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data. Experiments were carried out on two arid areas in southern Tunisia. The input data include the backscatter coefficient in two-mode polarization (sigma(VV)degrees and sigma(VH)degrees) for Sentinel-1A, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) for Sentinel-2A and in situ measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that TS-SME framework is capable of generating a well-performed student model, with the estimation accuracy is superior to all teacher models [artificial neural network (ANN), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest regressor (RFR), and water cloud model (WCM)]. It was highly correlated with the in situ measurements with high Pearson's correlation coefficient R (R-RF = 0.86, R-ANN = 0.75, R-XGBoost = 0.77, R-WCM = 0.77, RTS-SME = 0.96) and low root mean square error (RMSE) (RMSERF =1.09%, RMSEANN = 1.49%, R-XGBoost = 1.39%, RMSEWCM = 1.12%, RMSETS-SME = 0.8%), respectively.

AB  - In order to manage and handle all the damage cause by flood, satellite image can be used in determination of the damaged areas because of its ability to observe wide area at once. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a type of satellite image that does not get affected by weather condition, unlike optical satellite image which usually cannot see clear image of earth surface at the time of heavy rain or storm. However, SAR image is difficult to be interpreted with the conventional way as optical image. Deep learning is an efficient way for image segmentation and recognition where numbers of research have been proposed based on this technique for past several years. In this paper, we aim to detect flood area from a pair of SAR images with Res-Unet, one of the deep learning architectures which based on U-net. The SAR images have been preprocessed and normalized to [-1, 1] before training and prediction with Res-Unet. The result is compared to the using of U-net. The models trained with U-net and Res-Unet work well in detecting flood area where Res-Unet gives the better result visually.

TI  - Radiation use efficiency of the herbaceous layer of dry Chaco shrublands and woodlands: Spatial and temporal patterns
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Monitoring rangeland above-ground net primary production (ANPP) requires information on the variation of radiation use efficiency (RUE). We studied the spatial and temporal variations of RUE of the herbaceous layer (RUEH) in woodlands and shrublands and its association with grazing regime, environmental, and vegetation variables. Location We worked in the Arid Chaco (Argentina), an ecotone region between the Chaco and Monte phytogeographic provinces. Woody and herbaceous species coexist in variable proportions in relation to a regional precipitation gradient and local edaphic variations. Methods and results Over eight growing seasons, we estimated RUEH at 12 sites, each with two contrasting grazing regimes (moderate and severe). To do this, we related estimated ANPP(H) from biomass harvests and APAR(H) (absorbed photosynthetically active radiation of the herbaceous layer) calculated from the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then we linked the RUEH with precipitation, physiognomy, soil, and landscape data. Most of the spatial variability of RUEH was accounted for by the grazing regime. Moderately grazed areas had a three times greater RUEH than severely grazed ones (0.507 and 0.180 g MJ(-1) respectively). They also exhibited different proportions of herbaceous functional types. Physiognomic characteristics of the woody layer explained a significant proportion of the spatial variation of RUEH not explained by grazing regime. RUEH was between 30 and 150% greater in woodlands than in shrublands depending on whether the sites were under moderate or severe grazing respectively. Conclusion Grazing regime and woody physiognomy accounted for most of the variation in herbaceous radiation use efficiency. Our results show that RUEH may be predicted with greater accuracy from a combination of vegetation maps and information on grazing regime. Thus, our models could be incorporated into web platforms that provide ANPP(H) (forage) monitoring services based on satellite data, in order to improve their estimates in woodlands, shrublands and savanna ecosystems.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The Yakuts have traditionally led a semi-nomadic lifestyle, calling themselves “Sakha” (Саха). They are of Turkic descent and have been living with various ethnic groups in the Sakha Republic for a long time. In the 17th century, when Russia began to dominate the region, and later became a member of the Soviet Union and lived with Russian immigrants, the Yakuts were one of the few people who lived according to their ancestors while preserving their own traditions and customs. Anthony D. Smith defined a nation as ‘a named set of human beings who have a sense of solidarity through shared ancestral historical experiences, myths, and lifestyles’. Considering these common experiences that build a sense of solidarity among peoples and bind them together as a community, culture allows us to examine the traditional world image of a nation. Among the various areas of culture, food, clothing, and shelter culture reflects the world image and spiritual culture of a nation, in particular, making it possible to know their unique national characteristics.As the Republic of Yakutia is located in the Arctic region and has severe climatic conditions with an annual temperature difference of close to 100℃, residential culture can be seen as an area that shows their typical ethnic characteristics. Traditionally, semi-nomadic Yakuts build mobile homes called Yurt(a) (Юрта) and lead a migratory life for herding. Yurta means ‘home’ or ‘family’ to the nomadic peoples. In this paper, we would like to examine the harmony between residential culture, which is the most basic human cultural domain, and the traditional world view of Yakuts. It is meaningful to understand and organize one ancient form of life of the northern peoples that mankind has forgotten by examining the residential forms of Yakuts who move according to the seasons and livestock and their traditional world views that are dissolved in their architectural methods.

AB  - Crop classification presents an enormous significance for agriculture management. Satellite remote sensing is considered as an advanced technology to obtain crop types at regional scale, since it can periodically provide large-scale observations of ground objects. This paper presents an agri-tech application based on blockchain technology, which uses the PrivateSky platform, an ecosystem being developed in accordance with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). PrivateSky is a research project built with non-proprietary technologies, which focuses on privacy at all levels of the blockchain ecosystem. The paper describes a pipeline for crop classification that is used in a complex commercial application. The pipeline starts from the streaming, storage, and analysis of multispectral images, afterwards continues with the definition of features based on vegetation indices, usage of machine learning techniques, and ends with the blockchain storage of data for privacy issues. The experiments have been performed on real data from fields in the southern part of Romania.

AB  - Floods are among the most common and destructive extreme weather events in the world. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are well-suited for monitoring flood events given their ability to operate in near all-weather and all-time conditions. We present a case study classifying imagery from both the commercial very high resolution (VHR) Capella Space X-band constellation and the public C-band Sentinel-1 mission. We use inferred flood extents from these disparate sources to investigate the progression of unprecedented inundation over Abbotsford, British Columbia in November - December 2021.

M3  - Article
AB  - This research studied correlation between suicide risks and chemical components of particulate matter in Thailand. It employed satellite data on atmospheric particulate matter. Analysis for correlation between data on chemical components of particulate matter-a type of accumulated pollution in Thailand from 2010 to 2017-and suicidal incidents in 2018. The methodologies consisted of Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model and the Poisson log-linear model, which referred to the NASA database; aerosol diagnostics model, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2); and database from the Bureau of Policy and Strategy Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. A total of 4,756 patients selected for this study accounted for annual suicide rate of 7.16 per 100,000 population. Suicides in Thailand are related to chemical components of particulate matter. This research thus found that every 1 mu g/m 3 increase of dust- PM2.5, only PM2.5 was related to the risks of suicide (which increased for approximately 63.5 %). Black carbon, Organic carbon, and sulfate, however, had no statistically significant effects. Volume of atmospheric accumulated dust- PM2.5 correlated to increase in suicide risks, with statistical significance. (C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Lee Chong-jun’s “The Story of a Worm” in 1985 does not include the contents of “The May 18.” The readers and the critics at the time, however, read the novel as a certain understanding of the May 18. The novel later received the public attention as it became known as the origin of Lee Chang-dong’s movie The Secret Sunshine (2007). However, much of the comparative study of the two works has been done without the relevance of the May 18. Studies discuss forgiveness and salvation, loss and mourning as the subject that two works have in common, but they pay no attention to the May 18. In particular, researches in the case of The Secret Sunshine have been limited to the analyses of the content of the movie, which means that the director’s consciousness as a writer is not dealt properly. This study argues that Lee Chang-dong has a guilty consciousness towards the May 18 as one of the representative novelists in the 80s, and this consciousness was finally turned into a work as the movie The Secret Sunshine.This paper argues that Lee Chang-dong writes an allegorical text about the perpetrator/victim of the May 18 with The Secret Sunshine. As for how Lee Chang-dong expresses his consciousness towards the May 18, I use two methodologies. First, I follow details outside the text. Tracking down Lee Chang-dong’s career as a novelist and film director, I show that Lee Chang-dong tried to give a hint to the audience that his movie was about the May 18, especially with the title of the movie and the release date. Second, I try to reconstruct the stories by analyzing the main events of “The Story of a Worm” and The Secret Sunshine in  order to show that they express a similar consciousness. In particular, I analyze these two texts through the narrative style of allegory.My analysis of the two texts are based on two allegory theories. One is Walter Benjamin’s theory. According to the theory, the last step that the reader understands the author’s intention completes the allegory. On the other hand, Paul de Man stresses that although it is the author who creates the allegory, how the meaning is conveyed to the reader is outside of the author’s hands. Regardless of which allegory theory we buy, I suggest that the analysis of the allegories of “The Story of a Worm” and The Secret Sunshine shows that both texts express the author’s consciousness that there can be no real reconciliation between the perpetrators and the victims without the victim’s side of forgiveness. According to this interpretation, The Secret Sunshine shows a deeper perspective on the community. Just as the May 18 community resisted the false state’s authority, the community formed by the two main characters of the movie represents a community resisting God who forces the false kind of forgiveness.My analysis of these allegories shares a certain point with Stanley Fish’s ‘interpretive communities.’ According to Fish, the communities have a consistent perspective, forming the worldview shared by the members of the community. The community in a sense keeps writing a text together. Lee Chang-dong shows the characteristics of an interpretive community which maintains a certain position on the May 18, interpreting “The Story of a Worm” in a certain way and writing his own text with the creation of The Secret Sunshine. The interpretive communities theory further provides us with an opportunity to accept the May 18 as an open text and an opportunity to create a new text for the May 18. Considering that there could be many different interpretive communities, what I am arguing in this paper may be a position of a different interpretive community from the one who shows the viewpoint of The Secret Sunshine and its extended text such as “The Story of a Worm.” However, I believe that this paper’s discussion can be an interpretation of the same interpretive community, revealing the hidden viewpoint of the text that Lee Chang-dong was writing.

AB  - In this study, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to mapping air temperature in Seoul. MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiomter (MODIS) data was used as auxiliary data for mapping. For the ANN network topology optimizing, scatterplots and statistical analysis were conducted, and input-data was classified and combined that highly correlated data which surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), time (satellite observation time, Day of year), location (latitude, hardness), and data quality (cloudness). When machine learning was conducted only with data with a high correlation with air temperature, the average values of correlation coefficient (r) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were 0.967 and 2.708℃. In addition, the performance improved as other data were added, and when all data were utilized the average values of r and RMSE were 0.9840 and 1.883℃, which showed the best performance. In the Seoul air temperature map by the ANN model, the air temperature was appropriately calculated for each pixels topographic characteristics, and it will be possible to analyze the air temperature distribution in city-level and national-level by expanding research areas and diversifying satellite data.

AB  - This thesis examines the dialectical relationship between ecological thinking and dystopian representation in Pyun Hye-young's novel. The author's novels, which have formed the main flow of modern Korean novels since the 1990s, have been summarized into so-called 'topography of catastrophe', 'imagination of the apocalypse', and 'apocalyptic worldview' through prior research, and the harmful effects of modern capitalism and inhumanity. It has been evaluated as a cynical criticism of anger.Pyun Hye-young completely betrays the cause of her familiar absurdity and readers who expected an ethical declaration to solve this problem. Rather, it exposes the eerie and terrifying present in a terrifyingly cold and dry manner. What she feared is not the result of infectious diseases or garbage, alienation or isolation, and subsequent death. The silent representation of the self-evident dystopian reality can be seen as a rejection of interpretations based on anthropocentric social ecology.Through ecological thinking based on anthropological materialism, Hyeyeong Pyun leaves no room for the logic that humans dominate nature like someone outside of nature, just as conquerors rule the conquered. She also makes us recognize that humans with flesh, blood and brain belong to nature and are in the midst of nature. Through this process, the artist regards the order of the capitalist system as a material condition and seeks the possibility of escape from its recognition.Although the critical attitude towards anthropocentric social ecology shown in Pyun Hye-young's novel seems rather banal, it allows us to confirm the path of ecological thinking based on the materialistic relationship between humans and nature, and between humans and humans. Her novels require fundamental reflection on the relationships between humans and labor, humans and nature, and humans and civilizations, and when the abstraction of relationships that can be realized through exchange values ​​is extreme, labor, nature and civilization as concrete metabolic processes It warns that the ecological balance and circulation of

AB  - This study philosophically explores the principles of how schools should interact with society to play their essential role as a space for nurturing democratic citizens by analyzing the various transformations affecting society. Although the world is undergoing significant change caused by COVID-19, it is worth paying attention to the transformations that have had a far more lasting and comprehensive impact on our lives. “globalization”, “ecologicalization”, and “digitalization”, which have required a fundamental change in the traditional role of schools. Dewey's “Principle of school environment composition” was analyzed as a base for deriving the principle of interaction between school and society; furthermore, by linking Dewey's “simplification”, “purification”, and “balancing” with the current transformations and the concepts appearing in his later works, I recontextualized it as “principle of interactive change seeking” and “purification as the beginning of an integrative reconstruction”, and “balancing as an ecological worldview restoration”. This study underlines the importance of restoring the function of the school as a “space of integrated connection” in the process of interaction with society.

T2  - HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Yuzu (Citrus junos Sieb. Ex Tanaka) is one of the most important Citrus species in China, Japan, and Korea. Yuzu is assumed to be a natural hybrid. However, concrete evidence supporting its hybrid origin has not been reported yet. To identify putative maternal species, the nucleotide sequences of five hypervariable regions covering 17,531 bp in citrus chloroplast genomes were obtained from yuzu. A phylogenetic tree based on these sequences showed that yuzu was most closely related to Ichang papeda (C. cavaleriei), suggesting that Ichang papeda might be a seed parent of yuzu. To identify paternal species, yuzu homologs of 103 single-copy genes found among citrus genomes were identified from a yuzu transcriptome that was de novo assembled using RNA-seq reads. Eighty homologous genes were identified from the yuzu transcriptome. A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequence variations in 80 single-copy genes of yuzu and other Citrus species showed that yuzu was most closely related to mandarin. To assess hybrid origins of 80 single-copy genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among yuzu, Ichang papeda, mandarin, citron, and pummelo were analyzed, and yuzu SNP genotypes were identified by visual investigation of alignments of RNA-seq reads. Forty-three out of 80 genes were assumed to originate from hybrids between Ichang papeda and mandarin. Taken together, results of this study indicate that Ichang papeda and mandarin might be the parental species of yuzu.

AB  - As the threat of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, forest fires, and landslides increases due to climate change, social demand for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), is also increasing. However, the domestic environment has a high proportion of mountainous topography, making it challenging to retrieve soil moisture from SAR data. This study evaluated the usability of Sentinel-1 SAR, which is applied with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique, to retrieve soil moisture. It was confirmed that the backscattering coefficient obtained from Sentinel-1 significantly correlated with soil moisture behavior, and the possibility of stand-alone use to correct vegetation effects without using auxiliary data observed from other satellites or observatories. However, there was a large difference in the characteristics of each site and topographic group. In particular, when the model learned on the mountain and at flat land cross-applied, the soil moisture could not be properly simulated. In addition, when the number of learning points was increased to solve this problem, the soil moisture retrieval model was smoothed. As a result, the overall correlation coefficient of all sites improved, but errors at individual sites gradually increased. Therefore, systematic research must be conducted in order to widely apply high-resolution SAR soil moisture data. It is expected that it can be effectively used in various fields if the scope of learning sites and application targets are specifically limited.

AB  - This essay explores how Louise Erdrich’s The Painted Drum represents the Anishinaabe worldview of “the good life” (mino-bimaadiziwin) and its significance for the Ojibwes’ survival as it focuses on the eponymous drum as a non-human thing and its interrelations with other people who suffer losses all on their own. The essay argues that The Painted Drum envisions the Ojibwes’ recovery from their personal and communal losses through their awakening to the idea of “connection” within Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin: the connection between humans and non-humans, death and life, destruction and creation, transcendence and immanence. Reifying such diverse connections, the novel invites the reader to acknowledge the conception of the relational world and the necessity of respecting all animate and inanimate beings.

AB  - This study discusses the necessity of an ecological approach to environmental issues based on the essential concepts of 'symetrique' and 'translation' in Bruno Latour's symmetrical anthropology and develops soundscape program as a way to practice them in art education. To this end, the concept of soundscape is decribed and the works of soundscape are analyzed. Soundscape, based on ecological worldview, provides synesthetic and aesthetic experiences by collecting and analyzing sounds through technology convergence to enable new perceptions of the environment. The art education program using soundscape provides an opportunity to react sensitively to changes in the environment and to empathize with the environment as an actor through the process of visualizing and reconstructing sound as well as recognizing the relationship with the environment through sound exploration, provides an opportunity for actors to react sensitively to and empathize with changes in the environment, helping to form ecological sensitivity.

T2  - SOCIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM; usually defined in opposition to biomedicine or orthodox medicine) is use by part of the population (the percentage differs from country to country) exclusively or, more often, in addition to biomedical procedures. The causes of using alternative medicine may vary - from disappointment in biomedicine to preference of alternative medicine as a part of an alternative worldview philosophy in a broader context (Taves et al. 2018). Building on previous knowledge about the use of CAM, the authors address issues of the perception of CAM practices, ways of evaluating their effectiveness, and the role of creation of narrative about the faced problem as the part of coping with the given situation. The study is based on qualitative data from Slovakia.

TI  - Exploiting Temporal Data Diversity for Detecting Safety-critical Faults in AV Compute Systems

AB  - Silent data corruption caused by random hardware faults in autonomous vehicle (AV) computational elements is a significant threat to vehicle safety. Previous research has explored design diversity, data diversity, and duplication techniques to detect such faults in other safety-critical domains. However, these are challenging to use for AVs in practice due to significant resource overhead and design complexity. We propose, DiverseAV, a low-cost data-diversity-based redundancy technique for detecting safety-critical random hardware faults in computational elements. DiverseAV introduces data-diversity between the redundant agents by exploiting the temporal semantic consistency available in the AV sensor data. DiverseAV is a black-box technique that offers a plug-and-play solution as it requires no knowledge of the internals of the AI agent responsible for executing driving decisions, requiring little to no modification to the agent itself for achieving high coverage of transient and permanent hardware faults. It is commercially viable because it avoids software modifications to agents that are costly in terms of development and testing time. Specifically, DiverseAV distributes the sensor data between the two software agents in a round-robin manner. As a result, the sensor data for two consecutive time steps are semantically similar in terms of their worldview but significantly different at the bit level, thus ensuring the state and data diversity between the two agents necessary for detecting faults. We demonstrate DiverseAV using an open-source self-driving AI agent which is controlling a car in an open-source world simulator.

TI  - Influence of atmospheric modeling on spectral target detection through forward modeling approach in multi-platform remote sensing data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying objects or pixels of interest that are few in numbers and sparsely populated in imagery is referred to as target detection. Traditionally, the inverse modeling (IM) approach, usually a slow and computationally intensive process, is used for detecting targets using surface reflectance spectra. For the emerging online methods in remote sensing, modeling the at-sensor radiance of target material, i.e., a forward modeling (FM) approach, can be used. Compared to the IM approach, FM is better suited to online methods due to its potential for adaptation to regional atmospheric modeling. Spectral knowledge transfer of a target from a known to an unknown atmospheric condition is the primary outcome of an efficient target detection framework. However, such an endeavor requires an exhaustive assessment of the target detection process under different atmospheric models and associated uncertainties. The objective of this work is to assess the quantitative impact of atmospheric parameters on the detectability of engineered targets. Specifically, the impact of critical atmospheric parameters such as aerosol optical thickness (AOT), standard atmospheric profiles, and aerosol models are considered. For this effect, we designed a multi-platform image acquisition setup that acquired targets concurrently using a ground-based terrestrial hyperspectral imager (THI), an airborne hyperspectral imager (AVIRISNG), and a space-borne multispectral imager (Sentinel-2). We used a point-based spectroradiometer and pixel based THI to collect the in-situ reference target reflectance spectra and generated a radiance spectral library by simulating TOA radiance spectra using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. We have considered two cases of target radiance simulations, i.e., (i) corresponding to a grid of different AOT values for a predefined atmospheric and aerosol profile, and (ii) corresponding to varying combinations of atmospheric and aerosol profiles at a given AOT. The detection has been carried out using multiple target detection algorithms. Results indicate that the spectral knowledge-based targets can be detected in remote sensing data under different atmospheric model scenarios using the FM approach. A detection rate of about 75% and 50% have been consistently obtained for remote sensing data from airborne and space-borne platforms with a false alarm (FA) rate of 10(-2) to 10(-3) respectively. Change in the AOT across atmospheric models has resulted in decision-changing implications in the target detection modeling. The selection of the wrong atmospheric profile can potentially aggravate the number of FAs produced by a particular detection algorithm.

TI  - Crop Yield Estimation at Field Scales by Assimilating Time Series of Sentinel-2 Data Into a Modified CASA-WOFOST Coupled Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapidly and accurately estimating yields at field scales are very significant. Each type of currently yield estimation model has been well studied, yet all of them have certain limitations. Based on a coupled Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA)-World Food Studies (WOFOST) model and time series Sentinel-2 imagery, we achieved daily crop simulations and crop yield estimations at two adjacent farms in China. The results indicated that the coupled model inherited the high computing speed of light use efficiency (LUE) models and the mechanistic advantages of crop growth models. The of yield simulation was 0.64 for the CASA model, 0.84 for the coupled model, and 0.86 for the WOFOST model, and the root mean square error (RMSE) values were 948.32, 792.11, and 623.64 kg/ha, respectively. The operating times of the CASA model, CASA-WOFOST coupled model, and WOFOST model over the growing season of wheat were 37 min, 48 min, and 1 day 5 h 7 min, respectively. Compared with the WOFOST model, the coupled model provided a much faster running speed in yield simulations and a similar accuracy; therefore, the proposed model can be applied for assessments at large farms with high-spatial-resolution images to obtain accurate yield simulations. Compared with the CASA model, the coupled model provided higher simulation accuracy in mountainous areas and regions of uneven terrain. It can be concluded that the proposed coupled CASA-WOFOST model can improve the precision, reliability, and stability of crop yield estimation; provide theoretical support for crop yield estimation at field scales; and promote the development of precision agriculture.

TI  - Temporal Greenness Trends in Stable Natural Land Cover and Relationships with Climatic Variability across the Conterminous United States
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of temporal trends in vegetation greenness and related influences aids understanding of recent changes in terrestrial ecosystems and feedbacks from weather, climate, and environment. We analyzed 1-km normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data (1989-2016) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and developed growing-season time-integrated NDVI (GS-TIN) for estimating seasonal vegetation activity across stable natural land cover in the conterminous United States (CONUS). After removing areas from analysis that had experienced land-cover conversion or modification, we conducted a monotonic trend analysis on the GS-TIN time series and found that significant positive temporal trends occurred over 35% of the area, whereas significant negative trends were observed over only 3.5%. Positive trends were prevalent in the forested lands of the eastern one-third of CONUS and far northwest, as well as in grasslands in the north-central plains. We observed negative and nonsignificant trends mainly in the shrublands and grasslands across the northwest, southwest, and west-central plains. To understand the relationship of climate variability with these temporal trends, we conducted partial and multiple correlation analyses on GS-TIN, growing-season temperature, and water-year precipitation time series. The GS-TIN trends in northern forests were positively correlated with temperature. The GS-TIN trends in the central and western shrublands and grasslands were negatively correlated with temperature and positively correlated with precipitation. Our results revealed spatial patterns in vegetation greenness trends for different stable natural vegetation types across CONUS, enhancing understanding gained from prior studies that were based on coarser 8-km AVHRR data. Significance StatementAssessing vegetation trends, cycles, and related influences is important for understanding the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to climatic and environmental changes. We analyzed vegetation greenness trends (1989-2016) for stable natural land cover across the conterminous United States, based on vegetation index time series derived from coarse-resolution optical satellite sensors. We found greening trends in the forests of the east and far northwest and the grasslands of the northern central plains that correlated with increasing temperature in the regions. We observed browning and no trends mainly in the shrublands and grasslands across the northwest, southwest, and western central plains, associated with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. Future research should focus on vegetation greenness analysis using finer-resolution satellite data.

TI  - Measuring Ionospheric Scintillation Parameters From SAR Images Using Phase Gradient Autofocus: A Case Study
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spaceborne low-frequency (L-band and below) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is very susceptible to ionospheric scintillation. The scintillation phase error (SPE) is a vital factor that brings about the azimuth decorrelation and leads to the imaging degradation. In this article, a methodology is described, which exploits the accurate SPE estimation to measure scintillation parameters from SAR images. First, the phase gradient autofocus (PGA) is applied to achieve the believable SPE estimate from the local area that contains a strong scatterer. Second, based on the estimated staggered index of two SPE estimates, the irregularity altitude can be derived by solving an established equation using an iteration process. Third, three parameters, including the spectrum index, the outer scale, and the integrated turbulence strength, can be fitted when the theoretical spectrum expression mostly approximates the derived spectrum. The methodology is validated on an ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 spotlight data, and its azimuth imaging was seriously degraded by ionospheric scintillation. Two existent corner reflectors ensure the accuracy of SPE estimates from PGA. The measurement results indicate that the local ionospheric irregularities are extremely turbulent and located at a lower altitude of about 220 km in the F2-layer.

AB  - As European-centered ideological currents have led the culture and literature for a long time, denigration, value obliteration, and distortion of the entire culture and literature of the African colonial society have occurred. Therefore, judging that restoration of the value of the African oral tradition means restoration of the fundamental values ​​of mankind. This paper reveals the value of the oral story, a trace of African history and literature that retains the original form of human origin, and what in this way, it was studied whether it was reinterpreted, reborn, and restored in modern times. This study attempted to reveal that the presence or absence of letters and 'ecriture' cannot determine the value of a culture. ‘Anansi’ was chosen as an example for this study. ‘Anansi’ showed the traces and influences of cross-cultural exchanges and examples of modern rebirth. As traces of exchange, the influence between African - Egyptian - Levant -Crete - Greek cultures was noted, and the work of Gerald McDermott consisting of fairy tale illustrations was presented as an example of modern rebirth. Michel Ocelot‘s work was introduced as a work that restores the contemporary values and artistry of the African oral tradition and expands the artist’s imagination and worldview. The work confirmed that contemporary works are reviving characteristics, such as continuity, extensibility, and expansiveness of African oral traditions.

TI  - Multitask Deep Learning Framework for Spatiotemporal Fusion of NDVI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series are indispensable for monitoring land surfaces dynamics in spatiotemporally heterogeneous areas. Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is one of the most common methods used for producing such data. These methods require the use of one or two pairs of fine images (with fine spatial but rough temporal resolution, such as Landsat images) and coarse images [with fine temporal but rough spatial resolution, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)]. A coarse image at the prediction date is also required to predict the corresponding missing fine image in the time series. Recently, the proposed deep learning (DL)-based STF methods have achieved promising fusion performance but are challenged in areas with frequent cloud contamination and landcover change prediction, while they also suffer from unstable fusion performance. Moreover, current STF methods lack a quality assessment process for the fusion results. To address these limitations, in this article, we propose a multitask DL framework for STF of NDVI time series, which integrates two types of DL-based STF methods. Four experiments in two study sites were conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results indicate that it achieves accurate and stable fusion capable of predicting landcover changes even when image pairs obtained at long intervals are used. In addition, a fusion uncertainty estimation method is proposed, which has the potential to be used as a quality assessment metric.

M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate acquisition of crop planting area information allows for agricultural management departments to understand crop production information promptly. Concurrently, support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are unable to determine parameter combinations in remote sensing image crop classification to obtain optimal classification results. To solve this issue, this paper proposes an SVM that is optimized by the adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization algorithm. To test the algorithm, we undertook an experiment in Acheng District, Harbin City, Heilongjiang province, China, using Gaofen 1/wide-field-view satellite images to construct a time series for various vegetation indices. The SVM model with optimized parameters was compared with a traditional backpropagation neural network, a decision tree, and an SVM without parameter optimization. The experimental results verified that the improved SVM model obtained the highest classification accuracy.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Scenic resources can serve as symbols of a region's natural resources and culture and are often the stimulus for the development of national parks. Thus, careful scientific planning and effective management based on the identification and evaluation of scenic resources are key for the sustainable development of national parks. In this study, one object-oriented and three pixel-based (maximum likelihood classification, neural network, and support vector machine) classification methods were applied to identify scenic resources in Yesanpo National Park using high-resolution Gaofen-2 images. The classification accuracy of these scenic resources was evaluated through systematic sampling, which improved the objectivity and accuracy of the classification precision evaluation. All methods met the precision requirements of scenic resource identification, and the accuracy of object-oriented classification was the highest. The application scope of the different methods varies, and suitability can be determined according to the needs of scenic resource recognition. Collectively, this study has proposed an effective and practical method for the identification of scenic resources within Yesanpo National Park, which is of significance for its future planning and management. Moreover, this strategy can be applied by other national park planners to select areas for tourism development, formulate sustainable development strategies, and provide technical support and decision-making guidance for national park planning and management.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most popular cancer for women. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is significant for breast cancer treatment. Currently, SLN localization is normally based on visual observation and fluorescence imaging with low resolution due to the strong light scattering. In this study, an integrated Photoacoustic Pen (PAPen) is designed for SLN detection during breast cancer surgery. The PAPen is based on photoacoustic sensing with deeper penetration, which assists the surgeons to detect the SLN fast and accurately. The PAPen combines the ultrasound transducer for photoacoustic (PA) wave detection and the optical fiber for laser illumination. By scanning the detection target with PAPen, the PA signal of the contrast agent in the SLN by lymph drainage can be captured, which implicated the position of SLN for surgeons. The PAPen detects the PA signal update at 10 Hz and the detection depth is up to 50 mm, which can satisfy most breast cancer treatments. Both phantom and in-vivo studies are demonstrated in this work. The PAPen with enhanced flexibility and sensitivity will have great potential for SLN detection during breast cancer surgery.

The results indicate that the on-orbit radiometric calibrations in FY-3D MERSI-2 channels 23, 24, and 25 are slightly biased and certain variations exist between January and July 2020. In January 2020, the on-orbit calibration of MERSI-2 channel 23 is statistically consistent with that of AHI channel 11, and the calibration bias (mean f standard deviation at the mean) is 0.04 +/- 0.27 K, whereas they are 0.11 +/- 0.49 K and - 0.30 +/- 0.50 K in MERSI-2 channels 24 and 25, respectively. In July 2020, the on-orbit calibration of MERSI-2 channel 25 is very consistent with that of the AHI channels with a calibration bias of 0.06 +/- 0.31 K, while they are -0.18 +/- 0.23 K and - 0.27 +/- 030 K in MERSI-2 channels 23 and 24, respectively. The radiometric calibration biases are finally corrected by the linear fits on the matching observations.

TI  - Monitoring the Reduced Resilience of Forests in Southwest China Using Long-Term Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in the frequency and severity of droughts associated with global warming has resulted in deleterious impacts on forest productivity in Southwest China. Despite attempts to explore the response of vegetation to drought, less is known about forest's resilience in response to drought in Southwest China. Here, the reduced resilience of the forest was found based on remotely sensed optical and microwave vegetation products. The spatial distribution and temporal variation of resilience-reduced forest were assessed using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and vegetation optical depth (VOD). Our findings showed that 40-50% of the forest appeared to have abnormally low resilience approximately 6 months after the severe drought. The spatial distributions of abnormally low resilience had a good agreement with the regions affected by the 2009-2011 drought events. In particular, our results indicated that areas of afforestation were more susceptible to drought than natural forest, maybe due to the different water uptake strategy of the diverse root systems. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of afforestation areas to climate change, and recommend giving more attention to soil water availability.

TI  - Evaluation of Coastal Altimeter Wave Height Observations Using Dynamic Collocation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of altimeters' retracking algorithms, the signal-to-noise ratio of altimeter data in coastal regions has been improved significantly in recent years. However, due to the complexity of coastal waves, the traditional satellite-buoy/satellite-satellite collocation method using a spatial-temporal window, which is widely used in the evaluation of significant wave height (SWH) measurements of altimeters in the open ocean, is not reliable because coastal waves can vary significantly even in a small window. This makes it difficult to quantitatively evaluate the errors of altimeter coastal SWH observations. This study proposes an automated dynamic collocation method to solve this problem. The method combines SWH from coastal buoy observations and numerical wave model (NWM) outputs to generate an SWH reference field. The coastal altimeter observations can then be compared with this reference dataset. To test the effectiveness of the method, the SWH data from Sentinel-3A (S3A) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode in the coastal region of southwest England were evaluated. The results indicate that the coastal SWHs from the S3A SAR mode is good quality with an overall root mean square error of about 0.3 m when the offshore distance is more than 10 km. The results also show that the presented method works better than previous methods for the evaluation of coastal altimeter SWH observations. This method can be applied in future studies to evaluate and improve the performance of other coastal remotely sensed SWH observations.

TI  - MACA: A Relative Radiometric Correction Method for Multiflight Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Images Based on Concurrent Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers an unprecedented observing potential with ultrahigh spatial and temporal resolutions and high flexibility. However, it remains difficult to solve the radiometric inconsistency of multiflight UAV imagery. This study proposed a relative radiometric correction method for multiflight UAV images based on concurrent satellite imagery (MACA) consisting of two steps, i.e., cross-sensor spectral fitting (CSF) and fine-resolution spectral calibration (FSC). In CSF, relationships of multiflight UAV reflectance and the concurrent satellite reflectance were established for generating the fine-resolution reference imagery. Subsequently, a relative radiometric correction model was constructed in the FSC step to correct multiflight UAV imagery. The performance of MACA was evaluated using multiflight UAV datasets acquired on six cropland sites and a concurrent Sentinel-2 image. Compared with four typical or state-of-the-art relative correction methods, the correction using MACA yielded better consistency between UAV and Sentinel-2 data, regardless of individual spectral bands (R-2 = 0.79-0.86, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.004-0.019) or vegetation indices (VIs) (R-2 = 0.80-0.86, RMSE = 0.024-0.054). Moreover, the prediction of plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) based on the MACA-corrected UAV data had the highest accuracy and showed the spatial variation most significantly within and between fields for all sites. The results demonstrated that MACA was more robust in reducing spectral mismatch across sensors and eliminating the subjective error of pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) selection. MACA has the potential to be used to cross-calibrate multisensor data into a consistent standard, which will benefit multisensor synergies.

AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is an important factor in determining ecosystem quality and carbon sink. It reflects the productive capacity and ecological process of vegetation community, and is of great significance to adjust the global carbon balance and enhance the ecological service function. Using soil respiration model and improved CASA model, combined with MODIS and meteorological data, the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of vegetation in Qinghai since 2000 was estimated, the spatial and temporal distribution of vegetation NEP and carbon sink, the influences of precipitation and air temperature on vegetation NEP were analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, global warming has become a hot topic since the 20th century. In this study, the timing of snow-melt is taken as an important factor to study the impact on carbon source/sink of ecosystem in Qinghai province.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) downscaling aims to solve the coarse resolution problem of passive microwave SM products. On the basis of SMAP SM products and related MODIS products, this study develops a deep residual cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) based heterogeneous spatial-spectral fusion method to downscale SMAP SM from 36km to 9km. On the one hand, the proposed method creatively regards the MODIS products that can reflect the SM state as the spectral features of SM in a broad sense and performs the heterogeneous spatial-spectral fusion between the low-resolution (LR) SM product and high-resolution (HR) MODIS products. On the other hand, considering the spatial correlation of SM, the proposed method utilizes a deep residual cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to extract and fuse features of heterogeneous images through convolutions. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of experimental results shows that the proposed method can generate high accuracy SM products.

TI  - Deep-Learning-Based Spatio-Temporal-Spectral Integrated Fusion of Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a challenging task to integrate the spatial, temporal, and spectral information of multisource remote sensing images, especially in the case of heterogeneous images. To this end, for the first time, this article proposes a heterogeneous integrated framework based on a novel deep residual cycle generative adversarial network (GAN). The proposed network consists of a forward fusion part and a backward degeneration feedback part. The forward part generates the desired fusion result from the various observations; the backward degeneration feedback part considers the imaging degradation process and regenerates the observations inversely from the fusion result. The heterogeneous integrated fusion framework supported by the proposed network can simultaneously merge the complementary spatial, temporal, and spectral information of multisource heterogeneous observations to achieve heterogeneous spatiospectral fusion, spatiotemporal fusion, and heterogeneous spatiotemporal-spectral fusion. Furthermore, the proposed heterogeneous integrated fusion framework can be leveraged to relieve the two bottlenecks of land-cover change and thick cloud cover. Thus, the inapparent and unobserved variation trends of surface features, which are caused by the low-resolution imaging and cloud contamination, can be detected and reconstructed well. Images from many different remote sensing satellites, i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2, were utilized in the experiments conducted in this study, and both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed image fusion method.

TI  - Kinematic Behavior Analysis of the Wadi Landslide From Time-Series Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of kinematic characteristics and triggering factors of the potentially unstable slopes is of great significance for the slope protection and landslide reinforcing. Located in Mao Country, Sichuan Province in China, Wadi village is a typical mountainous area where geological disasters frequently occur due to the complex geological environment, intense tectonic activities, and concentrated seasonal rainfall. However, the slope stability and potential risk over this area are not fully evaluated yet. In this article, we investigate the unstable slope in Wadi village using time-series synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique. The deformation history retrieved from 132 C-band descending Sentinel-1 images between October 2014 and September 2019 demonstrates that the Wadi landslide presents a slow sliding trend with the averaged line-of-sight velocity of -70 mm/year and has a distinct seasonal velocity at the head and toe area. We further decompose the predominant and periodic velocities by a kinematic model to analyses spatial and temporal characteristics of Wadi landslide. The results reveal that the Wadi landslide is a hybrid type of push and pull with two source areas in the head and toe of the slope, respectively. The periodic velocity variations are highly correlated with seasonal rainfall. Our study also demonstrates the importance of correcting InSAR unwrapping error for interpreting the landslide kinematics and other small-scale geomorphological processes.

TI  - Sea-Ice Mapping of RADARSAT-2 Imagery by Integrating Spatial Contexture With Textural Features
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping different types of sea ice that form, grow, and melt in polar oceans is essential for shipping navigation, climate change modeling, and local community safety. Currently, ice charts are manually generated by analysts at the Canadian Ice Service based on dual-polarized RADARSAT-2/RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery on a daily basis. Inspired by the demand for a computer-based mapping system, we have developed an automatic sea-ice classification method that integrates spatial contexture (unsupervised segmentation) with textural features (supervised pixel-level labeling). First, the full-scene image is oversegmented, and the segments are merged into homogeneous regions across the entire scene. Second, pixel-based classifiers (support vector machine and random forest) are compared for their ability to label the generated homogeneous regions. Finally, the segmentation and labeling are combined using a proposed energy function. The proposed method was tested on 18 dual-polarization RADARSAT-2 scenes acquired over the Beaufort Sea. This dataset contains water, young ice, first-year ice, and multiyear ice covering melt, summer, and freeze-up seasons. The proposed method obtains an average classification accuracy of 86.33% based on the leave-one-out validation. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves promising classification results in both the quantity and quality measurements compared with benchmark methods. The robustness against incidence angle variance indicates that the proposed method is well qualified for operational sea-ice mapping.

TI  - Associations Among Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, Thrombocytopenia Cytokines/Chemokines and Genetic Polymorphisms of Toll-Like Receptor 2/4 in Chinese Patients with Sepsis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives(s): Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on platelets have been extensively studied. Both TLR2 and TLR4 have been shown to augment platelet activation and alter its function from a hemostatic regulator to an immune sentinel. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between genetic polymorphisms in TLR2, TLR4 and platelets. We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms of TLR2 and TLR4 were related to thrombocytopenia and coagulation failure in Chinese patients with sepsis. Basic Methods: Adult Chinese patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit of a university medical center were monitored for up to 28 days. Thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), diagnosed using Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) criteria, were observed as the primary outcomes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR2 (rs111200466, rs5743708) and TLR4 (rs11536889, rs145801336, rs11536896, rs7869402) in patients with sepsis were detected by polymerase chain reaction. The data were analyzed using chi-square and rank sum tests. Results: The genotype of TLR2 (rs111200466) (Del/Del) was associated with the initial DIC. The genotype of TLR4 (rs11536889) (C/C&C/G) was associated with initial DIC, DIC onset during hospitalization and platelet counts. Furthermore, both DIC and platelet counts were associated with cytokines and chemokines, especially the IL10. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that in Chinese sepsis patients, the rs111200466 SNP in TLR2 and rs11536889 SNP in TLR4 are associated with thrombocytopenia and DIC, with potential effects on the TLR4 pathways of platelets.

TI  - Landsat Observations of Two Decades of Wetland Changes in the Estuary of Poyang Lake during 2000-2019
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The stability of wetlands is threatened by the combined effects of global climate change and human activity. In particular, the vegetation cover status of lake wetlands has changed. Here, the change in vegetation cover at the estuary of Poyang Lake was monitored, and its influencing factors are studied to elucidate the dynamic change characteristics of vegetation at the inlet of this lake. Flood and water level changes are two of the main factors affecting the evolution of wetland vegetation at the estuary of Poyang Lake. Therefore, Landsat data from 2000 to 2019 were used to study the spatial and temporal variation in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the vegetation cover area. Theil-Sen Median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall tests were used to study the long-term trend characteristics of NDVI. The response between NDVI and the explanatory variables at the estuary of Poyang Lake was quantified using regression tree analysis to study the regional climate, water level, and flood inundation duration. Results showed the following: (1) Vegetation in a large area of the study area improved significantly from 2000 to 2010 and only slightly from 2010 to 2019, and few areas with slight degradation of vegetation were found. In most of these areas, the vegetation from 2000 to 2010 exhibited a gradual change, from nothing to something, which started around 2004; (2) The main variable that separated the NDVI values was the mean water level in October. When the mean October water level was greater than 14.467 m, the study area was still flooded in October. Thus, the regional value of BestNDVI was approximately 0.3, indicating poor vegetation growth. When the mean water level in October was less than 14.467 m, the elevation of the study area was higher than the water level value, and after the water receded in October, the wetland vegetation exhibited autumn growth in that year. Thus, the vegetation in the study area grew more abundantly. These results could help manage and protect the degraded wetland ecology.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Salinization by Machine Learning Algorithms in Different Arid Regions of Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral data has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its high accuracy in monitoring soil salinization. At present, most existing research focuses on the saline soil in a single area without comparative analysis between regions. The regional differences in the hyperspectral characteristics of saline soil are still unclear. Thus, we chose Golmud in the cold-dry Qaidam Basin (QB-G) and Gaotai-Minghua in the relatively warm-dry Hexi Corridor (HC-GM) as the study areas, and used the deep extreme learning machine (DELM) and sine cosine algorithm-Elman (SCA-Elman) to predict soil salinity, and then selected the most suitable algorithm in these two regions. A total of 79 (QB-G) and 86 (HC-GM) soil samples were collected and tested to obtain their electrical conductivity (EC) and corresponding hyperspectral reflectance (R). We utilized the land surface parameters that affect the soil based on Landsat 8 and digital elevation model (DEM) data, selected the variables using the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and built SCA-Elman and DELM from the hyperspectral reflectance data combined with land surface parameters. The results revealed the following: (1) The soil hyperspectral reflectance in QB-G was higher than that in HC-GM. The soils of QB-G are mainly the chloride type and those of HC-GM mainly belong to the sulfate type, having lower reflectance. (2) The accuracies of some of the SCA-Elman and DELM models in QB-G (the highest MAEv, RMSEv, and R-v(2) were 0.09, 0.12 and 0.75, respectively) were higher than those in HC-GM (the highest MAEv, RMSEv, and R-v(2) were 0.10, 0.14 and 0.73, respectively), which has flatter terrain and less obvious surface changes. The surface parameters in QB-G had higher correlation coefficients with EC due to the regular altitude change and cold-dry climate. (3) Most of the SCA-Elman results (the mean R-v(2) in HC-GM and QB-G were 0.62 and 0.60, respectively) in all areas performed better than the DELM results (the mean R-v(2) in HC-GM and QB-G were 0.51 and 0.49, respectively). Therefore, SCA-Elman was more suitable for the soil salinity prediction in HC-GM and QB-G. This can provide a reference for soil salinization monitoring and model selection in the future.

TI  - Unmixing-Based Spatiotemporal Image Fusion Accounting for Complex Land Cover Changes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal reflectance fusion has received considerable attention in recent decades. However, various challenges remain despite varying levels of success, especially regarding the recovery of spatial details with complex land cover changes. Taking the blending of Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images as an example, this article presents a locally weighted unmixing-based spatiotemporal image fusion model (LWU-STFM) that focuses on recovering complex land cover changes. The core idea is to redefine the land use class of each pixel featuring land cover change at the prediction date. The spatial unmixing process is enhanced using a proposed geographically spectrum-weighted regression (GSWR), and then, we optimize similar neighboring pixels for the final weighted-based prediction. Experiments are conducted using semisimulated and actual time-series Landsat-MODIS datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed LWU-STFM compared with the classic spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), two enhanced FSDAF models (SFSDAF and FSDAF 2.0), and a virtual image pair-based spatiotemporal fusion model for spatial weighting (VIPSTF-SW). The results reveal that the proposed LWU-STFM outperforms the other five models with the best quantitative accuracy. In terms of the relative dimensionless global error (ERGAS) index, the errors of Landsat-like images generated using LWU-STFM are 2.8%-63.4% lower than those of other models. From visual comparisons, LWU-STFM predictions illustrate encouraging improvements in recovering spatial details of pixels with complex land cover changes in heterogeneous landscapes and, thus, advancing applications of spatiotemporal image fusion for continuous and fine-scale land surface monitoring.

AB  - The accuracy of SST derived from passive-microwave (AMSR2, GMI, and WindSat) and infrared (AVHRR, MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua and VIIRS) radiometers in Southeast Asia and its adjacent seas is evaluated using Argo observations. The results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the differences between SST from passive-microwave radiometers (AMSR2, GMI, and WindSat) and Argo SST are 0.46 degrees C, 0.42 degrees C, and 0.50 degrees C, respectively. The RMSEs of the SST differences between infrared radiometers (VIIRS, AVHRR, MODIS onboard Aqua and Terra) and Argo buoy are 0.54., 0.63 degrees C, 0.65 degrees C, and 0.64 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the spatial coverage of the satellite SST products in Southeast Asia and its adjacent waters is calculated. The daily coverage of AMSR2 SST ranges from 44.51% to 66.74%, with annual average coverage of 56.8%. The yearly average coverage of MODIS onboard Aqua and Terra and VIIRS SST are 21.79%, 22.91%, and 20.67%, respectively.

TI  - Vegetation Phenological Change and Its Response to Climate Change in Qinghai Province
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the response of grassland vegetation phenology to climate change is the key to understand the history of regional land ecosystem productivity and the mechanism of future change. Based on MODIS NDVI data, grassland type data and ground measurement data, combined with en trend analysis and partial correlation analysis, the temporal and spatial characteristics, trends, stability of changes and their variation characteristics with climate factors of grassland vegetation phenology 2001-2020 were studied. The results show that : (1) with the increase of altitude, the start of growing season (SOS) , end of growing season ( EOS) and length of growing season (LOS) changed irregularly. (2) SOS was concentrated in mid April to late May (110-150 d) , and 79. 32% of the area showed a significant advance trend, with a rate of 0-1. 5 d . y(-1), the SOS of mountain meadow < temperate grassland, shrub grass and desert < alpine < alpine grassland. EOS concentrated in mid September to mid October (260-290 d) , show a delayed trend. The LOA lasted for 130-180 d, show a prolonged trend. (3) The decrease of annual precipitation, the increase of spring temperature, the increase of extreme climate index of temperature and the decrease of maximum 5 d rainfall will lead to the advance of grassland SOS. The increase of annual average temperature, maximum 1 d rainfall, summer and winter temperature, and the decrease of autumn temperature made trend of grassland SOS. (4) The increase of annual precipitation, daily maximum temperature and autumn temperature delay the grassland EOS, while the increase of annual average temperature lead to the advance of grassland EOS. The above results can provide a new understanding of the influencing factors of grassland phenology in Qinghai Province, and also provide a reference for grassland to adapt to future climate change and grassland breeding.

TI  - Study on Spatial Coupling Seasonal Differentiation of Vegetation Coverage and Land Surface Temperature in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation coverage (VC) are important indicators of global eco-environmental changes. The spatial coupling seasonal differentiation of LST and VC can provide theoretical support for eco-environmental research. Based on MODIS images, this study used ArcGIS, MRT and GeoDa softwares to analyze variations in vegetation coverage and land surface temperature, and to explore the spatial coupling seasonal differentiation in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The results show that the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of VC and LST in the Three Gorges Reservoir area are different. From the perspective of spatial distribution, the high value areas of LST are concentrat. ed in the tail area of the reservoir, and the low value areas are distributed in the steep slope areas in the north and middle south of the reservoir. Compared with LST, VC showed the opposite distribution trend. Through the univariate linear regres. sion and spatial autocorrelation analysis, VC and LST showed negative correlation in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, and the correlation between them is different among the four seasons. The significance of negative correlation between VC and LST in summer, spring, winter and autumn decreases in turn. The overall coupling effect of VC and LST in the Three Gorges Reservoir area is excellent. The coupling effect of seasonal change in the Three Gorges Reservoir area is in the order of autumn.winter > winter-spring > summer-autumn > spring.summer. Among the four seasons, the coupling degree within [0.8,1] had the largest proportion of LST lag grid, followed by the synchronous type of VC and LST, and the proportion of VC lag grid was the smallest. The research results can further help to understand the changes of ecological environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, and can also provide a theoretical basis for the implementation of better ecological en. vironment construction and protection in the Three Gorges Reservoir area.

TI  - Refined UNet V4: End-to-End Patch-Wise Network for Cloud and Shadow Segmentation with Bilateral Grid
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images are usually contaminated by cloud and corresponding shadow regions, making cloud and shadow detection one of the essential prerequisites for processing and translation of remote sensing images. Edge-precise cloud and shadow segmentation remains challenging due to the inherent high-level semantic acquisition of current neural segmentation fashions. We, therefore, introduce the Refined UNet series to partially achieve edge-precise cloud and shadow detection, including two-stage Refined UNet, v2 with a potentially efficient gray-scale guided Gaussian filter-based CRF, and v3 with an efficient multi-channel guided Gaussian filter-based CRF. However, it is visually demonstrated that the locally linear kernel used in v2 and v3 is not sufficiently sensitive to potential edges in comparison with Refined UNet. Accordingly, we turn back to the investigation of an end-to-end UNet-CRF architecture with a Gaussian-form bilateral kernel and its relatively efficient approximation. In this paper, we present Refined UNet v4, an end-to-end edge-precise segmentation network for cloud and shadow detection, which is capable of retrieving regions of interest with relatively tight edges and potential shadow regions with ambiguous edges. Specifically, we inherit the UNet-CRF architecture exploited in the Refined UNet series, which concatenates a UNet backbone of coarsely locating cloud and shadow regions and an embedded CRF layer of refining edges. In particular, the bilateral grid-based approximation to the Gaussian-form bilateral kernel is applied to the bilateral message-passing step, in order to ensure the delineation of sufficiently tight edges and the retrieval of shadow regions with ambiguous edges. Our TensorFlow implementation of the bilateral approximation is relatively computationally efficient in comparison with Refined UNet, attributed to the straightforward GPU acceleration. Extensive experiments on Landsat 8 OLI dataset illustrate that our v4 can achieve edge-precise cloud and shadow segmentation and improve the retrieval of shadow regions, and also confirm its computational efficiency.

AB  - With the deepening understanding of fire research and the rapid development of remote sensing technology, remote sensing data has become the main basis for fire monitoring. This study aimed to test the accuracy of four selected fire products based on fire events in Sichuan Province, including VNP14IMGTDL_NRT (hereinafter referred to as VNP14DL), MCD64A1, Fire_CCI, MCD14ML. The reference data is provided by Sichuan Forestry and Grassland Bureau, and the fire products are verified by the spatio-temporal cluster analysis method and classification accuracy evaluation method. The results show VNP14DL has the highest fire detection accuracy, with F1-score reaching 0.490 in 2014, followed by MCD14ML (F1-score=0.457), MCD64A1 (F1-score=0.390), and Fire_CCI (F1-score=0.330).

TI  - Evaluation of Four Satellite-Derived Fire Products in the Fire-Prone, Cloudy, and Mountainous Area Over Subtropical China
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the absence of historical fire records, end users intend to adopt free satellite-derived fire products, including global burn area (BA) and active fire (AF) products, to understand the historical fire dynamics for better forest management. Previous literature evaluated the accuracy of these fire products in regions with different environments, but no study evaluated the performance of these fire products in fire-prone, cloudy, and mountainous areas. This study contributed to filling this gap, through the first evaluation of four broadly used fire products: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based MCD64A1, MCD14ML, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)-based VNP14DLIMGTDLNRT (hereafter simplified as VNP14DL), and European Space Agency (ESA) Fire Disturbance Climate Change Initiative (FireCCI51) over subtropical China. Two methods were applied to this end: the spatiotemporal clustering algorithm based on official historical fire records and the density-based random sampling and estimation method from the Landsat 8 fire scenes. The results show that both the AF and BA products show poor fire detection ability in this area (with all the $F1$ -Score 0.5). Among them, the VNP14DL performed best, followed by MCD14ML, FireCCI51, and MCD64A1. The MCD14ML had the best detection capability for small fires (50 hectares). AF products have an overall higher fire detection ability than BA products. These findings provide insights for the improvement of fire detection algorithms for these fire products in the fire-prone, cloudy, and mountainous area over subtropical China.

TI  - Intratumor expanded T cell clones can be non-sentinel lymph node derived in breast cancer revealed by single-cell immune profiling
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) are regarded as key immune surveillance sites in cancer wherein mature dendritic cells present tumor-derived antigens to prime and activate T cells, which then migrate to the tumor site. However, it is unclear whether the tumor-specific T cells can be elicited within the tumor independent of the sentinel LNs. Methods We performed an integrative analysis of gene expression profiles of 65,285 cells and T cell receptor sequences of 15,831 T cells from 5 paired primary breast tumors and sentinel LNs to identify where clonal T cells come from and the characteristics of those clonal T cells. Results The proportion of clonal T cells was higher in the primary tumors compared with the sentinel LNs, whereas all expanded clones identified in the sentinel LN were also present in the primary tumors. In contrast, 10.91% of the expanded clones in the primary tumors were not found in the sentinel LNs. These novel intratumoral T cell clones were characterized by high tissues retention capacity (CXCR6 +ITGAE+) and a distinct coinhibitory pattern (CD39 +NKG2A+) compared with the expanded T cell clones common to both sites. Furthermore, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging showed the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in the primary breast tumors wherein the activated cytolytic T cells were concentrated, indicating its possible role in eliciting non-sentinel LN-derived T cell clones. Conclusions Our study revealed expanded intratumor non-sentinel LN derived T cell clones located in the TLS, which points to the need for exploring the role of TLS in antitumor immunity.

AB  - Cloud detection is an important preprocessing step for remote sensing image processing and analysis. The current deep-learning-based cloud detection methods are mostly based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which pay more attention to local information. To make more use of the global information, in this article, we propose a transformer-based cloud detection method (SCTrans) based on the spatial and channel attention mechanism. The experiment results show that when using only three-band images on the Landsat7 dataset, the mIoU of the validation set reaches 85.92% and the mIoU of the test set reaches 87.86%. The experimental results show that the proposed network has a higher mIoU and F1 score than Fmask and other networks.

AB  - Mapping the distribution of plastic covered greenhouses (PCG) is essential for any attempts to manage these complex areas of intensive agriculture. It is therefore important to understand how the spectrum of different PCG varies in order to establish its unique absorption features and how these can be utilised for mapping PCG from remote sensing imagery. This paper presents an analysis of the surface reflectance values of satellite image spectra for 50 PCG. The reflectance of these PCG, located in Almeria (Spain), was studied in two seasons of the year (summer and winter). All single bands of WorldView-3 (WV3), Sentinel-2 MSI (S2 L2A) and Landsat 8 OLI (L8 L2), together with Normalized Difference Plastic Index (NDPI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were generated through an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for each PCG and season. The results showed the variability of absorption features and overall shape of the spectra for all PCG. The main differences in reflectance were attributed to the crops and the specific characteristics of their local management. A relationship between brightness and whitewashing (greenhouse roof painted with lime to provide shade and reduce the temperature inside the greenhouse, especially in summer) was found, showing the ability of whitewashing to temporally mask the spectral signature of the plastic film.

TI  - An improvement of snow/cloud discrimination from machine learning using geostationary satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow and cloud discrimination is a main factor contributing to errors in satellite-based snow cover. To address the error, satellite-based snow cover performs snow reclassification tests on the cloud pixels of the cloud mask, but the error still remains. Machine Learning (ML) has recently been applied to remote sensing to calculate satellite-based meteorological data, and its utility has been demonstrated. In this study, snow and cloud discrimination errors were analyzed for GK-2A/AMI snow cover, and ML models (Random Forest and Deep Neural Network) were applied to accurately distinguish snow and clouds. The ML-based snow reclassified was integrated with the GK-2A/AMI snow cover through post-processing. We used the S-NPP/VIIRS snow cover and ASOS in situ snow observation data, which are satellite-based snow cover and ground truth data, as validation data to evaluate whether the snow/cloud discrimination is improved. The ML-based integrated snow cover detected 33-53% more snow compared to the GK-2A/AMI snow cover. In terms of performance, the F1-score and overall accuracy of the GK-2A/AMI snow cover was 73.06% and 89.99%, respectively, and those of the integrated snow cover were 76.78-78.28% and 90.93-91.26%, respectively.

AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, this technology has been widely used in the field of ecological environment monitoring. The Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) is based on remote sensing data and integrates the four factors of greenness, dryness, wetness, and heat. This study took Gansu Province as the research object and calculated its remote sensing ecological index in 2000, 2010 and 2020. The results showed: (1) In general, the average RSEI increased from 0.2665 to 0.3299, reflecting the positive trend of ecological environment quality in Gansu Province. (2) The ecological environment grades in Gansu Province were mainly poor and bad grades, which accounted for about 78% in 2000 and dropped to 65% in 2020. (3) In terms of space, the RSEI index showed a decreasing characteristic from southeast to northwest. The areas with better ecological quality were the Longnan Mountains and the Garman Plateau, while the areas with poorer ecological quality are the Hexi Corridor. (4) From 2000 to 2010, the ecological environment quality improved slightly, and the area with slight improvement accounted for 30.17%. From 2010 to 2020, the ecological environment was relatively stable, and the stable area accounted for 71.15%. This study supplements the blank of ecological environment quality evaluation in Gansu Province and aims to provide a reference for ecological environment protection and sustainable development in Gansu Province.

TI  - MODIS Green-Tide Detection With a Squeeze and Excitation Oriented Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel framework combining spectral analysis and machine learning for green-tide detection. The framework incorporates a squeeze and excitation (SE) attention module into a U-shaped generator of a generative adversarial network (GAN), and is referred to as squeeze and excitation oriented generative adversarial network (SE-GAN). In the SE-GAN, the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) is used as the preprocessing filter, which enhances the information associated with green-tide. The SE attention module recalibrates the feature maps so as to enhance the useful features conveyed from the generator's convolution layer while suppressing less useful ones. Overall, the generator attempts to render images that contain green-tide in a way that highly approximates the reference images, while the discriminator characterizes the difference between the generated images and the reference images. The training scheme, which is adversarial, minimizes the f- divergence between the generator and discriminator. Consequently, compared to other green-tide detection algorithms only applicable in small-area scenes, SE-GAN can automatically detect green-tide in MODIS images of any size. Experiments with both large- and small-format MODIS imagery confirm that SE-GAN's detection results are superior to those of five other commonly used methods.

TI  - Enhancing Spatial Resolution of Sea Surface Salinity in Estuarine Regions by Combining Microwave and Ocean Color Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a downscaling approach to improve the spatial resolution of sea surface salinity (SSS) in estuarine areas using combined microwave and ocean color data. The model established a relationship between SSS and normalized sea surface emissivity and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The model was validated by in situ measurements conducted in the East China Sea (ECS) and Mississippi River Estuary (MRE). The model showed relatively good agreement with in situ SSS measurements and illustrated enhanced SSS at high (4 km) resolution compared with low (40 km) resolution, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 1.55 versus 2.58 psu in the ECS and 0.39 versus 1.49 psu in the MRE. Overall, the proposed downscaling approach enhances the spatial resolution and accuracy of satellite SSS observations over estuarine areas, which should be helpful for ocean dynamic and biogeochemical studies in these regions.

AB  - On May 21, 2021 (UTC), an Mw 7.3 earthquake occurred in Madoi County of Qinghai Province (China). There was no damage to buildings or loss of life; however, surface manifestation was observed in the epicentral areas. The analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ground observation data shows changes in the section of the Yellow River and some lakes within the epicentral region associated with this strong earthquake. The changes in radar backscattering coefficient (BC) in water bodies are observed attributed to turbidity from the intense shaking of the earthquake. The liquefaction locations observed in the field within the epicentral region, which is also supported by the changes in the BC derived from Sentinel-1 data.

AB  - This paper is a study on the diary material 'Okryudong Ilgi' written by Jo Byeong-seok(趙秉錫, 1909～?), a Confucian scholar who lived during the Japanese colonial period.This diary is a record left by young Confucian scholar Jo Byeong-seok while he was staying at Okryujeongsa in Jeonju in 1927 for his studies in Geumjae Choi Byeong-shim. This diary contains vivid voices of the author's commitment to study while maintaining Confucian values amid the rapidly changing social and academic environment during the transition from the pre-modern period to the modern era.As this material is introduced to the academia for the first time, the bibliography of the material is first arranged. I first organized the bibliographical details of the material and looked at the characteristic features of the diary as a whole. Specifically, I tried to divide it into several categories, such as the content that the author places great importance on and meticulous attention to, topics that are repeatedly mentioned several times, and issues that can be given the significance of the times.The diary has a limitation in that it is not refined compared to other recording formats, but it has the advantage of conveying the author's voice relatively vividly. Paying attention to this fact, I tried to examine the worldview and perception of a young Confucian who lived in the period of modern transition through this diary.

AB  - This study diagnoses the scope and possibility of entry routes through which artists can work in the metaverse market by analyzing the characteristics and musical issues of existing large metaverse platforms. As a result, the researcher judged that Roblox was the easiest to enter through analysis of Roblox, ZEPETO, Fortnite, Minecraft, and Animal Forest, which are called large metaverse platforms. It is not easy for ordinary artists to enter into a contract with a platform by spending a large amount of money like large entertainment to enter the metaverse, so another approach is needed. Compared to the unprecedented metaverse storm, the technological development is slow and no future business model has been created. At this point, the metaverse platform Roblox and the artist's worldview content convergence are judged to have utility value and potential for development in the pop culture market. Like many maps in Roblox, simple games can induce users to purchase music within the platform, and storytelling can be used to build maps to attract users' interest. The creation of the metaverse platform using the worldview that expresses the creative ability and creativity of each artist is the most suitable path for various artists to enter the changing music market. A small number of popular musicians have acquired wealth in the past, but generally the life of a musician is not prosperous. The purpose of this study is to suggest the possibility of various artists entering the changing metaverse market by recommending the creation of the metaverse platform using the musical worldview

TI  - A Philosophical Study on the Pavilion Culture
TI  - 정자(亭子) 문화에 관한 철학적 시탐(試探)
T2  - Studies in Confucianism
T2  - 유학연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper examines the culture of the pavilion and scenic pavilion from a philosophical perspective. In the past, literati in the East wanted to enjoy a life with nature through pavilions. The letter ‘jeong (亭)’ in the pavilion has the meaning of ‘staying and resting (停)’. If the reason for ‘staying and resting’ is clarified at the philosophical level, it contains the philosophical meaning of ‘being negative once’ in the process of changing nature, ‘being negative once and becoming positive once.’ In addition, the pavilion, located in an open natural space, is understood to vomit and inhale the energy that runs in nature in terms of ‘holding empty things’. Accordingly, the pavilion is meaningful as a building that learns the vitality and motility of nature. In this regard, the pavilion was intended to be built by selecting a place where it is possible to climb a high place and look at a far place with the back of the mountain and the space where the water is in front of it. The purpose of building the pavilion is very diverse, and it is worth paying attention to the pavilion culture built at the private level rather than the pavilion in the form of a public pavilion built for the purpose of resting the mind and body tired of political affairs. This is because such a private pavilion contains the worldview that the literary aimed at. The pavilion culture at the private level contains the reason for pursuing pleasure through a natural life.Specifically, in terms of comparing it to human morality, it contains a life that is friendly to nature, symbolized by Confucius’ loving mountains and liking water. In addition, it contains the joy of coming back from bathing and singing at the Yi water’s edge, which Zengdian said, and the pursuit of a clear and clean life, reading a poem in the blowing wind and teasing the moon, which Zhou Dunyi recited. Sometimes there was a feeling of returning to the countryside after abandoning his government post, a life aimed at saving the world by retiring his body after retirement, and a reason for pursuing a necessary life. In this regard, the core of the pavilion culture pursued by the literati was the reason that the name and reality were superior in comparison to human morality, that is, the virtue of the person who built the pavilion through the pavilion. This is the reason why pavilion shows everything about the human being. Among the various reasons contained in the pavilion culture, the most important was the so-called ‘empty mind’ of emptying things such as secular power, honor, and wealth by ministrying the body and mind. In this respect, the pavilion has a unique status in Eastern literary culture. As seen above, the pavilion that appeared in the literature culture of the east was regarded as a ‘humanities-level building’ or a ‘philosophical-level building’ containing the philosophy and aesthetics of the literati, away from the simple natural space.

AB  - This paper proposed a method of restoring a cloud occluded area by a deep learning method by detectingclouds from high-resolution satellite images and learning between heterogeneous satellite images. After trainingaerial images with clouds, clouds in the Worldview-3 image were detected with YOLOv3 and the restorationarea was designated. CycleGAN was used among deep learning techniques for the restoration of the detectedcloud occlusion area, and an image restoration experiment was conducted through learning between the opticalheterogeneous satellite images, Worldview-3 and Kompsat-3 images. As a result, our proposed methodologyderived a decrease in RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) by about 72.3% compared to the result of applying theHistogram Matching Method, and a high R of about 0.98. Through this, it was confirmed that cloud detectionin high-resolution satellite images is possible by learning aerial photographs, and cloud occlusion areas can berestored through learning between heterogeneous satellite images.

TI  - A Study on Jungyong perspective of Dasan Revealed in Jachanmyojimyeong - Focusing on Jungyong Jajam and Jungyong Ganguibo

AB  - This paper aims to examine Dasan(茶山)’s Jungyong perspective through the seven points that Dasan mentioned about Jungyong in Jachanmyojimyeong (self-written epitaph) focusing on Jungyong Jajam and Jungyong Ganguibo among his writings on Jungyong by Dasan Jeongyakyong.In general, the study of Korean 經學 was based on the worldview of 朱子學的, and in the Joseon Dynasty, Neo-Confucian studies were deepened and Neo-Confucian thinking expanded by Yulgok and Toegye. However, in the late Joseon Dynasty, Dasan Jeongyakyong presented his own 經學觀 from a critical standpoint vis-a-vis Neo-Confucianism, escaping from the worldview of Neo-Confucianism, which was the main school at the time. In addition, he suggested seven points in hisJachanmyojimyeong about Jungyong, one of the Confucian Classics.Among the seven points, he considered the meaning of '中' with respect to the meaning of '不偏不倚無過不及' as Zhu Xi had done, but adopted a distinct interpretation of '中' from Zhu Xi, while he understood 庸 as meaning 有常, focusing on 'being able to do it consistently for a long time', where 有常 is understood as meaning '恒常' and '能久'. Therefore, in Dasan's view, 中庸 is characterized by an emphasis on 'continuous practicality'. Regarding the phrase '不睹不聞', it shows a focus on the 'subject and object' that we cannot see or hear, suggesting the 上帝 as 主宰者, and confirming that '不睹' is what is not seen and '不聞' is what is not heard. Regarding '隱微', it was said to be a matter of 上天, not of 暗處細事. Moreover, in '喜怒哀樂之未發', by distinguishing 喜怒哀樂 and 心知思慮 and stating that it is not the 未發 of 心知思慮 that is meant but 未發 of 喜怒哀樂, the scope of 情 was reinterpreted. Regarding '罟擭陷阱', he stated that it was not 罟擭陷阱 only to have committed a wrong and to be punished by 有司 and that the meaning of ‘索隱’ was not to find 隱僻 reason, but to be hidden for no reason. ‘改而止’ means that if one exerts self-control and corrects one’s mistakes, it does not mean to stop controlling oneself, but rather to correct one’s own actions through self-study. The two halves of '道心人心, 唯一唯精' are not connected to each other based on the   道經   in   荀子  , and according to the 本意 quoted by Xunzi, people should follow the order ‘道心人心’ rather than ‘人心道心’ and of ‘唯一唯精’ rather than ‘惟精惟一’. In this way, if we examine Dasan's view of 經學觀 in Jungyong, we see that the philosophical concepts of Neo-Confucianism are presented in a concrete way for easy recognition, and 經學 is approached from the perspective of governing, with a focus on examples revealed in real life.

AB  - Johannine discipleship have been explored from the perspective of the various approach. However, little has been done on the relationship between discipleship and Christology, except only so far limited John 17. This article attempts to link the relationship between discipleship and Christology throughout John’s Gospel. The primary purpose is to identify the Christological character of Johannine discipleship and suggest implications to improve discipleship strategies adopted in Africa. The study discovered a bond between Christology and discipleship throughout John’s Gospel and that disciples’ self-consciousness and identity flow from their understanding of the person and work of Jesus. The study suggests that (1). African discipleship should build a relationship between Jesus and Africans. (2) The church should disciple African Christians to adopt the biblical/Christological worldview. It is expected that this study would contribute the Church in Africa in the work of discipleship.

TI  - <i>Annual Review of Marine Science</i> Argo-Two Decades: Global Oceanography, Revolutionized
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Argo, an international, global observational array of nearly 4,000 autonomous robotic profiling floats, each measuring ocean temperature and salinity from 0 to 2,000 m on nominal 10-day cycles, has revolutionized physical oceanography. Argo started at the turn of the millennium, growing out of advances in float technology over the previous several decades. After two decades, with well over 2 million profiles made publicly available in real time, Argo data have underpinned more than 4,000 scientific publications and improved countless nowcasts, forecasts, and projections. We review a small subset of those accomplishments, such as elucidating remarkable zonal jets spanning the deep tropical Pacific; increasing understanding of ocean eddies and the roles of mixing in shaping water masses and circulation; illuminating interannual to decadal ocean variability; quantifying, in concert with satellite data, contributions of ocean warming and ice melting to sea level rise; improving coupled numerical weather predictions; and underpinning decadal climate forecasts.

AB  - Remote sensing data is plentiful, but downloading, organizing, and transforming large amounts of data into a format readily usable by modern machine learning methods is a challenging and labor-intensive task. We present the OpenSentinelMap dataset, which consists of 137,045 unique 3.7 km(2) spatial cells, each containing multiple multispectral Sentinel-2 images captured over a 4 year time period and a set of corresponding per-pixel semantic labels derived from OpenStreetMap data. The labels are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and contain information about roads, buildings, water, and 12 land-use categories. The spatial cells are selected randomly on a global scale over areas of human activity, without regard to OpenStreetMap data availability or quality, making the dataset ideal for both supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised experimentation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we a) train an off-the-shelf convolutional neural network with minimal modification to predict land-use and building and road location from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and b) show that the learned embeddings are useful for downstream fine-grained classification tasks without any fine-tuning. The dataset is publicly available at https://visionsystemsinc.github.io/open-sentinel-map/.

AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has become one of the widely used sensors to acquire continuous land surface temperature (LST) over large areas. However, despite the progress in the use of MODIS LST data globally, Africa still lags in the number of publications that utilized the data in research. The data extraction and analysis were done using bibliometric analysis in R statistical software. A total of 59 articles that used MODIS LST data in Africa were generated. The results indicated a steady rise in publication since 2006. China was the most contributing country to publications and Remote Sensing was the most active journal. MODIS was the most common word used in the generated publications. This study is vital in showing improvements in the application of MODIS LST data in Africa which provides information and encourages researchers to use new and unique models that can assist in global warming mitigation.

AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in reducing land surface temperatures. Vegetation indices such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are widely used to examine the relationship between vegetation cover and Land Surface Temperature (LST). In this study, the changes in EVI and LST were determined using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets from 1999 to 2021. The relationship between EVI and LST was also examined to provide a basis for environmental management. The results showed a significant difference in LST and EVI with a negative correlation of -0.22 between them. The LST values increased over the years of study with a maximum of 46 degrees C whilst vegetation cover decreased with a minimum EVI value of 0.20 in 2021. The findings of this study provide useful information to the government, municipalities and other stakeholders to undertake appropriate decisions that can help reduce LST and increase vegetation cover to promote sustainable development.

TI  - P3Net: Pansharpening via Pyramidal Detail Injection With Deep Physical Constraints
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is an image fusion process aiming to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images from a pair of low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images and a high-resolution PAN image. It is a fundamental and significant task for the widespread use of remote sensing images. This article proposes a new residual-learning-based multispectral pansharpening network constrained by two deep physical models, collectively termed as P3Net. It mainly consists of the mainstream PDFNet and the other two auxiliary physical models, M2PNet and H2LNet. Unlike the existing methods of processing only one image scale, the proposed PDFNet fully extracts the spatial details from the multilevel image pyramid with decreasing spatial scales. Then, the spatial information is injected into the upsampled LRMS image. Since the pansharpened result should be consistent with the observed inputs under the physics models, we learn deep pansharpening physics models to reflect the inverse relationships. In detail, we propose the lightweight M2PNet and H2LNet to represent the latent nonlinear mappings from the HRMS image to the panchromatic (PAN) image and the LRMS image, respectively. The two pretrained physics models are frozen and guide the training of the PDFNet, so as to drive clear physical interpretability and further suppress the spectral and spatial distortions. The comparative experiments with the existing state-of-the-art pansharpening methods on the QuickBird, GaoFen, and WorldView test sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both quantitative metrics and subjective visual effects.

TI  - Towards Global Daily Gridded Super-Collated SST Product from Low Earth Orbiting Satellites (L3S-LEO-Daily) at NOAA
T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING XIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XIV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Currently, NOAA produces two 0.02 degrees gridded super-collated ( L3S) sea surface temperature (SST) products from low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites using its enterprise Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system: PM from afternoon satellites (currently, two VIIRSs onboard NPP/N20) and AM from mid-morning satellites (currently, two AVHRR FRACs onboard Metop-B/C, with Metop-A used before 1 Nov 2021). PM/AM products are split into day and night, resulting in four files per 24hr, sampling the diurnal cycle at approximately 1:30 am/pm and 9:30 am/pm local time. The motivation was to preserve the diurnal cycle and short-scale ocean features present in the original observations, for interested users. Near-real time and historical time series of AM/PM-D/N data are extensively validated in the NOAA SST Quality Monitor (SQUAM) and ACSPO Regional Monitor for SST (ARMS) systems, and archived in NASA PO.DAAC and NOAA CoastWatch. For some applications in fisheries, data assimilation, ocean forecast, and L4 analysis communities, a daily SST product with the highest possible coverage may be preferred over four separate AM/PM-D/N files. To satisfy user's needs, NOAA is developing an L3S-LEO-Daily product, which combines four AM/PM-D/N SSTs into one file, with superior coverage and performance metrics. There are two challenges in aggregating data from different times: systematic inter-satellite biases due to diurnal warming and moving spatial features. Diurnal signals are smallest for the PM-N SST @1:30 am, largest for PM-D SST @1:30 pm, and fall in between for the AM-D/N SSTs @9:30 am/pm. We describe the ACSPO L3S-LEO-Daily algorithm, which normalizes the individual AM/PM-D/N SSTs to the PM-N benchmark, and then combines the four debiased/harmonized SSTs into L3S-LEO-Daily product, using an iterative scheme that maximally preserves feature resolution in the AM/PM-D/N data, while mitigating the remaining residual cloud leakages.

TI  - Strengthening Regional Value Chains in the EU: Impact on Korea’s Exports to the EU
T2  - 동유럽발칸연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper attempted to analyze the impact of the EU’s RVC (Regional Value Chain) on Korea’s export market to the EU. The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly changing the global trade environment. It has broken down the global supply chain and is widening the economic gap between developed and developing countries. The EU is pushing for ‘compulsory digitalization’ in Europe as one of its economic revitalization policies due to the spread of COVID-19 and ‘reshoring’ for the purpose of strategic autonomy. Nationalization and localization of supply chains through reshoring in the EU deprives suppliers of opportunities to diversify their exports. Meanwhile, despite the spread of COVID-19, conflicts between the U.S. and China are intensifying in various aspects. The United States and China are making efforts to devise an international order with their own worldview and make EU member states on their side. From the EU’s point of view, the deepening U.S.-China economic hegemony war caused by the COVID-19 may be an opportunity to increase the autonomy of choice. In other words, since the EU and member states have switched from being chosen to choosing, the possibility of cooperation with Korea will increase. The EU is expected to accelerate policies to support ‘fourth industries’ at the level of EU and member countries, such as digital transformation using AI and big data. Especially, demand for new cooperation is expected around eco-friendly vehicle parts, materials, and equipment. An important part of the competitiveness of developing countries in the future is their proximity to large-scale consumer markets. Accordingly, Korea needs to aggressively promote its plan to enter the regional production system in preparation for the increase in EU intra-regional trade.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the land surface temperatures (LSTs) retrieved from the GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A) satellite AMI sensor by comparing them to LSTs measured at 106 ground-based stations (95 ASOS and 11 AAOS stations). In addition, the statistical performance of the GK-2A AMI LST was compared with those of LSTs retrieved from the MODIS and S-VISSR satellites. LSTs were evaluated in terms of inland versus coastal regions and at different inland elevations. A time series analysis of the entire study period confirmed that the GK-2A satellite yielded the smallest bias among four satellite-based LST products. The satellite-based LSTs also exhibited higher correlations with ground-based measurements in the inland region than in the coastal region. In addition, the difference in LSTs at the highest and lowest elevations was approximately 1 ℃. A comparison of the annual mean LST and observation frequency revealed that geostationary satellite-based LSTs tend to be overestimated because of the lower observation frequency (1/3 of the polar orbit satellite frequency). Overall, the GK-2A AMI LSTs can be used to analyze the spatiotemporal variations in the urban heat island effect and heat waves at fine-scale resolutions, while further topographical correction is recommended to improve their accuracy.

AB  - This article explores the  philosophy of life contained in Lee Ae-ju’s dance and its theory from a critical perspective. I first discussed the planning intentions of the three works of Lee Ae-ju’s Creative Dance Ttangkkeut, Nanumgut bap, and Balloon Flower, as well as the view of life of her dance. Secondly, the traditional dances of Seungmu, Salpurichum,  and Taepyeongchum were  explained,  and Lee  Ae-ju's  artistic  life  and dance worldview were examined. Finally, the meaning and nature of the Lee Ae-ju’s dance, intended to be expressed across traditional and creative dances, were identified and  the  philosophy  of life within it was explored.An artist who has contributed significantly to the prosperity and development of Korean dance; an innovator who has steered her craft toward opening doors to a new world of  creative  positivity,  Lee  Ae-ju  was  such  an  artist.  While  traditional  dance  of  the past and modern forms of creative dance have often been in conflict, Lee’s nationally designated  dance  has  spread  its  wings  defying  a  century  of  creative  ideology.  By adding excitement and style to the rhythm, her art has sublimated dance into a form that embraces rebirth with joy. Through her dance, she gave new life to the creative spark  of  her  field  and  helped  instilling  hope  for  both  freedom  of  expression  and democratization.

TI  - Persistence and Variability of Earth's Interhemispheric Albedo Symmetry in 19 Years of CERES EBAF Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the unequal partitioning of land and aerosol sources between the hemispheres, Earth's albedo is observed to be persistently symmetric about the equator. This symmetry is determined by the compensation of clouds to the clear-sky albedo. Here, the variability of this interhemispheric albedo symmetry is explored by decomposing observed radiative fluxes in the CERES EBAF satellite data record into components reflected by the atmosphere, clouds, and the surface. We find that the degree of interhemispheric albedo symmetry has not changed significantly throughout the observational record. The variability of the interhemispheric difference in reflected solar radiation (asymmetry) is strongly determined by tropical and subtropical cloud cover, particularly those related to nonneutral phases of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). As ENSO is the most significant source of interannual variability in reflected radiation on a global scale, this underscores the interhemispheric albedo symmetry as a robust feature of Earth's current annual mean climate. Comparing this feature in observations with simulations from coupled models reveals that the degree of modeled albedo symmetry is mostly dependent on biases in reflected radiation in the midlatitudes, and that models that overestimate its variability the most have larger biases in reflected radiation in the tropics. The degree of model albedo symmetry is improved when driven with historical sea surface temperatures, indicating that the degree of symmetry in Earth's albedo is dependent on the representation of cloud responses to coupled ocean-atmosphere processes.
