TI  - A New Method for Automated Clearcut Disturbance Detection in Mediterranean Coppice Forests Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Landsat time series has been recognized as a viable source of information for monitoring and assessing forest disturbances and for continuous reporting on forest dynamics. This study focused on developing automated procedures for detecting disturbances in Mediterranean coppice forests which are characterized by rapid regrowth after a cut. Specifically, new methods specific to Mediterranean coppice forests are needed for mapping clearcut disturbances over time and for estimating related indicators in the context of Sustainable Forest Management and Biodiversity International monitoring frameworks. The aim of this work was to develop a new change detection algorithm for mapping clearcut disturbances in Mediterranean coppice forests with Landsat time series (LTS) using a short time window. Accuracy for the new algorithm, characterized as the Two Thresholds Method (TTM), was evaluated using an independent clearcut reference dataset over a temporal period of the 13 years between 2001 and 2013. TTM was also evaluated against two benchmark approaches: (i) LandTrendr, and (ii) the forest loss category of the Global Forest Change Map. Overall Accuracy for LandTrendr and TTM were greater than 0.94. Meanwhile, smaller accuracies were always obtained for the GFC. In particular, Producer's Accuracy ranged between 0.45 and 0.84 for TTM and between 0.49 and 0.83 for LT, while for the GFC, PA ranged between 0 and 0.38. User's Accuracy ranged between 0.86 and 0.96 for TTM and between 0.73 and 0.91 for LT, while for the GFC UA ranged between 0.19 and 1.00. Moreover, to illustrate the utility of TTM for mapping clearcut disturbances in Mediterranean coppice forests, we applied TTM to a Landsat scene that covered almost the entirety of the Tuscany region in Italy.

TI  - Stroke impairment categories: A new way to classify the effects of stroke based on stroke-related impairments
T2  - CLINICAL REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:To create a classification system based on stroke-related impairments.Data source:All adults with stroke admitted for at least 72 hours in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from July 2013 to July 2015 extracted from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit ProgrammeAnalysis:Impairments were defined using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores at admission. Common combinations of impairments were identified based on geometric coding and expert knowledge. Validity of the classification was assessed using standard descriptive statistics to report and compare patients' characteristics, therapy received and outcomes in each group.Results:Data from 94,905 patients were extracted. The items of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (on admission) were initially grouped into four body systems: Cognitive, Motor, Sensory and Consciousness. Seven common combinations of these impairments were identified (in order of stroke severity); Patients with Loss of Consciousness (n = 6034, 6.4%); those with Motor + Cognitive + Sensory impairments (n = 28,226, 29.7%); Motor + Cognitive impairments (n = 16,967, 17.9%); Motor + Sensory impairments (n = 9882, 10.4%); Motor Only impairments (n = 20,471, 21.6%); Any Non-Motor impairments (n = 7498, 7.9%); and No Impairments (n = 5827, 6.1%). There was a gradation of age, premorbid disability, mortality and disability on discharge. People with the most and least severe categories were least likely to receive therapy, and received least therapy (-20 minutes/day of stay) compared to -35 minutes/day of stay for the moderately severe categories.Conclusions:A classification system of seven Stroke Impairment Categories has been presented.

TI  - Environmental Factors and Hyperacute Stroke Care Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interrupted Time-Series Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims: Concerns have arisen regarding patient access and delivery of acute stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated key population level events on activity of the three hyperacute stroke units (HASUs) within Greater Manchester and East Cheshire (GM & EC), whilst adjusting for environmental factors. Methods: Weekly stroke admission & discharge counts in the three HASUs were collected locally from Emergency Department (ED) data and Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme core dataset prior to, and during the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan 2020 to May 2020). Whilst adjusting for local traffic-related air pollution and ambient measurement, an interrupted time-series analysis using a segmented generalised linear model investigated key population level events on the rate of stroke team ED assessments, admissions for stroke, referrals for transient ischaemic attack (TIA), and stroke discharges. Results: The median total number of ED stroke assessments, admissions, TIA referrals, and discharges across the three HASU sites prior to the first UK COVID-19 death were 150, 114, 69, and 76 per week. The stable weekly trend in ED assessments and stroke admissions decreased by approximately 16% (and 21% for TIAs) between first UK hospital COVID-19 death (5th March) and the implementation of the Act-FAST campaign (6th April) where a modest 4% and 5% increase per week was observed. TIA referrals increased post Government intervention (23rd March), without fully returning to the numbers observed in January and February. Trends in discharges from stroke units appeared unaffected within the study period reported here. Conclusion: Despite adjustment for environmental factors stroke activity was temporarily modified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Underlying motivations within the population are still not clear. This raises concerns that patients may have avoided urgent health care risking poorer short and long-term health outcomes.

TI  - Costing of Cesarean Sections in a Government and a Non-Governmental Hospital in Cambodia-A Prerequisite for Efficient and Fair Comprehensive Obstetric Care
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the cost of health care services is a prerequisite for evidence-based management and decision making. However, only limited costing data is available in many low- and middle-income countries. With a substantially increasing number of facility-based births in Cambodia, costing data for efficient and fair resource allocation is required. This paper evaluates the costs for cesarean section (CS) at a public and a Non-Governmental (NGO) hospital in Cambodia in the year 2018. We performed a full and a marginal cost analysis, i.e., we developed a cost function and calculated the respective unit costs from the provider's perspective. We distinguished fixed, step-fixed, and variable costs and followed an activity-based costing approach. The processes were determined by personal observation of CS-patients and all procedures; the resource consumption was calculated based on the existing accounting documentation, observations, and time-studies. Afterwards, we did a comparative analysis between the two hospitals and performed a sensitivity analysis, i.e., parameters were changed to cater for uncertainty. The public hospital performed 54 monthly CS with an average length of stay (ALOS) of 7.4 days, compared to 18 monthly CS with an ALOS of 3.4 days at the NGO hospital. Staff members at the NGO hospital invest more time per patient. The cost per CS at the current patient numbers is US$470.03 at the public and US$683.23 at the NGO hospital. However, the unit cost at the NGO hospital would be less than at the public hospital if the patient numbers were the same. The study provides detailed costing data to inform decisionmakers and can be seen as a steppingstone for further costing exercises.

TI  - Multiple cutaneous and haemorrhagic brain metastases as the sentinel presentation of lung adenocarcinoma
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Skin is a relatively uncommon site of metastasis in lung cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. Although, lung cancer does not uncommonly metastasise to the brain, haemorrhagic brain metastases are rarely reported. In this report, we present a dramatic presentation of a female smoker with a 3-week history of numerous cutaneous lesions over her body and two episodes of transient memory loss. Work-up demonstrated widely metastatic, poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with haemorrhagic brain metastases. She proceeded with whole brain radiotherapy, but her performance status quickly declined afterwards; she succumbed to her malignancy within 6 weeks of presentation. This case presentation demonstrates that, for patients who present with cutaneous masses, especially those aged more than 60 years, and who have extensive smoking history, metastatic lung cancer should remain on the differential diagnosis. Also, the very poor prognosis of multiple metastases may influence medical and social decisions in the patient's treatment plan.

TI  - Ability of Remote Sensing Systems to Detect Bark Beetle Spots in the Southeastern US
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research Highlights: Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products show greater potential to detect indications of disturbance by bark beetles in the southeastern US than Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the southeastern forest land prevents its deployment at the current resolution. Background and Objectives: Remote sensing technologies have been an essential tool to detect forest disturbances caused by insect pests through spectral trait variation. In the US, coordinated efforts such as ForWarn, led by the US Forest Service and based on MODIS satellite data, are used to monitor biotic and abiotic disturbances. Because of the particular characteristics of the southeastern US landscape, including forest fragmentation and rapid forest turnover due to management, detection and visualization of small bark beetle spots using remote sensing technology developed for more homogeneous landscapes has been challenging. Here, we assess the ability of MODIS and Sentinel-2 time-series vegetation index data products to detect bark beetle spots in the Florida Panhandle. Materials and Methods: We compared ForWarn's detection ability (lower resolution images) with that of Sentinel-2 (higher resolution images) using bark beetle spots confirmed by aerial surveys and ground checks by the Florida Forest Service. Results: MODIS and Sentinel-2 can detect damage produced by bark beetles in the southeastern US, but MODIS detection via NDVI change exhibits a high degree of false negatives (30%). Sentinel-2 NDVI products show greater potential for identifying indications of disturbance by bark beetles than MODIS change maps, with Sentinel-2 capturing negative changes in NDVI for all spots. Conclusions: Our research shows that for practical bark beetle detection via remote sensing, higher spatial and temporal resolution will be needed.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE COMPUTACAO APLICADA
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of thermal images of satellites to study a region is made accessing systems on the Internet such as the US Geological Survey (USGS). Every study of satellite images the acquisition and clipping stages for a region is made in an individualized way, being a common protocol in researches of orbital satellite images. In order to contribute to the optimization of geographic researches performance, this work presents an automated protocol for satellite image acquisition and preprocessing of the Landsat-8 TIRS thermal sensor. To develop this protocol, were analyzed common manual processes of acquisition and clipping in geographic researches that uses Landsat-8 thermal images. It has been found possible to pre-process the Landsat-8 digital thermocouples automatically, enabling a combination with others automated technologies and coupling with others geographic information systems that contain thermal region processing.

TI  - A strategy for the verification of CAP declarations using Sentinel-2 images in Navarre
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - In June 2018, the European Commission approved a modification of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that, among other measures, proposed the use of Copernicus data for the verification process of farmers' declarations. In recent years, several research efforts have been conducted to develop operational tools to accomplish this aim, among this the Interreg-POCTEFA PyrenEOS project. This article describes the methodological strategy proposed in the PyrenEOS project, which is based on the identification of the most probable crop using the Random Forests algorithm. Originally, the strategy builds a training sample from the CAP declarations file based on their NDVI time series. In addition, a series of rules are proposed to establish the level of uncertainty in the classification, and the criteria used to represent each parcel in the verification map with a simple colour coding (traffic light), where green represents correctly declared parcels, red indicates that the declaration is dubious, and orange corresponds to parcels with a high classification uncertainty. This verification strategy has been applied to two Agricultural Regions of Navarre, during an agricultural campaign where valuable field inspections were available, with a sampling intensity of 7% of the declared parcels. The results obtained, report overall accuracies close to 80% when the most probable crop was considered, and 90% when the two most probable crops were considered. This proves it is possible to identify correctly declared parcels (green parcels) with an error below 1%. Orange and red parcels should be considered for further analysis and inspection by technicians from the paying agencies, though they represent a small percentage of declarations (-6% of parcels), and include most of the wrong declarations.

TI  - Comparison of winter wheat NDVI data derived from Landsat 8 and active optical sensor at field scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a commonly used vegetation index for a wide range of purposes. In crop production NDVI is applied, amongst others, to monitor crop status and vigour, predict yields and prescript doses of nitrogen fertilizers. The calculation of NDVI requires the reflectance in Near Infrared (NIR) and Red (RED) wavelength bands. These data may be obtained from several sources, e. g. ground sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles, airborne and satellite sensors. These sources differ not only in spatial resolution, but also in sensor design and the wavelength range, at which the NIR and RED reflectance is being registered. An important issue is, if the NDVI values derived from such different sources are comparable, or they produce similar maps. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between NDVI derived from an active optical sensor used in the farm, and NDVI derived from Landsat 8 satellite on 7 winter wheat fields representing different regions and soils of Poland. According to the results of this study, the relationship between NDVIs from both data sources may be field and year specific, and varying for two adjacent fields on the same date. Consequently, the NDVI derived from ground and satellite sources are not directly comparable, but the NDVI maps produced from these sources are frequently similar, even for quite different days of data acquisition. The issue of a universal equation to convert ground NDVI into satellite NDVI or vice-versa is still an open-ended research question.

TI  - Drainage Ditch Berm Delineation Using Lidar Data: A Case Study of Waseca County, Minnesota
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Within a drainage system, drainage ditches are designed to improve existing natural drainage. Although drainage ditches are mostly engineered, they can also be part of natural watercourses. For environmental sustainability, in many places there are guidelines to establish vegetative buffer strips along the boundary of drainage ditches. In this landscape planning study, a geospatial modeling framework was established to identify these drainage system landforms and the boundary that separates these landforms from their surrounding areas across Waseca County in south-central Minnesota. By employing almost 2000 GPS spot elevation measurements from five ditch systems and one-meter Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived digital elevation model (DEM) data, the drainage ditch berm polygons were delineated. Eight low light angle hillshade rasters at 45-degree azimuth intervals were used to construct the model. These hillshade rasters were combined to form a composite raster so that the effect of multiple azimuths can be captured during ditch berm delineation. The GPS points identified as the top of the berm were used to extract cell values from the combined hillshade. These cell values were modeled further using statistical distribution graphs. The statistical model derived +0.5 and +1 standard deviation values (cell values 812 and 827, respectively) of the combined hillshade raster were utilized to obtain complete berm polygons. In this semi-automated method, between 67.30% to 79.80% of ditch berm lengths were mapped with an average error that is less than the resolution of the DEM. Demarcation of these boundaries are important for local governments in Minnesota and throughout the world, as it could help guide land-water management and aid sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Estimating Vertical Land Motion from Remote Sensing and In-Situ Observations in the Dubrovnik Area (Croatia): A Multi-Method Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different space-borne geodetic observation methods combined with in-situ measurements enable resolving the single-point vertical land motion (VLM) and/or the VLM of an area. Continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements can solely provide very precise VLM trends at specific sites. VLM area monitoring can be performed by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology in combination with the GNSS in-situ data. In coastal zones, an effective VLM estimation at tide gauge sites can additionally be derived by comparing the relative sea-level trends computed from tide gauge measurements that are related to the land to which the tide gauges are attached, and absolute trends derived from the radar satellite altimeter data that are independent of the VLM. This study presents the conjoint analysis of VLM of the Dubrovnik area (Croatia) derived from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 InSAR data available from 2014 onwards, continuous GNSS observations at Dubrovnik site obtained from 2000, and differences of the sea-level change obtained from all available satellite altimeter missions for the Dubrovnik area and tide gauge measurements in Dubrovnik from 1992 onwards. The computed VLM estimates for the overlapping period of three observation methods, i.e., from GNSS observations, sea-level differences, and Sentinel-1 InSAR data, are -1.93 +/- 0.38 mm/yr, -2.04 +/- 0.22 mm/yr, and -2.24 +/- 0.46 mm/yr, respectively.

TI  - Geodetic SAR for Height System Unification and Sea Level Research-Observation Concept and Preliminary Results in the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, sea level is observed at tide gauge stations, which usually also serve as height reference stations for national leveling networks and therefore define a height system of a country. One of the main deficiencies to use tide gauge data for geodetic sea level research and height systems unification is that only a few stations are connected to the geometric network of a country by operating permanent GNSS receivers next to the tide gauge. As a new observation technique, absolute positioning by SAR using active transponders on ground can fill this gap by systematically observing time series of geometric heights at tide gauge stations. By additionally knowing the tide gauge geoid heights in a global height reference frame, one can finally obtain absolute sea level heights at each tide gauge. With this information the impact of climate change on the sea level can be quantified in an absolute manner and height systems can be connected across the oceans. First results from applying this technique at selected tide gauges at the Baltic coasts are promising but also exhibit some problems related to the new technique. The paper presents the concept of using the new observation type in an integrated sea level observing system and provides some early results for SAR positioning in the Baltic sea area.

TI  - 2′-fluoro-modified pyrimidines enhance affinity of RNA oligonucleotides to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase
T2  - RNA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nucleic acid aptamers can be chemically modified to enhance function, but modifying previously selected aptamers can have nontrivial structural and functional consequences. Wepresent a reselection strategy to evaluate the impact of several modifications on preexisting aptamer pools. RNA aptamer libraries with affinity to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) were retranscribed with 2'-F, 2'-OMe, or 2'-NH2 pyrimidines and subjected to three additional selection cycles. RT inhibition was observed for representative aptamers from several structural families identified by high-throughput sequencing when transcribed with their corresponding modifications. Thus, reselection identified specialized subsets of aptamers that tolerated chemical modifications fromunmodified preenriched libraries. Inhibition was the strongest with the 2'-F-pyrimidine (2'-FY) RNAs, as compared to inhibition by the 2'-OMeY and 2 '-NH2Y RNAs. Unexpectedly, a diverse panel of retroviral RTs were strongly inhibited by all 2 '-FY-modified transcripts, including sequences that do not inhibit those RTs as unmodified RNA. The magnitude of promiscuous RT inhibition was proportional to mole fraction 2'-FY in the transcript. RT binding affinity by 2 '-FY transcripts was more sensitive to salt concentration than binding by unmodified transcripts, indicating that interaction with retroviral RTs is more ionic in character for 2'-FY RNA than for unmodified 2'-OH RNA. These surprising features of 2 '-FY-modified RNA may have general implications for applied aptamer technologies.

TI  - Using Geospatial Analysis to Map Forest Change in New Hampshire: 1996-Present
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - New Hampshire's forests are vitally important to the state's economy; however, there are indications that the state is experiencing a continuous loss in forest cover. We sought to investigate forest cover trends in New Hampshire. A baseline trend in forest cover between 1996 and 2010 was established using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Change Analysis Program land cover data. A land cover map was then generated from Landsat imagery to extend the baseline trend to 2018. Results show that the state has experienced a continual decline in forest cover with the annual net loss steadily increasing from 0.14% between 1996 and 2001 to 0.27% between 2010 and 2018. Additionally, the more urbanized counties in southern New Hampshire are experiencing some of the greatest rates of net forest loss, most likely because of urbanization and agricultural expansion.This study demonstrated an effective methodology for tracking forest cover change and will hopefully inform future forest use policies.Study Implications: In New Hampshire, forests are vital to the state's economy, provide environmental services that benefit everyone, and are critical habitat for numerous species. There was no recent analysis of trends in forest cover in New Hampshire via remote sensing, which has several advantages over the Forest Inventory and Analysis data that have traditionally been used for this purpose. The continued decline in forested area revealed in this study threatens the state's forest industry, the nontimber benefits that accrue from forests, and those threatened and endangered species reliant on forested habitats. If the current (2018) -0.27% annual forest loss estimated in this study remains unchanged, New Hampshire will lose more than 258,999 hectares (approximately 640,000 acres) of forest in the next 50 years and drop from 77.65% forest cover to 66.5%. The findings of this study will hopefully inform those in a position to influence and make decisions leading to new policies that stem the loss of forest cover in New Hampshire.

TI  - Random Forest Ensemble for River Turbidity Measurement From Space Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River turbidity, serving as an important evaluation index for monitoring water contamination and guiding pollution control, is mainly measured based on the data gathered from contacting turbidity sensors or contactless space satellites. Nevertheless, the prevalence of those abovementioned two measurements is strongly limited due to the disadvantages of low-density spatial distribution of sensor data and extremely high price of satellite data. To solve such difficulty, depending on the Google earth engine (GEE) that freely supplies hyperspectral remote sensing data, in this article, we propose a novel river turbidity measurement model based on random forest ensemble. First, by fully taking advantage of each spectral information and their tuned spectral information, a newly proposed full combination subspace is deployed to generate all the possible base random forests. Second, we introduce a novel error-minimization-based pruning algorithm to circularly delete poor base random forests in accordance with the dynamic threshold. Finally, a weighted average method solved by regularized linear regression is used to aggregate the entire remainder base random forests that are preserved after pruning, thereby yielding the final measurement result of river turbidity. Experiments corroborate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art competitors and its simplified counterparts.

TI  - Fusion of public DEMs based on sparse representation and adaptive regularization variation model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global or quasi-global digital elevation model (DEM) datasets provide three-dimensional information on terrain surface, and they have been extremely useful in geoscience research and applications. However, the wide application of DEMs is constrained by differences in the means of observation and processing, and in the resolution of global public DEM datasets. An adaptive regularization variation model based on sparse representation is proposed to generate a high-quality DEM by fusing multi-source DEMs. First, since the sparse representation method has a powerful capability to reconstruct information based on a small amount of information, prior terrain information is extracted from the 90-m TanDEM-X DEM (TDM90) with unprecedented global accuracy using a so-called sparse representation. In this step, an intermediate DEM (termed STDM30) is first extracted from TDM90 that preserves maximum terrain details, thereby preventing the degradation of the DEM accuracy induced by resampling. Then, the designed regularization framework based on terrain slope can constrain the DEM spatial information during fusing multiple datasets. STDM30 is combined with the ALOS Global Digital Surface Model "ALOS World 3D 30 m" (AW3D30) and the 1 arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM1) through the designed adaptive regularization variation model to generate a high-accuracy DEM product with a resolution of 30 m. The results of the proposed method were verified by a model-to-model comparison in South Dakota as well as by validation against GPS benchmarks in Southern California. The RMSE, MAE, and SD of the fused DEM are all lower than those of the existing public DEMs, especially in terms of removing topographic noise and refining terrain details. The GPS validation showed that the fused DEM has an RMSE of 3.04 m, with the highest absolute accuracy among the four studied DEMs, and its errors are almost equal to the normal distribution. These experimental results confirm that the multi-scale and multi-source DEM fusion strategy combining sparse representation and an adaptive regularization variation model can utilize existing public datasets and effectively improve the quality of global DEM products.

TI  - Linear Retrieval of Microwave Land Surface Emissivity over the Desert Area in January
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the multivariate function Taylor formula and optimal control principle, first, using the 10.65 GHz vertical polarization data of observed brightness temperature from FY -3C microwave radiation imager and simulated brightness temperature from community radiative transfer model (CRTM), the linear retrievals model between the microwave land surface emissivity and two (four) influencing factors arc constructed in the central part of the Taklimakan Desert (retrieval area) in January. Second, considering the observed brightness temperature as a reference, the land surface emissivity obtained by two kinds of linear retrieval models arc provided to CRTM model to simulate brightness temperature, it is found that the average deviations of the simulated brightness temperatures arc reduced to 56. 36% and 19. 37% of the original simulated brightness temperature, respectively. Finally, in the whole Taklimakan Desert (test area), the time and space independence tests of two kinds of linear retrieval models arc carried out by selecting Jan 18, which is used for retrieval date, and Jan 29, which is not used for retrieval date. The results show that the simulated brightness temperatures of the land surface emissivity obtained by two kinds of linear retrieval models arc still closer to the observation than the original simulated brightness temperature, and the average deviations arc also significantly reduced. The two linear retrieval models arc reasonable and universal for the retrieval of land surface emissivity in the desert area in January, and the linear retrieval model with 1 factors is better than 2 factors.

TI  - Improvement in Satellite Image-Based Land Cover Classification with Landscape Metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of an object-based image analysis (OBIA) method has recently become quite common for classifying high-resolution remote-sensed images. However, despite OBIA's segmentation being equally useful for analysing medium-resolution images, it is not used for them as often. This study aims to analyse the effect of landscape metrics that have not yet been used in image classification to provide additional information for land cover mapping to improve the thematic accuracy of satellite image-based land cover mapping. To this end, multispectral satellite images taken by Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) during three different seasons in 2017 were analysed. The images were segmented, and based on these segments, four patch-level landscape metrics (mean patch size, total edge, mean shape index and fractal dimension) were calculated. A random forest classifier was applied for classification, and the Coordination of Information on the Environment Land Cover (CLC) 2018 database was used as reference data. According to the results, landscape metrics both with and without segmentation can significantly improve the overall accuracy of the classification over classification based on spectral values. The highest overall accuracy was achieved using all data (i.e., spectral values, segmentation, and metrics).

TI  - Evolutionary artificial neural networks for accurate solar radiation prediction
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the performance of different evolutionary neural network models in a problem of solar radiation prediction at Toledo, Spain. The prediction problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables, which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically, three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms, leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Ecosystem Service Value Changes and Their Coordination with Economic Development: A Case Study of the Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - By integrating multiple remote sensing data sources this study accurately assesses the spatiotemporal characteristics of changes in ecosystem service values (ESVs) in the Yellow River Basin from 2000 to 2015 through Theil-Sen median trend analysis and the Mann-Kendall test. The stability and continuity of the ESVs were comprehensively characterized using coefficients of variation and the Hurst exponent. The degree of coherence between ESVs and economic growth (represented by gross domestic product GDP) on the same temporal and spatial scales was analyzed using ecological-economic coordination (EEC) models. The results show that (1) from 2001 to 2015 the total ESV and the ESV per unit area in the Yellow River Basin generally showed a U-shaped pattern (decreasing slightly then increasing rapidly). (2) The areas with increasing ESVs made up approximately 55.6% of the total area of the river basin. The areas with a decreasing pattern were mainly in the west and north of the Yellow River Basin. (3) The stability and continuity of the ESVs showed a clustered, compact distribution. (4) The most common level of EEC was slightly uncoordinated followed by slightly coordinated and highly coordinated. The proportion of coordinated areas was relatively higher in cultivated land and the lowest in built-up land.

TI  - Mapping plastic materials in an urban area: Development of the normalized difference plastic index using WorldView-3 superspectral data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and regularly updated information on plastic distribution in urban areas is of great significance for understanding the potential impact of plastic materials on human health and the environment. Remote sensing provides abundant data to identify and map plastics in the natural environment, such as marine plastic debris, and in a heterogeneous urban environment. In existing studies, airborne hyperspectral data were used to map plastic in urban areas. Recently available WorldView-3 data, with superspectral resolution, high spatial resolution and global coverage, have been used in mineral mapping and hydrocarbon detection in non-urban areas. These data provide new opportunities for plastic mapping in urban areas. This study proposes a novel plastic spectral index using WorldView-3 shortwave infrared bands, termed the Normalized Difference Plastic Index (NDPI), to quantify and map plastic materials in urban areas. The NDPI was evaluated in a dense urban area by comparing with the established hyperspectral Hydrocarbon Index (HI) and WorldView-3 Relative-absorption Band Depth (RBD) index. The results demonstrate that the NDPI was effective in visual evaluation, separability analysis and plastic material mapping, with superior performance than the HI and RBD indices. Thus, the pro-posed NDPI provides a useful measure for urban plastics mapping and analysis.

TI  - Calibration and Validation of Feng Yun-3-D Microwave Humidity Sounder II
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 15, 2017, the fourth satellite, Feng Yun-3D (FY-3D), of the new generation of Chinese polar orbit meteorological satellites was successfully launched into orbit. As one of the key payloads, the second-generation Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS II) has 15 channels for observing atmospheric temperature and moisture. In the ground data processing system, the calibration is completed for every scanning period, and then, brightness temperature (TB) data are obtained with calibration coefficients. In order to analyze the performance of MWHS II, one year of in-orbit data are used to monitor the trend of internal blackbody target temperature, instrument temperature, calibration counts, and automatic gain control (AGC), and the results indicate whether the instrument is working well. The instrument noise equivalent differential temperature (NEDT) is calculated, and the value satisfies the design requirements. Two methods are used to validate FY-3D MWHS II measurements. One is the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) approach: in this method, ATMS is chosen as the reference sensor, and the standard deviations for five humidity sounding channels are all less than 1.3 K. In the alternate approach, a comparison of the observed and simulated TB of MWHS II is carried out between FY-3C and FY-3D. The results also demonstrate a consistent performance between the two instruments.

TI  - A Framework of Spatio-Temporal Fusion Algorithm Selection for Landsat NDVI Time Series Construction
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion algorithms dramatically enhance the application of the Landsat time series. However, each spatio-temporal fusion algorithm has its pros and cons of heterogeneous land cover performance, the minimal number of input image pairs, and its efficiency. This study aimed to answer: (1) how to determine the adaptability of the spatio-temporal fusion algorithm for predicting images in prediction date and (2) whether the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series would benefit from the interpolation with images fused from multiple spatio-temporal fusion algorithms. Thus, we supposed a linear relationship existed between the fusion accuracy and spatial and temporal variance. Taking the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and the Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) as basic algorithms, a framework was designed to screen a spatio-temporal fusion algorithm for the Landsat NDVI time series construction. The screening rule was designed by fitting the linear relationship between the spatial and temporal variance and fusion algorithm accuracy, and then the fitted relationship was combined with the graded accuracy selecting rule (R-2) to select the fusion algorithm. The results indicated that the constructed Landsat NDVI time series by this paper proposed framework exhibited the highest overall accuracy (88.18%), and lowest omission (1.82%) and commission errors (10.00%) in land cover change detection compared with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI time series and the NDVI time series constructed by a single STARFM or ESTARFM. Phenological stability analysis demonstrated that the Landsat NDVI time series established by multiple spatio-temporal algorithms could effectively avoid phenological fluctuations in the time series constructed by a single fusion algorithm. We believe that this framework can help improve the quality of the Landsat NDVI time series and fulfill the gap between near real-time environmental monitoring mandates and data-scarcity reality.

TI  - Mapping National-Scale Croplands in Pakistan by Combining Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Croplands are commonly mapped using time series of remotely sensed images. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is an effective method for realizing this. However, DTW algorithm faces the challenge of capturing complete and accurate representative cropland time series on a national scale, especially in Asian countries where climatic and topographic conditions, cropland types, and crop growth patterns vary significantly. This study proposes an automatic cropland extraction method based on the DTW algorithm and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), hereinafter referred to as ACE-DTW, to map croplands in Pakistan in 2015. First, 422 frames of multispectral Landsat-8 satellite images were selected from the Google Earth Engine to construct monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Next, a total of 2409 training samples of six land cover types were generated randomly and explained visually using high-resolution remotely sensed images. Then, a multi-layer DBSCAN was used to classify NDVI time series of training samples into different categories automatically based on their pairwise DTW distances, and the mean NDVI time series of each category was used as the standard time series to represent the characteristics of that category. These standard time series attempted to represent cropland information and maximally distinguished croplands from other possible interference land cover types. Finally, image pixels were classified as cropland or non-cropland based on their DTW distances to the standard time series of the six land cover types. The overall cropland extraction accuracy of ACE-DTW was 89.7%, which exceeded those of other supervised classifiers (classification and regression trees: 78.2%; support vector machines: 78.8%) and existing global cropland datasets (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover: 87.1%; Global Food Security Support Analysis Data: 83.1%). Further, ACE-DTW could produce relatively complete time series of variable cropland types, and thereby provide a significant advantage in mountain regions with small, fragmented croplands and plain regions with large, high-density patches of croplands.

TI  - Event-based dynamics of the soil water content at Alpine sites (Tyrol, Austria)
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the soil moisture content (SMC) for runoff processes and thus for flood prediction is rather undisputed; however, there are still gaps in our knowledge of the precipitation - soil moisture reaction pattern. A new event-based approach, using statistical methods to analyse monitoring data, is presented and applied for soil moisture data of three test sites, situated in different parts of the Tyrolean Alps (Austria).The analyses revealed a significant influence of the initial soil moisture on the remaining soil storage capacity. A comparison of the value pairs initial soil moisture and soil moisture difference (SMCmax caused by rain events minus initial SMC) resulted in funnel-shaped distributions, whereby the upper boundary of the data should roughly match the field capacity of the soils. For purposes of flood prediction, precipitation sums and initial conditions are the relevant variables, while precipitation duration, intensities, and antecedent precipitation have significantly less influence on SMC. However, the functions describing the relationship between precipitation and SMC showed poor model fits despite their significance.The linkage of soil moisture content between different depths, which, inter alia, are important when using remote sensing data for spatial SMC estimations, showed that the soil moisture conditions in the upper layer do not necessarily represent the water storage state of the deeper layers. The relation strongly depends on the kind of transition between the horizons, underlining the great importance of proper spatial information on soil characteristics.Approaches to estimate the initial SMC at the beginning of heavy rainfall events on the basis of antecedent precipitation sums are not very promising due to the weak relationships between these parameters.

TI  - Mapping Conservation Management Practices and Outcomes in the Corn Belt Using the Operational Tillage Information System (OpTIS) and the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) Model
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying and quantifying conservation-practice adoption in U.S. cropland is key to accurately monitoring trends in soil health regionally and nationally and informing climate change mitigation efforts. We present the results of an automated system used across 645 counties in the United States Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018, mapped at field-scale and summarized for distribution at aggregated scales. Large-scale mapping by OpTIS (Operational Tillage Information System), a software tool that analyzes remotely sensed data of agricultural land, provides trends of conservation tillage (defined as >30% residue cover), cover cropping, and crop rotations, while modeling by DNDC (Denitrification-Decomposition), a process-based model of carbon and biogeochemistry in soil, provides estimates of the ecosystem outcomes associated with the changes in management practices mapped by OpTIS. Ground-truthing data acquired via OpTIS mobile, a roadside field-surveying app, were used for verification in 30 counties. OpTIS results for the Corn Belt show adoption of cover crops after planting corn and soy increased from 1% to 3% of the mapped area when comparing 2006 to 2018. Comparison of trends for conservation tillage use from 2006 to 2018 shows a slight decrease in conservation tillage adoption, from 46% to 44%. Results from DNDC show these soils sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) at an area-weighted mean change in SOC (dSOC) rate of 161 kgC/ha/year. Comparatively, in a scenario modeled without the adoption of soil health management practices, the same soils would have lost SOC at an area-weighted rate of -65 kgC/ha/year. As many factors affect changes to SOC, including climate and initial SOC in soils, modeling counterfactual scenarios at the field scale demonstrates outcomes of current soil health management in comparison to regional management practices and best management practices, with respect to SOC sequestration. Regional trends in adoption rates of conservation agriculture and resulting soil health implications are of great use for a wide range of stakeholders. We demonstrate the capability of OpTIS remote sensing to deliver robust, large-scale, multi-sensor, ground-verified monitoring data of current and historical adoption of conservation practices, and of DNDC process-based modeling to provide assessments of the associated environmental outcomes across regions in U.S. cropland.

TI  - Does a Science-Oriented Worldview Entail Unbelief? <i>Meaning</i>, <i>Morality</i>, <i>and Continuity from Scientific Research in Self</i>-<i>Reports of Finnish Unbelievers and Believers</i>
T2  - SECULAR STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Endorsement of science is often associated with non-religiosity and lack of supernatural belief. However, the relevance of science for worldviews might also relate to the cultural context and/or personal investment in science. This study investigates the following question: Is endorsement of worldview components of science associated with unbelief among science-oriented respondents? Here, worldview components refer to science providing 1) a sense of meaning, 2) moral standards, and 3) literal or symbolic continuity after death. 387 Finnish adults recruited via pro-research organizations were included in the analysis. The results suggest that self-reported worldview functions of science are associated with unbelief also among science-oriented individuals. These findings lend support to the belief replacement hypothesis, which suggests that secular worldviews such as belief in science are of particular importance for unbelievers. However, the effect sizes are small and also other God belief groups endorse the significance of science for e.g., meaning in life.

TI  - Land Subsidence Susceptibility Mapping in Jakarta Using Functional and Meta-Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithm Based on Time-Series InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas at risk of land subsidence in Jakarta can be identified using a land subsidence susceptibility map. This study evaluates the quality of a susceptibility map made using functional (logistic regression and multilayer perceptron) and meta-ensemble (AdaBoost and LogitBoost) machine learning algorithms based on a land subsidence inventory map generated using the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset from 2017 to 2020. The land subsidence locations were assessed using the time-series interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method based on the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) algorithm. The mean vertical deformation maps from ascending and descending tracks were compared and showed a good correlation between displacement patterns. Persistent scatterer points with mean vertical deformation value were randomly divided into two datasets: 50% for training the susceptibility model and 50% for validating the model in terms of accuracy and reliability. Additionally, 14 land subsidence conditioning factors correlated with subsidence occurrence were used to generate land subsidence susceptibility maps from the four algorithms. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the AdaBoost algorithm has higher subsidence susceptibility prediction accuracy (81.1%) than the multilayer perceptron (80%), logistic regression (79.4%), and LogitBoost (79.1%) algorithms. The land subsidence susceptibility map can be used to mitigate disasters caused by land subsidence in Jakarta, and our method can be applied to other study areas.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in Brazil: results from two successive nationwide serological household surveys
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Population-based data on COVID-19 are essential for guiding policies. There are few such studies, particularly from low or middle-income countries. Brazil is currently a hotspot for COVID-19 globally. We aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody prevalence by city and according to sex, age, ethnicity group, and socioeconomic status, and compare seroprevalence estimates with official statistics on deaths and cases.Methods In this repeated cross-sectional study, we did two seroprevalence surveys in 133 sentinel cities in all Brazilian states. We randomly selected households and randomly selected one individual from all household members. We excluded children younger than 1 year. Presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a lateral flow point-of-care test, the WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo Biotech, Guangzhou, China), using two drops of blood from finger prick samples. This lateral-flow assay detects IgG and IgM isotypes that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Participants also answered short questionnaires on sociodemographic information (sex, age, education, ethnicity, household size, and household assets) and compliance with physical distancing measures.Findings We included 25 025 participants in the first survey (May 14-21) and 31165 in the second (June 4-7). For the 83 (62%) cities with sample sizes of more than 200 participants in both surveys, the pooled seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.7-2.1) to 3.1% (2.8-3.4). City-level prevalence ranged from 0% to 25.4% in both surveys. 11(69%) of 16 cities with prevalence above 2.0% in the first survey were located in a stretch along a 2000 km of the Amazon river in the northern region. In the second survey, we found 34 cities with prevalence above 2.0%, which included the same 11 Amazon cities plus 14 from the northeast region, where prevalence was increasing rapidly. Prevalence levels were lower in the south and centre-west, and intermediate in the southeast, where the highest level was found in Rio de Janeiro (7.5% [4.2-12.2]). In the second survey, prevalence was similar in men and women, but an increased prevalence was observed in participants aged 20-59 years and those living in crowded conditions (4.4% [3.5-5.6] for those living with households with six or more people). Prevalence among Indigenous people was 6.4% (4.1-9.4) compared with 1.4% (1.2-1.7) among White people. Prevalence in the poorest socioeconomic quintile was 3.7% (3- 2-4.3) compared with 1.7% (1.4-2-2) in the wealthiest quintile.Interpretation Antibody prevalence was highly heterogeneous by country region, with rapid initial escalation in Brazil's north and northeast. Prevalence is strongly associated with Indigenous ancestry and low socioeconomic status. These population subgroups are unlikely to be protected if the policy response to the pandemic by the national government continues to downplay scientific evidence. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Effects of small crystallite size on the thermal infrared (vibrational) spectra of minerals
T2  - AMERICAN MINERALOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared (TIR, or vibrational) emission spectra of a suite of synthetic Mg-Fe olivines exhibit notable differences from their natural igneous counterparts in terms of their band shapes, relative depths, and reduced shifts in some band positions with Mg-Fe solid solution. Comparable reflectance spectra acquired from olivine-dominated matrices and fusion crusts of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites exhibit similar deviations. Here we show that these unusual spectral characteristics are consistent with crystallite sizes much smaller than the resolution limit of infrared light. We hypothesize that these small crystallites denote abbreviated crystal growth and also may be linked to the size of nucleation sites. Other silicates and non-silicates, such as carbonates, exhibit similar spectral behaviors. Because the spectra of mineral separates are commonly used in the modeling and analysis of comparable bulk rock, meteorite, and remote sensing data, understanding these spectral variations is important to correctly identifying the minerals and interpreting the origin and/or secondary processing histories of natural materials.

TI  - What factors determine the mass elevation effect of the Tibetan Plateau?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mass elevation effect (MEE) of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has attracted the attention of geographers because of its significant influence on the Asian climate, snow line, timberline, and other important climate-ecological boundaries of the plateau and on global ecological patterns. In recent years, much progress has been made in quantifying the MEE of TP. However, factors that affect the size of MEE have not been examined in depth, and the key factors still remain unclear. Based on quantification of MEE for each mountain basal elevation plot, this study identifies the factors that contribute significantly to MEE of the plateau. Seven factors are considered, including mountain basal elevation, distance from the core zone of MEE, thermal continentality, maximum elevation, height difference, area, and difference of underlying surface (with the yearly max "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index" (NDVI) serving as a quantitative indicator). We also used these seven factors as independent variables to develop a multiple linear regression model for MEE of the plateau. Results show that: (1) the determination coefficient (R-2) of the model reaches as high as 0.877, and the contributions of mountain basal elevation, distance from the core zone of MEE, thermal continentality, maximum elevation, topographical height difference, area, and NDVI are 39.77%, 23.02%, 14.48%, 5.78%, 11.41%, 2.92%, and 2.62%, respectively, with mountain basal elevation and the distance from the core of MEE as the most important factors; (2) thermal continentality and MEE are significantly correlated, and maximum elevation only has a coupling relationship with MEE, with height difference and NDVI contributing little to MEE. This study deepens our understanding of MEE and its forming factors in the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Irradiance Restoration Based Shadow Compensation Approach for High Resolution Multispectral Satellite Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous applications are hindered by shadows in high resolution satellite remote sensing images, like image classification, target recognition and change detection. In order to improve remote sensing image utilization, significant importance appears for restoring surface feature information under shadow regions. Problems inevitably occur for current shadow compensation methods in processing high resolution multispectral satellite remote sensing images, such as color distortion of compensated shadow and interference of non-shadow. In this study, to further settle these problems, we analyzed the surface irradiance of both shadow and non-shadow areas based on a satellite sensor imaging mechanism and radiative transfer theory, and finally develop an irradiance restoration based (IRB) shadow compensation approach under the assumption that the shadow area owns the same irradiance to the nearby non-shadow area containing the same type features. To validate the performance of the proposed IRB approach for shadow compensation, we tested numerous images of WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 acquired at different sites and times. We particularly evaluated the shadow compensation performance of the proposed IRB approach by qualitative visual sense comparison and quantitative assessment with two WorldView-3 test images of Tripoli, Libya. The resulting images automatically produced by our IRB method deliver a good visual sense and relatively low relative root mean square error (rRMSE) values. Experimental results show that the proposed IRB shadow compensation approach can not only compensate information of surface features in shadow areas both effectively and automatically, but can also well preserve information of objects in non-shadow regions for high resolution multispectral satellite remote sensing images.

TI  - Ground Deformation of Wuhan, China, Revealed by Multi-Temporal InSAR Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wuhan, the largest city in central China, has experienced rapid urban development leading to land subsidence as well as environmental concerns in recent years. Although a few studies have analyzed the land subsidence of Wuhan based on ALOS-1, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 datasets, the research on long-term land subsidence is still lacking. In this study, we employed multi-temporal InSAR to investigate and reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of land subsidence over Wuhan with ALOS-1, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 images from 2007-2010, 2008-2010, 2015-2019, respectively. The results detected by InSAR were cross-validated by two independent SAR datasets, and leveling observations were applied to the calibration of InSAR-derived measurements. The correlation coefficient between the leveling and InSAR has reached 0.89. The study detected six main land subsidence zones during the monitoring period, with the maximum land subsidence velocity of -46 mm/a during the 2015-2019 analysis. Both the magnitude and the extent of the land subsidence have reduced since 2017. The causes of land subsidence are discussed in terms of urban construction, Yangtze river water level changes, and subsurface water level changes. Our results provide insight for understanding the causes of land subsidence in Wuhan and serve as reference for city management for reducing the land subsidence in Wuhan and mitigating the potential hazards.

TI  - Brain metastasis from extramammary Paget's disease
T2  - NAGOYA JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we present a case of extramammary Paget's disease with brain metastasis that was diagnosed pathologically for the first time in Japan. Moreover, invasive extramammary Paget's disease (with distant metastasis) highly resistant to treatment. Only for brain metastasis, we may control the tumor by surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRT) for the treatment of intracranial metastases was assessed.An 76-year-old man was diagnosed with extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva at nearby hospital. Surgical resection and sentinel lymph node dissection were then performed, and the patient received chemotherapy because multiple lymph node metastases were suspected. The patient's response to chemotherapy was poor, and he was in the state of Progressive Disease. He complained of dyslexia and was referred to another hospital when he was 81 years old. Plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted, and two brain tumors in the vicinity of the left cerebellar tent were suspected.In our hospital, gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI was performed and showed a tumor in the cerebellum (left posterior temporal lobe) and another tumor under the tent (left cerebellar hemisphere). Significant edema was also noted. Based on these findings, the intracranial lesion was diagnosed as metastatic brain tumor. The pathological diagnosis was brain metastasis from extramammary Paget's disease. Postoperative intracranial residual disease was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. MRI showed that the size of the cerebellar lesions decreased, and no recurrence of cerebral lesions was observed. SRT for extracranial lymph node metastases was performed.Mass reduction and SRT may be the best way to treat brain metastasis from extramammary Paget's disease.

TI  - Primary dermal melanoma: clinical behaviour, prognosis and treatment
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Primary dermal melanoma (PDM) is a subtype of cutaneous melanoma, confined to the dermis, which poses a challenging clinical dilemma. It may represent a true primary melanoma or a dermal cutaneous metastasis. This study aimed to delineate the histopathological characteristics and prognosis of PDM in a large patient cohort to guide appropriate treatment strategies.Methods: A search of the Melanoma Research Database at Melanoma Institute Australia was conducted to identify all possible PDM patients at our institution diagnosed from 1978 to 2013. Overall, melanoma-specific and disease-free survival outcomes of the PDM group were compared to those of similar cohorts of Stage I-II and Stage IV M1a melanoma patients based on propensity score matching.Results: Sixty-two PDM patients were identified from the MRD with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Five-year survival was 87.1% and overall survival was 74.2%. PDMs had a significantly improved overall survival (p = 0.0002) and melanoma-specific survival (p = 0.001) compared to Stage I-II controls, however there was no difference in disease-free survival (p = 0.08). PDMs also demonstrated improved overall survival (p < 0.0001), melanoma-specific survival (p < 0.0001) and disease-free survival (p <0.0001) compared to Stage IV M1a controls.Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that PDMs have a more favorable prognosis compared to stage I-II cutaneous melanomas and suggest that these are in fact true primary lesions. This study thus provides evidence to justify a treatment approach, by way of a wide local excision and possibly sentinel lymph node biopsy, as for early stage primary cutaneous melanomas.

TI  - Assessment of Landsat-Based Evapotranspiration Using Weighing Lysimeters in the Texas High Plains
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the largest data gaps in water management due to the limited availability of measured evapotranspiration data, and because ET spatial variability is difficult to characterize at various scales. Satellite-based ET estimation has been shown to have great potential for water resource planning and for estimating agricultural water use at field, watershed, and regional scales. Satellites with low spatial resolution, such as NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and those with higher spatial resolution, such as Landsat (Land Satellite), can potentially be used for irrigation water management purposes and other agricultural applications. The objective of this study is to assess satellite based-ET estimation accuracy using measured ET from large weighing lysimeters. Daily, seven-day running average, monthly, and seasonal satellite-based ET data were compared with corresponding lysimeter ET data. This study was performed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) in Bushland, Texas, USA. The daily time series Landsat ET estimates were characterized as poor for irrigated fields, with a Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) of 0.37, and good for monthly ET, with an NSE of 0.57. For the dryland managed fields, the daily and monthly ET estimates were unacceptable with an NSE of -1.38 and -0.19, respectively. There are various reasons for these results, including uncertainties with remotely sensed data due to errors in aerodynamic resistance surface roughness length estimation, surface temperature deviations between irrigated and dryland conditions, poor leaf area estimation in the METRIC model under dryland conditions, extended gap periods between satellite data, and using the linear interpolation method to extrapolate daily ET values between two consecutive scenes (images).

TI  - Gap-Free Monitoring of Annual Mangrove Forest Dynamics in Ca Mau Province, Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Using the Landsat-7-8 Archives and Post-Classification Temporal Optimization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services offered by mangrove forests are facing severe risks, particularly through land use change driven by human development. Remote sensing has become a primary instrument to monitor the land use dynamics surrounding mangrove ecosystems. Where studies formerly relied on bi-temporal assessments of change, the practical limitations concerning data-availability and processing power are slowly disappearing with the onset of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud-computing services, such as in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). This paper combines the capabilities of GEE, including its entire Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 archives and state-of-the-art classification approaches, with a post-classification temporal analysis to optimize land use classification results into gap-free and consistent information. The results demonstrate its application and value to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove forests and land use changes in Ngoc Hien District, Ca Mau province, Vietnamese Mekong delta. The combination of repeated GEE classification output and post-classification optimization provides valid spatial classification (94-96% accuracy) and temporal interpolation (87-92% accuracy). The findings reveal that the net change of mangroves forests over the 2001-2019 period equals -0.01% annually. The annual gap-free maps enable spatial identification of hotspots of mangrove forest changes, including deforestation and degradation. Post-classification temporal optimization allows for an exploitation of temporal patterns to synthesize and enhance independent classifications towards more robust gap-free spatial maps that are temporally consistent with logical land use transitions. The study contributes to a growing body of work advocating full exploitation of temporal information in optimizing land cover classification and demonstrates its use for mangrove forest monitoring.

TI  - The Red Fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) as Sentinel for Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus in Endemic and Non-Endemic Areas
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most important viral zoonosis caused by a neurotropic arbovirus (TBEV). In Germany, TBE is classified as a notifiable disease with an average of 350 autochthonous human cases annually. The incidence-based risk assessment in Germany came under criticism because every year, a number of autochthonous human TBE cases have been detected outside of the official risk areas. Therefore, it is necessary to find additional parameters to strengthen TBEV surveillance. The aim of this study was to examine red foxes as sentinels for TBE. Thus far, there are no published data about the sensitivity and specificity for serological methods testing fox samples. Hence, we aimed to define a system for the screening of TBEV-specific antibodies in red foxes. A total of 1233 fox sera were collected and examined by ELISA and IIFA and confirmed by micro-NT. The overall seroprevalence of antibodies against TBEV in red foxes from Germany confirmed by micro-NT was 21.1%. The seroprevalence differed significantly between risk (30.5%) and non-risk areas (13.1%), with good correlations to local TBE incidence in humans. In conclusion, serological monitoring of red foxes represents a promising surrogate marker system and may even determine unexpected TBEV foci in regions currently regarded as non-risk areas.

TI  - Asymmetry of Daytime and Nighttime Warming in Typical Climatic Zones along the Eastern Coast of China and Its Influence on Vegetation Activities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this dissertation, the author adopted the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and meteorological data from 1982 to 2016 of the typical climate zones in coastal areas of China to analyze the influence of daytime and nighttime warming asymmetric changes in different seasons on vegetation activities during the growing season period according to the copula function theory optimized based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The seasonal daytime and nighttime warming trends of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Liaoning over the past 35 years were significant, and the daytime and nighttime warming rates were asymmetric. In spring and summer of Guangdong province, the warming rate in the daytime was higher than that at night, while, in autumn, the opposite law was observed. However, the warming rate in the daytime was lower than that at night in Jiangsu and Liaoning provinces. There were latitude differences in diurnal and nocturnal warming rate. (2) The daytime and nighttime warming influences on vegetation showed significant seasonal differences in these three regions. In Guangdong, the influence of nighttime warming on vegetation growth in spring is greater than that in summer, and the influences of daytime warming on vegetation growth from strong to weak were spring, summer and autumn. In Jiangsu, both the influences of daytime and nighttime warming on vegetation growth in summer were less than that in autumn. In Liaoning, both the influences of daytime and nighttime warming on vegetation growth from strong to weak were autumn, spring and summer. (3) In Guangdong, Jiangsu and Liaoning provinces, their maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) and the joint probability distribution functions of NDVI, all had little effect on NDVI when Tmax and Tmin respectively reached their minimum values, but their influences on NDVI were obvious when Tmax and Tmin respectively reached their maximum values. (4) The smaller the return period, the larger the range of climate factor and NDVI, which has indicated that when the climate factor is certain, the NDVI is more likely to have a smaller return period, and the frequency of NDVI over a certain period is higher. In addition, the larger the climate factor, the greater the return period is and NDVI is less frequent over a certain period of time. This research can help with deep understanding of the dynamic influence of seasonal daytime and nighttime asymmetric warming on the vegetation in typical coastal temperature zones of China under the background of global climate change.

TI  - Green Vegetation Cover Dynamics in a Heterogeneous Grassland: Spectral Unmixing of Landsat Time Series from 1999 to 2014
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to quantify green vegetation across space and over time is useful for studying grassland health and function and improving our understanding of the impact of land use and climate change on grasslands. Directly measuring the fraction of green vegetation cover is labor-intensive and thus only practical on relatively smaller experimental sites. Remote sensing vegetation indices, as a commonly-used method for large-area vegetation mapping, were found to produce inconsistent accuracies when mapping green vegetation in semi-arid grasslands, largely due to mixed pixels including both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic material. The spectral mixture approach has the potential to map the fraction of green vegetation cover in a heterogeneous landscape, thanks to its ability to decompose a spectral signal from a mixed pixel into a set of fractional abundances. In this study, a time series of fractional green vegetation cover (FGVC) from 1999 to 2014 is estimated using the spectral mixture approach for a semi-arid mixed grassland, which represents a typical threatened, species-rich habitat in Central Canada. The shape of pixel clouds in each of the Landsat images is used to identify three major image endmembers (green vegetation, bare soil/litter, and water/shadow) for automated image spectral unmixing. The FGVC derived through the spectral mixture approach correlates highly with field observations (R-2 = 0.86). Change in the FGVC over the study period was also mapped, and green vegetation in badlands and uplands is found to experience a slight increase, while vegetation in riparian zone shows a decrease. Only a small portion of the study area is undergoing significant changes, which is likely attributable to climate variability, bison reintroduction, and wildfire. The results of this study suggest that the automated spectral unmixing approach is promising, and the time series of medium-resolution images is capable of identifying changes in green vegetation cover in semi-arid grasslands. Further research should investigate driving forces for areas undergoing significant changes.

TI  - Multi-Segment Rupture Model of the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake Revealed by InSAR and GPS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, including two large (Mw >= 6.0) foreshocks and an Mw 7.0 mainshock, occurred in the Hinagu and Futagawa fault zones in the middle of Kyushu island, Japan. Here, we obtain the complex coseismic deformation field associated with this earthquake from Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) and Sentinel-1A Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. These InSAR data, in combination with available Global Positioning System (GPS) data, are then used to determine an optimal four-segment fault geometry with the jRi method, which considers both data misfit and the perturbation error from data noise. Our preferred slip distribution model indicates that the rupture is dominated by right-lateral strike-slip, with a significant normal slip component. The largest asperity is located on the northern segment of the Futagawa fault, with a maximum slip of 5.6 m at a 5-6 km depth. The estimated shallow slips along the Futagawa fault and northern Hinagu fault are consistent with the displacements of surface ruptures from the field investigation, suggesting a shallow slip deficit. The total geodetic moment release is estimated to be 4.89 x 10(19) Nm (Mw 7.09), which is slightly larger than seismological estimates. The calculated static Coulomb stress changes induced by the preferred slip distribution model cannot completely explain the spatial distribution of aftershocks. Sensitivity analysis of Coulomb stress change implies that aftershocks in the stress shadow area may be driven by aseismic creep or triggered by dynamic stress transfer, requiring further investigation.

AB  - Urbanization is a global trend determined primarily by excessive population growth, particularly in the developing countries such as Egypt. The configuration and boundaries of urbanization and their model can be observed at a distance of space and time. In this research, geographic information system and remote sensing were used to analyze urbanization and trends in the past 30 years of Mansoura City, which is one of the largest medium-sized cities in Egypt. Four Landsat images, obtained in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015, were adjusted and compared using the ArcGIS software. The classified images were analyzed to determine urbanization trends in Mansoura city during the three periods 1985-1995, 1995-2005 and 2005-2015. The results of the change disclosure showed areas and trends in urbanization. The urban area has grown by approximately five times over 30 years. The results showed that the eastern direction was predominant during the periods (1985-1995) and (1995-2005) with 53 and 53% of the city total growth, respectively. During the period (2005-2015), the northern trend was dominant with 38% of the city total growth. This research promotes future urban planning strategies by evaluating temporal spatial transformation and urbanization trends.

TI  - Comparing machine learning with case-control models to identify confirmed dengue cases
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the global incidence of dengue has increased. Affected countries have responded with more effective surveillance strategies to detect outbreaks early, monitor the trends, and implement prevention and control measures. We have applied newly developed machine learning approaches to identify laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from 4,894 emergency department patients with dengue-like illness (DLI) who received laboratory tests. Among them, 60.11% (2942 cases) were confirmed to have dengue. Using just four input variables [age, body temperature, white blood cells counts (WBCs) and platelets], not only the state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) prediction models but also the conventional decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) models delivered performances with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves areas under curves (AUCs) of the ranging from 83.75% to 85.87% [for DT, DNN and LR: 84.60% +/- 0.03%, 85.87% +/- 0.54%, 83.75% +/- 0.17%, respectively]. Subgroup analyses found all the models were very sensitive particularly in the pre-epidemic period. Pre-peak sensitivities (<35 weeks) were 92.6%, 92.9%, and 93.1% in DT, DNN, and LR respectively. Adjusted odds ratios examined with LR for low WBCs [<= 3.2 (x10(3)/mu L)], fever (>= 38 degrees C), low platelet counts [< 100 (x10(3)/mu L)], and elderly (>= 65 years) were 5.17 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.96-6.76], 3.17 [95%CI: 2.74-3.66], 3.10 [95%CI: 2.44-3.94], and 1.77 [95%CI: 1.50-2.10], respectively. Our prediction models can readily be used in resource-poor countries where viral/serologic tests are inconvenient and can also be applied for real-time syndromic surveillance to monitor trends of dengue cases and even be integrated with mosquito/environment surveillance for early warning and immediate prevention/control measures. In other words, a local community hospital/clinic with an instrument of complete blood counts (including platelets) can provide a sentinel screening during outbreaks. In conclusion, the machine learning approach can facilitate medical and public health efforts to minimize the health threat of dengue epidemics. However, laboratory confirmation remains the primary goal of surveillance and outbreak investigation.Author summaryIdentifying dengue cases early is crucial but challenging for healthcare professionals. This challenge is increased during large epidemics and is a particular problem in non-endemic areas with limited experienced staff. To improve dengue diagnosis, we investigated how to exploit machine learning (ML)-based prediction models and identified four key variables [age, fever, white blood cell counts (WBCs), and platelet counts], which are compatible with clinical and epidemiological knowledge. With these variables, the ML prediction models [decision tree (DT), deep neural network (DNN)] and the logistic regression model developed for identifying laboratory-confirmed dengue cases produced areas under curve (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves ranging from 83.75% to 85.87%. This implies that the prediction models may serve as a pivotal component of an integrated dengue surveillance system and they required only a single complete blood count (CBC) examination. The sensitivities, positive prediction values, and accuracies for major risk factors in the two machine learning models were close to those of the regression models. For future applications, the DNN models with superior performance can be employed at epidemic sites with adequate computer facilities, while the DT and regression models with interpretable prediction logic can be employed at sites with limited or no computer facilities. Artificial intelligence and clinical parameters identified from this study may aid when laboratories are overwhelmed, but should never replace laboratory confirmation.

TI  - Impact of Molecular Spectroscopy on Carbon Monoxide Abundances from TROPOMI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of SEOM-IAS (Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions-Improved Atmospheric Spectroscopy) spectroscopic information on CO columns from TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) shortwave infrared (SWIR) observations was examined. HITRAN 2016 (High Resolution Transmission) and GEISA 2015 (Gestion et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques Atmospheriques 2015) were used as a reference upon which the spectral fitting residuals, retrieval errors and inferred quantities were assessed. It was found that SEOM-IAS significantly improves the quality of the CO retrieval by reducing the residuals to TROPOMI observations. The magnitude of the impact is dependent on the climatological region and spectroscopic reference used. The difference in the CO columns was found to be rather small, although discrepancies reveal, for selected scenes, in particular, for observations with elevated molecular concentrations. A brief comparison to Total Column Carbon Observing Network (TCCON) and Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) also demonstrated that both spectroscopies cause similar columns; however, the smaller retrieval errors in the SEOM with Speed-Dependent Rautian and line-Mixing (SDRM) inferred CO turned out to be beneficial in the comparison of post-processed mole fractions with ground-based references.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A well-defined crystalline structure of zeolite-Y, having particles size in the range from 100 to 270nm, was prepared using hydrothermal method. The obtained zeolite was further used to fabricate polyamide-6/zeolite-Y (PA6/ZY) hybrid membranes. The addition of ZY modified the smooth surface of PA6 membrane, and the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of PA6/ZY became rough with increasing porosity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed an exfoliated structure of the hybrid membranes. Moreover, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of PA6/ZY membranes indicated the presence of some interaction between the PA6 and ZY, which was manifested itself by the slight increase in the intensity of PA6 bands after the addition of ZY.The results indicated that the tensile strength and failure strain decreased linearly with the increase of ZY content in the hybrid membranes. On the other hand, porosity and bubble point pore diameter increased gradually and reached a maximum when 4% ZY was added. It was concluded that 4%w loading of ZY in the hybrid membranes gave a balance of desirable properties and the hybrid membrane could be considered promising for water separation technology.

TI  - A spatial downscaling method for SMAP soil moisture through visible and shortwave-infrared remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an indispensable role in many practical applications, such as drought monitoring, hydrologic applications and agricultural management. Passive microwave remote sensing has proven capable of capturing changes in SM. However, the coarse spatial resolution (approximately 25-40 km) may greatly limit many regional hydrological and agricultural applications. In this study, we present a SM downscaling method based on the visible and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) remote sensing data toward improved spatial resolution of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM. In the proposed method, the Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), horizontally polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh), vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBv) and SWIR reflectance collected in Inner Mongolia from April to September 2018 and April to September 2019 are used as input data and combined with topographic information to downscale the SMAP SM L3 product from the original 36 km to 1 km. Random forest (RF) was used to link the input data and SMAP SM. Finally, 30 in situ station SM measurements distributed in Inner Mongolia and precipitation data were used to verify the downscaled SM. The results show that the correlation range of the downscaled SM and the in situ SM is 0.246 to 0.739, with an average of 0.535. The root mean square error (RMSE) range is 0.02 to 0.152 m(3)/m(3), and the mean RMSE is 0.059 m(3)/m(3). The ubRMSE has a range of 0.02 to 0.06 m(3)/m(3), and the mean performance is 0.04 m(3)/m(3). The bias ranges from - 0.145 to 0.087 m(3)/m(3), and the mean bias is 0.008 m(3)/m(3). The downscaled SMAP SM can capture the spatial heterogeneity of the SMAP SM and the dynamic changes in measured soil moisture. The downscaled SMAP SM also has a high spatial correspondence with the original SMAP SM, providing more detailed soil water information than the original 36 km resolution.

TI  - Managements of 13 emergency cardiac surgeries under COVID-19 pandemic in a Sentinel Hospital
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) creates many challenges for the healthcare sector. Currently, little is known of how the pandemic has impacted patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this study was to determine whether emergency cardiovascular surgeries can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: Between 17 January 2020 and 11 February 2020, 13 patients were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital for emergency cardiovascular surgery. During this time, Wuhan was a COVID-19 epicenter, and Wuhan Union Hospital is a sentinel hospital located in this area. These patients' epidemiological histories, clinical records, laboratory assessments, imaging findings, and surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Throat swabs were collected from some patients preoperatively and all patients postoperatively for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to determine whether these patients had COVID-19.Results: This cohort included 5 cases of acute aortic dissection, 3 cases of congenital heart disease, 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with end-stage heart failure, 1 case of aortocoronary fistula that had undergone previous surgery, 1 case of subacute infective endocarditis with cerebral infarction, and 1 case of multivessel coronary disease. Six patients were suspected COVID-19 cases (46.2%). There were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in this cohort. None of the patients in this cohort died and none developed severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure, or septic shock after surgery. No cross-infection occurred with other patients or medical staff who came into close contact with this cohort.Conclusions: Emergency surgery is crucial and unavoidable for many patients with acute and severe cardiovascular disease, regardless of the pandemic. Our study indicates that, with adequate preparation and the provision of appropriate treatment, satisfactory outcomes can be achieved for such patients.

TI  - Overwintering Distribution of Fall Armyworm (<i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>) in Yunnan, China, and Influencing Environmental Factors
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThe fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a nondiapausing insect pest capable of causing large reductions in the yield of crops, especially maize. Every year, the new generation of fall armyworms from Southeast Asia flies to East Asia via Yunnan, and some of them will grow, develop and reproduce in Yunnan since the geographical location and environmental conditions of Yunnan are very beneficial for the colonization of fall armyworms. This study explored the potential overwintering distribution of fall armyworms in Yunnan and the influence of environmental factors on its distribution. These results provide a basis for the precise prevention and control of fall armyworms by guiding management and decision-making and may facilitate meaningful reductions in pesticide application.The first fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) attack in Yunnan, China, occurred in January 2019. Because FAW lacks diapause ability, its population outbreaks largely depend on environmental conditions experienced during the overwinter months. Thus, there is an urgent need to make short-term predictions regarding the potential overwintering distribution of FAW to prevent outbreaks. In this study, we selected the MaxEnt model with the optimal parameter combination to predict the potential overwintering distribution of FAW in Yunnan. Remote sensing data were used in the prediction to provide real-time surface conditions. The results predict variation in the severity and geographic distribution of suitability. The high potential distribution shows a concentration in southwestern Yunnan that suitability continues to increase from January to March, gradually extending to eastern Yunnan and a small part of the northern areas. The monthly independent contributions of meteorological, vegetation, and soil factors were 30.6%, 16.5%, and 3.4%, respectively, indicating that the suitability of conditions for FAW was not solely dominated by the weather and that ground surface conditions also played a decisive role. These results provide a basis for the precise prevention and control of fall armyworms by guiding management and decision-making and may facilitate meaningful reductions in pesticide application.

TI  - Remote Estimation of Water Quality Parameters of Medium- and Small-Sized Inland Rivers Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the application of quantitative remote sensing in water quality monitoring, the existence of mixed pixels greatly affects the accuracy of water quality parameter inversion, especially for narrow inland rivers. Improving the image spatial resolution and weakening the interference of mixed pixels in the image are some of the urgent problems to be solved in the study of water quality monitoring of medium- and small-sized inland rivers. We processed Sentinel-2 multispectral images using the super-resolution algorithm and generated a set of 10 m spatial resolution images with basically unchanged reflection characteristics. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show that the super-resolution algorithm can weaken the influence of mixed pixels while maintaining spectral invariance. Before the application of the super-resolution algorithm, the inversion accuracy of water quality parameters in this study were as follows: for NH3-N, the R-2 was 0.61, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.177 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 29.33%; for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), the R-2 was 0.26, the RMSE was 0.756 and the MAPE was 4.62%; for Total Phosphorus (TP), the R-2 was 0.69, the RMSE was 0.032 and the MAPE was 30.58%. After the application of the super-resolution algorithm, the inversion accuracy of water quality parameters in this study were as follows: for NH3-N, the R-2 was 0.67, the RMSE was 0.161 and the MAPE was 25.88%; for COD, the R-2 was 0.53, the RMSE was 0.546 and the MAPE was 3.36%; for TP, the R-2 was 0.60, the RMSE was 0.034 and the MAPE was 24.28%. Finally, the spatial distribution of NH3-N, COD and TP was obtained by using a machine learning model. The results showed that the application of the super-resolution algorithm can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy of NH3-N, COD and TP, which illustrates the application potential of the super-resolution algorithm in water quality remote sensing quantitative monitoring.

TI  - Mapping Tree Species Deciduousness of Tropical Dry Forests Combining Reflectance, Spectral Unmixing, and Texture Data from High-Resolution Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical dry forests, deciduousness (i.e., leaf shedding during the dry season) is an important adaptation of plants to cope with water limitation, which helps trees adjust to seasonal drought. Deciduousness is also a critical factor determining the timing and duration of carbon fixation rates, and affecting energy, water, and carbon balance. Therefore, quantifying deciduousness is vital to understand important ecosystem processes in tropical dry forests. The aim of this study was to map tree species deciduousness in three types of tropical dry forests along a precipitation gradient in the Yucatan Peninsula using Sentinel-2 imagery. We propose an approach that combines reflectance of visible and near-infrared bands, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), spectral unmixing deciduous fraction, and several texture metrics to estimate the spatial distribution of tree species deciduousness. Deciduousness in the study area was highly variable and decreased along the precipitation gradient, while the spatial variation in deciduousness among sites followed an inverse pattern, ranging from 91.5 to 43.3% and from 3.4 to 9.4% respectively from the northwest to the southeast of the peninsula. Most of the variation in deciduousness was predicted jointly by spectral variables and texture metrics, but texture metrics had a higher exclusive contribution. Moreover, including texture metrics as independent variables increased the variance of deciduousness explained by the models from R-2 = 0.56 to R-2 = 0.60 and the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced from 16.9% to 16.2%. We present the first spatially continuous deciduousness map of the three most important vegetation types in the Yucatan Peninsula using high-resolution imagery.

TI  - Dark Glacier Surface of Greenland's Largest Floating Tongue Governed by High Local Deposition of Dust
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface melt, driven by atmospheric temperatures and albedo, is a strong contribution of mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In the past, black carbon, algae and other light-absorbing impurities were suggested to govern albedo in Greenland's ablation zone. Here we combine optical (MODIS/Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) remote sensing data with airborne radar and laser scanner data, and engage firn modelling to identify the governing factors leading to dark glacier surfaces in Northeast Greenland. After the drainage of supraglacial lakes, the former lake ground is a clean surface represented by a high reflectance in Sentinel-2 data and aerial photography. These bright spots move with the ice flow and darken by more than 20% over only two years. In contrast, sites further inland do not exhibit this effect. This finding suggests that local deposition of dust, rather than black carbon or cryoconite formation, is the governing factor of albedo of fast-moving outlet glaciers. This is in agreement with a previous field study in the area which finds the mineralogical composition and grain size of the dust comparable with that of the surrounding soils.

TI  - Using GIS tools to detect the land use/land cover changes during forty years in Lodhran District of Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change has serious implications for environment as LULC is directly related to land degradation over a period of time and results in many changes in the environment. Monitoring the locations and distributions of LULC changes is important for establishing links between regulatory actions, policy decisions, and subsequent LULC activities. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has the potential ability to identify the vegetation features of various eco-regions and provides valuable information as a remote sensing tool in studying vegetation phenology cycles. Similarly, the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) may be used for quoting built-up land. This study aims to detect the pattern of LULC, NDBI, and NDVI change in Lodhran district, Pakistan, from the Landsat images taken over 40 years, considering four major LULC types as follows: water bodies, built-up area, bare soil, and vegetation. Supervised classification was applied to detect LULC changes observed over Lodhran district as it explains the maximum likelihood algorithm in software ERDAS imagine 15. Most farmers (46.6%) perceived that there have been extreme changes of onset of temperature, planting season, and less precipitation amount in Lodhran district in the last few years. In 2017, building areas increased (4.3%) as compared to 1977. NDVI values for Lodhran district were highest in 1977 (up to + 0.86) and lowest in 1997 (up to - 0.33). Overall accuracy for classification was 86% for 1977, 85% for 1987, 86% for 1997, 88% for 2007, and 95% for 2017. LULC change with soil types, temperature, and NDVI, NDBI, and slope classes was common in the study area, and the conversions of bare soil into vegetation area and built-up area were major changes in the past 40 years in Lodhran district. Lodhran district faces rising temperatures, less irrigation water, and low rainfall. Farmers are aware of these climatic changes and are adapting strategies to cope with the effects but require support from government.

TI  - Invariability of Arctic Top-of-Atmosphere Radiative Response to Surface Temperature Changes
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have used satellite data to estimate the response of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes to surface temperature changes in the Arctic. The satellite-observed radiative response is indicative of Arctic climate sensitivity that determines future Arctic warming. However, it remains ambiguous whether the satellite-observed radiative response is invariable because the time period covered by satellite data reflects a rapidly changing transient Arctic climate state with considerable sea ice loss. Using NASA's Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations from 2000 to 2018, this study evaluates the invariability of the radiative response by comparing the radiative response of the high sea ice concentration (SIC) period to that of the low SIC period. The results show that the net radiative response remains approximately unchanged regardless of the SIC (-0.19 +/- 0.44 and 0.15 +/- 0.16 W m(-2) K-1 for high and low SIC periods, respectively). In addition, seven of the 11 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) demonstrated that the modeled radiative responses are stable. The ERA-interim reanalysis estimates show that regionally confined changes in individual radiative feedbacks such as albedo, lapse rate, water vapor, and clouds do not vary considerably. Consequently, we infer that the radiative response in the Arctic may remain stable even under rapid Arctic climate change. Hence, the Arctic climate sensitivity can be quantified with present satellite observations.

TI  - Development of the Mesoscale Cyclone of September 1-3, 2015, according to Satellite and Numerical Simulation Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A mesoscale cyclone, which developed in early September 2015 over the ice-free Laptev Sea and then, gradually intensifying, moved towards the East Siberian Sea, has been studied using the WRF model and satellite data. It is shown that the interaction between the cyclone and the underlying surface, in particular, both sensible and latent heat fluxes from the sea surface and the presence/absence of the sea ice in the East Siberian Sea, had no significant effect on the intensification of the cyclone. It is found that the main reason for the cyclone intensification was baroclinic instability, i.e., interaction with an upper level potential vorticity anomaly. It is also shown that the main reason for the formation of the warm core in the cyclone was the transport of relatively warm surface air masses from the land to the sea, and the release of latent heat during convection was of minor importance.

TI  - Epidemiologic surveillance for controlling Covid-19 pandemic: types, challenges and implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - The objectives of the study was to determine the types, challenges and implications of surveillance methods for controlling Covid-19 pandemic. An integrative article review was done. The source of data were documents from WHO, Euro-surveillance, CDC, Saudi CDC, MOH, and journals from PubMed, Medline, etc. The inclusion searching criteria were surveillance, Covid-19, types, benefits and challenges, during the period 2005-2020. Published studies, reviews and guidelines that determined these criteria were collected. Data extraction and analysis were completed for all included articles. A critical appraisal was done based on the University of Michigan Practice Guideline's levels of evidence. The final sample for the integrative review comprised 30 studies. Results revealed that types of Covid-9 surveillance includes routine surveillance (comprehensive, case-based, and aggregated weakly methods), active, wildlife, syndromic, sentinel and sentinel-syndromic methods. Laboratory and hospital-based surveillance are another important types. Help-lines, surveys, participatory electronic, digital and event-based surveillance are relatively new cost-effective methods. Many surveillance indicators can be calculated. Timely and accurate of surveillance data is an essential element for effective Covid-19 interventions. Regarding challenges, the quality of surveillance in developing countries is constrained by resources and training. The main limitations of surveillance are under-ascertainment/under-reporting, lack of timeliness and completeness of surveillance data. In conclusion, surveillance is a cornerstones for controlling Covid-19 pandemic. Enhancing Covid-19 surveillance is vital for rapid cases detection, containing spread & ending pandemic.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Land Subsidence in the San Luis Potosi Valley Induced by Aquifer Overexploitation Using the Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT) and Sentinel-1 InSAR Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The San Luis Potosi metropolitan area has suffered considerable damage from land subsidence over the past decades, which has become visible since 1990. This paper seeks to evaluate the effects of groundwater withdrawal on land subsidence in the San Luis Potosi Valley and the development of surface faults due to the differential compaction of sediments. For this purpose, we applied the Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT), a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique, using 112 Sentinel-1 acquisitions from October 2014 to November 2019 to estimate the deformation rate. The results revealed that the deformation areas in the municipality of Soledad de Graciano Sanchez mostly exhibit subsidence values between -1.5 and -3.5 cm/year; whereas in San Luis Potosi these values are between -1.8 and -4.2 cm/year. The PSI results were validated by five Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) benchmarks available, providing a data correlation between the results obtained with both techniques of 0.986. This validation suggests that interferometric derived deformations agree well with results obtained from GNSS data. The strong relationship between trace fault, land subsidence,e and groundwater extraction suggests that groundwater withdrawal is resulting in subsidence induced faulting, which follows the pattern of structural faults buried by sediments.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural habitats are rapidly declining due to urbanisation, with a concomitant decline in biodiversity in highly urbanised areas. Yet thousands of different species have colonised urban environments. These organisms are exposed to novel urban conditions, which are sometimes beneficial, but most often challenging, such as increased ambient temperature, chemicals, noise and light pollution, dietary alterations and disturbance by humans. Given the fundamental role of physiological responses in coping with such conditions, certain physiological systems such as the redox system, metabolism and hormones are thought to specifically influence organisms' ability to persist and cope with urbanisation. However, these physiological systems often show mixed responses to urbanisation. Does this mean that some individuals, populations or species are resilient to the urban environmental challenges? Or is something missing from our analyses, leading us to erroneous conclusions regarding the impact of urbanisation? To understand the impact of urbanisation, I argue that a more integrated mechanistic and ecological approach is needed, along with experiments, in order to fully understand the physiological responses; without knowledge of their ecological and evolutionary context, physiological measures alone can be misinterpreted. Furthermore, we need to further investigate the causes of and capacity for individual plasticity in order to understand not only the impact of urbanisation, but also species resilience. I argue that abiotic and biotic urban factors can interact (e.g. pollution with micro- and macronutrients) to either constrain or relax individual physiological responses - and, thereby, plasticity - on a temporal and/or spatial scale, which can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the impact of urbanisation.

AB  - This study concerns the activities, forms, and spread of mud eruption in Ciuyah as a part of Java-Madura axial depression zone. Landsat interpretation and detailed field observation were conducted to find out the eruption activity, the conduit system, and the host rock. Both physical and chemical properties of erupted material were tested to track down the mud origin, movement dynamic, and changes during transportation. Active bubbling which bring fluid, claystone- to sandstone-size solid particles, gas, and heat as well as crusting material inside conduits are detected in Ciuyah. The high similarity of rock composition and fossil contained indicated that the mud comes far below the surface passes the rock layers of the Late Tertiary sedimentary rock (Pemali and Halang Formations), and then ejected to the surface through conduits. The temperature of extruded mud reaches 6.9 degrees to 13.6 degrees compared to air temperature (hyperthermal). Conduits where the mud comes out mostly show NW-SE direction as a minor pattern of existing morphological lineament directions. Changes seen in pH, TCD and EC, besides hydro-chemical composition (level of Na+, Cl-, SiO2, Mn2+, K+, L+, Fe3+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Ca2+ and SO4-) caused by water formation as well as minerals enrichment dissolved due to heat and long-time contact to the side rock during eruption.

TI  - Allometric equations coupled with remotely sensed variables to estimate carbon stocks in date palms
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at developing specific allometric biomass equations that can be integrated into a remote sensing (RS) based model for assessing carbon sequestered in date palms. Assessing the potential of date palms to improve soil carbon sequestration was another objective. In a previous study, the authors demonstrated that combinations of visible and short wave single bands (Red, SWIR1, SWIR2) besides vegetation indices (DVI, NDI and RVI) derived from Landsat imagery correlated significantly with date palms' biomass. Here and based on field and lab work, relevant structural variables were identified and used in the development of allometric equations. Results showed that the crown area (CA) best estimated both crown biomass (CB) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Likewise, the trunk height (Ht) was the best estimator of trunk biomass (TB). Using these variables, allometric equations were developed for date palms at different age stages and were used to estimate CB, TB and SOC with coefficients of determination (R-2) of: 0.884, 0.835 and 0.952, respectively. Furthermore, the average ratios of below ground biomass (BGB) to above ground biomass (AGB) varied with palm maturity stages averaging 0.332, 0.925 and 0.496 for young, medium and mature palms, respectively. Moreover, the present study demonstrated that the amounts of organic carbon (OC) stored in date palms were considerable with values of: 15.88 kg/palm for young, 96.62 kg/palm for medium, and 225.58 kg/palm for mature palms. Substantially higher amounts of SOC were measured compared to other local plants with values of: 18.092 kg/palm, 62.594 kg/palm, and 92.908 kg/palm under young, medium and mature palms, respectively. The main achievement of the current study was the development of new and unprecedented allometric equations for date palm species in arid land. Such equations allow the development and calibration of a RS-based model for estimating biomass and Carbon Sequestration (CS) of date palms in the region with high accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers avenues for fruitful engagement between international relations and public theology in order to ask what an ethical Christian response to global conflict should entail. The process of mediating principles of biblical justice into a contemporary international context requires interpretation in a reality of territorial bounded states, with rules and norms governing international interactions that are unique to the present day. This article draws on two theologically oriented contributions to international relations, Christian realism and political reconciliation to probe the question as to how we conceptualise justice as a pursuit in international relations from a Christian worldview. It reflects on the contingencies of the present-day context of global conflict, and the implications for praxis from a public theology standpoint.

TI  - Assessment the Influence of Climate and Human Activities in Vegetation Degradation using GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) reveals the plants capability to transform solar energy to photosynthesis. It can be used as an indicator of status of environmental processes affected by climate changes and human activities, especially in degraded areas such as Gadarif State, Sudan, where vegetation degradation has progressively taken place. In this study, three types of net primary productivity from 2000 to 2017 were used to assess the relative roles of climate variables and human activities on vegetation variability in the eastern part of Sudan (Gadarif State) by ordinary least-square regression technique. The three types of NPP are the actual NPP derived from MODIS data, potential NPP estimated using Thornthwaite memorial model and human-related NPP, the difference between the Potential NPP and actual NPP. The correlations between NPP and climate variables are calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results revealed that 91.7% of the study area has experienced vegetation degradation caused by human activities with a variation of 97.95% in NPP. In contrast, 8.3% of the study area has a recovery by 2.05% of increase in NPP favored by climate change. The main driving forces of vegetation degradation are human activities, and the dominant factor for vegetation reversion is climate. No clear interaction between the two factors (climate change and human activities) was observed in the study area throughout the period of study. Thus, we concluded that NPP is a good indicator for assessing the relative roles of climate changes and human activities in vegetation cover dynamics that has obviously occurred in almost all districts of Gadarif, Sudan.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil is a non-renewable and dynamic source that most of the human food supply comes from the soil, and one of the factors affecting soil degradation is soil salinity. The aim of this study was to predict the salinity expansion of Golpayegan's plain through estimated losses in vegetation cover and wetland area, using indices, and spatial techniques. The first 22 Landsat images were selected from 1985 to 2016. Two sets of maps, Soil Salinity Index (SSI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were extracted from the Landsat images. By using of two indices, the classification of these lands was carried out. These maps with six classes, vegetation, and salinity were entered into the Land Change Modeler (LCM). Smart modeling was continued by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network method. After validation of the model, the transition potential probability maps were prepared. By using the Cellular Automata (CA) Markov method, 2025 forecast map was obtained. The results showed that among different salinity indices, SSI6 was the best index. In the study area, the land changing to high salinity has occurred such that the low salinity classes are first obtained and gradually changed to medium and high salinity classes. There is a reverse relationship between vegetation density and soil salinity, that is, with wetland drying up and increasing salinity, the density of vegetation decreases. Decision-makers should be control of drainage networks and water resources exploitation to control the salinity expansion.

TI  - Global-Scale Patterns and Trends in Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations, 2005-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important air pollutant with both environmental and epidemiological effects. The main aim of this study is to analyze spatial patterns and temporal trends in tropospheric NO2 concentrations globally using data from the satellite-based Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Additional aims are to compare the satellite data with ground-based observations, and to find the timing and magnitude of greatest breakpoints in tropospheric NO2 concentrations for the time period 2005-2018. The OMI NO2 concentrations showed strong relationships with the ground-based observations, and inter-annual patterns were especially well reproduced. Eastern USA, Western Europe, India, China and Japan were identified as hotspot areas with high concentrations of NO2. The global average trend indicated slightly increasing NO2 concentrations (0.004 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) y(-1)) in 2005-2018. The contribution of different regions to this global trend showed substantial regional differences. Negative trends were observed for most of Eastern USA, Western Europe, Japan and for parts of China, whereas strong, positive trends were seen in India, parts of China and in the Middle East. The years 2005 and 2007 had the highest occurrence of negative breakpoints, but the trends thereafter in general reversed, and the highest tropospheric NO2 concentrations were observed for the years 2017-2018. This indicates that the anthropogenic contribution to air pollution is still a major issue and that further actions are necessary to reduce this contribution, having a substantial impact on human and environmental health.

AB  - The current study presents a novel combination of artificial neural network cross-validation (fourfold ANN-CV) with a hybrid analytic hierarchy process-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (AHPTOPSIS) method to improve the earthquake risk assessment (ERA) and applied it to Aceh, Indonesia, to test the model. Recent studies have suggested that neural networks improve probability mapping in a city scale. The network architecture design with probability index remains unexplored in earthquake-based probability studies. This study explored and specified the major indicators needed to improve the predictive accuracy in probability mapping. First, probability mapping was conducted and used for hazard assessment in the next step. Second, a vulnerability map was created based on social and structural factors. Finally, hazard and vulnerability indices were multiplied to produce the ERA, and the population and areas under risk were calculated. Results show that the proposed model achieves 85.4% accuracy, and its consistency ratio is 0.06. Risk varies from very high to high in the city center, approximately covering an area of 23% (14.82 km(2)) and a total population of 54,695. The model's performance changes on the basis of the input parameters, indicating the selection and importance of input layers on network architecture selection. The proposed model is found to generalize better results than traditional and some existing probabilistic models. The proposed model is simple and transferable to other regions by localizing the input parameters that contribute to earthquake risk mitigation and prevention planning.

AB  - The evaluation of decadal climate predictions against observations is crucial for their benefit to stakeholders. While the skill of such forecasts has been verified for several atmospheric variables, land hydrological states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) have not been extensively investigated yet due to a lack of long observational records. Anomalies of TWS are globally observed with the satellite missions GRACE(2002-2017) and GRACE-FO(since 2018). By means of a GRACE-like reconstruction of TWS available over 41 years, we demonstrate that this data type can be used to evaluate the skill of decadal prediction experiments made available from different Earth system models as part of both CMIP5 and CMIP6. Analysis of correlation and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) reveals that for the global land average the initialized simulations outperform the historical experiments in the first three forecast years. This predominance originates mainly from equatorial regions where we assume a longer influence of initialization due to longer soil memory times. Evaluated for individual grid cells, the initialization has a largely positive effect on the forecast year 1 TWS states; however, a general grid-scale prediction skill for TWS of more than 2 years could not be identified in this study for CMIP5. First results from decadal hindcasts of three CMIP6 models indicate a predictive skill comparable to CMIP5 for the multimodel mean in general, and a distinct positive influence of the improved soil-hydrology scheme implemented in the MPI-ESM for CMIP6 in particular.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis concerning near-infrared imaging with fluorescent agents to identify the sentinel lymph node in oncology patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel node procedures (SNP) are performed with the use of tracer-agents, mainly radio-colloid and/or blue dye. Fluorescent agents have emerged as a new tracer-agent to identify the SLN intra-operatively with near-infrared imaging. Our aim is to compare the detection rate of fluorescent agents to current "golden standards" (blue dye and/or radio-colloid) for the SNP by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis without any restrictions based on tumor type.A systematic search in PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library was performed. Articles that compared the detection rates of fluorescent agents with radio-colloid and/or blue dye were included. Meta-analyses were performed for breast, gynecological and dermatological cancer using a random effects model.In total 6195 articles were screened which resulted in a final inclusion of 55 articles. All studies used indocyanine green (ICG) as fluorescent agent. Meta-analyses comparing ICG with blue dye showed a significant and clinically relevant difference in detection rate in favor of ICG, for both breast, dermatological and gynecological cancer. Meta-analyses comparing ICG with radio-colloid did not show any significant differences, with the exception of ICG versus radio-colloid + blue dye for the bilateral SLN detection in gynecological cancer.Near-infrared fluorescence imaging using ICG provides a higher detection rate compared to blue dye for the SNP in a range of different tumor types. SLN detection rates of ICG are comparable to radiocolloid. Due to their complementary characteristics in terms of spatial resolution and transdermal sensitivity, we suggest to use a combination of both ICG and a radio-colloid. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Observation of thermosphere and ionosphere using the ionosphere PhotoMeter (IPM) on the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-3D
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ionosphere PhotoMeter (IPM) is a far ultraviolet nadir-viewing photometer that flew aboard the second-generation, polar orbiting Chinese meteorological satellite Feng-Yun 3D (FY-3D), which was launched on November 25th, 2017. By observing far ultraviolet night-time OI 135.6 nm emissions, which are produced by the recombination of O+ ions and electrons, the F-2 layer peak electron density (NmF2) can be deduced. During daytime IPM was designed to measure the OI 135.6 nm and N-2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band emissions, which would be used to infer the O/N-2 ratio, a key diagnostic of neutral dynamics in the daytime. The paper shows the measurement results from IPM taken during its initial months of Operation. A quantitative comparison showing NmF2 from IPM and ground-based ionosondes is presented, and the correlation value R between the ground-based ionosondes and the satellite NmF2 is 0.91. The global O/N-2 ratio distribution during geomagnetic storm on 25 through 30 August is presented and illustrated, which could show the latitudes of the ionospheric positive/negative storm in different longitude ranges. The O/N-2 ratio significantly decreases during the main and recovery phase of the storm as expected. The correlation value R between the O/N-2 ratio retrieved from IPM data and the ionospheric electron density provided by ground-based ionosondes during storms in August 2018 is about 0.78.

TI  - Use of an Active Canopy Sensor Mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to Monitor the Growth and Nitrogen Status of Winter Wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing to rapidly acquire large-area crop growth information (e.g., shoot biomass, nitrogen status) is an urgent demand for modern crop production; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acts as an effective monitoring platform. In order to improve the practicability and efficiency of UAV based monitoring technique, four field experiments involving different nitrogen (N) rates (0-360 kg N ha(-1)) and seven winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties were conducted at different eco-sites (Sihong, Rugao, and Xinghua) during 2015-2019. A multispectral active canopy sensor (RapidSCAN CS-45; Holland Scientific Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) mounted on a multirotor UAV platform was used to collect the canopy spectral reflectance data of winter wheat at key growth stages, three growth parameters (leaf area index (LAI), leaf dry matter (LDM), plant dry matter (PDM)) and three N indicators (leaf N accumulation (LNA), plant N accumulation (PNA) and N nutrition index (NNI)) were measured synchronously. The quantitative linear relationships between spectral data and six growth indices were systematically analyzed. For monitoring growth and N nutrition status at Feekes stages 6.0-10.0, 10.3-11.1 or entire growth stages, red edge ratio vegetation index (RERVI), red edge chlorophyll index (CIRE) and difference vegetation index (DVI) performed the best among the red edge band-based and red-based vegetation indices, respectively. Across all growth stages, DVI was highly correlated with LAI (R-2 = 0.78), LDM (R-2 = 0.61), PDM (R-2 = 0.63), LNA (R-2 = 0.65) and PNA (R-2 = 0.73), whereas the relationships between RERVI (R-2 = 0.62), CIRE (R-2 = 0.62) and NNI had high coefficients of determination. The developed models performed better in monitoring growth indices and N status at Feekes stages 10.3-11.1 than Feekes stages 6.0-10.0. To sum it up, the UAV-mounted active sensor system is able to rapidly monitor the growth and N nutrition status of winter wheat and can be deployed for UAV-based remote-sensing of crops.

TI  - Delineation of built-up land change from SAR stack by analysing the coefficient of variation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One main challenge in detecting built-up land cover changes using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments is that complicated backscattering behaviours and the superimposition of speckles on rich textures cause a large number of false alarms. Using trajectory-based analyses from time-series SAR imagery can mitigate false alarms since the temporal variability in backscattering during construction improves discrimination capability. This paper presents an approach towards the detection of built-up land change based on a single-channel SAR stack. The proposed methodology includes the generation of a change indicator, the Markov modelling procedure and the delineation of changes over built-up areas. The generation of the change indicator aims to provide a feature with abundant contrast between changed and stable areas, a high signal-to-noise ratio and detail preservation. To this end, all temporal information is converted into a map of the coefficient of variation. After error removal, this change detector is combined with a Markov random field (MRF) criterion function. Rather than MRF modelling by iteration with very complex stochastic models, we propose using SAR temporal trajectory under a hypothesis test framework and interferometric coherence series to establish conditional density for each class. Then, the Graph-cuts theory is applied to delineate the boundary between changed and stable areas, followed by a binary classification procedure based on speckle divergence to exclude natural areas. The technique is tested on both synthetic data and two TerraSAR-X datasets covering representative areas with rich texture. We found that in a complex built environment that is challenging for classical change indicators and state-of-the-art techniques, the presented method can provide smaller overall error with better detail preservation.

TI  - Comparative Study on the Cooling Effects of Green Space Patterns in Waterfront Build-Up Blocks: An Experience from Shanghai
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Different structural patterns of waterfront green space networks in built-up areas have different synergistic cooling characteristics in cities. This study's aim is to determine what kinds of spatial structures and morphologies of waterfront green spaces offer a good cooling effect, combined with three different typical patterns in Shanghai. A multidimensional spatial influence variable system based on the cooling effect was constructed to describe the spatial structural and morphological factors of the green space network. The ENVI-met 4.3 software, developed by Michael Bruse at Bochum, German, was used to simulate the microclimate distribution data, combined with the boosted regression tree (BRT) model and the correlation analysis method. The results showed that at the network level, the distance from the water body and the connectivity of green space had a stronger cooling correlation. The orientation of green corridors consistent with a summer monsoon had larger cooling effect ranges. In terms of spatial morphology, the vegetation sky view factor (SVF) and Vegetation Surface Albedo (VSAlbedo) had an important correlation with air temperature (T), and the green corridor with a 20-25 m width had the largest marginal effect on cooling. These results will provide useful guidance for urban climate adaptive planning and design.

TI  - Refined UNet V2: End-to-End Patch-Wise Network for Noise-Free Cloud and Shadow Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and shadow detection is an essential prerequisite for further remote sensing processing, whereas edge-precise segmentation remains a challenging issue. In Refined UNet, we considered the aforementioned task and proposed a two-stage pipeline to achieve the edge-precise segmentation. The isolated segmentation regions in Refined UNet, however, bring inferior visualization and should be sufficiently eliminated. Moreover, an end-to-end model is also expected to jointly predict and refine the segmentation results. In this paper, we propose the end-to-end Refined UNet v2 to achieve joint prediction and refinement of cloud and shadow segmentation, which is capable of visually neutralizing redundant segmentation pixels or regions. To this end, we inherit the pipeline of Refine UNet, revisit the bilateral message passing in the inference of conditional random field (CRF), and then develop a novel bilateral strategy derived from the Guided Gaussian filter. Derived from a local linear model of denoising, our v2 can considerably remove isolated segmentation pixels or regions, which is able to yield "cleaner" results. Compared to the high-dimensional Gaussian filter, the Guided Gaussian filter-based message-passing strategy is quite straightforward and easy to implement so that a brute-force implementation can be easily given in GPU frameworks, which is potentially efficient and facilitates embedding. Moreover, we prove that Guided Gaussian filter-based message passing is highly relevant to the Gaussian bilateral term in Dense CRF. Experiments and results demonstrate that our v2 is quantitatively comparable to Refined UNet, but can visually outperform that from the noise-free segmentation perspective. The comparison of time consumption also supports the potential efficiency of our v2.

TI  - A generic framework for improving the geopositioning accuracy of multi-source optical and SAR imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, numerous Earth observation datasets from different types of satellites have been widely used in photogrammetric fields, including urban 3D modelling and geographic information systems. The development of small satellites has provided a new way to obtain repeated observations in a short period. However, compared with that of standard satellite imagery, the geometric performance of imagery from small satellites is relatively poor, restricting their photogrammetric applications. Traditional methods can improve the accuracy of optical images with the addition of well-distributed ground control points (GCPs), which require considerable financial and human resources. The collection of multi-view datasets is an alternative method for geometric processing without GCPs, but relies heavily on the stability and revisit period of satellite platforms. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for improving the geopositioning accuracy of multi-source datasets obtained from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, and a novel heterogeneous weight strategy is proposed based on an analysis of the geometric error sources of SAR and optical images. The geometric performance of multi-source optical imagery from the Jilin-1 (JL-1) small satellite constellation is evaluated and analysed first, and then Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images are calibrated based on statistical analysis for the production of virtual control points (VCPs). Based on our proposed heterogeneous weight strategy, multi-source optical and SAR images are integrated to improve the geopositioning accuracy. Experimental results indicate that our proposed model can achieve the best performance compared with other popular models, producing an accuracy of approximately 3 m in planimetry and 2 m in height, thereby providing a generic way to synergistically use multi-source remote sensing data.

TI  - Deep Learning Applications on Multitemporal SAR (Sentinel-1) Image Classification Using Confined Labeled Data: The Case of Detecting Rice Paddy in South Korea
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The applicability of deep learning to remote sensing is rapidly increasing in accordance with the improvement in spatiotemporal resolution of satellite images. However, unlike satellite images acquired in near-real-time over wide areas, there are limited amount of labeled data used for model training. In this article, three kinds of deep learning applications-data augmentation, semisupervised classification, and domain-adapted architecture-were tested in an effort to overcome the limitation of insufficient labeled data. Among the diverse tasks that can be used for classification, rice paddy detection in South Korea was performed for its ability to fully utilize the advantages of deep learning and high spatiotemporal image resolution. In the process of designing each application, the domain knowledge of remote sensing and rice phenology was integrated. Then, all possible combinations of the three applications were examined and evaluated with pixel-based comparisons in various environments and city-level comparisons using national statistics. The results of this article indicated that all combinations of the applications can contribute to increase classification performance, even though the uncertainty involved in imitating or utilizing unlabeled data remains. As the effectiveness of the proposed applications was experimentally confirmed, enhancement in the applicability of deep learning was expected in various remote sensing areas. In particular, the proposed applications would be significant when they are applied to a wide range of study areas and highresolution images, as they tend to require a large amount of learning data from diverse environments, owing to high intraclass heterogeneity.

TI  - Time-Series of Vegetation Indices (VNIR/SWIR) Derived from Sentinel-2 (A/B) to Assess Turgor Pressure in Kiwifruit
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: Measures of plant water status on kiwifruit were evaluated using Sentinel-2 (A/B) for two seasons in Central Chile.For more than ten years, Central Chile has faced drought conditions, which impact crop production and quality, increasing food security risk. Under this scenario, implementing management practices that allow increasing water use efficiency is urgent. The study was carried out on kiwifruit trees, located in the O'Higgins region, Chile for season 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. We evaluate the time-series of nine vegetation indices in the VNIR and SWIR regions derived from Sentinel-2 (A/B) satellites to establish how much variability in the canopy water status there was. Over the study's site, eleven sensors were installed in five trees, which continuously measured the leaf's turgor pressure (Yara Water-Sensor). A strong Spearman's (rho) correlation between turgor pressure and vegetation indices was obtained, having -0.88 with EVI and -0.81 with GVMI for season 2018-2019, and lower correlation for season 2019-2020, reaching -0.65 with Rededge1 and -0.66 with EVI. However, the NIR range's indices were influenced by the vegetative development of the crop rather than its water status. The red-edge showed better performance as the vegetative growth did not affect it. It is necessary to expand the study to consider higher variability in kiwifruit's water conditions and incorporate the sensitivity of different wavelengths.

TI  - Identification of Lymphatic and Hematogenous Routes of Rapidly Labeled Radioactive and Fluorescent Exosomes through Highly Sensitive Multimodal Imaging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been considerable interest in the clinical use of exosomes as delivery vehicles for treatments as well as for promising diagnostic biomarkers, but the physiological distribution of exosomes must be further elucidated to validate their efficacy and safety. Here, we aimed to develop novel methods to monitor exosome biodistribution in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging. Exosomes were isolated from cultured mouse breast cancer cells and labeled for PET and optical imaging. In mice, radiolabeled and fluorescently labeled exosomes were injected both via lymphatic and hematogenous metastatic routes. PET and fluorescence images were obtained and quantified. Radioactivity and fluorescence intensity of ex vivo organs were measured. PET signals from exosomes in the lymphatic metastatic route were observed in the draining sentinel lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry revealed greater exosome uptake in brachial and axillary versus inguinal lymph nodes. Following administration through the hematogenous metastasis pathway, accumulation of exosomes was clearly observed in the lungs, liver, and spleen. Exosomes from tumor cells were successfully labeled with Cu-64 (or Ga-68) and fluorescence and were visualized via PET and optical imaging, suggesting that this simultaneous and rapid labeling method could provide valuable information for further exosome translational research and clinical applications.

TI  - Is the intraoperative frozen section analysis of sentinel lymph nodes necessary in clinically negative node breast cancer?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Although metastasis occurs in 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been widely not performed. For axillary staging and management, the necessity of intraoperative frozen section analysis of SLN has been controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity and benefit of SLN analysis by permanent section alone in clinically negative lymph node breast cancer patients.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 283 cases with negative node clinical findings between July 2018 and August 2019 in Samsung Medical Center. Clinical nodal stage was evaluated by physical examination, breast ultrasonography, breast magnetic resonance imaging, and chest computerized tomography. The cases were divided into 2 groups; the permanent group had 151 cases (53.4%) and the frozen group had 132 cases (46.6%). We retrospectively analyzed the differences in the number of metastatic lymph nodes and rates of performed ALND between the 2 groups.Results: Baseline and clinicopathologic characteristics between the 2 groups were welt balanced. Three cases in the permanent group and 6 cases in the frozen group underwent additional or immediate ALND. The rates of ALND between the 2 groups were not significantly different (P = 0.312). The cased of 78.9% and 89.5% with metastatic lymph nodes in permanent and frozen groups were in the pathologic N1 stage, respectively.Conclusion: SLNs analysis by permanent section alone may be performed in clinically negative axillary node breast cancer patients. Our findings can help to avoid unnecessary intraoperative frozen section analysis.

AB  - Background: To estimate the causal impact of a change in the national health insurance policy to cover the cost of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigen testing on the incidence of RSV infection by age-groups, we analyzed the sentinel datasets of RSV infection in Japan from 2009-2017.Methods: The causal effect of introducing RSV antigen testing on increasing the reported incidence of RSV infection was quantified using a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences (DID) design and influenza as a control group.Results: Examining sentinel and virus surveillance datasets, only clinically mild cases have selectively increased from 2012/13. The median estimated incidences of influenza and RSV infection among children aged 0-4 years, the age group that dominates cases of both diseases, were estimated at 5,607 and 1,761 per 100,000 individuals, respectively. Exploring sentinel datasets, only the incidence of RSV infection abruptly increased from 2012/13. Using an age-dependent model, the estimated causal effect on the increase in RSV annual incidence was greatest among children aged 5-9 years, with an estimated additional 1,912 cases per 100,000 individuals (95% CI: 418-3,406).Conclusions: Owing to financial support of bedside RSV antigen testing from 2012/13, the incidence of RSV infection has been elevated. The recent increasing trend in RSV infection incidence should not be directly perceived as an increase in natural infections with RSV.

TI  - Is field-measured tree height as reliable as believed - Part II, A comparison study of tree height estimates from conventional field measurement and low-cost close-range remote sensing in a deciduous forest
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree height is one of the most important tree attributes in forest inventory. However, using conventional field methods to measure tree height is a laborious and time-consuming process. Despite the great interest in the past to facilitate tree height measurements, new, upcoming solutions are not yet thoroughly investigated. In this study, we investigated the applicability of different close-range remote sensing options for tree height measurement in a complex lowland deciduous forest. Six sample plots in a pedunculate oak forest were measured in detail using conventional methods. Close-range remote sensing datasets used in this study represent solutions from low-cost sensors used for hand-held personal laser scanning (PLShh), unmanned-borne laser scanning (ULS) and unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry (UAV(image)). Each tree in the sample plots was interactively measured directly from the point cloud, and correspondence of the field- and remote sensing measured trees was verified using tree positions collected during fieldwork. Cross-comparisons of different datasets were performed to evaluate the performances of different data sources in the tree height estimation with respect to crown class, tree height and species. All remote sensing data sources correlated well, e.g. biases between remote sensing sources were around +/- 1%. The field-measured tree height in general correlated well with remote sensing data sources. The uncertainties and bias of the field measurements were dependent on the tree height and crown class. Field measurements tended to underestimate codominant and intermediate trees at the approximately 1 m magnitude, whilst remote sensing data sources were robust to crown classes. Low-cost ULS used in this study, and very likely in general, may not have enough penetration capability when measuring low and mostly occluded trees, causing missed treetops. PLShh gave tree height estimates closer to the real tree height than those derived from conventional field measurements for trees above 21 m height.

TI  - Deciphering the many maps of the Xingu River Basin - an assessment of land cover classifications at multiple scales
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an invaluable tool to objectively illustrate the rapid decline in habitat extents worldwide. The many operational Earth Observation platforms provide options for the generation of land cover maps, each with unique characteristics and considerable semantic differences in the definition of classes. As a result, differences in baseline estimates are inevitable. Here we compare forest cover and surface water estimates over four time periods spanning three decades (1989-2018) for similar to 1.3 million km(2) encompassing the Xingu River Basin, Brazil, from published, freely accessible remotely sensed land cover classifications. While all showed a decrease in forest extent over time, the total deforested area reported by each ranged widely for all time periods. The greatest differences ranged from 9% to 17% (116,958 to 219,778 km(2)) deforestation of the total area for year 2000 and 2014-2018 time period, respectively. We also show the high sensitivity of forest fragmentation metrics (entropy and foreground area density) to data quality and spatial resolution, with cloud cover and sensor artefacts resulting in errors. Surface water classifications must be chosen carefully because sources differ greatly in location and mapped area of surface water. After operationalization of the Belo Monte dam complex, the large reservoirs are notably absent from several of the classifications illustrating land cover. Freshwater ecosystem health is influenced by the land cover surrounding water bodies (e.g., riparian zones). Understanding differences between the many remotely sensed baselines is fundamentally important to avoid information misuse, and to objectively choose the most appropriate classification for ecological studies, conservation, or policy making. The differences between the classifications examined here are not a failure of the technology, but due to different interpretations of 'forest cover' and characteristics of the input data (e.g., spatial resolution). Our findings demonstrate the importance of transparency in the generation of remotely sensed classifications and the need for users to familiarize themselves with the characteristics and limitations of each data set.

TI  - Forest Fire Susceptibility Prediction Based on Machine Learning Models with Resampling Algorithms on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study predicts forest fire susceptibility in Chaloos Rood watershed in Iran using three machine learning (ML) models-multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), support vector machine (SVM), and boosted regression tree (BRT). The study utilizes 14 set of fire predictors derived from vegetation indices, climatic variables, environmental factors, and topographical features. To assess the suitability of the models and estimating the variance and bias of estimation, the training dataset obtained from the Natural Resources Directorate of Mazandaran province was subjected to resampling using cross validation (CV), bootstrap, and optimism bootstrap techniques. Using variance inflation factor (VIF), weight indicating the strength of the spatial relationship of the predictors to fire occurrence was assigned to each contributing variable. Subsequently, the models were trained and validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) curve. Results of the model validation based on the resampling techniques (non, 5- and 10-fold CV, bootstrap and optimism bootstrap) produced AUC values of 0.78, 0.88, 0.90, 0.86 and 0.83 for the MARS model; 0.82, 0.82, 0.89, 0.87, 0.84 for the SVM and 0.87, 0.90, 0.90, 0.90, 0.91 for the BRT model. Across the individual model, the 10-fold CV performed best in MARS and SVM with AUC values of 0.90 and 0.89. Overall, the BRT outperformed the other models in all ramification with highest AUC value of 0.91 using optimism bootstrap resampling algorithm. Generally, the resampling process enhanced the prediction performance of all the models.

TI  - Identification of Mung Bean in a Smallholder Farming Setting of Coastal South Asia Using Manned Aircraft Photography and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mung bean (Vigna radiata) plays an important role providing protein in the rice-based diet of the people in Bangladesh. In the coastal division of Barisal, our study area, the average farm size is less than 0.5 ha and individual fields measure about 0.10 ha. The availability of free Sentinel-2 optical satellite data acquired at a 10 m ground sampling distance (GSD) may offer an opportunity to generate crop area estimates in smallholder farming settings in South Asia. We combined different sources of in situ data, such as aerial photographs taken from a low flying manned aircraft, data collected on the ground, and data derived from satellite images to create a data set for a segment based classification of mung bean. User's accuracy for mung bean was 0.98 and producer's accuracy was 0.99. Hence, the accuracy metrics indicate that the random tree classifier was able to identify mung bean based on 10 m GSD data, despite the small size of individual fields. We estimated the mung bean area for 2019 at 109,416 ha, which is about 40% lower than the Department of Agricultural Extension estimates (183,480 ha), but more than four times higher than the 2019 data reported by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (26,612 ha). Further analysis revealed that crop production tends to be clustered in the landscape by crop type. After merging adjacent segments by crop type, the following average cluster sizes resulted: 1.62 ha for mung bean, 0.74 ha for rice (Oryza sativa), 0.68 ha for weedy fallow and 0.40 ha for a category of other crops. This explains why 10 m GSD satellite data can be used for the identification of predominant crops grown in specific regions of South Asia.

TI  - CloudX-net: A robust encoder-decoder architecture for cloud detection from satellite remote sensing images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud Detection is an important pre-processing step for any application involving remote sensing data. This paper presents a deep learning based CloudX-Net architecture, that can detect cloud cover with improved accuracy in comparison to the benchmark from satellite remote sensing images. The proposed CloudX-Net model reduces the number of parameters needed for accurate predictions and thus make deep learning based cloud detection method very efficient. Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Separable convolution are used to optimize the network. For experimentation, we have used Landsat 8 images and 38-Cloud dataset and trained the architectures using Soft Jaccard loss function. Comparing several quantifying metrics result from various recent deep learning architectures proves the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed CloudX-Net model for cloud detection from satellite images.

TI  - Analyzing COVID-19 Impacts on Vehicle Travels and Daily Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) Levels among Florida Counties
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing social distancing behaviors resulted in substantial reduction on traffic, making this a unique experiment on observing the air quality. Such an experiment is also supplemental to the smart city concept as it can help to identify whether there is a delay on air quality improvement during or after a sharp decline on traffic and to determine what, if any, factors are contributing to that time lag. As such, this study investigates the immediate impacts of COVID-19 causing abrupt declines on traffic and NO2 concentration in all Florida Counties through March 2020. Daily tropospheric NO2 concentrations were extracted from the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and vehicle mile traveled (VMT) estimates were acquired from cell phone mobility records. It is observed that overall impacts of the COVID-19 response in Florida have started in the first half of the March 2020, two weeks earlier than the official stay-at-home orders, and resulted in 54.07% and 59.68% decrease by the end of the month on NO2 and VMT, respectively. Further, a cross-correlation based dependency analysis was conducted to analyze the similarities and associated time lag between 7-day moving averages of VMT and NO2 concentrations of the 67 counties. Although such reduction is unprecedented for both data sets, results indicate a strong correlation and this correlation increases with the identification of a time lag between VMT and NO2 concentration. Majority of the counties have no time lag between VMT and NO2 concentration; however, a cluster of South Florida counties presents earlier decrease on NO2 concentration compare to VMT, which indicates that the air quality improvements in those counties are not traffic related. Investigation on the socioeconomic factors indicates that population density and income level have no significant impact on the time lag between traffic and air quality improvements in light of COVID-19.

TI  - Exploration of marine phytoplankton: from their historical appreciation to the omics era
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine phytoplankton are believed to account for more than 45% of photosynthetic net primary production on Earth, and hence are at the base of marine food webs and have an enormous impact on the entire Earth system. Their members are found across many of the major clades of the tree of life, including bacteria (cyanobacteria) and multiple eukaryotic lineages that acquired photosynthesis through the process of endosymbiosis. Our understanding of their distribution in marine ecosystems and their contribution to biogeochemical cycles have increased since they were first described in the 18th century. Here, we review historical milestones in marine phytoplankton research and how their roles were gradually understood, with a particular focus on insights derived from large-scale ocean exploration. We start from the first observations made by explorers and naturalists, review the initial identification of the main phytoplankton groups and the appreciation of their function in the influential Kiel and Plymouth schools that established biological oceanography, to finally outline the contribution of modern large-scale initiatives to understand this fundamental biological component of the ocean.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 dual-polarized [horizontal-transmit-horizontal-receive and horizontal-transmit-vertical-receive (HH/HV)] ScanSAR mode L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery over an Arctic study area was evaluated for their suitability for operational sea ice (SI) monitoring. The L-band SAR data are studied for the estimation of different SI parameters: SI concentration, SI thickness, SI type, and SI drift. Also, some comparisons with nearly coincident C-band data over the same study area have been made. The results indicate that the L-band SAR data from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 are very useful for estimating the studied SI parameters and equally good or better than using the conventional operational dual-polarized C-band SAR satellite data.

TI  - Groundwater modeling in data scarce aquifers: The case of Gilgel-Abay, Upper Blue Nile, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater (GW) is the main source of domestic water supply in Ethiopia (85%), however, despite widespread acknowledgement of its potential for resource-based development and climate change adaptation, the sector is still quite under-investigated. This is mainly due to the scarcity of in situ data, which are essential to building robust impact models. To address this, we developed a fine-resolution (500 m) GW model using MODFLOW-NWT, focusing on the Gilgel-Abay Catchment located in the Upper Blue Nile basin, fed with daily distributed input forcings of recharge and streamflow simulated by the Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) hydrological model. The model was calibrated against instantaneous observation records of GW table for 38 historical wells, and validated at selected sites using time series data collected from the Citizen Science Initiative (PIRE CSI), and the Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation (ILSSI) project. An RMSE of 14.4 m (1.8% of range) was achieved for calibration and same for validation was 18.21 m and 15.76 mat the PIRE CSI and ILSSI sites, respectively. The findings of this research indicate substantial physical GW resource availability in the Gilgel-Abay region. Moreover, we expect the model to have multiscale future applications. These include obtaining dynamically downscaled boundary conditions for a local-scale GW model, to be developed in the next phase of our research. Further, an upscaled version of this model to encompass the entire Tana Basin would be developed to simulate lake-aquifer interactions. Finally, the approach of this research combining different types of datasets (e.g., reanalysis products, satellite data, citizen science data, etc.) is adaptable to other global data-scarce regions. Moreover, the method overcomes specific challenges associated to in situ data scarcity, limited knowledge on GW resources availability in the area, interaction with complex boundary conditions, and sensitivity under meteorological boundary forcings.

T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Correlation of ruptures with volcanic activities, and related hydrothermal-magmatic systems are studied. In our research we used a set of methods that included analysis of satellite data, identification lineaments and voxel modeling of crustal fragmentations. The main geological structure that ensures transportation of thermal energy in the hydrothermal-magmatic systems in the northern part of Paramushir Isl., and the a sill-dike complex associated with the system of north-eastern and sub-latitudinal fractures is considered. The formation of the northeast oriented ruptures is perpendicular to stretch of the submerged plate and reflects the stress regime in the island-arc setting. In the north of Paramushir Isl. ruptures with sub-latitudinal directions are recorded. The ruptures are located on the extension of the regional fault which is perpendicular to the main axis of the back-arc Kuril basin.

TI  - Precipitation Enhancement Experiments in Catchment Areas of Dams: Evaluation of Water Resource Augmentation and Economic Benefits
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study calculated the augmentation of water resources that can be achieved through precipitation enhancement and the ensuing economic benefits by conducting precipitation enhancement experiments using atmospheric aircraft in the catchment areas of 21 multipurpose dams in Korea. The maximum number of precipitation enhancement experiments to be carried out was estimated based on the frequency of occurrence of seedable clouds near each dam, using geostationary satellite data. The maximum quantity of water that can be obtained was calculated considering the mean precipitation enhancement and probability of success, as determined from the results of experiments conducted in South Korea during 2018-2019. The effective area of seeding was assumed 300 km(2). In addition, the amount of hydroelectric power generation possible was determined from the quantity of water thus calculated. In conclusion, it was established that an approximate increase of 12.89 million m(3) (90% confidence interval: 7.83-17.95 million m(3)) of water, and 4.79 (2.91-6.68) million kWh of electric power generation will be possible through approximately 96 precipitation enhancement operations in a year at the catchment area of Seomjin River (SJ) dam which has a high frequency of occurrence of seedable clouds, a large drainage area, and a high net head. An economic benefit of approximately 1.01 (0.61-1.40) million USD can be anticipated, the benefit/cost ratio being 1.46 (0.89-2.04).

TI  - GIS-Based Optimum Geospatial Characterization for Seismic Site Effect Assessment in an Inland Urban Area, South Korea
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil and rock characteristics are primarily affected by geological, geotechnical, and terrain variation with spatial uncertainty. Earthquake-induced hazards are also strongly influenced by site-specific seismic site effects associated with subsurface strata and soil stiffness. For reliable mapping of soil and seismic zonation, qualification and normalization of spatial uncertainties is required; this can be achieved by interactive refinement of a geospatial database with remote sensing-based and geotechnical information. In this study, geotechnical spatial information and zonation were developed while verifying database integrity, spatial clustering, optimization of geospatial interpolation, and mapping site response characteristics. This framework was applied to Daejeon, South Korea, to consider spatially biased terrain, geological, and geotechnical properties in an inland urban area. For developing the spatially best-matched geometry with remote sensing data at high spatial resolution, the hybrid model blended with two outlier detection methods was proposed and applied for geotechnical datasets. A multiscale grid subdivided by hot spot-based clusters was generated using the optimized geospatial interpolation model. A principal component analysis-based unified zonation map identified vulnerable districts in the central old downtown area based on the integration of the optimized geoprocessing framework. Performance of the geospatial mapping and seismic zonation was discussed with digital elevation model, geological map.

TI  - Flow cytometric characterization of the hemocytes of blood cockles <i>Anadara broughtonii</i> (Schrenck, 1867), <i>Anadara kagoshimensis</i> (Lischke, 1869), and <i>Tegillarca granosa</i> (Linnaeus, 1758) as a biomarker for coastal environmental monitoring
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine bivalves are often used as a sentinel species in coastal environmental monitoring since changes in the environmental quality are often well preserved in their cells and tissues. Anadara and Tegillarca species of Arcidae, the blood cockles, are considered to be good sentinel species in monitoring coastal pollution and ecosystem health because they are distributed widely in the subsurface of intertidal mudflats. Internal cellular defense of the blood cockles to physical and biological stresses is mediated by the circulating hemocytes, while their hemocyte types and functions are poorly studied. In this study, we first characterized morphology and immune-related activities of hemocytes of three common blood cockles Anadara broughtonii, A. kagoshimensis, and Tegillarca granosa using flow cytometry. Based on cell morphology and immunological functions, we de-scribed five types of hemocytes identically in the three blood cockles: erythrocytes type-I (erythrocytes-I), erythrocytes type-II (erythrocytes-II), granulocytes, hyalinocytes, and blast-like cells. Erythrocytes were round cells containing hemoglobin with numerous granules in the cytoplasm and these cells consist of two central populations. Erythrocytes-I were the most abundant cells accounting for 80-89% of the total circulating hemocytes and exhibited a certain level of lysosome and oxidative capacity. Erythrocytes-II were the largest cells and displayed high lysosome content and the most active oxidative capacity. Both erythrocytes-I and erythrocytes-II did not show phagocytosis capacity. Granulocytes were intermediated-sized hemocytes characterized by granules in the cytoplasm and long pseudopodia on the cell surface, and these cells were mainly engaged in the cellular defense exhibiting the largest lysosome content, the most active phagocytosis, and high oxidative capacity. Contrary to granulocytes, hyalinocytes were comparatively small and round cells and exhibited no granules in the cytoplasm. Hyalinocytes displayed a certain level of lysosome and phagocytosis and oxidative capacities. Blast-like cells characterized by the smallest size and small quantity of cytoplasm and exhibited an absence of phagocytosis and extremely low oxidative capacity, suggesting that this population is not directly involved in the cell-mediated immune activities. In conclusion, flow cytometry indicated that three blood cockles had five types of hemocytes, and the erythrocytes and granulocytes were mainly involved in the immunological activities.

TI  - A New Satellite-Based Retrieval of Low-Cloud Liquid-Water Path Using Machine Learning and Meteosat SEVIRI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are one of the major uncertainties of the climate system. The study of cloud processes requires information on cloud physical properties, in particular liquid water path (LWP). This parameter is commonly retrieved from satellite data using look-up table approaches. However, existing LWP retrievals come with uncertainties related to assumptions inherent in physical retrievals. Here, we present a new retrieval technique for cloud LWP based on a statistical machine learning model. The approach utilizes spectral information from geostationary satellite channels of Meteosat Spinning-Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), as well as satellite viewing geometry. As ground truth, data from CloudNet stations were used to train the model. We found that LWP predicted by the machine-learning model agrees substantially better with CloudNet observations than a current physics-based product, the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) CLoud property dAtAset using SEVIRI, edition 2 (CLAAS-2), highlighting the potential of such approaches for future retrieval developments.

TI  - Retrieval of Daily Reference Evapotranspiration for Croplands in South Korea Using Machine Learning with Satellite Images and Numerical Weather Prediction Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the Earth's energy and water cycle via the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface. The reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is particularly important in the croplands because it is a convenient and reasonable method for calculating the actual evapotranspiration (AET) that represents the loss of water in the croplands through the soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration. To date, many efforts have been made to retrieve ET0 on a spatially continuous grid. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product is provided with a reasonable spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 8 days. However, the applicability to the local-scale variabilities due to complex and heterogeneous land surfaces in countries like South Korea is not sufficiently validated. Meanwhile, the AI approaches showed a useful functionality for the ET0 retrieval on the local scale but have rarely demonstrated a substantial product for a spatially continuous grid. This paper presented a retrieval of the daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) over a 500 m grid for croplands in South Korea using machine learning (ML) with satellite images and numerical weather prediction data. In a blind test for 2013-2019, the ML-based ET0 model produced the accuracy statistics with a root mean square error of 1.038 mm/day and a correlation coefficient of 0.870. The results of the blind test were stable irrespective of location, year, and month. This outcome is presumably because the input data of the ML-based ET0 model were suitably arranged spatially and temporally, and the optimization of the model was appropriate. We found that the relative humidity and land surface temperature were the most influential variables for the ML-based ET0 model, but the variables with lower importance were also necessary to consider the nonlinearity between the variables. Using the daily ET0 data produced over the 500 m grid, we conducted a case study to examine agrometeorological characteristics of the croplands in South Korea during the period when heatwave and drought events occurred. Through the experiments, the feasibility of the ML-based ET0 retrieval was validated, especially for local agrometeorological applications in regions with heterogeneous land surfaces, such as South Korea.

TI  - Use of a Satellite-Based Aridity Index to Monitor Decreased Soil Water Content and Grass Growth in Grasslands of North-East Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous simulation studies of the effect of global warming on arid regions have indicated that increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation will trigger water shortages, drought, and further aridification. In north-east Asia, especially China and Mongolia, the area of degraded land has increased since 2000. Land use in arid regions is mainly natural grasslands for grazing. Growth in this land use is limited by the precipitation amount and intensity. To develop sustainable management of grasslands, it is essential to examine the relationship between water consumption and the growth patterns of the grasses. This study examined the applicability of a satellite-based aridity index (SbAI) as a way to measure the water consumption and growth of grasslands in China and Mongolia. The effective cumulative reciprocal SbAI was strongly correlated with the cumulative decreased soil water content in the root zone and changes in the normalized difference vegetation index in Shenmu, China. Application of the effective cumulative reciprocal SbAI to grasslands in Mongolia and in north-east Asia revealed a high correlation between the effective cumulative reciprocal SbAI and changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The effective cumulative reciprocal SbAI might be suitable for the detection of water consumption and growth in grasslands from satellite data alone.

T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - For healthcare providers, specifically military and federal public health personnel, prompt and accurate diagnosis and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus patients provide a two-fold benefit: (1) directing appropriate treatment to the infected patient as early as possible in the progression of the disease to increase survival rates and minimize the devastating sequelae following recovery and remission of symptoms; (2) provide critical information requirements that enable commanders and public health officials to best synchronize policy, regulations, and troop movement restrictions while best allocating scarce resources in the delicate balance of risk mitigation versus mission readiness. Simple personal protective measures and robust testing and quarantine procedures, instituted and enforced aggressively by senior leaders, physicians, and healthcare professionals at all levels are an essential aspect of the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic that will determine the success or failure of the overall effort. As consideration, the authors respectfully submit this vignette of the first confirmed positive COVID-19 case presenting to the Emergency Department at Winn Army Community Hospital, Fort Stewart, Georgia.

TI  - Forecasting Spatio-Temporal Dynamics on the Land Surface Using Earth Observation Data-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Reliable forecasts on the impacts of global change on the land surface are vital to inform the actions of policy and decision makers to mitigate consequences and secure livelihoods. Geospatial Earth Observation (EO) data from remote sensing satellites has been collected continuously for 40 years and has the potential to facilitate the spatio-temporal forecasting of land surface dynamics. In this review we compiled 143 papers on EO-based forecasting of all aspects of the land surface published in 16 high-ranking remote sensing journals within the past decade. We analyzed the literature regarding research focus, the spatial scope of the study, the forecasting method applied, as well as the temporal and technical properties of the input data. We categorized the identified forecasting methods according to their temporal forecasting mechanism and the type of input data. Time-lagged regressions which are predominantly used for crop yield forecasting and approaches based on Markov Chains for future land use and land cover simulation are the most established methods. The use of external climate projections allows the forecasting of numerical land surface parameters up to one hundred years into the future, while auto-regressive time series modeling can account for intra-annual variances. Machine learning methods have been increasingly used in all categories and multivariate modeling that integrates multiple data sources appears to be more popular than univariate auto-regressive modeling despite the availability of continuously expanding time series data. Regardless of the method, reliable EO-based forecasting requires high-level remote sensing data products and the resulting computational demand appears to be the main reason that most forecasts are conducted only on a local scale. In the upcoming years, however, we expect this to change with further advances in the field of machine learning, the publication of new global datasets, and the further establishment of cloud computing for data processing.

TI  - Ocean Surface Topography Altimetry by Large Baseline Cross-Interferometry from Satellite Formation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging Radar Altimeter (IRA) is the current development tendency for ocean surface topography (OST) altimetry, which utilizes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and interferometry to improve the spatial resolution of OST to several kilometers or even better. Meanwhile, centimetric altimetry accuracy should be guaranteed for applications such as geostrophic currents or marine gravity anomaly inversion. However, the baseline length of IRA which determines the altimetric sensitivity is confined by the satellite platform, in consideration of baseline vibration and payload capability. Therefore, the baseline length from a single satellite can extend to only tens of meters, making it difficult to achieve centimetric accuracy. Referring to the successful experience from TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, satellite formation can easily extend the baseline length to hundreds or thousands of meters, depending on the helix orbit. Therefore, we propose the large baseline IRA (LB-IRA) from satellite formation for OST altimetry: the carrier frequency shift (CFS) is brought in to compensate for the severe baseline decorrelation, and the helix orbit is carefully selected to prevent severe time decorrelation from along-track baseline. The numerical results indicate that the LB-IRA, whose cross-track baseline ranges between 629 similar to 1000 m and along-tack baseline ranges between 0 similar to 40 m, can achieve similar to 1 cm relative accuracy at 1 km resolution.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing, GIS and Machine Learning with Geographically Weighted Regression in Assessing the Impact of Hard Coal Mining on the Natural Environment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining operations cause negative changes in the environment. Therefore, such areas require constant monitoring, which can benefit from remote sensing data. In this article, research was carried out on the environmental impact of underground hard coal mining in the Bogdanka mine, located in the southeastern Poland. For this purpose, spectral indexes, satellite radar interferometry, Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and machine learning algorithms were utilized. Based on optical, radar, geological, hydrological and meteorological data, a spatial model was developed to determine the statistical significance of the selected factors' individual impact on the occurrence of wetlands. Obtained results show that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) change, terrain height, groundwater level and terrain displacement had a considerable influence on the occurrence of wetlands in the research area. Moreover, the machine learning model developed using the Random Forest algorithm allowed for an efficient determination of potential flooding zones based on a set of spatial variables, correctly detecting 76% area of wetlands. Finally, the GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modelling enabled identification of local anomalies of selected factors' influence on the occurrence of wetlands, which in turn helped to understand the causes of wetland formation.

TI  - FASTENER Feature Selection for Inference from Earth Observation Data
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel feature selection algorithm for inference from high-dimensional data (FASTENER) is presented. With its multi-objective approach, the algorithm tries to maximize the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm with as few features as possible. The algorithm exploits entropy-based measures, such as mutual information in the crossover phase of the iterative genetic approach. FASTENER converges to a (near) optimal subset of features faster than other multi-objective wrapper methods, such as POSS, DT-forward and FS-SDS, and achieves better classification accuracy than similarity and information theory-based methods currently utilized in earth observation scenarios. The approach was primarily evaluated using the earth observation data set for land-cover classification from ESA's Sentinel-2 mission, the digital elevation model and the ground truth data of the Land Parcel Identification System from Slovenia. For land cover classification, the algorithm gives state-of-the-art results. Additionally, FASTENER was tested on open feature selection data sets and compared to the state-of-the-art methods. With fewer model evaluations, the algorithm yields comparable results to DT-forward and is superior to FS-SDS. FASTENER can be used in any supervised machine learning scenario.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Ice Conditions in the Southeastern Baltic Sea and in the Curonian Lagoon and Validation of SAR-Based Ice Thickness Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we analyze ice conditions in the Southeastern Baltic (SEB) Sea and in the Curonian Lagoon (CL) using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data combined with in-situ measurements from coastal stations during four winter seasons between 2009-2013. As shown, the ice conditions in the SEB and in the CL are strongly varying from year to year and do not always correlate with each other. In the SEB, ice cover may form only within 5-15 km band along the coast or spread up to 100 km offshore covering almost the entire region. The mean ice season duration here is 45 days. The CL is almost fully ice-covered every year apart of its northern part subjected to sea water inflow and active shipping. The ice regime is also more stable here, however, it also possesses multiple periods of partial melting and re-freezing. In this study we also perform a validation of three SAR-based ice thickness products (Envisat ASAR 0.5-km and 1-km, and RADARSAT-2 0.5-km) produced by the Finnish Meteorological Institute versus in-situ measurements in the CL. As shown, all satellite products perform rather well for the periods of gradual ice thickness growth. When the ice thickness grows rapidly, all products underestimate the observed values by 10-20 cm (20-50%). The best results were obtained for the RADARSAT-2 ice thickness product with the highest R-2 value (0.68) and the root mean square error around 8 cm. The results of the study clearly show that multi-mission SAR data are very useful for spatial and temporal analysis of the ice regime in coastal waters and semi-enclosed shallow water bodies where the number of field observations is insufficient or lacking.

T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lexical-and-semantic class of personal names is characterized with a number of specific properties and functions. Synchronically, without appealing to etymology, those individual (individualized) names fulfil a secondary nomination function due to their semiotic function, which makes it possible interpret personal names as symbolic cultural codes belonging to national linguistic worldviews. Still, in course of cross-cultural communication, linguistic contacts demand personal names be translated from one language to another one. The aim of the article is to demonstrate the possibility of adaptation of personal names conserving their own semiotic and national identity while being globally transposed both into various languages and linguistic worldviews, including the general global linguistic worldview. As is generally acknowledged, due to the in translatability of personal names, though languages of the European area reveal some correlations, the principle method to adapt them in literary and mass-media texts as well as in course of colloquial communication is the transformation of their exterior soundand-letter form, so the foreground is made by the norms and rules of transliteration on the basis of the so-called "ideal" Latin alphabet and "practical" transcription which are closely interconnected and fixed as standard ones in the documents of international associations, e.g., ISO, MFO, etc. However, the alphabets and pronouncing norms of national languages are realized controversially which inevitably leads to developing variations and the necessity to revise the established standards. The implicitly positive result of personal names adaptation is the unification of transliteration, considering that even for languages using the hieroglyphic or letter-syllabic writing systems, special alphabets are developed, e.g., pingyin for Chinese or hangul for Korean, which have to provide the conventional communication in the intersection of languages and culture.

TI  - Identification of intrusive lithologies in volcanic terrains in British Columbia by machine learning using random forests: The value of using a soft classifier
T2  - GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the location of intrusions is a key component in exploration for porphyry Cu +/- Mo +/- Au deposits. In typical porphyry terrains, in the absence of outcrop, intrusions can be difficult to discriminate from the compositionally similar volcanic and volcanoclastic sedimentary rocks in which they are emplaced. The ability to produce lithological maps at an early exploration stage can significantly reduce costs by assisting in planning and prioritization of detailed mapping and sampling. Additionally, a data-driven strategy provides opportunity for the discovery of intrusions not identified during conventional mapping and interpretation. We used random forests (RF), a supervised machine learning algorithm, to classify rock types throughout the Kliyul porphyry prospect in British Columbia, Canada. Rock types determined at geochemical sampling sites were used as training data. Airborne magnetic and radiometric data, geochemistry, and topographic data were used in classification. Results were validated using First Quantum Minerals' geologic map, which includes additional detail from targeted location and transect mapping. The petrophysical and compositional similarity of rock types resulted in a noisy classification. Intrusions, particularly the more discrete, were inconsistently predicted, likely due to their limited extent relative to data sampling intervals. Closer examination of class membership probabilities (CMPs) identified locations where the probability of an intrusion being present was elevated significantly above the background. Indeed, a large proportion of mapped intrusions correspond to areas of elevated probability and, importantly, areas were highlighted as potential intrusions that were not identified in geologic mapping. The RF classification produced a reasonable lithological map, if lacking in resolution, but more significantly, great benefit comes from the insights drawn from the RF CMPs. Mapping the spatial distribution of elevated intrusion CMP, a soft classifier approach, produced a map product that can target intrusions and prioritize detailed mapping for mineral exploration.

TI  - Temporary reduction in fine particulate matter due to 'anthropogenic emissions switch-off' during COVID-19 lockdown in Indian cities
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a global response to limit associated mortality, with social distancing and lockdowns being imposed. In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020. This 'anthropogenic emissions switch-of presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020. For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41-53% (Delhi), 26-54% (Hyderabad), 24-36% (Kolkata), and 10-39% (Mumbai). Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions. Aerosol loading decreased by 29% (Chennai), 11% (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data. Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0.69 billion USD. Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend. Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans.

TI  - A Dermatologist's Guide to Implementation of Gene Expression Profiling in the Management of Melanoma.
T2  - The Journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND. With the advent of effective therapeutics, melanoma mortality rates have decreased, yet incidence rates are continuing to rise, making accurate prognostication for risk of recurrence increasingly important. Gene expression profiling (GEP) is a clinically available, objective metric that can be used in conjunction with traditional clinicopathological staging to help physicians stratify risk in melanoma patients. There is a gap in guidance from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) regarding how to utilize GEP in melanoma care. OBJECTIVE. An expert panel of 31-GEP test users sought to provide clarification of use options and a rational clinical workflow to guide appropriate application of the 31- GEP test in everyday practice. METHODS. The authors participated in an in-depth review of the literature and panel discussion regarding current limitations of melanoma risk assessment and opportunities for improvement with GEP. The panel reviewed 1) validation and clinical impact data supporting the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), 2) existing primary data and meta-analyses for 31-GEP testing in melanoma risk assessment, 3) AJCC, NCCN, and Melanoma Prevention Working Group (MPWG) data and guidelines for GEP use in melanoma risk assessment, and 4) experiences, rationales, and scenarios in which 31-GEP testing may be helpful for risk assessment. RESULTS. The 31-GEP test is useful and actionable for patient care when applied in accordance with current NCCN guidelines. Stratification of patients into low (Class 1a), intermediate (Class 1b or 2a), or high (Class 2b) risk categories can inform multidisciplinary conference discussion and can assist with determining the intensity of imaging, surveillance, and follow-up care. Patient-specific features of the disease and individual circumstances should be considered in the decision to use 31-GEP testing. CONCLUSION. The authors suggest a clinical workflow that integrates 31-GEP testing under the umbrella of current national guidelines. Application of the test in appropriate patient populations can improve risk assessment and inform clinical decision-making.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Ecosystem Structure: Fusing Passive and Active Remotely Sensed Data to Characterize a Deltaic Wetland Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A project was constructed to integrate remotely sensed data from multiple sensors and platforms to characterize range of ecosystem characteristics in the Peace-Athabasca Delta in Northern Alberta, Canada. The objective of this project was to provide a framework for the processing of multisensor data to extract ecosystem information describing complex deltaic wetland environments. The data used in this study was based on a passive satellite-based earth observation multispectral sensor (Sentinel-2) and airborne discrete light detection and ranging (LiDAR). The data processing strategy adopted here allowed us to employ a data mining approach to grouping of the input variables into ecologically meaningful clusters. Using this approach, we described not only the reflective characteristics of the cover, but also ascribe vertical and horizontal structure, thereby differentiating spectrally similar, but ecologically distinct, ground features. This methodology provides a framework for assessing the impact of ecosystems on radiance, as measured by Earth observing systems, where it forms the basis for sampling and analysis. This final point will be the focus of future work.

TI  - Ministry with Young Adults: Toward a New Ecclesiological Imagination
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pope Francis is urging ministry leaders to become a more synodal church, one where the people of God journey together as a faith community to create a more just and compassionate world. This calls for ministry leaders to embrace a paradigm shift, to not just rename their programs or develop new ones, but to develop a new worldview from which to understand and engage the New Evangelization as envisioned by Pope Francis. However, the 2018 Synod on Young People revealed that the current parish and diocesan programming with young adults are inadequate in: (1) curbing the increasing tide of religious disaffiliation in young adults and (2) addressing the real and felt needs of contemporary Catholic young adults. This article argues for a new ecclesiological imagination that enables ministry leaders to go out into the world to fully engage young adults in the life of the Church.

TI  - Flood Mapping in Vegetated Areas Using an Unsupervised Clustering Approach on Sentinel-1 and-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 constellation provides timely and freely available dual-polarized C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The launch of these and other SAR sensors has boosted the field of SAR-based flood mapping. However, flood mapping in vegetated areas remains a topic under investigation, as backscatter is the result of a complex mixture of backscattering mechanisms and strongly depends on the wave and vegetation characteristics. In this paper, we present an unsupervised object-based clustering framework capable of mapping flooding in the presence and absence of flooded vegetation based on freely and globally available data only. Based on a SAR image pair, the region of interest is segmented into objects, which are converted to a SAR-optical feature space and clustered using K-means. These clusters are then classified based on automatically determined thresholds, and the resulting classification is refined by means of several region growing post-processing steps. The final outcome discriminates between dry land, permanent water, open flooding, and flooded vegetation. Forested areas, which might hide flooding, are indicated as well. The framework is presented based on four case studies, of which two contain flooded vegetation. For the optimal parameter combination, three-class F1 scores between 0.76 and 0.91 are obtained depending on the case, and the pixel- and object-based thresholding benchmarks are outperformed. Furthermore, this framework allows an easy integration of additional data sources when these become available.

TI  - The InflateSAR Campaign: Evaluating SAR Identification Capabilities of Distressed Refugee Boats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the recent research in the field of marine target detection has been concentrating on ships with large metallic parts. The focus of this work is on much more challenging targets represented by small rubber inflatables. They are of importance, since in recent years they have largely been used by migrants to cross the Mediterranean Sea between Libya and Europe. The motivation of this research is to mitigate the ongoing humanitarian crisis at Europe's southern borders. These boats, packed with up to 200 people, are in no way suitable to cross the Mediterranean Sea or any other big water body and are in distress from the moment of departure. The establishment of a satellite-based surveillance infrastructure could considerably support search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea, reduce the number of such boats being missed and mitigate the ongoing death in the open ocean. In this work we describe and analyze data from the InflateSAR acquisition campaign, wherein we gathered multiple-platform SAR imagery of an original refugee inflatable. The test site for this campaign is a lake which provides background clutter that is more predictable. The analysis considered a sum of experiments, enabling investigations of a broad range of scene settings, such as the vessel's orientation, superstructures and speed. We assess their impact on the detectability of the chosen target under different sensor parameters, such as polarimetry, resolution and incidence angle. Results show that TerraSAR-X Spotlight and Stripmap modes offer good capabilities to potentially detect those types of boats in distress. Low incidence angles and cross-polarization decrease the chance of a successful identification, whereas a fully occupied inflatable, orthogonally oriented to the line of sight, seems to be better visible than an empty one. The polarimetric analyses prove the vessel's different polarimetric behavior in comparison with the water surface, especially when it comes to entropy. The analysis considered state-of-the-art methodologies with single polarization and dual polarization channels. Finally, different metrics are used to discuss whether and to which extent the results are applicable to other open ocean datasets. This paper does not introduce any vessel detection or classification algorithm from SAR images. Rather, its results aim at paving the way to the design and the development of a specially tailored detection algorithm for small rubber inflatables.

TI  - Understanding Pediatric Norovirus Epidemiology: A Decade of Study among Ghanaian Children
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the epidemiology of human norovirus infection in children within Ghana and the entire sub-Saharan African region, where future norovirus vaccines would have the greatest impact, is essential. We analyzed 1337 diarrheic stool samples collected from children <5 years from January 2008 to December 2017 and found 485 (36.2%) shedding the virus. GII.4 (54.1%), GII.3 (7.7%), GII.6 (5.3%), GII.17 (4.7%), and GII.5 (4.7%) were the most common norovirus genotypes. Although norovirus GII.4 remained the predominant capsid genotype throughout the study period, an increase in GII.6 and GII.3 capsid genotypes was observed in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The severity of clinical illness in children infected with GII.4 norovirus strains was similar to illness caused by non-GII.4 strains. Since the epidemiology of norovirus changes rapidly, establishment of systematic surveillance within sentinel sites across the country would enhance the monitoring of circulating norovirus strains and allow continuous understanding of norovirus infection in Ghana.

TI  - Linking the Remote Sensing of Geodiversity and Traits Relevant to Biodiversity-Part II: Geomorphology, Terrain and Surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The status, changes, and disturbances in geomorphological regimes can be regarded as controlling and regulating factors for biodiversity. Therefore, monitoring geomorphology at local, regional, and global scales is not only necessary to conserve geodiversity, but also to preserve biodiversity, as well as to improve biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Numerous remote sensing (RS) approaches and platforms have been used in the past to enable a cost-effective, increasingly freely available, comprehensive, repetitive, standardized, and objective monitoring of geomorphological characteristics and their traits. This contribution provides a state-of-the-art review for the RS-based monitoring of these characteristics and traits, by presenting examples of aeolian, fluvial, and coastal landforms. Different examples for monitoring geomorphology as a crucial discipline of geodiversity using RS are provided, discussing the implementation of RS technologies such as LiDAR, RADAR, as well as multi-spectral and hyperspectral sensor technologies. Furthermore, data products and RS technologies that could be used in the future for monitoring geomorphology are introduced. The use of spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variation (STV) approaches with RS enable the status, changes, and disturbances of geomorphic diversity to be monitored. We focus on the requirements for future geomorphology monitoring specifically aimed at overcoming some key limitations of ecological modeling, namely: the implementation and linking of in-situ, close-range, air- and spaceborne RS technologies, geomorphic traits, and data science approaches as crucial components for a better understanding of the geomorphic impacts on complex ecosystems. This paper aims to impart multidimensional geomorphic information obtained by RS for improved utilization in biodiversity monitoring.

TI  - ST-CORAbico: A Spatiotemporal Object-Based Bias Correction Method for Storm Prediction Detected by Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in near real-time rainstorm prediction using remote sensing have offered important opportunities for effective disaster management. However, this information is subject to several sources of systematic errors that need to be corrected. Temporal and spatial characteristics of both satellite and in-situ data can be combined to enhance the quality of storm estimates. In this study, we present a spatiotemporal object-based method to bias correct two sources of systematic error in satellites: displacement and volume. The method, Spatiotemporal Contiguous Object-based Rainfall Analysis for Bias Correction (ST-CORAbico), uses the spatiotemporal rainfall analysis ST-CORA incorporated with a multivariate kernel density storm segmentation for describing the main storm event characteristics (duration, spatial extension, volume, maximum intensity, centroid). Displacement and volume are corrected by adjusting the spatiotemporal structure and the intensity distribution, respectively. ST-CORAbico was applied to correct the early version of the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM-IMERG) over the Lower Mekong basin in Thailand during the monsoon season from 2014 to 2017. The performance of ST-CORABico is compared against the Distribution Transformation (DT) and Gamma Quantile Mapping (GQM) probabilistic methods. A total of 120 storm events identified over the study area were classified into short and long-lived storms by using a k-means cluster analysis method. Examples for both storm event types describe the error reduction due to location and magnitude by ST-CORAbico. The results showed that the displacement and magnitude correction made by ST-CORAbico considerably reduced RMSE and bias of GPM-IMERG. In both storm event types, this method showed a lower impact on the spatial correlation of the storm event. In comparison with DT and GQM, ST-CORAbico showed a superior performance, outperforming both approaches. This spatiotemporal bias correction method offers a new approach to enhance the accuracy of satellite-derived information for near real-time estimation of storm events.

TI  - Validation of Satellite Sea Surface Temperatures and Long-Term Trends in Korean Coastal Regions over Past Decades (1982-2018)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) data from 1982 to 2018 was performed by comparison with quality-controlled in situ water temperature data from Korea Meteorological Administration moored buoys and Korea Oceanographic Data Center observations in the coastal regions around the Korean Peninsula. In contrast to the relatively high accuracy of the SSTs in the open ocean, the SSTs of the coastal regions exhibited large root-mean-square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.75 K to 1.99 K and a bias ranging from -0.51 K to 1.27 K, which tended to be amplified towards the coastal lines. The coastal SSTs in the Yellow Sea presented much higher RMSE and bias due to the appearance of cold water on the surface induced by vigorous tidal mixing over shallow bathymetry. The long-term trends of OISSTs were also compared with those of in situ water temperatures over decades. Although the trends of OISSTs deviated from those of in situ temperatures in coastal regions, the spatial patterns of the OISST trends revealed a similar structure to those of in situ temperature trends. The trends of SSTs using satellite data explained about 99% of the trends in in situ temperatures in offshore regions (>25 km from the shoreline). This study discusses the limitations and potential of global SSTs as well as long-term SST trends, especially in Korean coastal regions, considering diverse applications of satellite SSTs and increasing vulnerability to climate change.

T2  - ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the relationship between energy, the environment, and society in early modern Korea, after its initial contact with electricity and fossil fuels. After reviewing the literature and original sources, the study reached four findings. First, the introduction of electricity and new energy sources was intensely pursued under the belief that civilization and enlightenment based on electricity, fossil fuels, and their relevant Western technologies could help Korea retain its national sovereignty and compete with imperial powers during thegaehwaperiod. Second, the traditional Korean worldview regarding the interrelationship between humans and nature was partially changed by the introduction of electricity and new energy sources. Third, using electricity and new energy sources changed the way traditional social relations were experienced in Korea, as well as conventional notions of time and space. Lastly, Seoulites in early modern Korea were psychologically prepared to accept and become familiar with electricity and new energy sources, which eventually became the foundation for mentally reorienting Korea toward future industrialization.

TI  - Can Continuity of Care Reduce Hospitalization Among Community-dwelling Older Adult Veterans Living With Dementia?
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hospitalization is a difficult experience, especially for patients with dementia. Understanding whether better continuity of care (COC) reduces hospitalizations can indicate interventions that might help curb hospitalizations. Objective: To estimate the causal impact of COC on hospitalizations and different reasons for hospitalization among community-dwelling older veterans with dementia. Research Design: Population-based observational study using nationwide Veterans Health Administration data linked to Medicare claims in Fiscal Years (FYs) 2014-2015. To account for unobserved confounders we used an instrumental variable for COC-whether veteran changed residence by more than 10 miles. Subjects: Community-dwelling veterans with dementia aged 66 and older, enrolled in Traditional Medicare (n=105,528). Measures: Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care (BBC) index (0-worst to 1-best COC); binary indicators of any hospitalization for all causes, for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) and for reasons grouped by major diagnostic category. Results: The mean BBC in FY 2014 was 0.32 (SD, 0.23). In FY 2015 43.3% of the cohort veterans were hospitalized. A 0.1 higher BBC resulted in 2.4% (95% confidence interval, 0.5%-4.4%) lower probability of hospitalization for all causes. BBC was not associated with hospitalization for ACSCs. Grouped by major diagnostic category, a 0.1 higher BBC resulted in 3.8% (95% confidence interval, 2.1%-5.4%) lower probability of hospitalization for neuropsychiatric diseases/disorders, with no impact on hospitalizations for circulatory, respiratory, infectious, kidney and urinary, digestive, musculoskeletal, and endocrine-metabolic diseases/disorders. Conclusions: Among community-dwelling older veterans with dementia, better COC resulted in less hospitalizations, and this effect was primarily due to less hospitalization for neuropsychiatric diseases/disorders but not hospitalization for ACSCs, or other hospitalization reasons.

TI  - Grounding line extraction in the Amery ice shelf, Antarctic using fusion of CryoSat-2 altimetry data and Landsat 8 optical data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, fusion of CryoSat-2 altimetry data and Landsat 8 data is applied to grounding line extraction in the Amery ice shelf area, Antarctic. Firstly, based on the 3-order Hermit polynomial interpolation processing of Landsat 8 optical images, the slope analysis is carried out to obtain the revised feature points using surface curvature. For the Cryosat-2 data, grounding point is extracted by using the along track gradient analysis after slope and surface curvature calculation. Finally, the least squares based fusion method is utilized to obtain the fusion grounding line. The results show that the fusion grounding line can guarantee the accuracy compared with optical data results, and the altimetry data are not affected by the cloud that can ensure the integrity of the grounding line. Compared with the Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA) product, the average distance between the fusion data points and the MOA grounding line is 367 m, and the standard deviation is 601 m. Points less than 1 km away from all data points account for 93.19% in total, which indicates the good agreement with the MOA product. The fusion algorithm maintains the grounding line characteristics extracted by Landsat 8, and the visual performance of overall results are also improved. It is of great importance for subsequent research on the Antarctic mass balance, ice velocity calculation and so on.

TI  - Accretion-Erosion Dynamics of the Yellow River Delta and the Relationships with Runoff and Sediment from 1976 to 2018
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely understanding of the coastal accretion-erosion dynamics of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) can not only deepen the understanding of the evolution of the delta but also provide scientific support for water-sediment regulation (WSR) in the lower reaches of Yellow River and the implementation of a protection strategy for the Yellow River Estuary. In this long-term study, Landsat images from 1976 to 2018 were acquired, and the cloud processing platform of the Google Earth Engine was used for extraction of coastlines. On the basis of these coastlines, the area and accretion-erosion dynamics were analyzed. Then, after statistical analysis of the interannual and intra-annual variations in runoff and sediment, we discuss the relationship between the accretion-erosion dynamics and the annual runoff and sediment. The results show that (1) the coastline of the YRD lengthened first and then shortened, and the average annual growth rate was 1.48 km/a. (2) The land area of the YRD showed a significant accretionary trend before 1996, with an average annual growth rate of 28.60 km(2)/a. Then, the area gradually decreased from 1997 to 2001. After WSR was implemented in 2002, the accretion-erosion dynamics gradually became smooth, with an annual growth rate of 0.31 km(2)/a. (3) After WSR, the maximum annual sedimentation decreased by 79.70%. The average annual sediment discharge accounted for only 6.69% from November to March of the following year during the non-flood season. (4) With the continuous decrease in sediment discharge, the determination coefficient (R-2) between the cumulative accretion-erosion area of the estuary and the annual sedimentation decreased from 0.98 in 1976-1996 to 0.77 after 2002. Overall, although WSR has maintained a steady increase in delta land area, it cannot change the long-term decrease in the land area of the delta. The insights gained from our study can provide some references for related coastline research, and will be useful to science community and decision makers for coastal environmental monitoring, management, protection, and sustainable development of the YRD.

TI  - Global Revisit Interval Analysis of Landsat-8-9 and Sentinel-2A-2B Data for Terrestrial Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of Landsat-8, Landsat-9, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B data provides a new perspective in remote sensing application for terrestrial monitoring. Jointly, these four sensors together offer global 10-30-m multi-spectral data coverage at a higher temporal revisit frequency. In this study, combinations of four sensors were used to examine the revisit interval by modelled orbit swath information. To investigate different factors that could influence data availability, an analysis was carried out for one year based on daytime surface observations of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A -2B. We found that (i) the global median average of revisit intervals for the combination of four sensors was 2.3 days; (ii) the global mean average number of surface observations was 141.4 for the combination of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A -2B; (iii) the global mean average cloud-weighted number of observations for the three sensors combined was 81.9. Three different locations were selected to compare with the cloud-weighted number of observations, and the results show an appropriate accuracy. The utility of combining four sensors together and the implication for terrestrial monitoring are discussed.

TI  - An optimal sampling method for multi-temporal land surface temperature validation over heterogeneous surfaces
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of ground-based sampling strategies is vital for validating medium or coarse-resolution satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) products. Conventional LST sampling at the satellite pixel scale has been limited to the homogeneous surfaces. In this study, an optimal sampling strategy called spatial and diurnal temperature cycle-constrained sampling (SDCS) is proposed to extend the feasibility of LST validation over heterogeneous surfaces with dramatic diurnal LST changes. SDCS integrates a priori information including land cover, diurnal LSTs data, and spatial distribution characteristics of samples to improve the representativeness of multi-temporal measurements over heterogeneous surfaces. SDCS was applied to four varied study areas using simulated satellite data and was compared with four existing methods including random sampling, systematic sampling, land cover-based stratified sampling, and conditioned Latin hypercube (CLH) sampling. Results showed that SDCS could significantly improve the representativeness of samples with a limited sample size. In homogeneous surfaces with an LST standard deviation (SD) of less than 2 K, the root mean square error (RMSE) of diurnal LSTs estimated by SDCS was less than 0.3 K when using 0.20% of the total pixels. In moderate heterogeneous surfaces (LST SD less than 5 K), 0.32% of the total pixels were required to achieve RMSE less than 0.5 K. In extremely heterogeneous surfaces (LST SD > 6 K), 0.96% of the pixels were needed to achieve the same accuracy. Further, the representativeness of the samples selected by SDCS was stable in diurnal space with uncertainties of LST bias less than 0.27 K. Moreover, the samples exhibited a dispersed spatial distribution with a nearest neighbor index of 1.27-1.54. SDCS can generalize to various regions and dates and can be employed in field campaigns for diurnal LST validation over heterogeneous surfaces.

TI  - Detection of Undocumented Building Constructions from Official Geodata Using a Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Undocumented building constructions are buildings or stories that were built years ago, but are missing in the official digital cadastral maps (DFK). The detection of undocumented building constructions is essential to urban planning and monitoring. The state of Bavaria, Germany, uses two semi-automatic detection methods for this task that suffer from a high false alarm rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework to detect undocumented building constructions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and official geodata, including high resolution optical data and the Normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM). More specifically, an undocumented building pixel is labeled as "building" by the CNN but does not overlap with a building polygon of the DFK. The class of old or new undocumented building can be further separated when a Temporal Digital Surface Model (tDSM) is introduced in the stage of decision fusion. In a further step, undocumented story construction is detected as the pixels that are "building" in both DFK and predicted results from CNN, but shows a height deviation from the tDSM. By doing so, we have produced a seamless map of undocumented building constructions for one-quarter of the state of Bavaria, Germany at a spatial resolution of 0.4 m, which has proved that our framework is robust to detect undocumented building constructions at large-scale. Considering that the official geodata exploited in this research is advantageous because of its high quality and large coverage, a transferability analysis experiment is also designed in our research to investigate the sampling strategies for building detection at large-scale. Our results indicate that building detection results in unseen areas at large-scale can be improved when training samples are collected from different districts. In an area where training samples are available, local training sampless collection and training can save much time and effort.

TI  - Explaining State Budget Punctuations: Policy Transparency, Political Institutions, and Electoral Incentives
T2  - POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - What factors cause policies experiencing long periods of stability to be interrupted occationally by a short period of large changes? This study argues that electoral incentives might influence the search, supply, and processing of information on constituency issues, as well as the associated cognitive or institutional frictions, and thus determine the presence and variation of punctuated policies. This article develops and evaluates this claim within a systemic framework consisting of policy transparency, political institutions, and electoral incentives. For the purpose of identifying policy punctuations, this research uses the Generalized Pareto Distribution in the Extreme Value Theory. This study analyzes budget spending data collected from FY 1988 to FY 2008 for all 50 American states. This study finds that greater policy transparency is associated with larger spending stability. By contrast, greater gubernatorial competition is more likely to produce extreme spending changes. Electoral incentives shaped by public preference and political term limits have a profound impact on nonincremental policy changes. The impact of policy transparency is conditional on public preference, while that of electoral competition and legislative professionalism is moderated by political term limits. Particularly, a transparent policy consistent with public preference and legislative professionalism with term limits are more likely to give rise to punctuated policies, while gubernatorial (legislative) competition leads to less punctuated changes when governors (legislators) are subject to term limits.

TI  - Cloudy Region Drought Index (CRDI) Based on Long-Time-Series Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and Vegetation Conditions Index (VCI): A Case Study in Guangdong, South Eastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread and long-lasting drought disasters can aggravate environmental degradation. They can lead to significant economic losses and even affect social stability. The existing drought index mostly chose arid and semi-arid regions as study areas, because cloudy weather in humid and semi-humid regions hindered the satellite in its attempts to obtain the surface reflectivity. In order to solve this problem, a cloudy region drought index (CRDI) is proposed to estimate the drought of the clouded pixels. Due to the cumulative effect of drought, the antecedent drought index (ADI) has a certain impact on the calculation of the current drought. Furthermore, cloud is the only source of natural precipitation, and it also affects the evaporation and emission process on the ground. Therefore, based on the remote sensing drought index, ADI and cloud optical thickness (COT) are used to estimate the drought of pixels with missing data due to cloud occlusion. In this paper, a case study of the cloudy Guangdong, which is located in a humid area, is presented. First, we calculated the CRDI using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2003 to 2017, and then discussed the effect of CRDI with the data from 2016 as examples. Through the analysis of the parameters of regression equation, filling efficiency, rationality of the estimated value, the continuity of CRDI and the rationality of CRDI spatial distribution results, it is concluded that CRDI can effectively estimate the drought severity of the cloud-covered pixels, and more comprehensive drought data can be obtained by using CRDI. The successful application of CRDI in Guangdong shows it is robust and flexible, suggesting high efficiency and great potential for further utilization.

TI  - Source Model of the 2014 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.9 Yutian Earthquake at the Southwestern End of the Altyn Tagh Fault in Tibet Estimated from Satellite Images
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple fault segments ruptured during the 2014 Yutian earthquake, but the detailed source parameters and the mechanism of rupture complexity remain poorly understood. Here, we use high-resolution TanDEM-X satellite data and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre-6/7 images to map the coseismic ground deformation field of the event. We find that the majority of coseismic slip occurred in the upper 10 km with the maximum left-lateral fault slip of similar to 2.5 m at similar to 6 km depth. The fault ruptured across a large 4.5 km extensional stepover from one left-lateral fault segment to another, with some right-lateral relay faulting in between. We find that the earthquake was followed by shallow afterslip concentrating at the southwestern end of coseismic rupture, in an area of many aftershocks and positive Coulomb failure stress change. Our findings demonstrate the power of satellite remote sensing technology in constraining source geometry and slip model of complex earthquakes when ground measurements are limited.

TI  - Identification of Cotton Root Rot by Multifeature Selection from Sentinel-2 Images Using Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton root rot is a destructive cotton disease and significantly affects cotton quality and yield, and accurate identification of its distribution within fields is critical for cotton growers to control the disease effectively. In this study, Sentinel-2 images were used to explore the feasibility of creating classification maps and prescription maps for site-specific fungicide application. Eight cotton fields with different levels of root rot were selected and random forest (RF) was used to identify the optimal spectral indices and texture features of the Sentinel-2 images. Five optimal spectral indices (plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI1), moisture stressed index (MSI), and renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI)) and seven optimal texture features (Contrast 1, Dissimilarity 1, Entory 2, Mean 1, Variance 1, Homogeneity 1, and Second moment 2) were identified. Three binary logistic regression (BLR) models, including a spectral model, a texture model, and a spectral-texture model, were constructed for cotton root rot classification and prescription map creation. The results were compared with classification maps and prescription maps based on airborne imagery. Accuracy assessment showed that the accuracies of the classification maps for the spectral, texture, and spectral-texture models were 92.95%, 84.81%, and 91.87%, respectively, and the accuracies of the prescription maps for the three respective models were 90.83%, 87.14%, and 91.40%. These results confirmed that it was feasible to identify cotton root rot and create prescription maps using different features of Sentinel-2 imagery. The addition of texture features had little effect on the overall accuracy, but it could improve the ability to identify root rot areas. The producer's accuracy (PA) for infested cotton in the classification maps for the texture model and the spectral-texture model was 2.82% and 1.07% higher, respectively, than that of the spectral model, and the PA for treatment zones in the prescription maps for the two respective models was 8.6% and 8.22% higher than that of the spectral model. Results based on the eight cotton fields showed that the spectral model was appropriate for the cotton fields with relatively severe infestation and the spectral-texture model was more appropriate for the cotton fields with low or moderate infestation.

TI  - Analysis of water clarity decrease in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, China, from 30-Year Landsat TM, ETM plus , and OLI observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity controls a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes and thus is an important environmental variable for assessing both the climatic and human activity factors that affect lake ecosystems. Here, we use 30-year Landsat series data to investigate the patterns and trends of water clarity in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir, the largest freshwater, man-made reservoir in the Yangtze River Delta region of China. Three empirical models based on Landsat 5, 7 and 8 data were developed and validated to remotely estimate the water clarity. The validation results show that the three models performed well in deriving water clarity, with the mean absolute percent differences (MAPDs) < 30%. The long-term trends and spatial distribution patterns of water clarity from 1986 to 2016 were constructed using the three developed models. A significant decreasing trend in water clarity was observed, with a reduction of approximately 0.2 m, indicating a gradual water quality decrease. Eleven explanatory variables, including air temperature, rainfall, gross domestic product (GDP), population, chemical fertilizer usage, industrial sewage, and land-use change, were used to explore the driving force of the long-term trend of water clarity with the multiple regression and variation partitioning model. Air temperature, rainfall, cropland, and industrial sewage were the four potential driving forces and explained 63% of the long-term variation in water clarity. Increasing built-up land, air temperature and rainfall, and decreasing forest and grassland jointly caused the decreasing water clarity. Therefore, several reservoir management measurements should be implemented to stop water clarity decreasing.

TI  - Springtime Upwelling and Its Formation Mechanism in Coastal Waters of Manaung Island, Myanmar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource satellite remote sensing data and the World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) temperature and salinity dataset have been used to analyze the spatial distribution, variability and possible forcing mechanisms of the upwelling off Manaung Island, Myanmar. Signals of upwelling exist off the coasts of Manaung Island, in western Myanmar during spring. It appears in February, reaches its peak in March and decays in May. Low-temperature (<28.3 degrees C) and high-salinity (>31.8 psu) water at the surface of this upwelling zone is caused by the upwelling of seawater from a depth below 100 m. The impact of the upwelling on temperature is more significant in the subsurface layer than that in the surface layer. In contrast, the impact of the upwelling on salinity in the surface layer is more significant. Further research reveals that the remote forcing from the equator predominantly induces the evolution of the upwelling, while the local wind forcing also contributes to strengthen the intensity of the upwelling during spring.

TI  - A Modified Cartesian Factorized Backprojection Algorithm Integrating with Non-Start-Stop Model for High Resolution SAR Imaging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging has extensive application value especially in military reconnaissance and disaster monitoring. The motion of the satellite during the transmission and reception of the signal introduces notable errors in the high resolution SAR spotlight mode, which will lead to a defocused SAR image if not handled. To address this problem, an accurate correct echo model based on non-start-stop model is derived to describe the property of the SAR signal in the paper. Then, in the imaging processing, an azimuth-time-varying range frequency modulation rate is used for range compression. The range history and compensation phase are also derived based on the correct echo model. Then, combining the correct echo model and Cartesian factorized backprojection (CFBP) algorithm, a modified CFBP algorithm is proposed for SAR imaging to improve the accuracy and efficiency of processing. Besides, the influence of residual error due to mismatch is analyzed in detail. In the end, the simulation experiment and Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data experiment are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

TI  - Modeling urban growth sustainability in the cloud by augmenting Google Earth Engine (GEE)
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) has been increasingly used in environmental and urban studies due to its cloud-based geospatial processing capability and accessibility to a large collection of geospatial datasets like Landsat, Modis, etc. However, at present, ecological and urban modeling efforts based on GEE are facing three grave challenges: current illustrations of GEE are to a large extent "straightforward mapping" applications; technical complexities that ecological or urban modelers have to overcome in order to effectively and easily use GEE to develop image processing based environmental models; and the majority of ecological and urban modelers are not aware of new analytical approaches that are becoming available because of the unprecedent geospatial processing capability and large collection of big geospatial datasets GEE has brought to them. The great potential of GEE to support ecological and urban modeling is less explored. In this study, we augmented GEE functions with a few sets of user-customized functions for improving image classification accuracy, estimating ecosystem services, and modeling urban growth sustainability. The paper is the first effort of modeling urban sustainability based on the concept of ecosystem service value (ESV) and in the cloud with GEE; is the first application of classifying GEE Landsat time-series images to compute yearly ESV; and creates the first set of cloud tools to augment GEE for ecologists and urban modelers to model urban sustainability from GEE and ESV. The paper also chose Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia as a case study to model urban sustainability in a time-series 12 years (2005-2016). The case study successfully estimated ecosystem service values and analyzed urban growth sustainability. It also revealed spatial disparities and temporal dynamics of urban growth sustainability in Hohhot City. The study provides an easy-to-adapt illustration on using GEE for image-based ecological and urban modeling.

TI  - Estimating Crop LAI Using Spectral Feature Extraction and the Hybrid Inversion Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an essential indicator used in crop growth monitoring. In the study, a hybrid inversion method, which combined a physical model with a statistical method, was proposed to estimate the crop LAI. The simulated compact high-resolution imaging spectrometer (CHRIS) canopy spectral crop reflectance datasets were generated using the PROSAIL model (the coupling of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves model) and the CHRIS band response function. Partial least squares (PLS) was then used to reduce the dimension of the simulated spectral data. Using the principal components (PCs) of PLS as the model inputs, the hybrid inversion models were built using various modeling algorithms, including the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Finally, remote sensing mapping of the CHRIS data was achieved with the hybrid model to test the inversion accuracy of LAI estimates. The validation result yielded an accuracy of R-2 = 0.939 and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) = 6.474% for the PLS_RFR model, which indicated that the crops LAI could be estimated accurately by using spectral feature extraction and a hybrid inversion strategy. The results showed that the model based on principal components extracted by PLS had a good estimation accuracy and noise immunity and was the preferred method for LAI estimation. Furthermore, the comparative analysis results of various datasets showed that prior knowledge could improve the precision of the retrieved LAI, and using this information to constrain parameters (e.g., chlorophyll content or LAI), which make important contributions to the spectra, is the key to this improvement. In addition, among the PLS, BP-ANN, LS-SVR, and RFR methods, RFR was the optimal modeling algorithm in the paper, as indicated by the high R-2 and low NRMSE in various datasets.

TI  - Estimates of Forest Canopy Height Using a Combination of ICESat-2/ATLAS Data and Stereo-Photogrammetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is an indispensable forest vertical structure parameter for understanding the carbon cycle and forest ecosystem services. A variety of studies based on spaceborne Lidar, such as ICESat, ICESat-2 and airborne Lidar, were conducted to estimate forest canopy height at multiple scales. However, while a few studies have been conducted based on ICESat-2 simulated data from airborne Lidar data, few studies have analyzed ATL08 and ATL03 products derived from the ATLAS sensor onboard ICESat-2 for regional vegetation canopy height mapping. It is necessary and promising to explore how data obtained by ICESat-2 can be applied to estimate forest canopy height. This study proposes a new means to estimate forest canopy height, defined as the mean height of trees within a given forest area, using a combination of ICESat-2 ATL08 and ATL03 data and ZY-3 satellite stereo images. Five procedures were used to estimate the forest canopy height of the city of Nanning in China: (1) Processing ground photons in a 30 m x 30 m grid; (2) Extracting a digital surface model (DSM) using ZY-3 stereo images; (3) Calculating a discontinuous canopy height model (CHM) dataset; (4) Validating the DSM and ground photon height using GEDI data; (5) Estimating the regional wall-to-wall forest canopy height product based on the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) model and Landsat 8 vegetation indices and independent accuracy assessments with field measured plots. The validation shows a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.34 m to 3.47 m and a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.51. The new method shows promise and can be used for large-scale forest canopy height mapping at various resolutions or in combination with other data, such as SAR images. Finally, this study analyzes resolutions and how to filter effective data when ATL08 data are directly used to generate regional or global vegetation height products, which will be the focus of future research.

TI  - Anthropogenic Heat Flux Estimation Based on Luojia 1-01 New Nighttime Light Data: A Case Study of Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid process of urbanization, anthropogenic heat generated by human activities has become an important factor that drives the changes in urban climate and regional environmental quality. The nighttime light (NTL) data can aptly reflect the spatial distribution of social-economic activities and energy consumption, and quantitatively estimate the anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) distribution. However, the commonly used DMSP/OLS and Suomi-NPP/VIIRS NTL data are restricted by their coarse spatial resolution and, therefore, cannot exhibit the spatial details of AHF at city scale. The 130 m high-resolution NTL data obtained by Luojia 1-01 satellite launched in June 2018 shows a promise to solve this problem. In this paper, the gridded AHF spatial estimation is achieved with a resolution of 130 m using Luojia 1-01 NTL data based on three indexes, NTLnor (Normalized Nighttime Light Data), HSI (Human Settlement Index), and VANUI (Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index). We chose Jiangsu, a fast-developing province in China, as an example to determine the best AHF estimation model among the three indexes. The AHF of 96 county-level cities of the province was first calculated using energy-consumption statistics data and then correlated with the corresponding data of three indexes. The results show that based on a 5-fold cross-validation approach, the VANUI power estimation model achieves the highest R-2 of 0.8444 along with the smallest RMSE of 4.8277 W center dot m(-2) and therefore has the highest accuracy among the three indexes. According to the VANUI power estimation model, the annual mean AHF of Jiangsu in 2018 was 2.91 W center dot m(-2). Of the 96 cities, Suzhou has the highest annual mean AHF of 7.41 W center dot m(-2), followed by Wuxi, Nanjing, Changzhou and Zhenjiang, with the annual mean of 3.80-5.97 W center dot m(-2), while the figures of Suqian, Yancheng, Lianyungang, and Huaian, the cities in northern Jiangsu, are relatively low, ranging from 1.41 to 1.59 W center dot m(-2). This study has shown that the AHF estimation model developed by Luojia 1-01 NTL data can achieve higher accuracy at city-scale and discriminate the spatial detail of AHF effectively.

TI  - Calving Event Led to Changes in Phytoplankton Bloom Phenology in the Mertz Polynya, Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polynyas are subject to variability in winds and ocean circulation and are important sites of ecological productivity. In February 2010, the B09B iceberg collided with the Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT), calving a 78 x 40-km giant iceberg which modified the icescape and primary productivity of the Mertz polynya. In this study, we use satellite ocean color and sea ice concentration to investigate the variability, trends, and drivers of phytoplankton blooms in the Mertz polynya since 1997. During the bloom, over 21 years, we found (i) a later ice retreat time, (ii) an increase in sea ice concentration, (iii) a decrease in open-water period, (iv) a later bloom start, and (v) a decrease in bloom duration. Our results suggest that major postcalving changes in the physical characteristics of the polynya, mainly its icescape, are the primary drivers of phytoplankton phenology. More specifically, the MGT calving event resulted in significant seasonal and regional changes, with higher eastern chl-a and mean summer chl-a postcalving. While satellite data are useful to study long-term variability in these inhospitable areas, they only focus on the ocean surface and are obscured by ice and clouds. Additional subsurface parameters from seal tags, gliders and moorings in the southernmost polar regions would strengthen our comprehension of phytoplankton and physical changes in ocean dynamics that may have far-reaching consequences, from global circulation to carbon export.

TI  - A New Concept of Full Ocean Current Vector Retrieval With Spaceborne SAR Based on Intrapulse Beam-Switching Technique
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has proven to be an important tool for the retrieval of ocean surface currents. However, existing spaceborne SAR systems can usually measure only one component of an ocean current vector. In this article, we propose a new concept of dual-look spaceborne SAR system for ocean surface motion remote sensing. The key of the proposed SAR system lies in the use of a technique called intrapulse beam switching (IPBS) implemented by a phased array antenna. One example for the application of the proposed IPBS-based SAR system is its combination with the Doppler centroid anomaly (DCA) method. Through the combination, the DCA method, which in its conventional version can measure only the radial component of a current vector, is generalized to measure full ocean current vectors. A system design example and its performance evaluation demonstrate that the accuracies for ocean surface velocity vector measurement better than 5 cm/s in both azimuth and range, and better than 10 degrees in velocity direction for a mild current, and a swath width of about 100 km, can be achieved. A comparison with other beam-generating schemes indicates that a relatively large swath width, without compromising the current-measuring accuracy, can be achieved by the proposed SAR system with one single antenna array and one single physical output channel-a feature that means a high level of integration which in turn allows for the flexibility to operate this system in multiple SAR modes.

TI  - Detection of County Economic Development Using LJ1-01 Nighttime Light Imagery: A Comparison with NPP-VIIRS Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data have been widely used to derive socioeconomic indicators at the national and regional scales to study regional economic development. However, most previous studies only chose a single measurement indicator (such as GDP) and adopted simple regression methods to investigate the economic development of a certain area based on DMSP-OLS or NPP-VIIRS stable NTL data. The status quo shows the problems of using a single evaluation index-it has a low evaluation precision. The LJ1-01 satellite is the first dedicated NTL remote sensing satellite in the world, launched in July 2018. The data provided by LJ1-01 have a higher spatial resolution and fewer blooming phenomena. In this paper, we compared the accuracy of the LJ1-01 data and NPP-VIIRS data in detecting county-level multidimensional economic development. In three provinces in China, namely, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi, 20 socioeconomic parameters were selected from the following five perspectives: economic conditions, people's livelihood, social development, public resources and natural vulnerability. Then, a County-level Economic Index (CEI) was constructed to evaluate the level of multidimensional economic development, with the spatial pattern of the multidimensional economic development also identified across the study area. The present study adopted the random forest (RF) and linear regression (LR) algorithms to establish the regression model individually, and the results were evaluated by cross-validation. The results show that the RF algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of the model compared with the LR algorithm, and thus is suitable for the study of NTL data. In addition, a better determinate coefficient (R-2) based on the LJ1-01 data (0.8168) was obtained than that from the NPP-VIIRS data (0.7245) in the RF model, which reflects that the LJ1-01 data offer better potential in the evaluation of socioeconomic parameters and can be used to identify, both accurately and efficiently, multidimensional economic development at the county level.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of a Pear Chlorotic Leaf Spot-Associated Virus, a Novel Emaravirus Associated with a Severe Disease of Pear Trees in China
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pear chlorotic leaf spot (PCLS) is a recently emerged disease of commercially cultivated sandy pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) trees in central and southern China. By integrating high-throughput sequencing and conventional Sanger sequencing of reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR products, a novel emaravirus infecting pear trees was identified and molecularly characterized. The virus was provisionally named pear chlorotic leaf spot-associated virus (PCLSaV). PCLSaV shows the typical molecular features of members of the genus Emaravirus in the family Fimoviridae. It has a genome composed of at least five negative-sense RNA segments, with each containing a single open reading frame and two complementary 13-nucleotide stretches at the 5' and 3' termini. PCLSaV shows a close phylogenetic relationship with recognized emaraviruses but forms a separate Glade. Moreover, double-membrane-bound bodies were observed in PCLSaV-infected tissues and in extracts of PCLSaV-infected leaves. For the first time, our study revealed the profile distribution of viral RNA reads from the RNA-seq libraries of three samples along the RNA1 to RNA5 of an emaravirus. Field surveys combined with specific RT-PCR assays revealed the presence of PCLSaV in almost all PCLS-diseased pear samples, strongly supporting the association of the virus with the PCLS disease. This study revealed the first emaravirus infecting pear trees and its association with a severe pear chlorotic leaf disease.

TI  - Evaluation and Modifying of Multispectral Drought Severity Index
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a very destructive natural disaster. In recent years, affected by climate change, the frequency of drought is increasing all over the world, causing serious economic losses. Accurate monitoring of drought information is the basis of disaster prevention and reduction. Drought Severity Index (DSI) is a kind of index that can effectively capture regional drought information. It has been proved that it has great potential in global drought monitoring, but its classification of drought grade is obviously regional. In order to test the applicability of DSI on the provincial scale and correct the classification differences, DSIMODIS and DSIAVHRR from 2001 to 2014 were obtained based on the data sets of MODIS ET/PET, NDVI and AVHRR NDVI in Shanxi Province. Meanwhile, combined with SPEI, the spatial and temporal distribution of drought in these three indexes was compared and analyzed. To verify the reliability of SPEI, long time series SPEIs were compared with historical drought records. In order to investigate the errors of DSI in the region, DSIMODIS DSIAVHRR and SPEI were compared in time frequency and spatial distribution. Finally, as SPEI a reference and based on the original DSI classification standard, the new drought classification standard was obtained by adjusting the threshold of drought grade of DSIMODIS with 0. 1 as the step size. In addition, DSIMM was used to monitor the provincial seasonal scale from 2001 to 2014, to capture the typical drought events in 2001 and 2002, and to verify the applicability and robustness of DSIMM in drought monitoring in Shanxi. Studies show that there is a high correlation between DSIMODIS and DSTAVHRR, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 75. Both of them have consistent performance in spatial distribution and time frequency of drought, indicating that DSI can be extended to AVHRR data set in the absence of data to make up for the deficiency of MODIS data in long time series monitoring. DI was underestimated by DSIMODIS while D2, D3 and D4 were overestimated in Shanxi province. In the four grades of mild drought Dl, moderate drought D2, severe drought D3 and extreme drought D4, DSIMM and SPEI showed a high degree of consistency in the occurrence frequency and spatial ratio of drought. The time frequency of D3 was completely consistent, and the spatial distribution consistency of D4 was 0. 98. The drought classification standard of DSIMM can monitor the drought information at different temporal and spatial scale accurately, which can be applied to the whole governor time series drought monitoring. The results can be used for reference in regional scale drought monitoring using DSI, and a simple calculation method with high accuracy is obtained for Shanxi Province drought information monitoring.

TI  - An Improved Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Method Using Surface Heterogeneity Information Based on ESTARFM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of the spatiotemporal data fusion method as an effective data interpolation method has received extensive attention in remote sensing (RS) academia. The enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) is one of the most famous spatiotemporal data fusion methods, as it is widely used to generate synthetic data. However, the ESTARFM algorithm uses moving windows with a fixed size to get the information around the central pixel, which hampers the efficiency and precision of spatiotemporal data fusion. In this paper, a modified ESTARFM data fusion algorithm that integrated the surface spatial information via a statistical method was developed. In the modified algorithm, the local variance of pixels around the central one was used as an index to adaptively determine the window size. Satellite images from two regions were acquired by employing the ESTARFM and modified algorithm. Results showed that the images predicted using the modified algorithm obtained more details than ESTARFM, as the frequency of pixels with the absolute difference of mean value of six bands' reflectance between true observed image and predicted between 0 and 0.04 were 78% by ESTARFM and 85% by modified algorithm, respectively. In addition, the efficiency of the modified algorithm improved and the verification test showed the robustness of the modified algorithm. These promising results demonstrated the superiority of the modified algorithm to provide synthetic images compared with ESTARFM. Our research enriches the spatiotemporal data fusion method, and the automatic selection of moving window strategy lays the foundation of automatic processing of spatiotemporal data fusion on a large scale.

TI  - Trade-off between watershed water yield and ecosystem productivity along elevation gradients on a complex terrain in southwestern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the tradeoffs between water yield and ecosystem productivity is important for developing strategies for large scale ecological restoration worldwide. This study focused on a national forest protection project in the Upper Yangtze River Basin where a logging ban was implemented in 1998. We used a hydrologic model and remote sensing data to study the interactions between water and carbon cycles along elevation gradients in the Minjiang watershed (MJ), where extensive deforestation and reforestation have occurred in the past seven decades. Average annual evapotranspiration (ET), water yield, and gross primary productivity (GPP) from 2000 to 2015 were estimated as 429 mm yr(-1), 555 mm yr(-1), and 1002 g.C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. ET decreased sharply and consistently with increasing elevation, whereas GPP only decreased significantly in high elevation areas (i.e., > 3,000 m), resulting in divergent trends of water use efficiency (WUE) with elevation. Evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) contributed 28% of water yield and 37% of GPP at the watershed scale, while grassland (GRA) also contributed 28% of water yield, but only 20% of total watershed GPP. Moreover, runoff coefficients showed strong negative correlations with GPP, suggesting a general trade-off relationship between water yield and ecosystem productivity in MJ. Our results suggest that vegetation composition and elevation played a key role in determining the relative ecological benefits for carbon and water in the study watershed with a complex terrain.

TI  - Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network for Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of deep learning technology, semantic segmentation methods have been widely used in remote sensing data. A pretrained semantic segmentation model usually cannot perform well when the testing images (target domain) have an obvious difference from the training data set (source domain), while a large enough labeled data set is almost impossible to be acquired for each scenario. Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) techniques aim to transfer knowledge learned from the source domain to a totally unlabeled target domain. By reducing the domain shift, DA methods have shown the ability to improve the classification accuracy for the target domain. Hence, in this letter, we propose an unsupervised adversarial DA network that converts deep features into 2-D feature curves and reduces the discrepancy between curves from the source domain and curves from the target domain based on a conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) model. Our proposed DA network is able to improve the semantic labeling accuracy when we apply a pretrained semantic segmentation model to the target domain. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2-D Semantic Labeling data set. Results show that our proposed network is able to stably improve overall accuracy not only when the source and target domains are from the same city but with different building styles but also when the source and target domains are from different cities and acquired by different sensors. By comparing with a few state-of-the-art DA methods, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best cross-domain semantic segmentation performance.

TI  - Farmland Parcel Mapping in Mountain Areas Using Time-Series SAR Data and VHR Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, timely, and reliable farmland mapping is a prerequisite for agricultural management and environmental assessment in mountainous areas. However, in these areas, high spatial heterogeneity and diversified planting structures together generate various small farmland parcels with irregular shapes that are difficult to accurately delineate. In addition, the absence of optical data caused by the cloudy and rainy climate impedes the use of time-series optical data to distinguish farmland from other land use types. Automatic delineation of farmland parcels in mountain areas is still a very difficult task. This paper proposes an innovative precise farmland parcel extraction approach supported by very high resolution(VHR) optical image and time series synthetic aperture radar(SAR) data. Firstly, Google satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.55 m was used for delineating the boundaries of ground parcel objects in mountainous areas by a hierarchical extraction scheme. This scheme divides farmland into four types based on the morphological features presented in optical imagery, and designs different extraction models to produce each farmland type, respectively. The potential farmland parcel distribution map is then obtained by the layered recombination of these four farmland types. Subsequently, the time profile of each parcel in this map was constructed by five radar variables from the Sentinel-1A dataset, and the time-series classification method was used to distinguish farmland parcels from other types. An experiment was carried out in the north of Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, Southwest China. The result shows that, the producer's accuracy of farmland parcels obtained by the hierarchical scheme is increased by 7.39% to 96.38% compared with that without this scheme, and the time-series classification method produces an accuracy of 80.83% to further obtain the final overall accuracy of 96.05% for the farmland parcel maps, showing a good performance. In addition, through visual inspection, this method has a better suppression effect on background noise in mountainous areas, and the extracted farmland parcels are closer to the actual distribution of the ground farmland.

TI  - Comparison of two satellite-based soil moisture reconstruction algorithms: A case study in the state of Oklahoma, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays a critical role in regional water cycles and is one of the key indicators for agricultural droughts. Satellite-based microwave radiometers have been the main instrument for mapping surface soil moisture at regional to global scales. However, known issues still exist that lead to data gaps in microwave-based remotely sensed soil moisture products. Multiple gap-filling approaches have been recently developed to generate spatially continuous satellite-based soil moisture. However, there are few inter-comparisons of such approaches despite their importance. In this study, we present a comparison between a triangular feature space-based (Tri) model and a machine learning (ML) based random forest (RF) model for seamless reconstruction in the European Space Agency's Essential Climate Variables Soil Moisture product (ECV SM) over Oklahoma, USA. Five variables are implemented in the models: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), daytime land surface temperature (LST), nighttime LST, daily average LST, and diurnal LST (.LST), and different combinations of these five variables are examined. The reconstructed soil moisture is validated against the original ECV SM and local in-situ measurements. The RF model achieved precise and outstanding performance (R-2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.02 m(3)/m(3), bias = 0.07%) in comparison to the original ECV SM. Comparatively, the Tri and RF models revealed equivalent performance in fitting the in-situ measurements, and both effectively alleviated the bias from the ECV SM. Specifically, Tri, which used daytime LST and NDVI to establish a soil moisture estimation model, displayed the highest correlation coefficient as well as the smallest error (R= 0.620, RMSE = 0.080 m(3)/m(3), ubRMSE = 0.038 m(3)/m(3)) for the in-situ measurements. Moreover, the assessments for sub-regions proved the consistency and robustness of both the Tri and RF models. Missing sub-regional training samples are unlikely to degrade performance of the models as long as there are sufficient valid samples in the whole region. The results of this study highlight the promising potential of Tri and RF models in efficiently filling the gaps in the ECV SM and can provide a reference for future studies focused on satellite-based soil moisture gap-filling algorithm selections.

TI  - Trajectory of coastal wetland vegetation in Xiangshan Bay, China, from image time series
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation is crucial for providing multiple ecosystem services. However, accurate assessment of wetland vegetation is problematic due to the challenging coastal environment. Using Xiangshan Bay (XB) in China as a typical case study, we developed a time series biological phenological approach to classifying coastal wetland vegetation using Landsat time-series images from 1984 to 2018. The results demonstrate that the total vegetation area of coastal wetlands in XB in 2018 was similar to 85.3 km(2). The interannual dynamics of coastal wetland vegetation area in XB in the last 35 years can be divided into three periods: increasing volatility (1984-1998), decreasing (1999-2004), and increasing volatility (2005-2018). Our results emphasize the potential of the use of the time-series biological phenological approach for monitoring coastal wetland vegetation, which can contribute to the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - A case study of Chlorophyll a response to tropical cyclone Wind Pump considering Kuroshio invasion and air-sea heat exchange
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - New evidences provided that the tropical cyclone (TC) Linfa in 2015 induced looping path of Kuroshio invasion into the northeastern South China Sea (NESCS) through the northwestern Luzon Strait (LS), based on the in-situ measurements, satellite data and model output data. This TC-enhanced Kuroshio invasion with low nutrients and denser waters suppressed the TC "Wind Pump" induced upwelling and nutrients uptake, and therefore inhibited the Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a) increase from surface to similar to 50 m in the open ocean of the NESCS. The TCinduced Kuroshio invasion promoted the generation of the strong cyclonic eddy to its left side where weak Ekman Pumping Velocity was observed. This enhancing cyclonic eddy then dominated the nutrients uplift and increased the surface and subsurface (0-50 m) Chl-a through eddy pumping rather than Ekman Pumping. The TC-declined anti-cyclonic eddy, which shoaled the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD), benefited to the nutrient uptake through TC-induced upwelling and thereby increased the surface Chl-a and raised the Chl-a Maximum Layer (CML) to similar to 20 m over the southwestern LS. The temporal Chl-a variations were also influenced by TC intensities and biochemical processes. The air-sea heat budget analysis indicated that, the air-sea heat exchange contributed to nearly 80% of the sea surface cooling (SST cooling) over the northwestern LS with Kuroshio invasion, while eddy-induced upwelling dominated the SST cooling over the western LS, and the wind-driven upwelling (and mixing) controlled the SST cooling over the southwestern LS. These different formations of SST cooling then played important role in Chl-a variations. This study is the first case of TC "Wind Pump" induced Chl-a variations considering air-sea heat exchange, Kuroshio invasion and mesoscale eddies over LS, which would help to evaluate the influence of TCs over the other major heat transport arteries of the world ocean: The Gulf Stream area.

TI  - Enhancing Soil and Water Assessment Tool Snow Prediction Reliability with Remote-Sensing-Based Snow Water Equivalent Reconstruction Product for Upland Watersheds in a Multi-Objective Calibration Process
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation occurs in two basic forms defined as liquid state and solid state. Different from rain-fed watershed, modeling snow processes is of vital importance in snow-dominated watersheds. The seasonal snowpack is a natural water reservoir, which stores snow water in winter and releases it in spring and summer. The warmer climate in recent decades has led to earlier snowmelt, a decline in snowpack, and change in the seasonality of river flows. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) could be applied in the snow-influenced watershed because of its ability to simultaneously predict the streamflow generated from rainfall and from the melting of snow. The choice of parameters, reference data, and calibration strategy could significantly affect the SWAT model calibration outcome and further affect the prediction accuracy. In this study, SWAT models are implemented in four upland watersheds in the Tulare Lake Basin (TLB) located across the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Three calibration scenarios considering different calibration parameters and reference datasets are applied to investigate the impact of the Parallel Energy Balance Model (ParBal) snow reconstruction data and snow parameters on the streamflow and snow water-equivalent (SWE) prediction accuracy. In addition, the watershed parameters and lapse rate parameters-led equifinality is also evaluated. The results indicate that calibration of the SWAT model with respect to both streamflow and SWE reference data could improve the model SWE prediction reliability in general. Comparatively, the streamflow predictions are not significantly affected by differently lumped calibration schemes. The default snow parameter values capture the extreme high flows better than the other two calibration scenarios, whereas there is no remarkable difference among the three calibration schemes for capturing the extreme low flows. The watershed and lapse rate parameters-induced equifinality affects the flow prediction more (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) varies between 0.2-0.3) than the SWE prediction (NSE varies less than 0.1). This study points out the remote-sensing-based SWE reconstruction product as a promising alternative choice for model calibration in ungauged snow-influenced watersheds. The streamflow-reconstructed SWE bi-objective calibrated model could improve the prediction reliability of surface water supply change for the downstream agricultural region under the changing climate.

TI  - Exploring Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance and Response Systems in Beijing, China: A Qualitative Study from the Health System Perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Climate change may contribute to higher incidence and wider geographic spread of vector borne diseases (VBDs). Effective monitoring and surveillance of VBDs is of paramount importance for the prevention of and timely response to outbreaks. Although international regulations exist to support this, barriers and operational challenges within countries hamper efficient monitoring. As a first step to optimise VBD surveillance and monitoring, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of system characteristics and experiences in to date non-endemic regions at risk of becoming endemic in the future. Therefore, this study qualitatively analyses the nature and flexibility of VBD surveillance and response in Beijing. Methods: In this qualitative study, eleven experts working in Beijing's vector-borne diseases surveillance and response system were interviewed about vector-borne disease surveillance, early warning, response, and strengths and weaknesses of the current approach. Results: Vector-borne disease surveillance occurs using passive syndromic surveillance and separate vector surveillance. Public health authorities use internet reporting networks to determine vector-borne disease risk across Beijing. Response toward a vector-borne disease outbreak is uncommon in this setting due to the currently low occurrence of outbreaks. Conclusions: A robust network of centralised institutions provides the continuity and flexibility needed to adapt and manage possible vector-borne disease threats. Opportunities exist for population-based health promotion and the integration of environment and climate monitoring in vector-borne disease surveillance.

TI  - Comparison of Nodal Target Volume Definition in Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy According to RTOG Versus ESTRO Atlases: A Practical Review From the TransAtlantic Radiation Oncology Network (TRONE)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Regional nodal irradiation has gained interest in recent years with the publication of several important randomized trials and the availability of more conformal techniques. Target volume delineation represents a critical step in the radiation planning process. Adequate coverage of the microscopic tumor spread to regional lymph nodes must be weighed against exposure of critical structures such as the heart and lungs. Among available guidelines for delineating the clinical target volume for the breast/chest wall and regional nodes, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology guidelines are the most widely used internationally. These guidelines have been formulated based on anatomic boundaries of areas historically covered in 2-dimensional field-based radiation therapy but have not been validated by patterns-of-failure studies. In recent years, an important body of data has emerged from mapping studies documenting patterns of local and regional recurrence. We aim to review, discuss, and compare contouring guidelines for breast cancer radiation therapy in the context of contemporary data on locoregional relapse to improve their implementation in modern practice.

TI  - Block Adjustment With Relaxed Constraints From Reference Images of Coarse Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the direct geo-locating accuracy of spaceborne optical images is limited by the uncertainty of the exterior orientation parameters, precise ground control points (GCPs), which are difficult or expensive to obtain, are commonly required to improve the geometric accuracy in practical applications. In this article, we propose a novel block adjustment (BA) method to make use of the GCPs automatically collected from reference images of coarse resolution (Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2), which are publicly available. Different from the conventional BA methods, the proposed one treats the GCPs of low accuracy as relaxed constraints instead of directly minimizing the error between the geometric models and GCPs, and only guarantees that the GCPs are satisfied by the geometric models with a prior accuracy. In addition, an automated method is introduced to estimate the proper GCP accuracy for the proposed BA. The experimental results of three testing sites in China using three different types of spaceborne images, i.e., Gaofen-1 (GF-1) panchromatic (PAN), ZY-3 nadir (NAD), and SPOT-5 high resolution geometric (HRG) whose spatial resolutions are around 2 m, show that the accuracy of 1-2 pixel can be achieved for these high-resolution images when only coarse reference images (spatial resolution of 15 and 10 m) were used as ground control. The results also show that the inaccurate GCPs are not likely to undermine the geometric consistency of images in the proposed BA, and BA with relaxed constraints can even achieve better tie points (TPs) accuracy than BA without ground control. This article provides a practical way to utilize inaccurate ground control and balance the tradeoff between GCPs and TPs.

TI  - Lake outburst accelerated permafrost degradation on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and permafrost on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are both important indicators of climate change. Previous literatures have shown the usefulness of optical remote sensing in lake expansion monitoring and the effectiveness of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) in retrieving permafrost deformation on QTP. However, none of them incorporated both optical remote sensing and InSAR to investigate an event that may exhibit causal links between lake outburst and permafrost degradation. This study integrated both the Google Earth Engine (GEE) analysis on optical images and the small baseline subset (SBAS) processing on SAR datasets to evaluate the potential impact of a lake outburst event on permafrost degradation. The outburst of Zonag Lake (headwater lake) that occurred on 14 September 2011 was focused, and its consequential influence on the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake (tailwater lake) was investigated. The GEE processing on Landsat and HJ-1 imageries allowed an efficient monitoring of the Salt Lake expansion over past 20 years. In addition, the SBAS-InSAR analysis on temporal Envisat and Sentinel-1 datasets further discovered the accelerated permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake after 2014. The results provide an evidence that on QTP the outburst of a headwater lake may significantly accelerate the permafrost degradation surrounding the tailwater lake. Such degradation may be attributed to the thermal alteration of the permafrost thawing-freezing cycle and the melting ground ice, along with the subsequent changes on hydrological connectivity and soil permeability. With the continuous trend of the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake, potential risks may be further exposed to the regional environment and infrastructures such as the Qinghai-Tibet railway and highway, thus deserving a particular attention in the near future. The novelties of this study are: 1) technically, the preliminary attempt to integrate the GEE and InSAR techniques for a joint analysis of lake expansion and permafrost degradation, and 2) scientifically, the finding that lake outburst may accelerate permafrost degradation on QTP.

TI  - Monitoring the performance of the Fengyun satellite instruments using radiative transfer models and NWP fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Review
AB  - Fengyun (FY) satellite program is becoming the important component of global earth observing system. Its instrumental performance, i.e., data quality and stability, play a critical role to support the quantitative applications, such as atmospheric and surface parameter retrievals, numerical weather prediction (NWP) and the production of Climate Data Records (CDRs). For monitoring the instrumental performance, the radiative transfer models (RTMs) together with NWP fields are used to simulate the reference radiance in FY satellite instrument monitoring schemes (FY-SIMS). Through monitoring the difference of observed and simulated brightness temperature of satellite instruments (OMB) against instrument parameters, the quality and stability can be evaluated from different viewpoint of geographic location, viewing geometry, time and spectral ranges. Two components of FY-SIMS, FY satellite data status monitoring system (FY-SDSMon) and satellite instrument characterization (FY-SIChar), are introduced. FY-SDSMon can provide near-real-time and long-time monitoring using fast RTMs and the China Meteorological Administration operational NWP fields, giving a routine and general knowledge of the instrument performance and its potential risk warning. FY-SIChar helps on further characterization of instruments by using more kinds of RTMs and comparison with counterpart instruments. Several examples show that FY-SIMS gives the insight to understand the instrument performance and characterize the potential bias. With the FY-SIMS, the performance of IR and MW band is widely monitored, and recently the VIS-NIR band is also in test to be monitored. Due to the improved quality and stability, the FY data is well evaluated and assimilated by worldwide NWP community to improve the forecast skill. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Glacier Mapping Based on Random Forest Algorithm: A Case Study over the Eastern Pamir
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris-covered glaciers are common features on the eastern Pamir and serve as important indicators of climate change promptly. However, mapping of debris-covered glaciers in alpine regions is still challenging due to many factors including the spectral similarity between debris and the adjacent bedrock, shadows cast from mountains and clouds, and seasonal snow cover. Considering that few studies have added movement velocity features when extracting glacier boundaries, we innovatively developed an automatic algorithm consisting of rule-based image segmentation and Random Forest to extract information about debris-covered glaciers with Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data for spectral, texture and temperature features, multi-digital elevation models (DEMs) for elevation and topographic features, and the Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) for movement velocity features, and accuracy evaluation was performed to determine the optimal feature combination extraction of debris-covered glaciers. The study found that the overall accuracy of extracting debris-covered glaciers using combined movement velocity features is 97.60%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.9624, which is better than the extraction results using other schemes. The high classification accuracy obtained using our method overcomes most of the above-mentioned challenges and can detect debris-covered glaciers, illustrating that this method can be executed efficiently, which will further help water resources management.

TI  - Lossy Compression of Multichannel Remote Sensing Images with Quality Control
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lossy compression is widely used to decrease the size of multichannel remote sensing data. Alongside this positive effect, lossy compression may lead to a negative outcome as making worse image classification. Thus, if possible, lossy compression should be carried out carefully, controlling the quality of compressed images. In this paper, a dependence between classification accuracy of maximum likelihood and neural network classifiers applied to three-channel test and real-life images and quality of compressed images characterized by standard and visual quality metrics is studied. The following is demonstrated. First, a classification accuracy starts to decrease faster when image quality due to compression ratio increasing reaches a distortion visibility threshold. Second, the classes with a wider distribution of features start to "take pixels" from classes with narrower distributions of features. Third, a classification accuracy might depend essentially on the training methodology, i.e., whether features are determined from original data or compressed images. Finally, the drawbacks of pixel-wise classification are shown and some recommendations on how to improve classification accuracy are given.

TI  - Comparison of machine learning algorithms for mapping mango plantations based on Gaofen-1 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mango is a commercial crop on Hainan Island, China, that is cultivated to develop the tropical rural economy. The development of accurate and up-to-date maps of the spatial distribution of mango plantations is necessary for agricultural monitoring and decision management by the local government. Pixel-based and object-oriented image analysis methods for mapping mango plantations were compared using two machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) based on Chinese high-resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) imagery in parts of Hainan Island. To assess the importance of different features on classification accuracy, a combined layer of four original bands, 32 gray-level co-occurrence (GLCM) texture indices, and 10 vegetation indices were used as input features. Then five different sets of variables (5, 10, 20, and 30 input variables and all 46 variables) were classified with the two machine learning algorithms at object-based level. Results of the feature optimization suggested that homogeneity and variance were very important variables for distinguishing mango plantations patches. The object-based classifiers could significantly improve overall accuracy between 2-7% when compared to pixel-based classifiers. When there were 5 and 10 input variables, SVM showed higher classification accuracy than RF, and when the input variables exceeded 20, RF showed better performances. After the accuracy achieved saturation points, there were only slightly classification accuracy improvements along with the numbers of feature increases for both of SVM and RF classifiers. The results indicated that GF-1 imagery can be successfully applied to mango plantation mapping in tropical regions, which would provide a useful framework for accurate tropical agriculture land management.

TI  - Uncertainty Analysis of Object-Based Land-Cover Classification Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, time-series from optical satellite data have been frequently used in object-based land-cover classification. This poses a significant challenge to object-based image analysis (OBIA) owing to the presence of complex spatio-temporal information in the time-series data. This study evaluates object-based land-cover classification in the northern suburbs of Munich using time-series from optical Sentinel data. Using a random forest classifier as the backbone, experiments were designed to analyze the impact of the segmentation scale, features (including spectral and temporal features), categories, frequency, and acquisition timing of optical satellite images. Based on our analyses, the following findings are reported: (1) Optical Sentinel images acquired over four seasons can make a significant contribution to the classification of agricultural areas, even though this contribution varies between spectral bands for the same period. (2) The use of time-series data alleviates the issue of identifying the "optimal" segmentation scale. The finding of this study can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of classification uncertainty on object-based dense multi-temporal image classification.

TI  - Benchmarking large-scale evapotranspiration estimates: A perspective from a calibration-free complementary relationship approach and FLUXCOM
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying large-scale terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) remains hampered by poor parameterization of the physical processes that relate to ET. Previous studies suggested that the calibration-free complementary relationship (CR) method that requires only routine meteorological data performed better than main-stream atmospheric reanalyses, land surface or remote sensing models in estimating large-scale ET. Here we simultaneously evaluate the latest machine learning-based upscaling of eddy-covariance measurements (FLUXCOM) and the CR estimates against the water-balance derived ET rates of 18 large Hydrologic Unit Code-2 (HUC2) and 327 medium HUC6 basins across the conterminous United States. Overall, CR and FLUXCOM perform comparably in representing the multiyear mean and temporal variations in annual ET at both, HUC2 and HUC6, scales for the 1979-2013 period. Such equally good skills also hold true for the 2003-2015 period, during which FLUXCOM was driven solely by remote sensing data. However, the CR generally captures the longterm linear tendencies in annual ET rates somewhat better than FLUXCOM. Because of its minimal data requirement, the calibration-free version of the CR may continue to serve as a benchmarking tool for large-scale ET simulations.

TI  - Wildfire controls on evapotranspiration in California's Sierra Nevada
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We used Landsat-based measures of annual evapotranspiration (ET) to explore the effects of wildfires on vegetation water use across California's Sierra Nevada. Wildfires decreased ET relative to unburned and pre-fire controls, in many areas this reduction persisted for at least 15 years. The ET reduction averaged 265 mm yr(-1) (36% of pre-fire ET) during the first year after fire, and 169 mm yr(-1) (23%) over the first 15 years after fire. The ET reduction varied with burn severity, pre-fire canopy density, and hydro-topographic environment. In areas burned at low severity the ET reduction in the first year after fire averaged 224 mm yr(-1) (31% of pre-fire ET) whereas high severity were reduced a 362 mm yr(-1) (50%) for the first year. Forest stands that were denser prefire had a larger ET reduction across all burn severities. Evapotranspiration reduction following moderate-to-high-severity burns was greatest at 900-1300 m asl elevation. The combination of pre-fire canopy density and burn severity explained 70% of the spatial variation in first-year ET reduction. Forest restoration and a reintroduction of low-intensity fire have been proposed as management practices to mitigate fire risk and improve ecosystem health. Our findings illustrate that restoration and fire reintroduction may reduce the current total ET by up to 9%, with potential benefits for downstream water supply in a globally important food-producing region.

TI  - Retrieving snow wetness based on surface and volume scattering simulation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetness is one of the important physical parameters of snowpack. Its spatial and temporal changes play a key role in snowmelt runoff forecast, regional climate change, and agricultural irrigation. In this study, we proposed a new method to retrieve snow wetness from full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. First, the dominant scattering components, i.e. surface and volume scattering, in wet-snow conditions were obtained by polarimetric decomposition. The random rough surface scattering models and the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) model were then used to establish the surface and volume scattering models, through which the surface and volume scattering lookup tables were created, respectively. Based on the lookup tables and the polarimetric decomposition results, the snow surface and volume wetness were retrieved, respectively. Finally, the effective snow wetness was derived from the weighted summation of surface and volume wetness. The advantage of this method mainly comes from the full consideration the snow surface roughness, the local incidence angle on complex mountain terrain, and the polarimetric information. In experiments, the GaoFen-3 data obtained on January 17, 2018 in the Kelan River Basin and the Radarsat-2 data obtained on March 19, 2014 in the Manasi River Basin were selected to verify the applicability of the proposed method at different conditions. From the analysis of experiment results, the correlation coefficient between the estimated and the ground measured snow wetness in the Kelan River Basin is 0.72. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) are 3.35% and 3.89%, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the snow wetness estimated by Radarsat-2 and the measured values in the Manasi River Basin is 0.62. MAE and RMSE are 1.32% and 1.62%, respectively. These results proved that the proposed method can effectively retrieve snow wetness under different SAR data, different areas, and different snow periods.

TI  - An Unsupervised Crop Classification Method Based on Principal Components Isometric Binning
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely access to the spatial distribution information of crops is of great importance for agricultural production management. Although widely used, supervised classification mapping requires a large number of field samples, and is consequently costly in terms of time and money. In order to reduce the need for sample size, this paper proposes an unsupervised classification method based on principal components isometric binning (PCIB). In particular, principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction is applied to the classification features, followed by the division of the top k principal components into equidistant bins. Bins of the same category are subsequently merged as a class label. Multitemporal Gaofen 1 satellite (GF-1) remote sensing images were collected over the southwest of Hulin City and Luobei County of Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province, China in order to map crop types in 2016 and 2017. Our proposed method was compared with commonly used classifiers (random forest, K-means and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm (ISODATA)). Results demonstrate PCIB and random forest to have the highest classification accuracies, reaching 82% in 2016 in the southwest of Hulin City. In Luobei County in 2016, the accuracies of PCIB and random forest were determined as 81% and 82%, respectively. It can be concluded that the overall accuracy of our proposed method meets the basic requirements of classification accuracy. Despite exhibiting a lower accuracy than that of random forest, PCIB does not require a large field sample size, thus making it more suitable for large-scale crop mapping.

TI  - Impact of changes in surface cover on energy balance in a tropical city by remote sensing: A study case in Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are the most densely populated areas, making them the most used landscape by the population. The urbanization process drastically changes the land cover by converting natural vegetation into impermeable areas. The urban development of cities in the Brazilian Center-west region, such as the city of Cuiaba, was the result of migratory flows that changed the landscape without organization due to rapid urbanization. The impact of converting natural Cerrado areas to cities on energy balance and surface evapotranspiration is still unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of changes in surface cover in Cuiab a on energy balance and evapotranspiration determined by remote sensing. The energy balance and evapotranspiration were estimated by SEBAL with images of TM Landsat-5 from April to November of 2009. The net radiation (Rn), soil/storage heat flux (G), sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimated by remote sensing were validated by measurements performed on a micrometeorological tower installed in a pasture at the Experimental Farm of the Federal University of Mato Grosso. All the energy balance variables and ET estimated by SEBAL, except the G, were strongly correlated with measurements in loco and had low errors. The urban areas of Cuiaba had higher values of surface albedo and temperature, which reduced the Rn. The Rn was used primarily to H and G in Cuiaba. Still, an opposite pattern was observed in the forest and grassland areas, where the Rn was used primarily as a LE.

TI  - Sun-induced fluorescence closely linked to ecosystem transpiration as evidenced by satellite data and radiative transfer models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Transpiration (7) returns about half of continental precipitation back into the atmosphere. However, the global spatial and temporal dynamics of transpiration are highly uncertain, and current estimates rely on either indirect remote sensing or empirical model formulations. Here, we show that T can be estimated reliably at the global scale using observations of plant sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). To do so, we derive T using two different methods from globally-distributed eddy-covariance measurements and compare it with satellite SIF retrievals from GOME-2 and OCO-2. Whereas most research to date has focused on the link between SIF and gross primary production (GPP), we demonstrate that SIF is as highly correlated with T (mean correlation coefficient R of 0.76 across sites for 16-day periods with GOME-2 and 0.75 at the daily scale with OCO-2). SIF shows a greater predictive skill to estimate T than traditional optical vegetation indices and its dynamics are very similar to those of T. Through the use of an advanced radiative transfer model, we also demonstrate a clear empirical link between SIF and T. At 83 FLUXNET sites, remote sensing data and flux-derived GPP and T are used to estimate the relevant parameters of the Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) radiative transfer model and to model SIF. While the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis (GPP) is mostly controlled by leaf biochemical properties and plant structure, the SIF-T relationship appears largely determined by air temperature and intrinsic water use efficiency. Our findings suggest that ongoing advances in satellite SIF retrievals will allow for a more direct estimation of transpiration over large scales.

TI  - Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells: A Double-Edged Sword in Cancer?
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary: Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), like other ILCs, are a new resident cell subset of innate immunity that provides the first line of defense against pathogens such as helminths and largely contributes to inflammation observed in allergic disorders and in some tumors. They are considered sentinel cells, which reside at the interface between host and external environment and are rapidly activated by signals deriving from tissue. Depending on the type of signals and their high plasticity, ILC2s exert both enhancing and regulatory activity on other tissue-resident cells, including tumor- and tumor-associated cells. The functional profile of ILC2s, their pro- or antitumor activity in preclinical studies and patients and the potential therapeutic approaches targeting ILC2s have been extensively reviewed.Abstract: Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2s) belong to the family of helper ILCs which provide host defense against infectious agents, participate in inflammatory responses and mediate lymphoid organogenesis and tissue repair, mainly at the skin and mucosal level. Based on their transcriptional, phenotypic and functional profile, ILC2s mirror the features of the adaptive CD4+ Th2 cell subset, both contributing to the so-called type 2 immune response. Similar to other ILCs, ILC2s are rapidly activated by signals deriving from tissue and/or other tissue-resident immune cells. The biologic activity of ILCs needs to be tightly regulated in order to prevent them from contributing to severe inflammation and damage in several organs. Indeed, ILC2s display both enhancing and regulatory roles in several pathophysiological conditions, including tumors. In this review, we summarize the actual knowledge about ILC2s ability to induce or impair a protective immune response, their proor antitumor activity in murine models, human (children and adults) pathologies and the potential strategies to improve cancer immunotherapy by exploiting the features of ILC2s.

TI  - Land-cover change threatens tropical forests and biodiversity in the Littoral Region, Cameroon
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest regions in equatorial Africa are threatened with degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss as a result of land-cover change. We investigated historical land-cover dynamics in unprotected forested areas of the Littoral Region in south-western Cameroon during 1975-2017, to detect changes that may influence this important biodiversity and wildlife area. Processed Landsat imagery was used to map and monitor changes in land use and land cover. From 1975 to 2017 the area of high-value forest landscapes decreased by c. 420,000 ha, and increasing forest fragmentation caused a decline of c. 12% in the largest patch index. Conversely, disturbed vegetation, cleared areas and urban areas all expanded in extent, by 32% (c. 400,000 ha), 5.6% (c. 26,800 ha) and 6.6% (c. 78,631 ha), respectively. The greatest increase was in the area converted to oil palm plantations (c. 26,893 ha), followed by logging and land clearing (c. 34,838 ha), all of which were the major factors driving deforestation in the study area. Our findings highlight the increasing threats facing the wider Littoral Region, which includes Mount Nlonako and Ebo Forest, both of which are critical areas for regional conservation and the latter a proposed National Park and the only sizable area of intact forest in the region. Intact forest in the Littoral Region, and in particular at Ebo, merits urgent protection.

TI  - Groundwater Withdrawal Prediction Using Integrated Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data Sets and Machine Learning
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective monitoring of groundwater withdrawals is necessary to help mitigate the negative impacts of aquifer depletion. In this study, we develop a holistic approach that combines water balance components with a machine learning model to estimate groundwater withdrawals. We use both multitemporal satellite and modeled data from sensors that measure different components of the water balance and land use at varying spatial and temporal resolutions. These remote sensing products include evapotranspiration, precipitation, and land cover. Due to the inherent complexity of integrating these data sets and subsequently relating them to groundwater withdrawals using physical models, we apply random forests-a state of the art machine learning algorithm-to overcome such limitations. Here, we predict groundwater withdrawals per unit area over a highly monitored portion of the High Plains aquifer in the central United States at 5 km resolution for the Years 2002-2019. Our modeled withdrawals had high accuracy on both training and testing data sets (R-2 approximate to 0.99 and R-2 approximate to 0.93, respectively) during leave-one-out (year) cross validation with low mean absolute error (MAE) approximate to 4.31 mm and root-mean-square error (RMSE) approximate to 13.50 mm for the year 2014. Moreover, we found that even for the extreme drought year of 2012, we have a satisfactory test score (R-2 approximate to 0.84) with MAE approximate to 9.72 mm and RMSE approximate to 24.17 mm. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach should be applicable to similar regions for proactive water management practices.

TI  - Modeling Operating Speed Using Continuous Speed Profiles on Two-Lane Rural Highways in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometric elements of the road, such as tangents and curves, play a vital role in road safety because significant crashes are reported on the horizontal curves and tangent-to-curve transitions. Literature reveals that inconsistent geometric design of roads violates driver's expectation of operating speed leading to crashes. For safe manoeuver, it is necessary to achieve consistent operating speed with road geometry based on the driver's expectations rather than the designer's perception. Estimation of reliable operating speeds in the design phase will help to design safer road alignments. Several past studies developed operating speed models on the curves and tangent-to-curve transitions. However, these models used spot speed data with the assumption that the constant speed persists on the horizontal curves and entire deceleration/acceleration occurs on the approach/departure tangents. In this study, an instrumented vehicle with a high-end GPS (global positioning system) device was used to obtain the continuous speed profiles for passenger cars which resulted in reliable and robust speed prediction models for a tangent, curve, and tangent-to-curve. The study also establishes a relationship between the differential of the 85th percentile speed (Delta V85) and 85th percentile speed differential (Delta 85V). The analysis results revealed that Delta V85 underestimates Delta 85V by 5.32 km/h, and Delta 85V predicted the actual speed reduction from tangent-to-curve transitions. Statistical analysis results showed low errors, variations, and strong correlation of the proposed models with the field data. The models developed in the present study were validated and compared with various other models available in the literature. The comparative study highlights the importance of using continuous speed profile data to calibrate the operating speed models. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Automated Production of a Land Cover/Use Map of Europe Based on Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date information about the Earth's surface provided by land cover maps is essential for numerous environmental and land management applications. There is, therefore, a clear need for the continuous and reliable monitoring of land cover and land cover changes. The growing availability of high resolution, regularly collected remote sensing data can support the increasing number of applications that require high spatial resolution products that are frequently updated (e.g., annually). However, large-scale operational mapping requires a highly-automated data processing workflow, which is currently lacking. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for the automated classification of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The method uses a random forest classifier and existing land cover/use databases as the source of training samples. In order to demonstrate its operability, the method was implemented on a large part of the European continent, with CORINE Land Cover and High-Resolution Layers as training datasets. A land cover/use map for the year 2017 was produced, composed of 13 classes. An accuracy assessment, based on nearly 52,000 samples, revealed high thematic overall accuracy (86.1%) on a continental scale, and average overall accuracy of 86.5% at country level. Only low-frequency classes obtained lower accuracies and we recommend that their mapping should be improved in the future. Additional modifications to the classification legend, notably the fusion of thematically and spectrally similar vegetation classes, increased overall accuracy to 89.0%, and resulted in ten, general classes. A crucial aspect of the presented approach is that it embraces all of the most important elements of Earth observation data processing, enabling accurate and detailed (10 m spatial resolution) mapping with no manual user involvement. The presented methodology demonstrates possibility for frequent and repetitive operational production of large-scale land cover maps.

TI  - SASYA: An integrated framework for crop biophysical parameter retrieval and within-season crop yield prediction with SAR remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security can be assured with a reasonable crop yield forecast at a national and regional scale. The agencies require advance estimates of production of major crops at a regional scale for taking various policy decisions. Hence, it is necessary to develop operational systems for crop monitoring and yield forecasting. Unlike the traditional annual crop yield estimates based on the statistics-based framework, remote sensing techniques are recognized as an effective approach for yield forecasting. In particular, the microwave remote sensing data have gained importance due to its all-weather imaging capability and sensitivity to crop phenological changes. In this present work, an integrated framework `SASYA-Space technology for Agricultural Systems and Yield forecasting Algorithm' is introduced for crop yield forecasting using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing images. SASYA incorporates a model inversion scheme to estimate crop biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index-LAI and wet biomass) simultaneously using a multi-output support vector regression (MSVR). The framework cross-link the MSVR based inversion module with a yield prediction module, which utilizes the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) crop simulation model. The robustness of the framework is assessed for estimation of winter barley yield using L-band NISAR data simulated using full-pol L-band E-SAR airborne SAR data acquired during Agri-SAR 2006 campaign over DEMMIN test site in Germany. The simulated NISAR data in HH-HV-VV, HH-HV, and VV-HV modes are first compared by investigating accuracies to estimate crop biophysical parameters with the inversion of Water Cloud Model. These LAI and wet biomass estimates are then used in SASYA framework to assimilate with WOFOST crop yield model to estimate grain yield. Different polarization modes HH-HV-VV, HH-HV, and VV-HV are also assessed to investigate best performance in grain yield estimation. Also, different test cases are considered to find the suitable acquisition dates based on crop phenological stages, which returns the best potential yield estimation. The SAR images during heading and early fruit development stage are found to be most important for yield prediction with lowest RMSE error in the range of 0.57-1.612 ton/ha. The LAI, biomass and potential yield map indicate promising results, which can be used further for crop risk assessment for that region.

AB  - BackgroundIn the field of melanoma, clinical trials evaluating the impact of sentinel node biopsy, completion lymph node dissection and adjuvant medical therapies on patient outcomes have provided evidence that has changed practice significantly over the past five years.ObjectiveThe aim of this article is to discuss key evidence that has informed new Cancer Council Australia melanoma management guidelines.DiscussionGeneral practitioners play a critical role in melanoma diagnosis and follow-up. Complete excisional biopsy to achieve accurate tumour microstaging is essential for obtaining reliable prognostic information, planning further management and accessing adjuvant medical therapies. The management of patients with Stage III disease has changed dramatically over the past few years. Less surgery is now recommended, and patients may be offered potentially life-prolonging systemic therapies. Multidisciplinary discussion of management is recommended. Rapid advances in therapeutic options for patients with advanced melanoma have placed new emphasis on the importance of accurate staging and early management. Accordingly, the Australian national melanoma management guidelines have recently been updated. These evidence-based guidelines are now readily available on Cancer Council Australia's electronic Wiki platform, which facilitates regular further updating.

TI  - Experience of establishing severe acute respiratory surveillance in the Netherlands: Evaluation and challenges.
T2  - Public health in practice (Oxford, England)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend countries to establish a national severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) surveillance system for preparedness and emergency response. However, setting up or maintaining a robust SARI surveillance system has been challenging. Similar to other countries, surveillance data on hospitalisations for SARI in the Netherlands are still limited, in contrast to the robust surveillance data in primary care. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview, evaluation, and challenges of already available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands, which might be used for near real-time surveillance of severe respiratory infections. Seven available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands were reviewed. The evaluation criteria, including data quality, timeliness, representativeness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability and stability were based on United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines for public health surveillance. We added sustainability as additional evaluation criterion. The best evaluated surveillance system or dataset currently available for SARI surveillance is crude mortality monitoring, although it lacks specificity. In contrast to influenza-like illness (ILI) in primary care, there is currently no gold standard for SARI surveillance in the Netherlands. Based on our experience with sentinel SARI surveillance, a fully or semi-automated, passive surveillance system seems most suited for a sustainable SARI surveillance system. An important future challenge remains integrating SARI surveillance into existing hospital programs in order to make surveillance data valuable for public health, as well as hospital quality of care management and individual patient care.

TI  - Estimation of boreal forest floor reflectance from airborne hyperspectral data of coniferous forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In open forest canopies, such as in boreal forests, forest floor can contribute significantly to the observed top of canopy reflectance. In order to retrieve the biophysical properties of the tree layer, correcting for forest floor is essential. Traditionally, the algorithms for retrieval of forest floor reflectance depend on tree layer information such as leaf area index, canopy cover, and site fertility. To overcome these circular dependencies, we propose an algorithm that can be applied only using airborne remote sensing data. We acquired airborne hyperspectral imagery over the Hyytiala forest research station (61 degrees 50 ' N, 24 degrees 17 ' E) in central Finland on July 3rd in 2015 using a hyperspectral pushbroom line scanner. The image data had a spectral resolution of 4.6 nm, and the spatial resolution was 0.6 m. We developed a linear spectral unmixing algorithm, which is based on the definition of the reflectance factor, taking into account the variation of incident irradiance inside the canopy. The weights of the mixture can be computed from tree canopy gap fractions, a tree species insensitive leaf albedo, and average tree stand reflectance. Canopy gap fractions were retrieved with empirical methods available in scientific literature. The forest floor reflectance in the near-infrared increased with site fertility in agreement with the forest floor field measurements. Moreover, we found that in near infrared, the reflectance of moderately rich and moist upland forests was significantly different from all other fertility classes. Finally, we tested the reflectance decomposition on the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) known to be heavily affected by understory reflectance and canopy structure, and the forest PRI to be decoupled from the PRI of the overand understory.

TI  - Orinoco: Retrieving a River Delta Network with the Fast Marching Method and Python
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We present Orinoco, an open-source Python toolkit that applies the fast-marching method to derive a river delta channel network from a water mask and ocean delineation. We are able to estimate flow direction, along-channel distance, channel width, and network-related metrics for deltaic analyses including the steady-state fluxes. To demonstrate the capabilities of the toolkit, we apply our software to the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya River Deltas using water masks derived from Open Street Map (OSM) and Google Maps. We validate our width estimates using the Global River Width from Landsat (GRWL) database over the Mackenzie Delta as well as in situ width measurements from the National Water Information System (NWIS) in the southeastern United States. We also compare the stream flow direction estimates using products from RivGraph, a related Python package with similar functionality. With the exciting opportunities afforded with forthcoming surface water and topography (SWOT) data, we envision Orinoco as a tool to support the characterization of the complex structure of river deltas worldwide and to make such analyses easily accessible within a Python remote sensing workflow. To support that end, all the data, analyses, and figures in this paper can be found within Jupyter notebooks at Orinoco's GitHub repository.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse a consecutive series of patients with oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma who had had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at our hospital during 2008-2017. A total of 70 patients with clinically and radiologically confirmed primary oral (n = 67) or oropharyngeal (n = 3) carcinoma, with no signs of metastatic lymph nodes preoperatively (clinically N0) were included. Patients' clinical and personal data, characteristics of the tumours, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status and outcomes were recorded. Eight patients had invaded SLN. Two patients with clear sentinel lymph node biopsies had recurrences in the cervical lymph nodes with no new primary tumour as origin. The negative predictive value (NPV) and sensitivity for SLNB were 97% and 80%, respectively. The depth of invasion was an individual predictor for cervical lymph node metastasis (p = 0.043). Single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT) detected fewer SLN in patients with invaded lymph nodes than in patients with clear lymph nodes (p = 0.018). Our data support the use of SLNB as a minimally invasive method for staging the cervical lymph nodes among patients with cN0 oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma.Our results further confirm that greater depth of invasion is associated with cervical lymph node metastases.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Predictive Modelling of Sorghum Biomass Using UAV-Based Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-throughput phenotyping using high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution remote sensing (RS) data has become a critical part of the plant breeding chain focused on reducing the time and cost of the selection process for the "best" genotypes with respect to the trait(s) of interest. In this paper, the potential of accurate and reliable sorghum biomass prediction using visible and near infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral data as well as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquired by sensors mounted on UAV platforms is investigated. Predictive models are developed using classical regression-based machine learning methods for nine experiments conducted during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) at Purdue University, Indiana, USA. The impact of the regression method, data source, timing of RS and field-based biomass reference data acquisition, and the number of samples on the prediction results are investigated. R-2 values for end-of-season biomass ranged from 0.64 to 0.89 for different experiments when features from all the data sources were included. Geometry-based features derived from the LiDAR point cloud to characterize plant structure and chemistry-based features extracted from hyperspectral data provided the most accurate predictions. Evaluation of the impact of the time of data acquisition during the growing season on the prediction results indicated that although the most accurate and reliable predictions of final biomass were achieved using remotely sensed data from mid-season to end-of-season, predictions in mid-season provided adequate results to differentiate between promising varieties for selection. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the accuracies of the predictive models showed that both the data source and regression method are important factors for a reliable prediction; however, the data source was more important with 69% significance, versus 28% significance for the regression method.

TI  - Rural-Urban Transition of Hanoi (Vietnam): Using Landsat Imagery to Map Its Recent Peri-Urbanization
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The current trend towards global urbanization presents new environmental and social challenges. For this reason, it is increasingly important to monitor urban growth, mainly in those regions undergoing the fastest urbanization, such as Southeast Asia. Hanoi (Vietnam) is a rapidly growing medium-sized city: since new economic policies were introduced in 1986, this area has experienced a rapid demographic rise and radical socio-economic transformation. In this study, we aim to map not only the recent urban expansion of Hanoi, but also of its surroundings. For this reason, our study area consists of the districts within a 30km radius of the city center. To analyze the rural-urban dynamics, we identified three hypothetical rings from the center: the core (within a 10 km radius), the first ring (the area between 10 and 20 km) and, finally, the outer zone (over 20 km). To map land use/land cover (LULC) changes, we classified a miniseries of Landsat images, collected approximately every ten years (1989, 2000, 2010 and 2019). To better define the urban dynamics, we then applied the following spatial indexes: the rate of urban expansion, four landscape metrics (the number of patches, the edge length, the mean patch area and the largest patch index) and the landscape expansion index. The results show how much the city's original shape has changed over the last thirty years: confined for hundreds of years in a limited space on the right bank of the Red River, it is now a fringed city which has developed beyond the river into the surrounding periurban areas. Moreover, the region around Hanoi is no longer solely rural: in just thirty years, urbanization has converted this territory into an industrial and commercial region.

TI  - Predicting fine-scale forage distribution to inform ungulate nutrition
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantity and nutritional quality of forage are key drivers for ungulate populations, including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), in the western U.S., but current vege-tation maps are too coarse spatially and temporally to effectively characterize fine-scale habitat. To address some of these gaps, we tested a novel approach using existing vegetation surveys, maps, and remotely sensed data to develop fine-scale forage species distribution models (SDMs) across Idaho, USA. We modelled 20 forage species that are suitable for mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk. Climatic, topographic, soil, vegetation, and disturbance variables were attributed to approximately 44.3 million habitat patches generated using multi-scale object -oriented image analysis. Lasso logistic regression was implemented to produce predictive SDMs. We evaluated if the inclusion of distal environmental variables (i.e., indirect effects) improved model performance beyond the inclusion of proximal variables (i.e., direct physiological effect) only. Our results showed that all models provided higher predictive accuracy than chance, with an average AUC across the 20 forage species of 0.84 for distal and proximal variables and 0.81 for proximal variables only. This indicated that the addition of distal variables improved model performance. We validated the models using two independent datasets from two regions of Idaho. We found that predicted forage species occurrence was on average within 10% of observed occurrence at both sites. However, predicted occurrences had much less variability between habitat patches than the validation data, implying that the models did not fully capture fine-scale heterogeneity. We suggest that future efforts will benefit from additional fine resolution (i.e., less than 30 m) environmental predictor variables and greater accounting of environmental disturbances (i.e., wildfire, grazing) in the training data. Our approach was novel both in methodology and spatial scale (i.e., resolution and extent). Our models can inform ungulate nutrition by predicting the occurrence of forage species and aide habitat management strategies to improve nutritional quality.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Mine Site Rehabilitation for Ecological Outcomes: A Global Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The mining industry has been operating across the globe for millennia, but it is only in the last 50 years that remote sensing technology has enabled the visualization, mapping and assessment of mining impacts and landscape recovery. Our review of published literature (1970-2019) found that the number of ecologically focused remote sensing studies conducted on mine site rehabilitation increased gradually, with the greatest proportion of studies published in the 2010-2019 period. Early studies were driven exclusively by Landsat sensors at the regional and landscape scales while in the last decade, multiple earth observation and drone-based sensors across a diverse range of study locations contributed to our increased understanding of vegetation development post-mining. The Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) was the most common index, and was used in 45% of papers; while research that employed image classification techniques typically used supervised (48%) and manual interpretation methods (37%). Of the 37 publications that conducted error assessments, the average overall mapping accuracy was 84%. In the last decade, new classification methods such as Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) have emerged (10% of studies within the last ten years), along with new platforms and sensors such as drones (15% of studies within the last ten years) and high spatial and/or temporal resolution earth observation satellites. We used the monitoring standards recommended by the International Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) to determine the ecological attributes measured by each study. Most studies (63%) focused on land cover mapping (spatial mosaic); while comparatively fewer studies addressed complex topics such as ecosystem function and resilience, species composition, and absence of threats, which are commonly the focus of field-based rehabilitation monitoring. We propose a new research agenda based on identified knowledge gaps and the ecological monitoring tool recommended by SER, to ensure that future remote sensing approaches are conducted with a greater focus on ecological perspectives, i.e., in terms of final targets and end land-use goals. In particular, given the key rehabilitation requirement of self-sustainability, the demonstration of ecosystem resilience to disturbance and climate change should be a key area for future research.

TI  - Over a decade monitoring Fiji's seagrass condition demonstrates resilience to anthropogenic pressures and extreme climate events
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass are an important marine ecosystem of the Fiji Islands. We confirm six seagrass species from the archipelago and defined five broad categories of seagrass habitat. We report, with high confidence, seagrass meadows covering 59.19 km(2) of Fiji's shallow water habitats from literature and this study. Long-term monitoring of seagrass abundance, species composition, and seed banks at eight sentinel sites, found no long-term trends. Examination of key attributes that affect seagrass resilience identified meadows as predominately enduring and dominated by opportunistic species which had moderate physiological resistance, and high recovery capacity. We examined threats to Fiji's seagrass meadows from extreme climatic events and anthropogenic activities using a suite of indicators, identifying water quality as a major pressure. Based on these findings, we assessed existing protections in Fiji afforded to seagrass and their services. This understanding will help to better manage for seagrass resilience and focus future seagrass research in Fiji.

AB  - In precision viticulture, the knowledge of the spatial distribution of soil characteristics is necessary to optimize the agro-cultural practices. In this work a multi-parametric approach, based on different satellite sensors and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), is evaluate to detect areas with similar soils characteristics. The Misra Soil Brightness Index (MSBI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) spectral indices are extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery for main distribution of soil and vegetation characteristics. COmbined Spectral Response Index (COSRI) and Soil Background Line (SBL) spectral indices are calculated from Pleiades data for a more accurate delimitation of soil homogenous areas. Digital Elevation Model, Ortophoto and slope maps retrieval of UAV data are also included within a Geographical Information System for morphological analysis. The analysis of such different thematic layers allow to set up a dedicated and specific grid for soil sampling on each analysed vineyard unit. Finally, spectroradiometric and chemical (Electric Conductivity and pH) laboratory measurements of sampled soils allow to obtain the Normalized Differential Salinity Index (NDSI) and EC map. In accordance with satellite analysis, such analysis delimit soil heterogeneity spatial distribution highlighting areas potentially subjected to salinity stress and, consequently, to a different grapes production and maturity trend.

TI  - A fast and accurate radiative transfer model for aerosol remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - After several decades' development of retrieval techniques in aerosol remote sensing, no fast and accurate analytical Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) has been developed and applied to create global aerosol products for non-polarimetric instruments such as Ocean and Land Colour Instrument/Sentinel-3 (OLCI/Sentinel-3) and Meteosat Second Generation/Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG/SEVIRI). Global aerosol retrieval algorithms are typically based on a Look-Up-Table (LUT) technique, requiring high-performance computers. The current eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm also utilizes the LUT method. In order to have a near-real time retrieval and achieve a quick and accurate "FIRST-LOOK" aerosol product without high-demand of computing resource, we have developed a Fast and Accurate Semi-analytical Model of Atmosphere-surface Reflectance (FASMAR) for aerosol remote sensing. The FASMAR is developed based on a successive order of scattering technique. In FASMAR, the first three orders of scattering are calculated exactly. The contribution of higher orders of scattering is estimated using an extrapolation technique and an additional correction function. The evaluation of FASMAR has been performed by comparing with radiative transfer model SCIATRAN for all typical observation/illumination geometries, surface/aerosol conditions, and wavelengths 412, 550, 670, 870, 1600, 2100 nm used for aerosol remote sensing. The selected observation/illumination conditions are based on the observations from both geostationary satellite (e.g. MSG/SEVIRI) and polarorbit satellite (e.g. OLCI/Sentinel-3). The percentage error of the top of atmosphere reflectance calculated by FASMAR is within +/- 3% for typical polar-orbit/geostationary satellites' observation/illumination geometries. The accuracy decreases for solar and viewing zenith angles larger than 70 degrees. However, even in such cases, the error is within the range +/- 5%. The evaluation of model performance also shows that FASMAR can be used for all typical surfaces with albedo in the interval [0 - 1] and aerosol with optical thickness in the range [0.01 -1].

TI  - Rupture kinematics of 2020 January 24 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.7 Doganyol-Sivrice, Turkey earthquake on the East Anatolian Fault Zone imaged by space geodesy
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we present the results of a kinematic slip model of the 2020 M-w 6.7 Doganyol-Sivrice, Turkey Earthquake, the most important event in the last 50 yr on the East Anatolian Fault Zone. Our slip model is constrained by two Sentinel-1 interferograms and by 5 three-component high-rate GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) recordings close to the earthquake source. We find that most of the slip occurs predominantly in three regions, two of them at between 2 and 10 km depth and a deeper slip region extending down to 20 km depth. We also relocate the first two weeks of aftershocks and Ilnd a distribution of events that agrees with these slip features. The HR-GNSS recordings suggest a predominantly unilateral rupture with the effects of a directivity pulse clearly seen in the waveforms and in the measure peak ground velocities. The slip model supports rupture propagation from northeast to southwest at a relatively slow speed of 2.2 km s(-1) and a total source duration of similar to 20 s. In the absence of ncar-source seismic stations, space geodetic data provide the best constraint on the spatial distribution of slip and on its time evolution.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of aquatic insects in ecological studies of oil palm plantations provides an effective evaluation of biodiversity loss caused by changes in habitat. Approaches at the population or community level associated with biomarker analyses might help in the management and conservation of impacted habitats. Our aim was to assess detoxification responses (Glutathione S-transferase activity) of three aquatic invertebrates (Mnesarete aenea, Cylindrostethus palmaris, and Campylocia anceps) in oil palm plantations and forested areas in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. A total of 20 streams were sampled during the dry season of 2017, in the municipality of Tailandia, Para - Brazil. The response of this exposure biomarker was related with water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, canopy cover and habitat integrity index. The species M. aenea and C. palmaris showed differences in detoxification response induction, with higher specific activity in oil palm areas than in forest areas. The conversion of natural landscape and use of agrochemicals in oil palm plantations might affect the dynamics of organisms that are sensitive to changes in habitat quality. We suggest that differences in Habitat Integrity Index between oil palm and Amazon forest areas is a determining factor in increased GST induction in M. aenea. This result indicates that this organism might act as a sentinel for biomarker evaluations, providing an early warning signal via its biochemical responses that could help to prevent changes at the population and community levels.

TI  - ESMO consensus conference recommendations on the management of locoregional melanoma: under the auspices of the ESMO Guidelines Committee
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) held a consensus conference on melanoma on 5-7 September 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The conference included a multidisciplinary panel of 32 leading experts in the management of melanoma. The aim of the conference was to develop recommendations on topics that are not covered in detail in the current ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline and where available evidence is either limited or conflicting. The main topics identified for discussion were: (i) the management of locoregional disease; (ii) targeted versus immunotherapies in the adjuvant setting; (iii) targeted versus immunotherapies for the first-line treatment of metastatic melanoma; (iv) when to stop immunotherapy or targeted therapy in the metastatic setting; and (v) systemic versus local treatment of brain metastases. The expert panel was divided into five working groups in order to each address questions relating to one of the five topics outlined above. Relevant scientific literature was reviewed in advance. Recommendations were developed by the working groups and then presented to the entire panel for further discussion and amendment before voting. This manuscript presents the results relating to the management of locoregional melanoma, including findings from the expert panel discussions, consensus recommendations and a summary of evidence supporting each recommendation. All participants approved the final manuscript.

TI  - Trans-boundary land cover changes and its influences on water crisis: Case study of the Aras River
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a watershed, disturbing land covers (LCs) are one of the most important factors in the balance and flow rate of water. This study aimed to monitor and model LC changes in the upstream of the Aras River Basin in Turkey over 1984, 2002, 2010 and 2016. The main ground to conduct such an analysis was to mitigate severe economic, social and ecological consequences driven by agricultural activities and dam construction along with probable climate change, which would decrease the water flow from the Aras River to Caspian Sea. The study approach consisted of four main steps: 1) producing LC maps using Landsat satellite images, 2) performing the change analysis, 3) identifying the change driver variables for each of the calibration period, and 4) identifying the most accurate scenario and predicting maps of the years 2026 and 2036 based on the calibration periods (i.e., 1984-2002 and 2002-2010) using the Land Change Modeler (LCM). Moreover, the net changes in each LC were studied as well the transition from one LC to another and the spatial pattern of these changes over a 32-year period. The results show the growth of agricultural, industrial and residential lands in the upstream during 1984-2016. This trend seems to be more critical in 2026 and 2036. The construction of small to medium sized dams and redirecting rivers in order to supply water for increasing agricultural lands and industrial/municipal areas will affect the quantity of water flowing to downstream. This decreasing trend in water flow of upstream areas will intensify the shortage of water used for agricultural, industrial and drinking purposes in downstream countries in future. This study suggests that the Aras River Basin, as one of the most important feeders of the Caspian Sea, needs more protection and monitoring programs. Likewise, similar studies must be conducted in Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan given these countries plan to preserve the quality and quantity of the Aras River.

TI  - Open surface water index: a novel approach for surface water mapping and extraction using multispectral and multisensory data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a novel water index has been proposed for mapping of open surface water in multispectral images and named as open surface water index (OSWI). The proposed index has been applied on Landsat-8 data to delineate the water area and the results are compared with those of existing water indices. The index is also applied on Sentinel-2A data and corresponding water pixels are extracted. The results have been validated with the help of classification as well as density slicing based methods on multisensory data. The preliminary results show that the proposed index is capable of identifying smaller water regions which remain unidentified by other indices.

TI  - Vis-NIR Spectroscopy and Satellite Landsat-8 OLI Data to Map Soil Nutrients in Arid Conditions: A Case Study of the Northwest Coast of Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of soil nutrients is a key issue for numerous applications and research fields ranging from global changes to environmental degradation, from sustainable soil management to the precision agriculture concept. The characterization, modeling and mapping of soil properties at diverse spatial and temporal scales are key factors required for different environments. This paper is focused on the use and comparison of soil chemical analyses, Visible near infrared and shortwave infrared VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy, partial least-squares regression (PLSR), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) images, to inexpensively analyze and predict the content of different soil nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)), pH, and soil organic matter (SOM) in arid conditions. To achieve this aim, 100 surface samples of soil were gathered to a depth of 25 cm in the Wadi El-Garawla area (the northwest coast of Egypt) using chemical analyses and reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. PLSR was used firstly to model the relationship between the averaged values from the ASD spectroradiometer and the available N, P, and K, pH and SOM contents in soils in order to map the predicted value using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and secondly to retrieve N, P, K, pH, and SOM values from OLI images. Thirty soil samples were selected to verify the validity of the results. The randomly selected samples included the spatial diversity and characteristics of the study area. The prediction of available of N, P, K pH and SOM in soils using VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy showed high performance (where R-2 was 0.89, 0.72, 0.91, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively) and quite satisfactory results from Landsat-8 OLI images (correlation R-2 values 0.71, 0.68, 0.55, 0.62 and 0.7, respectively). The results showed that about 84% of the soils of Wadi El-Garawla are characterized by low-to-moderate fertility, while about 16% of the area is characterized by high soil fertility.

TI  - Sensitivity of various topographic data in flood management: Implications on inundation mapping over large data-scarce regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic data in the form of digital elevation models (DEMs) play a significant role in flood management. Despite the increasing availability of DEMs for large regions, there is a need to evaluate their performance at the inundation/flood level, while considering the overall complexity of flood models. The present study identifies, for the first time, the uncertainties generated in both river channel and overland flooding while considering a set of nine variants from various sources (LiDAR, Cartosat, SRTM, and ASTER) and grid resolutions (resampled versions) in the presence of discharge, rainfall, and tide boundary conditions for a severely flood-prone catchment in the Mahanadi River Basin, India. Extensive geostatistical analyses reveal the existence of significant biases with global DEMs i.e., SRTM and ASTER, whereas interestingly the LiDAR and Carto DEMs exhibit a high degree of isotropy. The global DEMs fail to capture several inundated spots; thus plummeting the flood inundation extents to a sufficient degree of unacceptability. Prominently, the inability in identifying high and very high flood depths (> 1.5 m) over the coastal stretches results in large uncertainties in the majority of the grids. Our analysis reveals the existence of significant noise in global DEMs, which nullifies the hydrodynamic interaction during the coupling of 1-D and 2-D flood models in presence of tidal influence. We recommend that under unavailability of precise LiDAR DEMs, resampled and freely available Carto DEMs, that are as efficient as LiDAR if not more, be given higher preference. We caution against the copious usage of global DEMs for large data-scarce and flood-prone regions, as the DEM uncertainty may be substantially amplified at the inundation level during combined channel and overland flood simulations. Through this study, we would like to recommend the proposed framework as a guided step while selecting appropriate DEM for flood inundation mapping over large data scarce regions.

TI  - Unitemporal approach to fire severity mapping using multispectral synthetic databases and Random Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity assessment is crucial for predicting ecosystem response and prioritizing post-fire forest management strategies. Although a variety of remote sensing approaches have been developed, more research is still needed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of fire severity mapping. This study proposes a unitemporal simulation approach based on the generation of synthetic spectral databases from linear spectral mixing. To fully exploit the potential of these training databases, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to build a classifier and regression model. The predictive models parameterized with the synthetic datasets were applied in a case study, the Sierra de Luna wildfire in Spain. Single date Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery of the immediate post-fire environment were used to develop the validation spectral datasets and a Pleiades orthoimage, providing the ground truth data. The four defined severity categories - unburned (UB), partial canopy unburned (PCU), canopy scorched (CS), and canopy consumed (CC) - demonstrated high accuracy in the bootstrapped (about 95%) and real validation sets (about 90%), with a slightly better performance observed when the Sentinel-2A dataset was used. Abundance of four ground covers (green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and ash) was also quantified with moderate (similar to 45% for NPV) or high accuracy (higher than 75% for the remaining covers). No specific pattern in the comparison of sensors was observed. Variable importance analysis highlighted the complementary behavior of the spectral bands, although the contrast between the near and shortwave infrared regions stood out above the rest. Comparison of procedures reinforced the usefulness of the approach, as RF image-derived models and the multiple endmember spectral unmixing technique (MESMA) showed lower accuracy. The capabilities for detailed mapping are reflected in the development of different types of cartography (classification maps and fraction cover maps). The approach holds great potential for fire severity assessment, and future research needs to extend the predictive modeling to other burned areas - also in different ecosystems - and analyze its competence and the possible adaptations needed.

TI  - Does Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) of Normal/Benign Axillary Lymph Nodes in Patients with Breast Cancer Identify Significant Axillary Nodal Burden?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of the axilla allows preoperative identification and biopsy of the sentinel lymph node. Our aims were to evaluate the accuracy of the CEUS procedure for identifying axillary lymph node metastases preoperatively and compare the volume of axillary metastases in patients with malignant versus benign CEUS guided core biopsy at end of primary surgical treatment.Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on patients with breast cancer with normal axillary ultrasound or benign axillary FNAC undergoing preoperatively CEUS guided sentinel lymph node biopsy between 2013 and 2018.Results: SLN was successfully identified by CEUS in 186 (90.7%) of patients with definitive diagnosis obtained in 163 (87.6%). Overall sensitivity was 55.77%, but significantly higher for high volume disease (77.78%) than for low volume disease (32.00%, odds ratio = 7.44, 95% CI = 2.16 to 25.62, p = .001) Specificity was 100%. NPV was 82.84% overall, 86.72% for low volume disease and 94.87 % for high volume disease. 72.4% of patients with initial malignant CEUS guided SLN core biopsy had two or more macrometastases at end of surgical treatment compared to 4.47% of patients with initial benign CEUS guided core biopsy.Conclusion: When disease was present, CEUS guided sentinel lymph node core biopsy identify nodal metastases in 55.77% of patients with normal axillary grey scale ultrasound. This study suggests that the likelihood of extensive axillary disease at end of surgical treatment is low with an initial benign CEUS guided SLN core biopsy.

TI  - Application of NDVI for identify potentiality of the urban forest for the design of a green corridors system in intermediary cities of Latin America: Case study, Temuco, Chile
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern cities are constantly growing; this fact provokes strong environmental pressure as pollution, health problems, stress, and other troubles which as a whole reduces the citizens' life quality. Some decades ago, the concept sustainable urban planning was created; the concept intends to generate friendly cities with a planned development. This research contributes to this task evaluating the potential that urban forests could have in the design of green corridors for Latin American intermediate cities (case study, Temuco, Chile).For the analysis and the generation of data, the Geographic Information System was applied. Also, the mul-tispectral images were used with data derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The satellite used was the Sentinel-2, which gives red and infrared spectral information with a resolution of 10 x 10 m pixels providing vital information to analyze the quality of the vegetation. Methodologies applied were based on forestry ecosystem samples as well as on satellite technology. This helped to define the quality of the urban green areas allowing the connection to future green corridors.From these tools it was found that the green areas possess good quality vegetation, establishing the sanity, the form, the plant vigor, the stress, the chlorophyll activity and the vegetal cover. The results demonstrate that these combined methodologies of forestry ecology and geospatial tools, such as NDVI, are a good possibility to generate a continuous monitoring and follow up system of public areas, which in turn will allow a planning of those cities that contribute to a sustainable urban planning and with a better life quality for their population.

TI  - Prognostic Role of Non-Identification of Sentinel Lymph Node in Cutaneous Melanoma Patients: An Observational Retrospective Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummarySentinel lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor for patients with cutaneous melanoma, but occasionally it is not possible to identify the sentinel lymph node. Little is known in cutaneous melanoma literature about the phenomenon of non-identification of sentinel lymph node and its prognostic implications. In this study we observed that not identifying the sentinel lymph node involves a worse nodal disease-free survival, but not a worse melanoma-specific survival than a negative sentinel lymph node. Potentially, patients with non-identified SLN should receive a follow-up schedule like that of patients with positive SLN.Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is recognized as the most important prognostic factor for patients with cutaneous melanoma. However, sometimes it is not possible to identify SLN. The phenomenon of non-identification of SLN and its prognostic role have not been thoroughly evaluated in melanoma literature. The objective of this study was to identify which patient or tumor variables may be associated to non-identification of SLN and to evaluate the prognostic role of non-identification of SLN. Methods: Observational retrospective study of 834 cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent SLN biopsy at Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia. Results: Forty-two patients (5%) presented non-identification of SLN. Patients with age at diagnosis of >= 64 years, obesity (BMI >= 30), and head and neck localization were at higher risk of non-identification of SLN. Non-identified SLN patients had worse nodal disease-free survival with respect to negative SLN patients, but not worse melanoma-specific survival. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a need to follow-up patients with non-identified SLN in the same way as patients with positive SLN.

TI  - National Trend of Axillary Management in Clinical T3/T4 N0 Patients Having Breast Conserving Therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The ACOSOG Z0011 trial has essentially eliminated axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast conserving therapy (BCT) patients with clinical T1/T2 and 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Currently, ALND is recommended for positive SLNs unless ACOSOG Z0011 criteria are applicable. We aimed to assess the national trends and axillary management before and after the publication of ACOSOG Z0011 for larger tumors.Methods: An IRB-approved study evaluated the National Cancer Database from 2006 to 2016. Women with clinical T3/T4, N0 who otherwise fit ACOSOG Z0011 criteria were included. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy or known nodal disease was excluded. Clinicopathologic data were compared between two timeframes based on ACOSOZ Z0011 publication and by axillary management. Patients were categorized into SLNB alone (1-5 lymph nodes examined) and ALND (>= 10 lymph nodes examined) groups.Results: A total of 230 women fit inclusion criteria, of whom 36% underwent ALND. ALND use decreased from 54% in 2006 to 14% in 2016 (P < 0.01). Comparing ALND to SLNB alone within the pre-Z0011 era, comprehensive community cancer programs had higher proportions of ALND, whereas academic centers had higher rates of SLND alone (P = 0.03). Comparing similar axillary management between eras, SLNB-alone patients in the post-Z0011 era had higher pT and pN stages, were less likely to be Her2 positive, and were more likely to receive systemic treatment.Conclusions: There is a national trend to forgo ALND in women who have tumors larger than those included in the Z0011 criteria without any clear clinicopathologic indications.

TI  - The wind erodibility in the newly emerged surfaces of Urmia Playa Lake and adjacent agricultural lands and its determining factors
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the great extent of Urmia Playa Lake (UPL), researchers have rarely ever studied the development of playa surfaces and their vulnerability to dust emission. Therefore, we aimed the current research to study the formation of UPL surfaces and how their physicochemical, mineralogical and geomorphological characteristics affect their susceptibility to wind erosion. An area of 41 km(2) was chosen including lands from UPL and adjacent Agricultural Lands (AL). Different playa surfaces were identified on different geomorphic surfaces and mapped using Landsat images. Later, 75 soil samples from depth of 0-5 cm of different map units were collected and subjected to physicochemical analysis. Soil Erodible Fraction (EF) was also measured as an index for the wind erodibility of the examined soil surfaces. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis of soil samples from three playa surfaces with significantly different EF values were also conducted. Major reasons for the development of different playa surfaces were found to be basically related to geomorphic surfaces on which they have developed, size and mineralogical composition of the sediments as well as the landscape position and depth to the groundwater. Statistical analysis of EF of different playa surfaces and AL showed that Salt Crusts (SC) had the lowest mean EF value due to the formation of a thin layer of salt on its surface as it has developed on low stand geomorphic surface being fine-textured by nature and rich in Na, Mg and Cl ions. Abandoned Agricultural lands (AA) and AL had the highest mean EF values. High sand content of soils with anthropogenic origin along with conventional tillage practices resulting in soil organic matter loss and over grazing were the major reasons of their high EF. Therefore, these surfaces need to be monitored carefully and to be of high priority of conservation and dust control programs in the region.

TI  - Exploring the utility of Sentinel-2 MSI derived spectral indices in mapping burned areas in different land-cover types
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The difference in structure and composition of landcover types requires accurate mapping of burned areas for post-fire ecological assessments. Spectral indices for burned area mapping are mostly hard-coded to particular environments. However, the best post-fire spectral index to use for burned area mapping in most unstudied landcover types is not known. In this study, out of nine burned mapping indices optimised using the red-edge band, we tested which index outperformed the others in different land cover types. We used the Random Forest (RF) classifier to detect burned areas from Sentinel 2A imagery in four study sites and assessed the classification accuracy. We found out that, the Burned Area Index (BAI) and Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) spectral indices outperformed other indices in open shrublands, evergreen forest and in needle-leaved and semi-deciduous forests. The lowest performing spectral indices in the four study sites were Optimised Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), Normalise Burn Ratio (NBR), and Normalise Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We recommend that for future studies, researchers and ecologists should use BAI and GEMI in mapping fires in open shrublands, evergreen, needle-leaved and semi-deciduous forests. Our results provide necessary insight for burned mapping algorithms and the accurate estimation of post-fire carbon emission with uni-temporal spectral indices in open shrublands, evergreen, needle-leaved and semideciduous forests.

TI  - Monitoring the urban environment quality in the city of Johannesburg using remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification and analysis of urban greenness is important in evaluating the role of urban trees in carbon sequestration and regulating land surface temperature of an urban environment. Landsat 8 satellite data was used to evaluate the effects of urban heat island based on land surface temperature (LST) in the affluent suburb of Rosebank in the north and the previously marginalized township of Soweto south of Johannesburg. It was found that the LST of Soweto was 2.58 degrees C hotter than Rosebank, suggesting that high-density areas with less street trees and parks are hotter than low-density suburbs. The Pearson's correlation coefficient computed between the LST and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the two areas, Rosebank and Soweto showed a positive correlation of 0.92 and 0.98) and a negative correlation of -0.91 and -0.99 respectively. The correlation between the NDVI and NDBI also showed negative values of -0.90 and -0.85, respectively. Based on the global bench mark for safe solar UVI, the residents of Soweto are likely to be at risk of skin and eye damage due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation than the residents of Rosebank. Thus, this study has effectively computed and evaluated the land surface temperatures of the two study areas from Landsat 8 satellite data, an information which can help potential vegetation cover programs to improve existing disparity in urban greenness in the city of Johannesburg.

TI  - The concept of "female beauty" in Tatar and Yakut literature
T2  - REVISTA SAN GREGORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research is focused on studying the features of representation of the concept of "female beauty" in the literature of Turkic peoples illustrated by writing of the founders of Tatar and Yakut literatures. The subject of the research is the means of representation of this concept in the works of U.M. Tukay "Tatar kyzlaryna" ("To Tatar girls", 1906) and A.E. Kulakovsky "Kyrasyabay Kyys" ("Beautiful girl", 1910). Common and distinctive features in representation of female personages in the works of the two poets Were revealed in the course of comparative analysis. The relevance of the research is due to good perspectives of studying the concept a basis, revealing the worldview of people. At the same time, comparing concepts that belong to consciousness of bearers of different cultures makes possible determination of their common and specific characteristics. A discrete role in the objectification of the concept and the concept formation itself belongs to metaphorical singings that reflect the values of people and carry cultural stereotypes from generation to generation. The concept of "female beauty", being one of the most important categories of culture, can demonstrate this assumption in a most interesting and complete way. Thus, the scientific novelty of the study is determined by the fact that it is the first attempt of comparative analysis of the "female beauty" undertaken in Turkic poetry. The analysis of the works harkens back to the social, philosophical and spiritual foundations of depicted phenomenon. images of beautiful girls and ideals of beauty, created in works of the representatives of different cultures, are not only based on traditions of the national folklore, but are also linked by the philosophical idea of the "beauty saving the world". As a result, while remaining national (images of everyday life, nature, geographical environment, features of perception of the world), the images acquire a timeless, universal character (purity, innocence, and psyche). This work may play an important role in the comparative study of Turkic literatures, namely those of Tatar and Yakut.

TI  - Map-based site-specific seeding of consumption potato production using high-resolution soil and crop data fusion
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maximizing potato productivity and economic return calls for a proper seeding technology that is capable to manage in-field soil variability by optimizing the input seed densities. Current study evaluates the agronomic and economic potential of site-specific seeding (SSS) of consumable potato in comparison with uniform rate seeding (URS) approach. Two treatments of map-based SSS were tested in two study sites i.e., Dal (5.5 ha) and Bottelare (5.4 ha) in Belgium. In the first treatment, soil apparent electrical conductivity measured with an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor (EMI-SSS) was used as the management zone proxy data, and in the second treatment, soil fertility attributes measured with an on-line visible and near-infrared spectroscopy were fused with Sentinel-2 retrieved normalized difference vegetation index (VNIRS-SSS). In-row seed-to-seed distances were varied by 29, 31, 36, 40, 43 cm for Dal, and 25, 31, 36, 43, 47 cm for Bottelare following the prescription rule of sowing more seeds to the more fertile zones and vice-versa, whereas 36 cm seeding interval was applied for the control URS treatment. Yield analysis indicated that the SSS improved tuber yields, saved seed costs, and accordingly increased net economic return compared to the URS. The highest yield was harvested in Dal field for VNIRS-SSS (59.13 t/ha), followed by EMI-SSS (58.39 t/ha) and URS (56.16 t/ha). The VNIRS-SSS also produced higher yield (16.75 t/ha) at Bottelare site than EMI-SSS (16.49 t/ha) and URS (13.70 t/ha). The net profit of the SSS treatments was 5.35 to 56.0% higher than that of the URS treatment. The VNIRS-SSS treatment produced the highest net return (380.27 (sic)/ha) for Dal, while EMI-SSS resulted in the highest net return (447.67 (sic)/ha) for Bottelare. Therefore, regardless of the type of data/sensor used, map-based SSS is recommended for improving the production of consumption potato and increasing net economic margin.

TI  - Partnerships and Stakeholder Participation in the Management of National Parks: Experiences of the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - National parks play an important role in maintaining natural ecosystems which are important sources of income and livelihood sustenance. Most national parks in Southern Africa are managed by their states. Before 2007, Gonarezhou National Park was managed by the Zimbabwe Parks Management and Wildlife Authority, which faced challenges in maintaining its biodiversity, community relations and infrastructure. However, in 2017 the Frankfurt Zoological Society and the Zimbabwe Parks Management and Wildlife Authority formed an innovative partnership under the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust (GCT). This study examines the relationship between GCT management, Gonarezhou National Park stakeholders and communities as well as the impact of the relationship on biodiversity and ecosystems. The study also highlights challenges faced and lessons learned in managing Gonarezhou as a protected area. To obtain the information, key informant interviews, Landsat satellite imagery, secondary data from previous studies and government sources were utilized. The results indicate that the concerted efforts of the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust to manage the park are starting to bear fruit in improving biodiversity conservation, ecosystem management and engaging communities. However, challenges such as governance obstacles, problematic stakeholder management, maintaining trust in community relations, ensuring sustainability, managing the adverse impacts of climate change and human-wildlife conflicts must still be navigated to ensure the park's sustainable management. Notwithstanding challenges, we argue that a partnership arrangement such as the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust is a desirable model that can be applied in national parks in Zimbabwe and Africa for better biodiversity management and tourism.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF FLOOD-AFFECTED AREAS DUE TO EXTREME WEATHER IN PACITAN, INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones trigger floods in parts of Indonesia and result in massive damage. Tropical Cyclone Cempaka in 2017 is an example of such an event, which caused high levels of loss of life and property in Pacitan Regency. This area is located in the southern part of Java Island, an area prone to tropical cyclones. This paper aims to identify the specific area of Pacitan, Indonesia, that is affected to flood hazards triggered by extreme weather. The flood event during Cyclone Cempaka in 2017 is used as a case study, and the identification of flood-affected areas due to extreme weather was carried out by an analysis of Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Normalized Differentiation Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the inundated areas at that time, corrected by Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), slope, and landform. The flood-affected area included 11 villages with a total area of 412.684 hectares. Those villages are located in areas of landform resulting from fluvial processes with slope 0-2 and 2-7% which are prone to flooding. The results of the identification are appropriate for preparing mitigation strategies for the area.

TI  - Land Cover Dynamics and Mangrove Degradation in the Niger Delta Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Niger Delta Region is the largest river delta in Africa and features the fifth largest mangrove forest on Earth. It provides numerous ecosystem services to the local populations and holds a wealth of biodiversity. However, due to the oil and gas reserves and the explosion of human population it is under threat from overexploitation and degradation. There is a pressing need for an accurate assessment of the land cover dynamics in the region. The limited previous efforts have produced controversial results, as the area of western Africa is notorious for the gaps in the Landsat archive and the lack of cloud-free data. Even fewer studies have attempted to map the extent of the degraded mangrove forest system, reporting low accuracies. Here, we map the eight main land cover classes over the NDR using spectral-temporal metrics from all available Landsat data centred around three epochs. We also test the performance of the classification when L-band radar data are added to the Landsat-based metrics. To further our understanding of the land cover change dynamics, we carry out two additional assessments: a change intensity analysis for the entire NDR and, focusing specifically on the mangrove forest, we analyse the fragmentation of both the healthy and the degraded mangrove land cover classes. We achieve high overall classification accuracies in all epochs (similar to 79% for 1988, and 82% for 2000 and 2013) and are able to map the degraded mangroves accurately, for the first time, with user's accuracies between 77% and 87% and producer's accuracies consistently above 82%. Our results show that mangrove forests, lowland rainforests, and freshwater forests are reporting net and highly intense losses (mangrove net loss: similar to 500 km(2); woodland net loss: similar to 1400 km(2)), while built-up areas have almost doubled in size (from 1990 km(2) in 1988 to 3730 km(2) in 2013). The mangrove forests are also consistently more fragmented, with the opposite effect being observed for the degraded mangroves in more recent years. Our study provides a valuable assessment of land cover dynamics in the NDR and the first ever accurate estimates of the extent of the degraded mangrove forest and its fragmentation.

TI  - RUESVMs: An Ensemble Method to Handle the Class Imbalance Problem in Land Cover Mapping Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate Land Cover (LC) information is required for various applications, such as climate change analysis and sustainable development. Although machine learning algorithms are most likely successful in LC mapping tasks, the class imbalance problem is known as a common challenge in this regard. This problem occurs during the training phase and reduces classification accuracy for infrequent and rare LC classes. To address this issue, this study proposes a new method by integrating random under-sampling of majority classes and an ensemble of Support Vector Machines, namely Random Under-sampling Ensemble of Support Vector Machines (RUESVMs). The performance of RUESVMs for LC classification was evaluated in Google Earth Engine (GEE) over two different case studies using Sentinel-2 time-series data and five well-known spectral indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The performance of RUESVMs was also compared with the traditional SVM and combination of SVM with three benchmark data balancing techniques namely the Random Over-Sampling (ROS), Random Under-Sampling (RUS), and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). It was observed that the proposed method considerably improved the accuracy of LC classification, especially for the minority classes. After adopting RUESVMs, the overall accuracy of the generated LC map increased by approximately 4.95 percentage points, and this amount for the geometric mean of producer's accuracies was almost 3.75 percentage points, in comparison to the most accurate data balancing method (i.e., SVM-SMOTE). Regarding the geometric mean of users' accuracies, RUESVMs also outperformed the SVM-SMOTE method with an average increase of 6.45 percentage points.

TI  - Spatial modeling of soil water erosion associated with agroclimatic seasonality in the southern region of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
T2  - ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Water erosion is a serious soil degradation problem, with impact in several areas. Its measurement is extremely important and costly. Empirical models of soil loss estimation, such as the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), are used to meet this demand. Few studies in Brazil are considered to evaluate the effect on agroclimatic seasonality in the estimates of soil loss due to water erosion in watersheds. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the agroclimatic seasonality in the estimation of soil losses through RUSLE and to identify the factors that control erosion in the watershed of the Fragata stream. Rainfall erosivity (R) was calculated by means of precipitation data for four seasons and annual average. The soil erodibility factor (K) was obtained from soil information. The topographic factor (LS) was generated from the Digital Elevation Model (MDE) and the soil cover factor and conservationist practices (CP) through Landsat8/OLI satellite images. Seasonal variation had an effect on soil loss, with higher erosion rates in the summer and spring months. Soil losses between 5 and 50 Mg ha(-1)ano(-1) were recorded in 24% of the BHAF, associated with periods of more erosive rainfall, higher slope and low vegetation cover. RUSLE factors with the greatest contribution to erosion were R, LS, and CP. The approach presented can be useful in quantifying soil losses in river basins.

TI  - Urban land use effect analysis on the level of noise pollution using satellite and GIS technologies: A case study in Tehran city
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We utilized satellite and GIS technologies to address the relationship between urban land uses and Noise Pollution (NP) in one of the most crowded regions of Tehran city. L-eq was determined in 170 stations of the studied area and an acoustic map was created. Moreover, using satellite remote sensing data and a land use map, the density map for nine types of the most important urban land use was provided and the relationship between different land use densities and NP was investigated. We found that the investigated region was highly polluted and the NP level was higher in the morning (76.29 +/- 5.61 dB[A]) and afternoon (76.46 +/- 4.88 dB[A]) in comparison to the noon period. Furthermore, the prepared acoustic map revealed that in the east and southwest of the studied area, the NP was highest and lowest, respectively. Also, cultural (73.48 +/- 4.7 dB[A]) and parking (79.02 +/- 4.3 dB[A]) areas had the lowest and highest levels of L-eq. Also, the high density of road, commercial, industrial, mixed commercial and residential and parking land uses had a direct significant relationship with L-eq and this relation was inverse for green space. It was concluded that land use variations significantly affect the NP levels and it can be utilized to predict and manage the NP in different cities.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Land Surface Temperature and Vertical City Associated with Dengue Incidences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population and urban growth in Bangkok increases the need for vertical city development because of the limited territory. This might lead to increasing land surface temperatures (LST), which makes some urban areas significantly warmer and leads to hot spots known as urban heat islands. It is known that climatic factors, such as rainfall and temperature, influence increases in dengue incidences. Thus, this research uses spatial statistical analysis to consider the association of urban LST with dengue incidences. The LST calculation methods are based on LANDSAT imageries in 2009 and 2014. Pearson correlation and Bayesian hierarchical modeling were used for predicting dengue incidences. This study found the highest correlation between the density of high-rise buildings, which had a significant influence on LST, and dengue incidences. Both the number of high-rise buildings and the surface temperature of low-rise buildings increased dengue incidence between 2009 and 2014. Overall, it was found that for every increase of 1000 high-rise buildings, the dengue incidence increased 2.19 on average during that period.

TI  - Dynamics and forcing mechanisms of upwelling along the south eastern Arabian sea during south west monsoon
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was carried out to understand the upwelling and its forcing mechanisms along South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) during the southwest monsoon. Ship observations onboard FORV Sagar Sampada during summer monsoon (August 2017) and satellite data during the period were used to delineate these mechanisms. Here, sea level anomaly (SLA), Ekman transport, Ekman pumping velocity and Brunt-Vaisala frequency are considered as indices as well as proxies for upwelling. Also, the zonal and meridional variations of hydrographic parameters along the SEAS during summer monsoon are studied in detail using in situ observations. Coastal variations showed maximum upwelling intensity off Cape whereas offshore variation showed maximum intensity off Kochi leading to maximum offshore Ekman transport. These variations are investigated by studying the differences in D26, D24 isotherms and local temperature anomaly. The alongshore component of wind is observed to be strong from southern transects extending from Trivandrum to Mangalore where the upwelling signals are dominant. Intense upwelling off Cape is observed to be due to cross-shore component of wind. Ekman transport due to cross-shore component of wind during the period is observed to be maximum at 6-8 degrees N and decreases towards north but eventually increases on reaching to Goa. Ekman transport due to alongshore component of wind and pumping velocity are maximum at 8-10 degrees N when compared to southern region (6-8 degrees N) and also reduces further north (10-15.2 degrees N). The offshore Ekman transport, pumping velocity, sea level anomaly and mixing of watermasses play a major role in the variation of upwelling intensities in the SEAS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Immediate disturbances induced by tropical cyclone Fani on the coastal forest landscape of eastern India: A geospatial analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An extremely severe tropical cyclone Fani made its landfall on 3rd May, 2019 along the coastal region of Odisha, India causing profound damage to its natural and human resources. This study examines the immediate effects of the cyclone on vegetation dynamics and patterns of canopy gap formation in Balukhand Wildlife Sanctuary of this region. Sentinel 2A data of pre and post-Fani scenarios were used to derive Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and relevant landscape metrics of patch and class levels for this forest from coast (zone A) to inland (zone C). Results showed that even the maximum NDVI values of the post-cyclone scenario were either less than or equal to the mean NDVI values of the pre-cyclone scenario for most of the grids of three zones. Among the twenty three grids, severe damage was identified in seven grids mostly covering western parts of the forest owing to high levels of exploitative human interventions. Species like Casuarina equisetifolia and Eucalyptus globulus had suffered the most. The individual as well as combined interactions of land cover and cyclone scenario were found to have significantly strong effects on patch metric values (p < 0.01) in three-way analysis of variance. Regarding canopy gaps, zone A was characterized by clusters of few large patches (> 1 ha area; > 400 m perimeter) and multiple tiny patches but canopies of zone B and C were primarily perforated through multitudes of tiny, irregular cum amorphous gaps. Zone-wise ecological restoration was recommended to mitigate the statistically significant losses of vegetated patches (p < 0.001) due to the cyclone and accordingly relevant species were suggested for site-specific plantation.

TI  - Geochronological constraints on Neoproterozoic rifting and onset of the Marinoan glaciation from the Kingston Peak Formation in Death Valley, California (USA)
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Death Valley (California, USA) hosts iconic Cryogenian snowball Earth deposits, but the lack of direct geochronological constraints has permitted a variety of correlations and age models. Here, we report two precise zircon U-Pb isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry dates for the Kingston Peak Formation: a volcanic eruptive age of 705.44 +/- 0.28 Ma from the synglacial Limekiln Spring Member, and a maximum depositional age of 651.69 +/- 0.64 Ma from the nonglacial Thorndike submember, which is below the Wildrose diamictite. These dates confirm that the Limekiln Spring and Surprise Members were deposited during the Sturtian glaciation, while the Wildrose submember is a Marinoan glacial deposit, and the overlying Sentinel Peak Member of the Noonday Formation is a Marinoan cap carbonate. Additionally, the age from the Thorndike submember supersedes existing radioisotopic ages from the Datangpo Formation in South China as the youngest constraint on the onset of the Marinoan glaciation, demonstrating that the Cryogenian nonglacial interlude lasted for at least 9 m.y. and the Marinoan glaciation was <17 m.y. long. Cryogenian glaciation in western Laurentia occurred against the backdrop of similar to 85 m.y. of episodic rift-related subsidence and magmatism within laterally discontinuous, fault-bound basins.

TI  - The importance of multidisciplinary care for spine metastases: initial tumor management
T2  - NEURO-ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spine metastases are very common in cancer patients often requiring urgent assessment and the initiation of therapy.Treatment paradigms have changed exponentially over the past decade with the evolution and integration of stereotactic body radiotherapy, minimally invasive spine techniques, and systemic options including biologics and checkpoint inhibitors.These advances necessitate multidisciplinary assessments and interventions to optimize outcomes. The NOMS framework provides a mechanism for all practitioners to evaluate the 4 sentinel assessments required to make decisions in patients with spine metastases: Neurologic, Oncologic, Mechanical Stability, and Systemic disease. The NOMS framework is continuously updated with the integration of newer technologies and evidence-based medicine as they become available. This paper presents the current iteration of NOMS with a focus on the role of medical and neuro-oncologists in the assessment and treatment of metastatic spine tumors.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation with Small UAVs in Precision Agriculture
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Estimating evapotranspiration (ET) has been one of the most critical research areas in agriculture because of water scarcity, the growing population, and climate change. The accurate estimation and mapping of ET are necessary for crop water management. Traditionally, researchers use water balance, soil moisture, weighing lysimeters, or an energy balance approach, such as Bowen ratio or eddy covariance towers to estimate ET. However, these ET methods are point-specific or area-weighted measurements and cannot be extended to a large scale. With the advent of satellite technology, remote sensing images became able to provide spatially distributed measurements. However, the spatial resolution of multispectral satellite images is in the range of meters, tens of meters, or hundreds of meters, which is often not enough for crops with clumped canopy structures, such as trees and vines. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can mitigate these spatial and temporal limitations. Lightweight cameras and sensors can be mounted on the UAVs and take high-resolution images. Unlike satellite imagery, the spatial resolution of the UAV images can be at the centimeter-level. UAVs can also fly on-demand, which provides high temporal imagery. In this study, the authors examined different UAV-based approaches of ET estimation at first. Models and algorithms, such as mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC), the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model, and machine learning (ML) are analyzed and discussed herein. Second, challenges and opportunities for UAVs in ET estimation are also discussed, such as uncooled thermal camera calibration, UAV image collection, and image processing. Then, the authors share views on ET estimation with UAVs for future research and draw conclusive remarks.

TI  - An Improved Approach for Downscaling Coarse-Resolution Thermal Data by Minimizing the Spatial Averaging Biases in Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a fundamental role in various geophysical processes at varying spatial and temporal scales. Satellite-based observations of LST provide a viable option for monitoring the spatial-temporal evolution of these processes. Downscaling is a widely adopted approach for solving the spatial-temporal trade-off associated with satellite-based observations of LST. However, despite the advances made in the field of LST downscaling, issues related to spatial averaging in the downscaling methodologies greatly hamper the utility of coarse-resolution thermal data for downscaling applications in complex environments. In this study, an improved LST downscaling approach based on random forest (RF) regression is presented. The proposed approach addresses issues related to spatial averaging biases associated with the downscaling model developed at the coarse resolution. The approach was applied to downscale the coarse-resolution Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF) LST product derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor aboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) weather satellite. The LSA-SAF product was downscaled to a spatial resolution of similar to 30 m, based on predictor variables derived from Sentinel 2, and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) digital elevation model (DEM). Quantitatively and qualitatively, better downscaling results were obtained using the proposed approach in comparison to the conventional approach of downscaling LST using RF widely adopted in LST downscaling studies. The enhanced performance indicates that the proposed approach has the ability to reduce the spatial averaging biases inherent in the LST downscaling methodology and thus is more suitable for downscaling applications in complex environments.

T2  - ACTUALIDAD JURIDICA AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic growth, industrial development and modern technologies have brought a new degree of comfort and well-being. However, it was achieved at the expense of the depletion of natural resources and the widespread loss of ecosystems. In this context, certain lines of thought were formulated that, in contrast to the current ones, promote the recognition of rights to nature and to all living beings.From these perspectives, in the legal world, an intense debate began about legal subjectivity and whether it is legally viable that Nature and each of its components can be considered as a subject of law.Thus, by way of doctrine and jurisprudence, a path of confluence between environmental law and the rights of Nature began, which is transforming classical environmental law, lightening the anthropocentric vision that characterizes it, integrating it with a biocentric worldview and expanding its protection to all those species with which the human being shares the planet.The purpose of this article is the theoretical, doctrinal and jurisprudential development of an alternative position that advocates the greening of environmental law, the dialogue between Ecology and Law and the integration of ecological and environmental justice to achieve effective protection of nature.

TI  - Solar and sensor geometry, not vegetation response, drive satellite NDVI phenology in widespread ecosystems of the western United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived phenology metrics are valuable tools for understanding broad-scale patterns and changes in vegetated landscapes over time. However, the extraction and interpretation of phenology in ecosystems with subtle growth dynamics can be challenging. US National Park Service monitoring of evergreen pinyon-juniper ecosystems in the western US revealed an unexpected winter-peaking phenological pattern in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. In this paper, we assess the validity of the winter peaks through ground-based observation of phenology and examination of solar and satellite geometry effects. To test the premise of a true vegetation response, we analyzed NDVI values extracted from a time series of ground-based digital camera ('phenocam') images collected September 2017 to December 2018 in a pinyon-juniper woodland in Arizona, US. Results show pinyon and juniper growth peaked in the warm season, as did the other species in the phenocam field of view. NDVI time series from four other sensors (Landsat 7, Sentinel-2, VIIRS, and Proba-V) confirmed that winter peaks in this ecosystem are not limited to MODIS products. Examination of NDVI time series (2003-2018) derived from daily 250-m MODIS data in the broader pinyon-juniper ecosystem revealed that solar-to-sensor angle, sensor zenith angle, and forward/back-scatter reflectance explained > 80% of intra-annual variability. Solar-to-sensor angle exerted the greatest control, and the direction of its correlation (positive) was the opposite of that which would be expected if it were driven by vegetation greenness. Solar-to-sensor angle is controlled seasonally by solar zenith angle and daily by variations in satellite overpass geometry. We mapped winter peaks across the western US in Google Earth Engine using 500-m MODIS MCD43A4 data, which correct for reflectance differences caused by view angle. In areas where winter vegetation peaks are ecologically improbable (i.e., locations with sub-freezing December temperatures), consistent winter peaks (>= 14 years in 2003 to 2018) are widespread in both pinyon-juniper and non-pinyon-juniper conifer ecosystems; winter peaks are common (>= 5 years in 2003 to 2018) across areas of shrubland. We attribute winter peaks to the positive correlation of NDVI with solar-to-sensor angle and solar zenith angle in combination with sparse, vertically oriented evergreen vegetation canopies. Increasing shadow visibility has been shown to increase overall NDVI, and the prevalence of the winter peaking in evergreen western sparse canopy ecosystems is consistent with this hypothesis. The extent of winter peaking patterns may have been previously overlooked due to temporal compositing, curve fitting, and incomplete snow screening.

AB  - Although the characteristics of biomass burning events and the ambient ecosystem determine emitted smoke composition, the conditions that modulate the partitioning of black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) formation are not well understood, nor are the spatial or temporal frequency of factors driving smoke particle evolution, such as hydration, coagulation, and oxidation, all of which impact smoke radiative forcing. In situ data from surface observation sites and aircraft field campaigns offer deep insight into the optical, chemical, and microphysical traits of biomass burning (BB) smoke aerosols, such as single scattering albedo (SSA) and size distribution, but cannot by themselves provide robust statistical characterization of both emitted and evolved particles. Data from the NASA Earth Observing System's Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument can provide at least a partial picture of BB particle properties and their evolution downwind, once properly validated. Here we use in situ data from the joint NOAA/NASA 2019 Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments Experiment-Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign to assess the strengths and limitations of MISR-derived constraints on particle size, shape, light-absorption, and its spectral slope, as well as plume height and associated wind vectors. Based on the satellite observations, we also offer inferences about aging mechanisms effecting downwind particle evolution, such as gravitational settling, oxidation, secondary particle formation, and the combination of particle aggregation and condensational growth. This work builds upon our previous study, adding confidence to our interpretation of the remote-sensing data based on an expanded suite of in situ measurements for validation. The satellite and in situ measurements offer similar characterizations of particle property evolution as a function of smoke age for the 06 August Williams Flats Fire, and most of the key differences in particle size and absorption can be attributed to differences in sampling and changes in the plume geometry between sampling times. Whereas the aircraft data provide validation for the MISR retrievals, the satellite data offer a spatially continuous mapping of particle properties over the plume, which helps identify trends in particle property downwind evolution that are ambiguous in the sparsely sampled aircraft transects. The MISR data record is more than two decades long, offering future opportunities to study regional wildfire plume behavior statistically, where aircraft data are limited or entirely lacking.

TI  - Dynamics of land cover, land surface temperature and NDVI in Uyo City, Nigeria
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Uyo City in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and development over the past decades. The urban expansion has led to different land cover transitions which in turn have caused significant changes in key environmental parameters such as Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This study investigated land cover changes in Uyo and the relationship with LST and NDVI. Landsat multispectral imageries covering the study area were acquired for three periods - 1986, 2000 and 2018. Land cover was extracted using the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) technique, LST was derived using a single channel algorithm applied on the imagery thermal bands, and the NDVI equation was applied to the imageries. To assess the MLC accuracy, four different accuracy metrics were calculated - user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient. Change statistics were computed to evaluate the transition dynamics of each land cover class. Finally, the relationship between land cover, LST and NDVI was evaluated using the Contribution Index (CI) and Pearson's Correlation analysis. Between 1986 and 2018, vegetation declined from 278 km 2 to 219 km(2), wetlands declined from 20 km(2) to 17 km(2), barren land declined from 33km(2) to 25km(2) while built-up areas increased from 69 km(2) to 139 km(2). There were significant transitions in land cover for instance, 78km(2) of vegetation and 14km(2) of barren land were converted to built-up area over the 32 years. The mean LSTs in the city were 21.67 degrees C (1986), 25.40 degrees C (2000) and 26.04 degrees C (2018). The highest contribution to LST was from built-up areas while the lowest was from vegetation. The CI of built-up areas rose from 0.08 in 1986 to 0.30 in 2018, Similarly, LST profiles showed that the diffusion of higher LSTs across the study area was in tandem with the horizontal expansion of built-up areas. There was also a high negative correlation between LST and NDVI at the three periods of study. It is recommended that the Uyo local authorities take deliberate measures and policies aimed at moderating urban growth while ensuring the conservation of urban greens spaces in the city.

TI  - Seasonal climatology and relationship between AOD and cloud properties inferred from the MODIS over Malawi, Southeast Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The studies related to aerosol and cloud properties are rare over the South Eastern African continent despite their significant influence on the regional climate. The present work is aimed at analyzing the spatiotemporal correlations between aerosol and cloud properties during 2008-2017 derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Republic of Malawi, Southeast Africa. The annual mean aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD(550)) was found high ( > 0.23) around the Lake Malawi and its environments, and in the southern parts of the study domain, characterized by dense population and increased anthropogenic activities. Whereas, low AOD centers were noticed over the high-altitude locations of central Malawi. The seasonal mean AOD(550) was found high during September-October-November (SON) (0.32) and June-July-August (JJA) (0.24) December-January-February (DJF) (0.2), and lowest in March-April-May (MAM) (0.16). The Angstrom exponent (AE(412)(-4)(70)) sensitive to fine-mode particles was found high ( > 1.2) in most of the regions during the study period. The trend analysis from the linear regression technique found a general increase in AOD, except during SON was characterized by decreasing AOD. Besides, we investigated on understanding the relationship between AOD and cloud microphysical properties over the domain. The AOD(550) exhibited a negative correlation with cloud fraction (CF) and the cloud effective radius (CER). However, it showed a positive correlation with cloud top temperature (CTT) in areas of high AOD. Finally, the results from the backward trajectory analysis revealed that aerosols over Malawi were associated with long-range transport from the Arabian Deserts, Madagascar Island, Central Africa, and the Indian Ocean, along with locally produced aerosols during different seasons. The findings may be useful to better understand the sources and climatic effects of atmospheric aerosols in southeast Africa.

TI  - An updated assessment of Ireland's wave energy resource using satellite data assimilation and a revised wave period ratio
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although wave energy harnessing is still at the pre-commercial stage, accurate and up-to-date resource assessments are necessary to the development of a wave energy industry. Radar altimeters aboard spaceborne platforms provide extensive spatial coverage of wave height estimations but cannot compensate for the scarcity of in-situ measurements associated with their poor temporal resolution. Ireland's wave energy resource is assessed here using a numerical model developed by Meteo-France assimilating wave height data measured from satellite altimeters. The accuracy of the model is first assessed against in-situ wave buoy measurements and compared with other models that do not assimilate remotely sensed data. The use of satellite data assimilation appears to reduce the significant wave height error by 6 cm on average. A bespoke wave period ratio between the energy period and the up-cross period based on the experimental work of Cahill and Lewis (2014) is then used to compute the wave power around Ireland. The new map is compared with assessments which used other data and methodologies and is found to exhibit previously unidentified patterns as well as a substantial average wave power increase of approximately 20% in most areas and up to 30% in a region off the northwest coast.

TI  - Threshold- and trend-based vegetation change monitoring algorithm based on the inter-annual multi-temporal normalized difference moisture index series: A case study of the Tatra Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous algorithms are used in remote sensing to detect changes in vegetation. Majority of them require several tunable parameters or can only detect abrupt forest disturbances. The aim of this study was to develop a new thresholdand trend-based vegetation change monitoring algorithm (TVCMA) that can detect abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation within forested and non-forested areas. To test the algorithm, the Polish and Slovak Tatra Mountains were used as the study area. Strong winds and bark beetle outbreaks (BBOs) are the primary causes of vegetation disturbances in this region. An annual time series of vegetation indices from 1984 to 2016 was used as the input. The long time span necessitated the use of scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fifty-one images were atmospherically and topographically corrected. The collected in situ data included the chlorophyll content, leaf area index, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and spectral signatures of non-forest vegetation, dwarf pine, and forest stands in 190 sample plots. To select the vegetation indices (VIs) most suitable for disturbance detection, ten satellite-based VIs were correlated with the acquired field data. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) was found to be more sensitive to vegetation disturbances and more resistant to data noise than any other tested index. The TVCMA uses two separate approaches, namely, thresholding, which indicates where and when the disturbances occurred, and a regression analysis, which presents the general trend in the time series for each pixel. The number of detected disturbances, the Spearman's correlation coefficient between the modeled trend line and satellite observations, and p-values were calculated. Different threshold values were tested to identify the value that yielded the most accurate results. By using 200 randomly selected validation points, we achieved an 83.3% producer's accuracy for disturbances (PAD), 46.3% user's accuracy for disturbances (UAD), and 97.8% overall accuracy (OA). These results confirm the potential of TVCMA for monitoring abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation. Moreover, the simplicity and data-driven character of the proposed algorithm make it suitable for multi-temporal analyses of other types of satellite data.

TI  - Chronologic trends of cancer-related lymph node research in PubMed: informetrics analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Given the tong history of investigation into cancer and its relevance to the lymph node (LN), it would be meaningful to plot the trends of research on cancer-related LN.Methods: Queries such as "cancer," "lymph node," and "cancer and lymph node" were submitted to PubMed to collect articles on cancer and LN published between 1945 and 2017. The collected articles were then extracted by an automatic web crawler and examined through informetrics and linguistic analysis.Results: The number of articles related to cancer was 2,795,476 and 127,897 articles (4.6%) were found to be relevant to LN. With regard to cancer types, breast cancer was the most studied (37%), followed by gastric cancer (17%). With regard to the subjects in which the surgeon is interested, LN metastasis (57%) was found to be the topic most discussed, followed by LN dissection (22%) and sentinel LN (17%). Publications on LN metastasis gradually increased over time from 1988 to 2017 although those on sentinel LN and LN dissection have stagnated since the early 2000s.Conclusion: Although research on cancer was abundant, only a small portion was dedicated to investigating its relevance to LN. Western countries had led the research on cancer-related LN, but Asian countries began to participate as major players, expanding their contributions. While LN metastasis, one of the major cancer-related LN topics, showed a steady increase, those involved in oncologic surgery such as LN dissection and sentinel LN did not.

TI  - Flood Detection in Built-Up Areas Using Interferometric Phase Statistics of PALSAR-2 Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated a method of flood detection in built-up areas by L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, using interferometric phase statistics instead of the widely used coherence. Simulation and actual SAR data analysis showed that phase statistics are more accurate than coherence is, especially when there are many point-like scatterers. Accuracy was further improved by using an interferometric phase filter. The flood detection accuracies obtained by the phase statistics were k = 0.535 (0.304 by coherence) in the 2015 flood in Joso and k = 0.679 (0.609 by coherence) in the 2018 flood in Mabi. These results showed that coherence should be used with great care with point targets and that the phase-only statistics can be more robust in such cases. The proposed method is expected to apply to other types of disasters where coherence has been used previously.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Environmental Atmospheric Risk Factors in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the vast evidence on the environmental influence in neurodegenerative diseases, those considering a geospatial approach are scarce. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies concerning environmental atmospheric risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases that have used geospatial analysis/tools. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for all scientific studies that included a neurodegenerative disease, an environmental atmospheric factor, and a geographical analysis. Of the 34 included papers, approximately 60% were related to multiple sclerosis (MS), hence being the most studied neurodegenerative disease in the context of this study. Sun exposure (n = 13) followed by the most common exhaustion gases (n = 10 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and n = 5 for carbon monoxide (CO)) were the most studied atmospheric factors. Only one study used a geospatial interpolation model, although 13 studies used remote sensing data to compute atmospheric factors. In 20% of papers, we found an inverse correlation between sun exposure and multiple sclerosis. No consensus was reached in the analysis of nitrogen dioxide and Parkinson's disease, but it was related to dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This systematic review (number CRD42020196188 in PROSPERO's database) provides an insight into the available evidence regarding the geospatial influence of environmental factors on neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Anthropocene Temporality in Gaia Games
T2  - KRONOSCOPE-JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the potential of a new generation of environmental god games, or Gaia games, to engage with the ambivalent dynamic of Anthropocene temporality, a concept modelled after Nicolas Mirzoeff's notion of Anthropocene visuality. In particular, this article highlights a trope that has become popular in god games recently: the move from map-style interfaces to the use of whole Earth images and models. This trope signals an overt and growing-although as I shall point out, imperfect-engagement with planetarity: an emerging worldview that posits the planet as a world-ecology, one that imbeds both human and nonhuman forces while calling for a renewed attendance to the ethics and aesthetics of relationality. At the same time, this article also notes the perpetuation in Gaia games of generic tropes and conventions like the tech tree and expansionist gameplay. The notion of Anthropocene temporality that this article attempts to theorize helps us to think through the juxtaposition between ecological relationality and a continued desire for expansionism and progress, as both of these play out in videogames.

TI  - DInSAR for Road Infrastructure Monitoring: Case Study Highway Network of Rome Metropolitan (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The road network of metropolitan Rome is determined by a large number of structures located in different geological environments. To maintain security and service conditions, satellite-based monitoring can play a key role, since it can cover large areas by accurately detecting ground displacements due to anthropic activities (underground excavations, interference with other infrastructures, etc.) or natural hazards, mainly connected to the critical hydrogeological events. To investigate the area, two different Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) processing methods were used in this study: the first with open source using the Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) of SNAP-StaMPS workflow for Sentinel-1 (SNT1) and the second with the SBAS technique for Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK). The results obtained can corroborate the displacement trends due to the characteristics of the soil and the geological environments. With Sentinel-1 data, we were able to obtain the general deformation overview of the overall highways network, followed by a selection and classification of the PSI content for each section. With Cosmo-SkyMed data, we were able to increase the precision in the analysis for one sample infrastructure for which high-resolution data from CSK were available. Both datasets were demonstrated to be valuable for collecting data useful to understand the safety condition of the infrastructure and to support the maintenance actions.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the increase in sentinel cases of COVID-19 in Mexico calculated from the effective number of reproductions of the infection (R-t) and compare its evolution with that reported by Italy, Spain and the United States of America during the first twenty weeks of evolution of the epidemic. Method: In an analytical cross-sectional design, the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Mexico from February 29 to July 24, 2020 was studied, and compared with sentinel cases calculated from the R-t A descriptive and comparative analysis of prevalence, cumulative incidence and case fatality was performed to summarize the epidemiological data for Mexico and in relation to information for Italy, Spain, and the United States of North America. Results: In Mexico, until July 24, 2020, there are a total of 390,516 cases of COVID-19 and 43,680 deaths from this disease; with the use of R-t to calculate the correction of cases and unidentified deaths, the figure increases to 3,780,195 cases (p = 0.0002) and 211,469 deaths (p = 0.001). This suggests underreporting in the identification of cases and deaths and is associated with one of the highest case fatality rates in the world for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: In Mexico, the sentinel model presents a significant loss of unquantified information. It is necessary to reinforce epidemiological surveillance through a better case detection strategy in our country and continue to apply measures that allow the containment and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure in squamous vulvar cancer. 10 years follow-up analysis
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure in early-stage vulvar cancer and analysis of results, recurrences and complications.Material and methods: 40 patients with vulvar cancer and SLNB between 2008 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. During the surgical procedure the inguinofemoral lymph nodes were checked with a gamma probe to identify the sentinel nodes that were removed and referred for intraoperative pathological assessment. Subsequently, long-term patient follow-up was performed with analysis of complications, relapse and mortality.Results: 40 patients (mean age: 72 years [47-86], the overall detection rate per patient was 95% and a total of 129 Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLNs) were removed (3.22 SLN/patient). In 3 out of 25 patients with lateral tumour lesions drainage was bilateral and in 2 out of 15 with midline lesions drainage was unilateral. On lymphoscintigraphy, 16 out of 40 had bilateral drainage and 24 unilateral. A total of 119 SLNand 10 SLN+ were obtained, in 8 out of 10 an inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy was performed. In the SLNgroup, one case of lymphatic blockage and one false negative were included. In 12 out of 40 patients there were post-surgical complications, 4 of them lymphoedemas. In the median follow-up (40 months), 6 out of 10 with SLN+ (40% mortality) and 7 out of 30 SLN(16% mortality) had recurrences.Conclusions: SLNB in vulvar cancer is the technique of choice for correct staging and locoregional therapy. Correct clinical lymph node staging is important before surgery in order to avoid potential blockage drainages which could induce a false negative SLN.

AB  - Absorption of colored dissolved organic matter or detrital gelbstoff (aCDOM/ADG) and light attenuation coefficient (K(d)490) parameters were studied at La Parguera Natural Reserve in southwestern Puerto Rico, before and following Hurricanes Irma (6-7 September) and Maria (20-21 September) in 2017. Water quality assessments involving Sentinel 3A ocean color products and field sample data was performed. The estimated mean of ADG in surface waters was calculated at >0.1 m(-1) with a median of 0.05 m(-1) and aCDOM443 ranged from 0.0023 to 0.1121 m(-1) in field samples (n=21) in 2017. Mean ADG443 values increased from July to August at 0.167 to 0.353 m(-1) in September-October over Turrumote reef (LP6) with a maximum value of 0.683 m(-1). Values above 0.13 m(-1) persisted at offshore waters off Guanica Bay and over coral reef areas at La Parguera for over four months. The ADG443 product presented values above the median and the second standard deviation of 0.0428 m(-1) from September to October 2017 and from water sample measurement on 19 October 2017. Mean K(d)490 values increased from 0.16 m(-1) before hurricanes to 0.28 right after Hurricane Irma. The value remained high, at 0.34 m(-1), until October 2017, a month after Hurricane Maria. Analysis of the Sentinel (S3) OLCI products showed a significant positive correlation (r(s) = 0.71, p = 0.0005) between K(d)490_M07 and ADG_443, indicating the influence of ADG on light attenuation. These significant short-term changes could have ecological impacts on benthic habitats highly dependent on light penetration, such as coral reefs, in southwestern Puerto Rico.

TI  - Geomatics and EO Data to Support Wildlife Diseases Assessment at Landscape Level: A Pilot Experience to Map Infectious Keratoconjunctivitis in Chamois and Phenological Trends in Aosta Valley (NW Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomatics and satellite remote sensing offer useful analysis tools for several technical-scientific fields. This work, with reference to a regional case of study, investigates remote sensing potentialities for describing relationships between environment and diseases affecting wildlife at landscape level in the light of climate change effects onto vegetation. Specifically, the infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra L.) in Aosta Valley (NW Italy) was investigated at the regional level. IKC (Mycoplasma conjunctivae) is a contagious disease for domestic and wild ruminants (Caprinae and Ovinae). Two types of analysis were performed: one aimed at exploring by remotely sensed data phenological metrics (PMs) and evapotranspiration (ET) trends of vegetation in the area; one investigating the correlation between PMs and ET, versus IKC prevalence. The analysis was based on TERRA MODIS image time series ranging from 2000 to 2019. Ground data about IKC were available for a shorter time range: 2009-2019. Consequently, PMs and ET trend investigations were focused on the whole times range (2000-2019); conversely, correlation analysis was achieved with reference to the reduced 2009-2019 period. The whole study was based on freely available data from public archives. MODIS products, namely MOD13Q1 v.6 and MOD16A2, were used to derive PM and ET trends, respectively. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was used to describe local topography; CORINE Land Cover map was adopted to describe land use classes. PMs and ET (as derivable from EO data) proved to significantly changed their values in the last 20 years, with a continuous progressive trend. As far as correlation analysis was concerned, ET and some PMs (specifically, End of Season (EOS) and Length of Season (LOS) proved significantly condition IKC prevalence. According to results, the proposed methodology can be retained as an effective tool for supporting public health and eco-pathological sectors. Specifically, it can be intended for a continuous monitoring of effects that climatic dynamics determine onto wild animals in the Alpine area, included diseases and zoonosis, moving future environmental management and planning towards the One Health perspective.

TI  - Analysis of Copernicus' ERA5 Climate Reanalysis Data as a Replacement for Weather Station Temperature Measurements in Machine Learning Models for Olive Phenology Phase Prediction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of phenological events and their variability can help to determine final yield, plan management approach, tackle climate change, and model crop development. THe timing of phenological stages and phases is known to be highly correlated with temperature which is therefore an essential component for building phenological models. Satellite data and, particularly, Copernicus' ERA5 climate reanalysis data are easily available. Weather stations, on the other hand, provide scattered temperature data, with fragmentary spatial coverage and accessibility, as such being scarcely efficacious as unique source of information for the implementation of predictive models. However, as ERA5 reanalysis data are not real temperature measurements but reanalysis products, it is necessary to verify whether these data can be used as a replacement for weather station temperature measurements. The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the validity of ERA5 data as a substitute for weather station temperature measurements, (ii) to test different machine learning models for the prediction of phenological phases while using different sets of features, and (iii) to optimize the base temperature of olive tree phenological model. The predictive capability of machine learning models and the performance of different feature subsets were assessed when comparing the recorded temperature data, ERA5 data, and a simple growing degree day phenological model as benchmark. Data on olive tree phenology observation, which were collected in Tuscany for three years, provided the phenological phases to be used as target variables. The results show that ERA5 climate reanalysis data can be used for modelling phenological phases and that these models provide better predictions in comparison with the models trained with weather station temperature measurements.

TI  - Early Physical Rehabilitation after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Is It Feasible and Safe?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary purpose of this research was to investigate the feasibility and safety of delivering an early supervised physical therapy intervention to women after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); furthermore, we aimed to provide explorative data on its effects. This was a single-site feasibility study. Pre- and post-evaluation was conducted from baseline to follow-up at 6 months. Primary outcomes were participant recruitment, participant retention, compliance with the intervention, and safety. Secondary outcomes were shoulder range of motion, handgrip strength, upper limb pain and disability, scar recovery, quality of life, and the incidence of axillary web syndrome (AWS) and/or lymphoedema. A total of 43 participants (mean age 55.37 years) completed the trial and the follow-up period. A total of 91% of women who met the inclusion criteria agreed to participate, and the adherence rate was 80%. No adverse events were reported. Incidence of AWS was 9.3%, and there was no incidence of lymphoedema at 6 months. Our results support that this intervention is feasible and safe. The results presented in this study also provide preliminary evidence for the use of a rehabilitation program as a supportive intervention after SLNB, but future research on effectiveness is needed.

TI  - Application of DInSAR and Spatial Statistics Methods in Analysis of Surface Displacements Caused by Induced Tremors
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Induced seismicity is one of the negative phenomena caused by anthropogenic activities that include mining of minerals. This phenomenon manifests itself as sudden and unpredictable shocks of rock mass, which can cause surface deformation and damage to ground infrastructure. Until the advent of satellite radar interferometry that enables analysis of historical events, the characteristics of these unexpected surface deformations were difficult to assess. The main aim of the research was the spatial analysis of the geometry of surface displacements caused by eight induced tremors in the Rudna copper mine (SW Poland) and the dependence of deformation characteristics (vertical displacements, extent) on the induced shock energy. For this purpose, Sentinel-1 satellite imagery, the differential radar satellite interferometry (DInSAR) method and geographic information systems (GIS) based spatial statistics were used. Vertical displacements were mapped on the basis of 37 calculated interferograms. Spatial statistics on the pixel-to-pixel level were performed in the GIS Map Algebra environment. In the result, descriptive and spatial statistics characterizing deformations caused by individual shocks were calculated. The average values of vertical displacements ranged from -44 to -119 mm. Strong, statistical correlation between the extent, maximum vertical displacement, and energy values was determined. In addition, geometries of the formed deformation areas were analyzed and presented graphically. The results obtained in this research constitute development of a knowledge base on surface displacements caused by induced tremors in underground copper mining.

TI  - Spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility using hybrid support vector regression (SVR) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with various metaheuristic algorithms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are natural and sometimes quasi-natural hazards that are destructive to natural resources and cause loss of human life every year. Hence, preparing susceptibility maps for landslide monitoring is essential to minimizing their negative effects. The main aim of the current research was to develop landslide susceptibility maps for Icheon Township, South Korea, using hybrid Machin learning and metaheuristic algorithms, that is, the bee algorithm (Bee), the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and to compare their predictive accuracy. Based on identified landslide locations, an inventory map was prepared and divided into training and validation data sets (70%/30%). the predicated model outcomes were validated with root mean square error (RMSE), and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and pairwise comparison values for the ANFIS, ANFIS-Bee, ANFIS-GWO, SVR, SVR-Bee, and SVR-GWO models were obtained. The area under the curve was obtained with the training and validation data sets. Based on the training data sets, AUC of 80%, 83%, 83%, 69%, 81%, and 80% were obtained for the SVR, SVR-GWO, SVR-Bee, ANFIS, ANFIS-GWO, and ANFIS-Bee models, respectively. For the validation data sets, values of 79%, 82%, 82%, 68%, 79%, and 79%, respectively, were obtained. The SVR-GWO and SVR-Bee models were the most predictive models in terms of constructing the exceptionally focused landslide susceptibility map, with little spatial variation in the highly susceptible classes. Furthermore, the MSE, RMSE, and pairwise comparisons indicated that the SVR-GWO and SVR-Bee models were superior models for this study township. In addition, ANFIS individually was not superior to the ensembles of ANFIS-GWO and ANFIS-Bee for landslide assessment. These landslide susceptibility maps provide a platform for land use planning with an eye toward sustainable development of infrastructure and damage reduction for Icheon Township.

TI  - Within-Field Relationships between Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indices, Grain Yield and Spike Number of Winter Wheat and Triticale
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study were to: (i) evaluate the relationships between vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery and grain yield (GY) and the number of spikes per square meter (SN) of winter wheat and triticale; (ii) determine the dates and plant growth stages when the above relationships were the strongest at individual field scale, thus allowing for accurate yield prediction. Observations of GY and SN were performed at harvest on six fields (three locations in two seasons: 2017 and 2018) in three regions of Poland, i.e., northeastern (A-Bro(z) over dotowka), central (B-Zdziechow) and southeastern Poland (C-Krylow). Vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), modified SAVI (mSAVI), modified SAVI 2 (mSAVI2), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI)) calculated for sampling points from mid-March until mid-July, covering within-field soil and topographical variability, were included in the analysis. Depending on the location, the highest correlation coefficients (of about 0.6-0.9) for most of VIs with GY and SN were obtained about 4-6 weeks before harvest (from the beginning of shooting to milk maturity). Therefore, satellite-derived VIs are useful for the prediction of within-field cereal GY as well as SN variability. Information on GY, predicted together with the results for soil nutrient availability, is the basis for the formulation of variable fertilize rates in precision agriculture. All examined VIs were similarly correlated with GY and SN via the commonly used NDVI. The increase in NDVI by 0.1 unit was related to an average increase in GY by about 2 t ha(-1).

TI  - Purely triplet seesaw and leptogenesis within cosmological bound, dark matter, and vacuum stability
T2  - NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
M3  - Article
AB  - In a novel standard model extension it has been suggested that, even in the absence of right-handed neutrinos and type-I seesaw, purely triplet leptogenesis leading to baryon asymmetry of the universe can be realized by two heavy Higgs triplets which also provide type-II seesaw ansatz for neutrino masses. In this work we discuss this model predictions for hierarchical neutrino masses in concordance with recently determined cosmological bounds and oscillation data including theta(23) in the second octant and large Dirac CP phases. We find that for both normal and inverted orderings, the model fits the oscillation data with the sum of the three neutrino masses consistent with current cosmological bounds determined from Planck satellite data. In addition, using this model ansatz for CP-asymmetry and solutions of Boltzmann equations, we also show how successful predictions of baryon asymmetry emerges in the cases of both unflavoured and two-flavoured leptogeneses. With additional Z(2) discrete symmetry, a minimal extension of this model is further shown to predict a scalar singlet WIMP dark matter in agreement with direct and indirect observations which also resolves the issue of vacuum instability persisting in the original model. Although the combined constraints due to relic density and direct detection cross section allow this scalar singlet dark matter mass to be m xi = 750 GeV, the additional vacuum stability constraint pushes this limiting value to m xi = 1.3 TeV which is verifiable by ongoing experiments. We also discuss constraint on the model parameters for the radiative stability of the standard Higgs mass. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Inferring floodplain bathymetry using inundation frequency
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new method to retrieve the bathymetry of turbid-water floodplains from the inundation frequency (IF) data derived from over 32 years of composite optical remote sensing data. The new method was tested and validated over the Curuai floodplain in the lower Amazon River, where the entire bathymetry was surveyed in 2004, and water level gauge data has been available since 1960. The depth was estimated based on the relationship derived from IF and surveyed depth data, and the results were compared to those retrieved from bare-Earth DEM. We further assessed the sensitivity of the approach by analyzing the deepest part of the lake (i.e., permanent water body similar to 8m) with high IF, as well as the effect of gradual sedimentation in the lake over time. The results showed that the model is highly accurate and sensitive to IF changes even in the permanent water body areas, suggesting that this model can be used in other seasonal lakes worldwide with turbid-waters, where large-scale bathymetry surveys are not feasible due to high operation costs.

TI  - Current practice patterns in nodal evaluation and adjuvant treatment of advanced stage endometrioid endometrial cancer: An SGO survey
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping over full lymphadenectomy for endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC) has had varying uptake. Adjuvant therapy for advanced stage EC is also a debated topic globally. Two recent randomized controlled trials have attempted to clarify which treatment approach should be recommended. Our aims were to identify common practice patterns in the intraoperative lymph node evaluation as well as the practice patterns in the treatment of advanced stage (stage III-IV) endometrioid EC among gynecologic oncologists.A 16-question survey was distributed via email to all Society of Gynecologic Oncology members. Study data were collected anonymously and managed using REDCap electronic data tools. Respondents were asked questions regarding demographics, assessing nodal status, and choice of adjuvant treatment for each stage. Descriptive statistics, student's t-tests, and chi-squared analyses were performed.A total of 1531 surveys were distributed and 187 (12%) members responded. The majority (70%) of respondents identified nodal metastases by performing SLN mapping prior to nodal evaluation in grade 1-2 disease, however only half perform SLN mapping in grade 3 EC. Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended by 90% of practitioners for advanced EC. However, external beam radiation or brachytherapy was combined with chemotherapy in 74% of stage III EC and 35% of stage IV EC.While 90% of practitioners recommend chemotherapy-based adjuvant treatment for women with stage IIIA-IVA endometrioid EC, decreasing local recurrence appears to be a factor in treatment planning as radiation combined with chemotherapy is used in 63% of cases.

TI  - Viral surveillance and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article traces the diffusion of the 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemic against the backdrop of scientific and global health developments, a global wave of social protests, and Cold War tensions between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Although the outbreak was far less severe than the 1918-19 'Spanish' influenza pandemic, the ease with which influenza spread globally between 1968 and 1970 contributed to a reformulation of global health that emphasized the need for enhanced preparedness and rapid vaccine production. From the 1950s through the 1960s, the scope of disease surveillance expanded, with China increasingly identified as the global epicentre of viral threats. In so arguing, the article challenges histories of global health that suggest that this was a period when concerns for infectious disease receded, in contrast to the final two decades of the twentieth century that saw the ascendancy of an 'emerging diseases worldview'.

TI  - Prediction of crop coefficients from fraction of ground cover and height. Background and validation using ground and remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The current study aims at reviewing and providing advances on methods for estimating and applying crop coefficients from observations of ground cover and vegetation height. The review first focuses on the relationships between single K-c and basal K-cb and various parameters including the fraction of ground covered by the canopy (f(c)), the leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy (f(shad)), the fraction of intercepted light (f(light)) and intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (f(IPAR)). These relationships were first studied in the 1970's, for annual crops, and later, in the last decennia, for tree and vine perennials. Research has now provided a variety of methods to observe and measure f(c) and height (h) using both ground and remote sensing tools, which has favored the further development of K-c related functions. In the past, these relationships were not used predictively but to support the understanding of dynamics of K-c and K-cb in relation to the processes of evapotranspiration or transpiration, inclusive of the role of soil evaporation. Later, the approach proposed by Allen and Pereira (2009), the A&P approach, used f(c) and height (h) or LAI data to define a crop density coefficient that was used to directly estimate K-c and K-cb values for a variety of annual and perennial crops in both research and practice. It is opportune to review the A&P method in the context of a variety of studies that have derived K-c and K-cb values from field measured data with simultaneously observed ground cover f(c) and height. Applications used to test the approach include various tree and vine crops (olive, pear, and lemon orchards and vineyards), vegetable crops (pea, onion and tomato crops), field crops (barley, wheat, maize, sunflower, canola, cotton and soybean crops), as well as a grassland and a Bermudagrass pasture. Comparisons of K-cb values computed with the A &P method produced regression coefficients close to 1.0 and coefficients of determination >= 0.90, except for orchards. Results indicate that the A&P approach can produce estimates of potential K-cb, using vegetation characteristics alone, within reasonable or acceptable error, and are useful for refining K-cb for conditions of plant spacing, size and density that differ from standard values. The comparisons provide parameters appropriate to applications for the tested crops. In addition, the A&P approach was applied with remotely sensed f(c) data for a variety of crops in California using the Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) framework. Daily SIMS crop ET (ETc-SIMS) produced K-cb values using the FAO56 and A&P approaches. Combination of satellite derived f(c) and K-cb values with ETo data from Spatial CIMIS (California Irrigation Management Information System) produced ET estimates that were compared with daily actual crop ET derived from energy balance calculations from micrometeorological instrumentation (ETc EB).Results produced coefficients of regression of 1.05 for field crops and 1.08 for woody crops, and R-2 values of 0.81 and 0.91, respectively. These values suggest that daily ETc-SIMS-based ET can be accurately estimated within reasonable error and that the A&P approach is appropriate to support that estimation.It is likely that accuracy can be improved via progress in remote sensing determination of f(c). Tabulated K-cb results and calculation parameters are presented in a companion paper in this Special Issue.

TI  - CCL21-loaded 3D hydrogels for T cell expansion and differentiation
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent achievements in the field of immunotherapy, such as the development of engineered T cells used in adoptive cell therapy, are introducing more efficient strategies to combat cancer. Nevertheless, there are still many limitations. For example, these T cells are challenging to manufacture, manipulate, and control. Specifically, there are limitations in producing the large amounts of therapeutic T cells needed for these therapies in a short period of time and in an economically viable manner. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) hydrogels covalently combined with low molecular weight heparin are engineered to resemble the lymph nodes, where T cells reproduce. In these hydrogels, PEG provides the needed structural and mechanical properties, whereas heparin is used as an anchor for the cytokine CCL21, which is present in the lymph nodes, and can affect cell migration and proliferation. The 3D structure of the hydrogel in combination with its loading capacity result in an increased primary human CD4(+) T cell proliferation compared to the state-of-the-art expansion systems consisting of artificial antigen presenting cells. Thus, we present a new tool for adoptive cell therapy to help achieving the large numbers of cells required for therapy of selected phenotypes targeted against cancer cells, by mimicking the lymph nodes.

TI  - Flank sliding: A valve and a sentinel for paroxysmal eruptions and magma ascent at Mount Etna, Italy
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising magma, dike intrusions, and flank collapse are observed at many volcanoes worldwide, but how they interact is still poorly documented. Extensive synthetic aperture radar interferometry and continuous global positioning system observations captured a sharp dike intrusion at Mount Etna, Italy, during the 2018 paroxysm that triggered a vigorous seaward sliding of the eastern flank connected with brittle failure and deep magmatic resourcing. We propose a feedback process between flank acceleration and magma intrusion that derives from the interaction between the long- and short-term deformation of the volcano. The flank sliding acts as a valve that modulates the emplacement and eruption of magma within the shallow system. Rapid flank acceleration could potentially evolve into sudden collapses and seismic release at shallow depth. In turn, flank slip events could act as a sentinel fix center dot changes in magma depth and paroxysmal eruptions at Mount Etna.

TI  - Mapping Species at an Individual-Tree Scale in a Temperate Forest, Using Sentinel-2 Images, Airborne Laser Scanning Data, and Random Forest Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information about tree species composition is critical to forest managers and ecologists. In this study, we used Sentinel-2 imagery in combination with a canopy height model (CHM) derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) to map individual tree crowns and identify them to species level. Our study area covered 140 km(2) of a mainly mixed temperate forest in the Veluwe area in The Netherlands. Ground truth data on tree species were acquired for 2460 trees. Tree crowns were automatically delineated from the CHM model. We identified the delineated tree crowns to species and phylum level (angiosperm vs. gymnosperm) using a random forest (RF) classification. The RF model used multitemporal spectral variables from Sentinel-2 and crown structural variables from the CHM and was validated using an independent dataset. Different combinations of variables were tested. After feature reduction from 25 to 15 features, the RF model identified tree crowns with an overall accuracy of 78.5% (Kappa value 0.75) for tree species and 84.5% (Kappa value 0.73) for tree phyla whilst using the combination of all variables. Adding crown structural and multitemporal spectral information improved the RF classification compared to using only a Sentinel image from one season as input data. The producer's accuracies varied between 43.8% for Norway spruce (Picea abies) to 95.3% for Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The RF model was extrapolated to generate a tree species map over a study area (140 km(2)). The map showed high abundances of common oak (Quercus robur; 35.5%) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris; 22.8%) and low abundances of Norway spruce (Picea abies; 1.7%) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii; 2.8%). Our results indicate a high potential for individual tree classification based on Sentinel-2 imagery and automatically derived tree crowns from canopy height models.

TI  - Risk Factors for Recurrence after Robot-Assisted Radical Hysterectomy for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: A Multicenter Retrospective Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryIn 239 women with early-stage cervical cancer (<= IB1 or IIA1, FIGO 2009) undergoing robot-assisted radical hysterectomy in Spanish and Portuguese centers between 2009 and 2018, the overall survival rate was 94.1% after a median follow-up of 51 months. Recurrence was diagnosed in 26 patients. In the multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for recurrence were tumor size > 20 mm, adenocarcinoma as histological type, presence of positive pelvic lymph nodes, tumor grades 2 and 3, and not performing sentinel lymph node biopsy. The present oncological and surgical results surpassed the target of quality indicators in cervical cancer proposed by the European Society of Gynecology Oncology. When selecting a robot-assisted surgical approach to perform radical hysterectomy in the surgical treatment of primary early-stage cervical cancer, it is recommended to take into account the tumor grade and histological type, results of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, and the size of the tumor.This retrospective analysis aimed to assess the risk factors for recurrence in patients diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer (<= IB1 or IIA1, FIGO 2009) undergoing robot-assisted radical hysterectomy in Spain and Portugal between 2009 and 2018. A second primary objective was to audit the oncological outcomes according to quality indicators (QI) proposed by the European Society of Gynecology Oncology (ESGO). The study population included 239 women. After a median follow-up of 51 months, recurrence occurred in 26 patients (10.9%). Independent factors for recurrence were clinical tumor size > 20 mm (hazard ratio (HR) 2.37), adenocarcinoma as histological type (HR 2.51), positive pelvic lymph nodes (HR 4.83), tumor grade 2 (HR 4.99), tumor grade 3 (HR 8.06), and having not performed sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (HR 4.08). All 5 QI selected were surpassed by our results. In patients with early-stage cervical cancer undergoing robotic radical hysterectomy, clinicians should be aware that tumor grade 2 and 3, tumor size > 20 mm, adenocarcinoma, positive pelvic nodes, and lack of performance of SLNB are risk factors for recurrence. Fulfillment of QI targets of the ESGO might be considered as an objective oncological outcome indicator supporting the minimally invasive approach for early-stage cervical cancer treatment.

TI  - Localized Afterslip at Geometrical Complexities Revealed by InSAR After the 2016 Central Italy Seismic Sequence
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mw 6.5 Norcia earthquake occurred on 30 October 2016, along the Mt Vettore fault (Central Apennines, Italy), it was the largest earthquake of the 2016-2017 seismic sequence that started 2 months earlier with the Mw 6.0 Amatrice earthquake (24 August). To detect potential slow slip during the sequence, we produced Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series using 12- to 6-day repeat cycles of Sentinel-1A/1B images. Time series indicates that centimeter-scale surface displacements took place during the 10 weeks following the Norcia earthquake. Two areas of subsidence are detected: one in the Castelluccio basin (hanging wall of the Mt Vettore fault) and one in the southern extent of the Norcia earthquake surface rupture, near an inherited thrust. Poroelastic and viscoelastic models are unable to explain these displacements. In the Castelluccio basin, the displacement reaches 13.2 +/- 1.4 mm in the ascending line of sight on 6 January 2017. South of the Norcia earthquake surface rupture (a zone between the Norcia and Amatrice earthquakes), the postseismic surface displacements affect a smaller area but reach 35.5 +/- 1.7 mm in ascending line of sight by January 2017 and follow a logarithmic temporal decay consistent with postseismic afterslip. Our analysis suggests that the structurally complex area located south of the Norcia rupture (30 October) is characterized by a conditionally stable frictional regime. This geometrical and frictional barrier likely halted rupture propagation during the Amatrice (24 August) and Norcia (30 October) earthquakes at shallow depth (<3-4 km).

TI  - Can Quantitative Research Solve Social Problems? Pragmatism and the Ethics of Social Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Journal of Business Ethics recently published a critique of ethical practices in quantitative research by Zyphur and Pierides (J Bus Ethics 143:1-16, 2017). The authors argued that quantitative research prevents researchers from addressing urgent problems facing humanity today, such as poverty, racial inequality, and climate change. I offer comments and observations on the authors' critique. I agree with the authors in many areas of philosophy, ethics, and social research, while making suggestions for clarification and development. Interpreting the paper through the pragmatism of William James, I suggest that the authors' arguments are unlikely to change attitudes in traditional quantitative research, though they may point the way to a new worldview, or Jamesian "sub-world," in social research.

TI  - Remote sensing of severely degraded land: Detection of long-term land-use changes using high-resolution satellite images on the Meghalaya Plateau, northeast India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term land use/land cover (LULC) assessments, based on remote-sensing data, play a leading role in gathering information on land degradation that has an impact on food security, soil quality and species habitats with all the accompanying social implications. The aim of this study was to determine the LULC changes of severely degraded land using high-resolution remote-sensing data from the last similar to 50 years in order to determine whether human activities have led to improvements or further land degradation. An area of 70 km(2) near Cherrapunji in Northeast India, which receives 11,000 mm of rainfall annually and was deforested in historical times, was selected for this analysis. Despite severe land degradation, the population density of this area has been continuously increasing, standing at similar to 300 inhabitants km(-2) in 2011. A visual interpretation technique, combined with field surveys, was used for LULC mapping, based on satellite images from the US Corona programme for 1965, pansharpened Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) images IRS-1D for 1998 and Google Earth for 2017. This analysis indicated the dominance of grassland (73.2%), with a small contribution of forest (17.6%), settlements (5.8%), mining (2.3%), cropland (0.7%) and water bodies (0.4%) in 2017. The LULC structure was the result of a largely degraded land contribution inherited from the past and the emergence of new driving forces behind landuse change. The LULC trends in 1965-2017 included a decrease of forest (4%) and grassland (5%), stability of cropland, and an increase of land-use classes which, in non-degraded land under a monsoonal climate, are usually of small extension, such as settlements (85%), mining (132%) and water bodies (525%). These changes reflect both, attempts to utilise existing environmental resources and to adapt to living in a degraded environment caused by growing human population. From the land degradation perspective, the trends in LULC change show two opposing directions--further land degradation mainly associated with the expansion of settlements and mining (accounting for similar to 79% of the total LULC changes), and land improvement and neutral change, including the recovery of natural vegetation and the construction of water bodies. The relationships between the LULC changes and direct measurements of biomass and carbon stocks of forest and grassland ecosystems indicated that their balance was negative for the Cherrapunji spur in 1965-2017. A strategy aimed at restoring the sustainability of the Cherrapunji spur environment should focus on the replacement of grassland by forest through the abandonment of uncontrolled grass burning, animal grazing and coal mining with the simultaneous provision of alternative gainful employment for the local population such as tourism and aquaculture.

TI  - Triangle method modification with second degree polynomial edges fitting in LST NDVI scatterplot in lignite mine influence area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper authors presents and verifies triangle method modification in which classic dry and wet edge, usually calculated as linear functions have been replaced by second degree polynomials for soil moisture condition estimation in the vicinity of lignite open cast mine. We have performed calculation using both approaches, classic which is well described, and have been widely used by many authors and modified "quadratic approach". We also provided ground measurements to validate both TVDI (Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index) derived using classic linear approach and qTVDI (quadratic TVDI) derived using modified approach. Ground measurements were carried out using Delta-T SM150 Soil Moisture FDR Sensor on the different depths 5-10 cm, 10-15 cm and 25-30 cm. In modified approach not only curve fitting was better and no dry edge fitting range modification were needed, but also correlation with ground measurement of soil moisture presented as determination coefficient R-2 is about 10% higher for each depth.

TI  - Monthly Deforestation Monitoring with Sentinel-1 Multi-temporal Signatures and InSAR Coherences
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 interferometric time-series allow for the accurate retrieval of the target's temporal decorrelation and, therefore, the inversion of land cover information and its temporal monitoring. This paper describes the development of an observation scenario for monitoring monthly deforestation over the Amazon rainforest, which relies on the use of radar for overcoming the physical limitations of optical sensors caused by the presence of cloud coverage. Specifically, we implement a classification scheme that exploits multi-temporal SAR features, such as backscatter, spatial textures, and interferometric parameters, to map forested areas. Distinct forest maps are generated for consecutive months and further processed to detect deforestation phenomena and map clear-cuts evolution. The obtained results are validated by selecting cloud-free Sentinel-2 multispectral data on the selected area and acquired during the same observation time.

TI  - Burden of Ileal Perforations Among Surgical Patients Admitted in Tertiary Care Hospitals of Three Asian countries: Surveillance of Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP), September 2016-September 2019
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and can lead to systemic illness and complications. We aimed to characterize typhoid-related ileal perforation in the context of the population-based Surveillance of Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) in Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan.Methods. Between September 2016 and September 2019, all cases of nontraumatic ileal perforation with a clinical diagnosis of typhoid were enrolled from 4 tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, 2 pediatric hospitals in Bangladesh, and 2 hospitals in Nepal. Sociodemographic data were collected from patients or their caregivers, and clinical and outcome data were retrieved from medical records. Tissue samples were collected for histopathology and blood cultures where available.Results. Of the 249 enrolled cases, 2 from Bangladesh, 5 from Nepal and 242 from Pakistan. In Pakistan, most of the cases were in the 0-15 (117/242; 48%) and 16-30 (89/242; 37%) age groups. In all countries, males were most affected: Pakistan 74.9% (180/242), Nepal 80% (4/5), and Bangladesh 100% (2/2). Blood culture was done on 76 cases; 8 (11%) were positive for S. Typhi, and all were extensively drug resistant (XDR) S. Typhi. Tissue cultures was done on 86 patients; 3 (3%) were positive for S. Typhi, and all were XDR S. Typhi, out of 86 samples tested for histopathology 4 (5%) revealed ileal perforation with necrosis. Culture or histopathology confirmed total 15 (11%) enteric fever cases with ileal perforation are similar to the clinically diagnosed cases. There were 16/242 (7%) deaths from Pakistan. Cases of ileal perforation who survived were more likely to have sought care before visiting the sentinel hospital (P = .009), visited any hospital for treatment (P = .013) compared to those who survived.Conclusions. Although surveillance differed substantially by country, one reason for the higher number of ileal perforation cases in Pakistan could be the circulation of XDR strain of S. Typhi in Karachi.

TI  - Soil Salinity Inversion of Winter Wheat Areas Based on Satellite-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Ground Collaborative System in Coastal of the Yellow River Delta
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is an important factor affecting winter wheat growth in coastal areas. The rapid, accurate and efficient estimation of soil salt content is of great significance for agricultural production. The Kenli area in the Yellow River Delta was taken as the research area. Three machine learning inversion models, namely, BP neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) were constructed using ground-measured data and UAV images, and the optimal model is applied to UAV images to obtain the salinity inversion result, which is used as the true salt value of the Sentinel-2A image to establish BPNN, SVM and RF collaborative inversion models, and apply the optimal model to the study area. The results showed that the RF collaborative inversion model is optimal, R-2 = 0.885. The inversion results are verified by using the measured soil salt data in the study area, which is significantly better than the directly satellite remote sensing inversion method. This study integrates the advantages of multi-scale data and proposes an effective "Satellite-UAV-Ground" collaborative inversion method for soil salinity, so as to obtain more accurate soil information, and provide more effective technical support for agricultural production.

TI  - Impact of the One-Stream Cloud Detection Method on the Assimilation of AMSU-A Data in GRAPES
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds affect the assimilation of microwave data from satellites and therefore the detection of clouds is important under both clear sky and cloudy conditions. We introduce a new cloud detection method based on the assimilation of data from the advanced microwave sounder unit A (AMSU-A) and the microwave humidity sounder (MHS) into the global and regional assimilation and prediction system (GRAPES) and use forecast experiments to evaluate its impact. The new cloud detection method can retain more observational data than the current method in GRAPES, thereby improving the assimilation of AMSU-A data. Verification of the method showed that, by improving the forecast of the lower-level air temperature and geopotential height, the new cloud detection method improved the forecast of the track of two typhoons. The forecast of a large-scale weather system in GRAPES was also improved by the new method in the later period of the forecast.

TI  - A Novel Image Fusion Method of Multi-Spectral and SAR Images for Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of multi-spectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images could retain the advantages of each data, hence benefiting accurate land cover classification. However, some current image fusion methods face the challenge of producing unexpected noise. To overcome the aforementioned problem, this paper proposes a novel fusion method based on weighted median filter and Gram-Schmidt transform. In the proposed method, Sentinel-2A images and GF-3 images are respectively subjected to different preprocessing processes. Since weighted median filter does not strongly blur edges while filtering, it is applied to Sentinel-2A images for reducing noise. The processed Sentinel images are then transformed by Gram-Schmidt with GF-3 images. Two popular methods, principal component analysis method and traditional Gram-Schmidt transform, are used as the comparison methods in the experiment. In addition, random forest, a powerful ensemble model, is adopted as the land cover classifier due to its fast training speed and excellent classification performance. The overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient and classification map of the random forest are used as the evaluation criteria of the fusion method. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both objective metrics and visual impressions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can improve the overall accuracy by up to 5% compared to using the original Sentinel-2A and has the potential to improve the satellite-based land cover classification accuracy.

TI  - Influence of Quality of Remote Sensing Data on Vegetation Passability by Terrain Vehicles
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studied databases of vegetation created from remote sensors, outcome of analyses of Cross-Country Movement in forests, and quality of utilized data. The aim was to combine various databases of forests and get statistics of best data by using different methods of evaluation. Passability in forests is mainly conducted with analysis of driving between trees. The most suitable datasets in the Czech Republic are Forest Economic Plan and Digital Elevation Model 5th generation combined with Digital Surface Model 1st generation. Accuracy and usability of databases were compared with digital model of surface created from orthophoto images. Processing of data is the most important part that influences quality of statistical and map results. Studied characteristics of input databases and applied methods also have considerable influence on results of analysis of forest passability. The outcome substantially varies for personnel armored vehicles and wheeled vehicles mostly due to their movement capabilities.

TI  - Multitemporal water quality study in Sitjar (Castello, Spain) reservoir using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality is a subject of intense scientific inquiry because of its repercussion in human's life, agriculture or even energy generation. Remote sensing can be used to control water masses by analyzing biophysical variables. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Solids (SS) are a well-known feature of water quality. These variables have been measured in Sitjar reservoir (Castello, Spain) as a part of the project Ecological Status of Aquatic Systems with Sentinel Satellites (ESAQS), in order to compare the results with satellite reflectance data. Two processes were compared to correct atmospherically the level 1C Sentinel 2 (S2) images. The results show that Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) method, with a Root Mean Square Error of 2.4 mg/m(3) (Chl-a) and 3.9 g/m(3) (SS) is a better tool for atmospheric correction in this scenario due to the low turbidity levels of water. Besides, in this paper we study the Chl-a and SS variability through April 2017 to March 2019 with fourteen S2 images with the automatic products from C2RCC correction, finding correlations between them and the climate and reservoir conditions. Chl-a increase from 0.4 mg/m(3) to 9.5 mg/m(3) while SS rise 18 g/m(3) in this period, which makes Sitjar as an oligotrophic-mesotrophic system. The correlation results demonstrate an excellent correspondence between them (R-2=0.9). Sitjar reservoir lost almost 40 hm (3) at the beginning of the study, which it had a possible relationship with the increasing parameter values. Also discussed was the role played by the climatology in the reservoir conditions due to the changes in the water structure with seasons, which explains the variability through the year.

TI  - Global Open Data Remote Sensing Satellite Missions for Land Monitoring and Conservation: A Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - The application of global open data remote sensing satellite missions in land monitoring and conservation studies is in the state of rapid growth, ensuring an observation with high spatial and spectral resolution over large areas. The purpose of this study was to provide a review of the most important global open data remote sensing satellite missions, current state-of-the-art processing methods and applications in land monitoring and conservation studies. Multispectral (Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS), radar (Sentinel-1), and digital elevation model missions (SRTM, ASTER) were analyzed, as the most often used global open data satellite missions, according to the number of scientific research articles published in Web of Science database. Processing methods of these missions' data consisting of image preprocessing, spectral indices, image classification methods, and modelling of terrain topographic parameters were analyzed and demonstrated. Possibilities of their application in land cover, land suitability, vegetation monitoring, and natural disaster management were evaluated, having high potential in broad use worldwide. Availability of free and complementary satellite missions, as well as the open-source software, ensures the basis of effective and sustainable land use management, with the prerequisite of the more extensive knowledge and expertise gathering at a global scale.

TI  - Performance of different machine learning algorithms on satellite image classification in rural and urban setup
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In many countries, the increasing population drives the spatiotemporal land use and land cover change (LULCC) at a higher rate, causing heterogeneous landscape. Hence, the LULCC is a dynamic and frequent process causing fragmented land cover, and therefore, extensive research on LULCC pattern is necessary at different spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, it is essential to identify appropriate algorithms to detect LULCC in such fragmented areas. Furthermore, the rate of change is different in rural and urban areas. Hence, the main goal of the study was to describe the performance of different machine learning algorithms on three different spatial and multispectral satellite image classification in rural and urban extents. We carried out atmospheric and geometric correction. To achieve this, we acquired and processed a set of moderate and finer resolution images (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Planet images) having similar phenological stages to finding out the suitable algorithms that provide better performance in LULC classification. Random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and their combined strength (stacked algorithms) were applied on Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Planet images separately to assess individual and overall class accuracy of the images. Two unique sets of training data were generated to classify the 6 (3 sensors x 2 locations) imagery. We find that the Sentinel-2 image performs best among the three images. Among the three different algorithms, SVM showed comparatively better results. In both Bhola and Dhaka, the SVM on Sentinel image performed best with an overall accuracy of 0.969, 0.983, and overall kappa of 0.948, and 0.968, respectively. This study illustrates the role of algorithms on LULCC studies for a better understanding of the changes that occurred in the rural and urban areas. These findings assist planners, remote sensing scientists and decision-makers to choose a suitable image classification algorithm in monitoring rapidly changing, fragmented, and diverse landscape in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Regional Distribution of Net Radiation over Different Ecohydrological Land Surfaces
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Net radiation is an important component of the earth's surface energy balance, which plays a vital role in the evolution of regional climate or climate change. The estimation of this component at regional or global scales is critical and challenging due to the sparse and limited ground-based observations. This paper made an attempt to analyze the feasibility of a remote sensing-based surface energy balance model using satellite (TERRA/MODIS) data to derive the net radiation (R-n). In the present study, MODIS data at 15 different days of the year (DOY) were utilized to visualize the spatial pattern of net radiation flux over three versatile and heterogeneous ecohydrological land surfaces (upstream, midstream, and downstream) of northwest China (Heihe river basin). The results revealed that the estimated net radiation from the satellite data agrees well with the ground-based measurements over three different surfaces, with a mean relative error of 9.33% over the upstream superstation (grasslands), 13.95% over the middle stream superstation (croplands), and 11.63% over the downstream superstation (mixed forests), where the overall relative error was 11.64% with an overall rmse of 29.36 W/m(2) in the study area. The regional distribution of net radiation over the versatile land surfaces was validated well at a large scale during the five-month period and over different land surfaces. It was also observed that the spatial pattern of net radiation varies spatially over three different landscape regions during four different days of the year, which might be associated with different climatic conditions and landscape features in these regions. The overall findings of this study concluded that satellite-derived net radiation can rationally be obtained using a single-source remote sensing model over different land surfaces.

TI  - Space-time variogram for daily rainfall estimates using rain gauges and satellite data in mountainous tropical Island of Bali, Indonesia (Preliminary Study)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatio-temporal variability of daily rainfall in Bali Island can create the absence of structure in the daily variogram in certain days. This research proposes a new technique applying space-time variogram for 3-successive daily rainfall to detect structure in variogram estimation by merging rain gauges and satellite data applying ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging with CMORPH (CM), regression kriging with TRMM (FR), and blended monthly rainfall (MONT) to obtain daily blended gridded rainfall estimates. Original retrieval of CMORPH (CM_OR) and TRMM (TR_OR) also used as control points to assess the proposed method. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis including cross validation were carried out to validate the proposed method.The result shows that a new technique, adapted from CMORPH specific character, can be applied to detect the existence of structure in variogram. Blended gridded daily rainfall estimates of CM has highest probability detection of rainy events, while OK the lowest. Generally, the four interpolation methods (OK, CM, MONT, TR) have low accuracy at leeward and in a coastal area. All of them have almost similar performance indicated by no clear distinction of RMSE value from cross validation. CM, MONT, and TR have a good sensitivity with maximum and minimum temperature, indicating that satellite data can improve the gridded rainfall estimates. However, it is required an improvement of daily gridded rainfall estimates since there are large RMSE values and low coefficient correlation in certain days because of strong and erratic behavior of rainy events in a mountainous tropical island of Bali.

TI  - A spatial-temporal analysis of urban growth in melbourne; Were local government areas moving toward compact or sprawl from 2001-2016?
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In most cities, urban growth follows a sprawl pattern. In the Melbourne metropolitan area, the Plan Melbourne (2017-2050) was formulated with the aim of reducing sprawl and encouraging sustainable growth. However, the Internet research has shown that in the metropolitan area of Melbourne, no studies aiming to investigate the urban growth using satellite images and analyzing compact urban growth drivers (CUGDs) have been conducted. The objectives of this study of the Melbourne metropolitan area are as follows: 1) Analyzing spatial-temporal changes of normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) 2) Analyzing CUGDs 3) Evaluating the relationship between NDBI and CUGDs. 4) Determining the type of growth in metropolitan area divisions regarding NDBI and CUGDs (2001-2016). To calculate NDBI and urban built-up areas Landsat satellite images were used. Five indicators of population density, separate house density, apartment house density, public transportation usage ratio and distance from the city center were analyzed as CUGDs. The relationship between NDBI and CUGDs was assessed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). GIS and ENVI software packages were used for these analyses. The findings revealed that outer Melbourne has experienced the highest rate of change in built-up areas and the direction of developments are toward west, north and south-east in conformity with the government policies. The highest annual rate of change belongs to apartment house density. During 2001-2006, it was 67%, during 2006-2011 45%, during 2011-2016 58%, and during 2001-2016, 61% of the variation in NDBI was explained by the variables. Changes in NDBI under various CUGDs conditions led to the formation of patterns conceptualized at the level of thirty-one local governments (LGs). Based on this study's findings, practical strategies should be formulated to guide the future development of the city and to achieve the Plan Melbourne (2017-2050) objective.

TI  - Analyzing Daily Estimation of Forest Gross Primary Production Based on Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Product Using SCOPE Process-Based Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation top-of-canopy reflectance contains valuable information for estimating vegetation biochemical and structural properties, and canopy photosynthesis (gross primary production (GPP)). Satellite images allow studying temporal variations in vegetation properties and photosynthesis. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has produced a harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data set to improve temporal coverage. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential and investigate the information content of the HLS data set using the Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model to retrieve the temporal variations in vegetation properties, followed by the GPP simulations during the 2016 growing season of an evergreen Norway spruce dominated forest stand. We optimized the optical radiative transfer routine of the SCOPE model to retrieve vegetation properties such as leaf area index and leaf chlorophyll, water, and dry matter contents. The results indicated percentage differences less than 30% between the retrieved and measured vegetation properties. Additionally, we compared the retrievals from HLS data with those from hyperspectral airborne data for the same site, showing that HLS data preserve a considerable amount of information about the vegetation properties. Time series of vegetation properties, retrieved from HLS data, served as the SCOPE inputs for the time series of GPP simulations. The SCOPE model reproduced the temporal cycle of local flux tower measurements of GPP, as indicated by the high Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value (>0.5). However, GPP simulations did not significantly change when we ran the SCOPE model with constant vegetation properties during the growing season. This might be attributed to the low variability in the vegetation properties of the evergreen forest stand within a vegetation season. We further observed that the temporal variation in maximum carboxylation capacity had a pronounced effect on GPP simulations. We focused on an evergreen forest stand. Further studies should investigate the potential of HLS data across different forest types, such as deciduous stand.

TI  - Image-based tea yield estimation using Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2B images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery poses a considerable potential for estimating agricultural and plantation production, one of which is tea yields. Estimations using this technology provide explicit spatial information of the total area and production of tea yield. This study aims to assess the effect of spatial resolution (pixel size) of the images on tea yield estimates in the plantation area of PT (limited company) Pagilaran, Central Java, Indonesia. The estimation was carried out semi-empirically using fractional canopy cover (FC) as a proxy, which was applied to Landsat-8 OLI (30m) and Sentinel-2B (10m) images. Statistical correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify the relationship (1) between the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and actual tea FC and (2) between fractional canopy cover of tea trees (FCtea) and actual tea yields. These analyses produced regression equations to build models of tea yield estimation based on the images. The results showed that the relationship between the two pairs of variables was linear and positive. Both images can be used to efficiently estimate total tea yield with a difference of merely 6.18 kg/ha/month. The large pixel size of Landsat-8 OLI causes a large number of mixed pixels of tea plants and other objects so that the accuracy of its tea production estimate is lower than that of the Sentinel-2B image.

TI  - Mapping of rice growth phases and bare land using Landsat-8 OLI with machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular monitoring and mapping of rice (Oryza Sativa) growth phases are essential for industry stakeholders to ensure food production is on track and to assess the impact of climate change on rice production. In Indonesia, high-cost field surveys have been widely used to monitor the rice growth phases. Alternatively, this research proposes a methodology to retrieve multi-temporal rice phenology (vegetative, reproductive, and ripening) and bare land mapping using medium resolution remote sensing imagery obtained from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) combined with machine learning techniques. In this study, we have used extensive ground validation information collected from 2014 to 2016 for training the models. This ground validation information was obtained from pre-installed webcams across Indonesia. Five different machine learning algorithms were used including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) with three kernel functions (linear, polynomial, and radial) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to classify rice growth phases and bare land. This paper also evaluates the temporal evolution of rice phenology and bare land to check the prediction model consistency between two consecutive dates in 3 years. The results show that the nonlinear SVM algorithm gives the best model accuracy (70.5% with Kappa: 0.66) based on the test dataset and the lowest temporal changes (<11%). Spatial-temporal assessment of rice phenology and bare land from Landsat-8 indicated that the models were reliable and robust over different seasons and years. The distribution of rice phenology maps will enable Indonesian management authorities to supply fertilizer, allocate water resources, harvesting, and marketing facilities more efficiently.

TI  - Automatic Mapping of Rice Growth Stages Using the Integration of SENTINEL-2, MOD13Q1, and SENTINEL-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food crop for more than half of the world's population. Rice production is facing a myriad of problems, including water shortage, climate, and land-use change. Accurate maps of rice growth stages are critical for monitoring rice production and assessing its impacts on national and global food security. Rice growth stages are typically monitored by coarse-resolution satellite imagery. However, it is difficult to accurately map due to the occurrence of mixed pixels in fragmented and patchy rice fields, as well as cloud cover, particularly in tropical countries. To solve these problems, we developed an automated mapping workflow to produce near real-time multi-temporal maps of rice growth stages at a 10-m spatial resolution using multisource remote sensing data (Sentinel-2, MOD13Q1, and Sentinel-1). This study was investigated between 1 June and 29 September 2018 in two (wet and dry) areas of Java Island in Indonesia. First, we built prediction models based on Sentinel-2, and fusion of MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1 using the ground truth information. Second, we applied the prediction models on all images in area and time and separation between the non-rice planting class and rice planting class over the cropping pattern. Moreover, the model's consistency on the multitemporal map with a 5-30-day lag was investigated. The result indicates that the Sentinel-2 based model classification gives a high overall accuracy of 90.6% and the fusion model MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1 shows 78.3%. The performance of multitemporal maps was consistent between time lags with an accuracy of 83.27-90.39% for Sentinel-2 and 84.15% for the integration of Sentinel-2/MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1. The results from this study show that it is possible to integrate multisource remote sensing for regular monitoring of rice phenology, thereby generating spatial information to support local-, national-, and regional-scale food security applications.

TI  - Long-term changes in land surface temperature due to land use land cover over a mega city in south India
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that one of the major causes of global climate change is urbanization and industrialization. The necessity of converting vegetation area into residential and commercial areas and their allied developments in the way of rapid urbanization, may change the surface albedo that could increase the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the impact of landscape structure on the diversity of LST over one of the fastest growing urban region Hyderabad, located in Rangareddy district of Telangana state in southern India. Study has been carried out during the period of 1995 - 2018, using four Landsat Images (two Landsat - 5 Thematic Mapper and two Landsat OLI-TIRS 8). Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping and LST are derived by using pre-processed landscape data. Interestingly, urban region LST is found less than that observed in the outskirts during entire study period. Land cover classification showed that the built-up areas, barren land and vegetation increased by 2.34%, 9.28% and 18.01%, respectively, while the forest area and water bodies are decreased by 28.79% and 1.21% respectively, over the period of 24 years between 1995 and 2018. Maximum LST for the total area increased by approximately 4 degrees C and the minimum temperature increased by approximately 3.5 degrees C between 1995 and 2018. The negative correlation has been observed between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) with LST with low temperatures, but Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), has positive correlation with high temperatures. This study also provides a quantitative approach in exploring the relationship between several index and temperature.

TI  - First Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Center in Africa: First 2 Years in Operation, Including COVID-19 Experiences
T2  - JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE There is a shortage of radiation therapy service centers in low- to middle-income countries. TARGIT-intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) may offer a viable alternative to improve radiation treatment efficiency and alleviate hospital patient loads. The Breast Care Unit in Johannesburg became the first facility in Africa to offer TARGIT-IORT, and the purpose of this study was to present a retrospective review of patients receiving IORT at this center between November 2017 and May 2020.PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient selection criteria were based mainly on the latest American Society of Radiation Oncology guidelines. Selection criteria included early-stage breast carcinoma (luminal A) and luminal B with negative upfront sentinel lymph node biopsy that negated external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Patient characteristics, reasons for choosing IORT, histology, and use of oncoplastic surgery that resulted in complications were recorded.RESULTS One hundred seven patients successfully received IORT/TARGIT-IORT. Mean age was 60.8 years (standard deviation, 9.3 years). A total of 73.8% of patients presented with luminal A, 15.0% with luminal B, and 5.6% with triple-negative cancer. One patient who presented with locally advanced breast cancer (T4N2) opted for IORT as a boost in addition to planned EBRT. Eighty-seven patients underwent wide local excision (WLE) with mastopexy, and 12 underwent WLE with parenchymal. Primary reasons for selecting IORT/TARGIT-IORT were distance from the hospital (43.9%), choice (40.2%), and age (10.3%).CONCLUSION This retrospective study of IORT/TARGIT-IORT performed in Africa confirms its viability, with low complication rates and no detrimental effects with breast conservation, resulting in positive acceptance and the potential to reduce Oncology Center patient loads. Limitations of the study include the fact that only short-term data on local recurrence were available. Health and socioeconomic value models must still be addressed in the African setting.

TI  - Obtaining agricultural land cover in Sentinel-2 satellite images with drone image injection using Random Forest in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain accurate information on land cover changes in the agricultural sector, we propose a supervised classification method that integrates Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with images surveyed from Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The methodology was implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform. Initially, the Sentinel-2 imagery collection was integrated into a single image through a median reduction process. Subsequently, the high-pass filter (HPF) pansharpening image fusion method was applied to the thermal spectral bands to obtain a final spatial resolution of 10 m. To perform the integration of the two image sources, the RPAS image was normalized by using a 5X5 gaussian texture filter and the pixel was resampled to five times its original size. This procedure was performed iteratively until reaching the spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 imagery. Besides, the following inputs were added to the classification: the spectral indices, calculated from the Sentinel-2 and RPAS bands (e.g. NDVI, NDWI, SIPI, GARI), altimetric information and slopes of the zone derived from the SRTM DEM. The supervised classification was done by using the Random Forest technique (Machine Learning). The land cover seed reference to perform the classification was manually captured by a thematic expert, then, this reference was distributed in 70% for the training of the Random Forest algorithm and in 30% to validate the classification. The results show that the incorporation of the RPAS image improves thematic accuracy indicators by an average of 3% compared to a classification made exclusively with Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - Long-Term Remote Monitoring of Ground Deformation Using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR): Applications and Insights into Geotechnical Engineering Practices
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology and the dedicated suite of processing tools have aided the evolution of remote sensing techniques for various Earth Observation (EO) applications. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) is a relatively new geodetic technique which provides high-speed and reliable geographic, geologic, and hazards information allowing the prognosis of future environmental and urban planning. In this study, we explored the applicability of two differential interferometry techniques, conventional and advanced differential InSAR (A-DInSAR), for topographic mapping and long-term geotechnical monitoring by exploiting satellite data, particularly Sentinel-1 SAR data, which is publicly shared. We specifically used the open-source tools of SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) for interferometric data processing to implement A-DInSAR. This study presents various applications, which include generation of a digital elevation model (DEM), mapping of seismically induced displacement and associated damages, and detection and long-term monitoring of tunneling-induced ground deformation and rainfall-induced landslide. Geometric and temporal decorrelations posed challenges and limitations in the successful implementation of Sentinel-1 SAR interferometry specifically in vegetated areas. The presented results proved the validity and reliability of the exploited SAR data and InSAR techniques for addressing geotechnical engineering related problems.

TI  - Soil salinity assessment using vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral data. application to Leziria Grande, Portugal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leziria Grande is an important agricultural area in Portugal, prone to waterlogging and salinity problems due to the influence of estuarine tides on groundwater dynamics. Simple, non-invasive, practical approaches are need for monitoring soil salinity in the region and preventing further degradation of soil resources. The objective of this study was to develop regression models for soil salinity assessment in Leziria Grande based on the relationship between multi-year crop reflectance data derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and rootzone salinity. Nine vegetation indices (VI), computed from the annual averages of the spectral bands, were tested between 2017 and 2019. The multi-year maximum from each pixel was then used for correlating the VI with the ground-truth dataset. This dataset was composed of average values of the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract (ECe mean) measured in 80 sampling sites (0-1.5 m depth) located in four agricultural fields representative of the salinity gradient in the region. The Canopy Response Salinity Index (CRSI), which uses the blue (490 nm), green (560 nm), red (665 nm), and infrared (842 nm) bands, provided the strongest correlation with measured data (r=-0.787). Regression models further considered vegetation cover and soil type as explanatory variables, with predictions resulting in a coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.63 to 0.91 and a root mean square error (RMSE) varying from 1.63 to 3.26 dS m(-1). The use of remote sensing data for soil salinity assessment showed to be an interesting option to consider in future soil monitoring programs. Nevertheless, more detailed covariates are needed for improving salinity assessment models at the regional scale.

TI  - Deep disagreement and hinge epistemology
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the application of hinge epistemology to deep disagreement. Hinge epistemology holds that there is a class of commitments-hinge commitments-which play a fundamental role in the structure of belief and rational evaluation: they are the most basic general 'presuppositions' of our world views which make it possible for us to evaluate certain beliefs or doubts as rational. Deep disagreements seem to crucially involve disagreements over such fundamental commitments. In this paper, I consider pessimism about deep disagreement, the thesis that such disagreements are rationally irresolvable, and ask whether the Wittgensteinian account of deep disagreement-according to which such disagreements are disagreements over hinge commitments-provides adequate support for pessimism. I argue that the answer to this question depends on what hinge commitments are and what our epistemic relation to them is supposed to be. I argue for two core claims. First, that non-epistemic theories of hinge commitments provide adequate support for pessimism. Nevertheless, such theories have highly implausible consequences in the context of deep disagreement. Secondly, at least one epistemic theory of hinge commitments, the entitlement theory, permits optimism about such disagreements. As such, while hinge epistemology is mainly pessimistic about deep disagreement, it doesn't have to be.

TI  - Impacts of Erratic Snowfall on Apple Orchards in Kashmir Valley, India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Kashmir Valley has been witnessing erratic snowfall events in recent autumns which severely impacted apple orchards and harvests. Here, we combine remotely sensed data and field observations to map snowfall distribution and snow depths during the recent snowfall events in November 2018 and November 2019. Besides, we used ERA-5 reanalysis climate datasets to investigate the causes of these erratic snowfall events, pointing to an early arrival of Western Disturbances (WD) to the area. Analysis of these untimely snowfall episodes indicates that snow depths varied from 5-122 cm and 31-152 cm during the 2018 and 2019 snowfall events, respectively. In turn, satellite data analysis reveals that the apple orchards cover roughly 9.8% (1329 km(2)) of the entire surface of Kashmir Valley, out of which 32.6% were mildly to severely damaged by snow. The areas in South Kashmir suffered the most from the untimely snowfall with an area affected estimated to similar to 264 km(2), followed by North Kashmir (similar to 151 km(2)) and Central Kashmir (18 km(2)). The snowfall caused substantial harvest losses in orchards ranging from 4-50% with an average of similar to 35%. The geopotential analysis from the ERA-5 dataset provides insights into the synoptic weather patterns leading to the snowfall events and point to a trough in the high-troposphere (200 mb), along with a col at lower levels (850 mb) over the Kashmir Valley from November 2-5, 2018. The lower levels (850 mb) experienced intense cyclonic circulation which favored advection of moisture from the Arabian Sea during the November 6-7, 2019, snowfall event. The large economic losses related to early arrival of WD led to a virtual grounding of the horticultural sector in 2018 and 2019. Therefore, more baseline research is critically needed along with a comprehensive evaluation of the suitability of horticulture as an economically viable sector that is being promoted over the Kashmir region, also under climate change.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Data to Increase the Efficiency of Data Collection
T2  - GIM INTERNATIONAL-THE WORLDWIDE MAGAZINE FOR GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rigorous evaluation of the outcomes of international development programmes and interventions has been a perennial challenge across multiple sectors and disciplines. Because of their ability to determine intervention effectiveness (and cost effectiveness), the demand for and production of impact evaluations (IEs) has grown substantially in recent decades, and they have been evolving to fill a critical gap in evidence. Remotely sensed data allows IEs to be improved in multiple ways, increasing their timeliness, accuracy and relevance for decision-makers. This article outlines how 3ie and New Light Technologies aim to enhance the generation, use and transparency of geospatial analysis in IEs.

TI  - Detecting Change at Archaeological Sites in North Africa Using Open-Source Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our paper presents a remote sensing workflow for identifying modern activities that threaten archaeological sites, developed as part of the work of the Endangered Archaeology of the Middle East and North Africa (EAMENA) project. We use open-source Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and the free tool Google Earth Engine to run a per-pixel change detection to make the methods and data as accessible as possible for heritage professionals. We apply this and perform validation at two case studies, the Aswan and Kom-Ombo area in Egypt, and the Jufra oases in Libya, with an overall accuracy of the results ranging from 85-91%. Human activities, such as construction, agriculture, rubbish dumping and natural processes were successfully detected at archaeological sites by the algorithm, allowing these sites to be prioritised for recording. A few instances of change too small to be detected by Sentinel-2 were missed, and false positives were caused by registration errors, shadow and movements of sand. This paper shows that the expansion of agricultural and urban areas particularly threatens the survival of archaeological sites, but our extensive online database of archaeological sites and programme of training courses places us in a unique position to make our methods widely available.

TI  - Enhancing POLST Completion in a Hospital Setting: An Interdisciplinary Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY With increased therapeutic capabilities in healthcare today, many patients with multiple progressive comorbidities are living longer. They experience recurrent hospitalizations and often undergo procedures that are not aligned with their personal goals. That is why it is essential to discuss and document healthcare preferences prior to an acute event when significant interventions could occur, especially for patients with serious and progressive illness. Completion of an advance directive and a physician order for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) supports provision of goal-concordant care. Further, for patients who have do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) orders or are diagnosed with advanced dementia, having a POLST is essential. This may be best accomplished with hospitalization discharge plans. Our 896-bed academic medical center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, launched a quality initiative in 2015 to complete POLSTs for patients being discharged with DNAR status or with dementia returning to a skilled nursing facility. As part of interdisciplinary progression of care rounds, emphasis was placed on those patients for whom POLST completion was indicated. Proactive, facilitated discussions with patients, family members, and attending physicians were initiated to support POLST completion. The completed forms were then uploaded to the electronic health record. Individual units and physicians received regular feedback on POLST completion rates, and the data were later shared at medical staff quality improvement meetings. During the initiative, POLST completion rates for DNAR patients discharged alive rose from 41% in fiscal year (FY) 2014 to 75% in FY 2019. Similar improvement was seen for patients with dementia discharged to skilled nursing facilities, regardless of code status (rising from 14% in FY 2014 to 54% in FY 2019). Subsequently, we have expanded our efforts to include early discussion and completion of these advanced care planning documents for patients recently diagnosed with high mortality cancers (ovarian, pancreatic, lung, glioblastoma), focusing on the completion of advanced care planning documentation and palliative care referrals.

TI  - Full Convolutional Neural Network Based on Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for the Class Imbalance Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image segmentation with samples imbalance is always one of the most important issues. Typically, a high-resolution remote sensing image has the characteristics of high spatial resolution and low spectral resolution, complex large-scale land covers, small class differences for some land covers, vague foreground, and imbalanced distribution of samples. However, traditional machine learning algorithms have limitations in deep image feature extraction and dealing with sample imbalance issue. In the paper, we proposed an improved full-convolution neural network, called DeepLab V3+, with loss function based solution of samples imbalance. In addition, we select Sentinel-2 remote sensing images covering the Yuli County, Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China as data sources, then a typical region image dataset is built by data augmentation. The experimental results show that the improved DeepLab V3+ model can not only utilize the spectral information of high-resolution remote sensing images, but also consider its rich spatial information. The classification accuracy of the proposed method on the test dataset reaches 97.97%. The mean Intersection-over-Union reaches 87.74%, and the Kappa coefficient 0.9587. The work provides methodological guidance to sample imbalance correction, and the established data resource can be a reference to further study in the future.

TI  - Half a century of forest cover change along the Latvian-Russian border captured by object-based image analysis of Corona and Landsat TM/OLI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - After 1991, major events, such as the collapse of socialism and the transition to market economies, caused land use change across the former USSR and affected forests in particular. However, major land use changes may have occurred already during Soviet rule, but those are largely unknown and difficult to map for large areas because 30-m Landsat data is not available prior to the 1980s. Our goal was to analyze the rates and determinants of forest cover change from 1967 to 2015 along the Latvian-Russian border, and to develop an object-based image analysis approach to compare forest cover based on declassified Corona spy satellite images from 1967 with that derived from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images from 1989/1990 and 2014/2015. We applied Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry to orthorectify and mosaic the scanned Corona images, and extracted forest cover from Corona and Landsat mosaics using object-based image analysis in eCognition and expert classification. In a sensitivity analysis, we tested how the scale parameters for the segmentation affected the accuracy of the change maps. We analyzed forest cover and forest patterns for our full study area of 22,209 km(2), and applied propensity score matching approach to identify three Latvian-Russian pairs of 15 x 15 km cells, which we compared. We attained overall classification accuracies of 92% (Latvia) and 93% (Russia) for the forest/non-forest change maps of 1967-1989, and 91% (Latvia) and 93% (Russia) for 1989-2015, and our results were robust in regards to the segmentation scale parameter. Sample-based forest cover gain from 1967 to 1989 differed notably between the two countries (18.5% in Latvia and 23.6% in Russia), but was generally much higher prior to 1989 than from 1989 to 2015 (8.7% in Latvia and 9.7% in Russia). Furthermore, we found rapid de-fragmentation of forest cover, where forest core area increased, and proportions of isolated patches and forest corridors decreased, and this was particularly pronounced in Russia. Our findings highlight the need to study Soviet-time land cover and land use change, because rural population declines and major policy decisions such as the collectivization of agricultural production, merging of farmlands and agricultural mechanization led already during Soviet rule to widespread abandonment and afforestation of remote farmlands. After 1991, government subsidies for farming declined rapidly in both countries, but in Latvia, new financial aid from the EU became available after 2001. In contrast, remoteness, lower population density, and less of a legacy of intensive cultivation resulted in higher rates of forest gain in Russia. Including Corona imagery in our object-based image analysis workflow allowed us to examine half a century of forest cover changes, and that resulted in surprising findings, most notably that forest area gains on abandoned farm fields were already widespread during the Soviet era and not just a post-socialist land use change trend as had been previously reported.

TI  - Monitoring water discharge and floodplain connectivity for the Northern Andes utilizing satellite data: A tool for river planning and science-based decision-making (vol 586, 124887, 2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Correction
AB  - River discharge data and magnitudes of floods are often not readily available for decision makers of many developing nations, including Colombia. And this while flooding for these regions is often devastating, causing many fatalities and insurmountable damage to the most vulnerable communities. During the wet season, in strong La Nina years, infrastructural damages of over $US 7.2 billion have occurred. Mitigation of such natural disasters lacks data-supported scientific approaches for evaluating river response to extreme climate events. Here, we propose a satellite-based technique to measure river discharge at selected sites for the main northern Andean River, the Magdalena. This method has the advantage of back calculating daily river discharges over a period of two decades, and thus making it possible to calculate return intervals of significant flood events. The study shows that satellite based river discharges well capture a) the inter-annual variability of river discharge; b) the natural seasonality of water discharge along the floodplains; and c) peak discharges that were observed during La Nina conditions between 2008 and 2011. The last is likely more accurate compared to ground-based gauging stations, as ground-based stations tend to overflow during large flood events and as such are hampered to accurately monitor peak discharges. Furthermore, we show that these derived discharges can form the base to study river-floodplain connectivity, providing environmental decision makers with a technique that makes it possible to better monitor river and ecosystem processes.

AB  - The crop coefficient (KC) is essential to irrigation scheduling in agriculture. The objectives of this study were to monitor height and vegetation index NDVI in safflower during two growing seasons, develop a new crop coefficient (KC) based on NDVI and calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETC) taking KC values. The study was carried out in autumn-winter 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 growing seasons in Matamoros, Coahuila, Mexico. The cultivars evaluated were Guayalejo, Selkino and CD-868. Sowing was done in dry soil on December 10 and 12, of 2016 and 2017, respectively. In growing season 2016-2017 three irrigations were applied and 2017-2018 two. NDVIfield values were derived from GreenSeeker and NDVIsatellite were derived from Landsat 7 and 8 images. A relationship between NDVIfield and KC taken from FAO-56 Manual was established. The results indicated similar NDVI curves in both growing seasons. High determination coefficients (r(2) = 0.93 and 0.89) were recorded between NDVIfield and KC FAO-56. A linear equation (KC = 1.064 * NDVI + 0.212) for both growing seasons was generated. The new KC values were multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) to calculate ETC. Whit this equation a calculation model is proposed to derive recommendation irrigation according to safflower phenological stage.

TI  - Departures of Rangeland Fractional Component Cover and Land Cover from Landsat-Based Ecological Potential in Wyoming, USA
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring rangelands by identifying the departure of contemporary conditions from long-term ecological potential allows for the disentanglement of natural biophysical gradients driving change from changes associated with land uses and other disturbance types. We developed maps of ecological potential (EP) for shrub, sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), perennial herbaceous, litter, and bare ground fractional cover in Wyoming, USA. EP maps correspond to the potential natural vegetation cover expected by environmental conditions in the absence of anthropogenic and natural disturbance as represented by the greenest and least disturbed period of the Landsat archive. EP was predicted using regression tree models with inputs of soil maps and spectral data associated with the 75th percentile of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in the Landsat archive. We trained our EP models with 2015 component cover maps on ecologically intact sites with relatively lower bare ground than expected. We generated departure of vegetation cover by comparing the EP and 2015 fractional cover. The departures represent land cover change from potential land cover and/or within-state changes in 2015. Next, we converted EP and 2015 fractional cover maps into thematic land cover and evaluated departure to determine if it was great enough to result in land cover change. The 2015 conditions showed reduced shrub, sagebrush, litter, and perennial herbaceous cover and increased bare ground relative to EP. Known disturbances, such as energy development, fires, and vegetation treatments, are clearly visible on the departure maps, but not on EP component maps. The most frequent departure from EP land cover was shrubland conversion to grassland. Land cover departures can be explained only in small part by known disturbance, and instead are ostensibly related to climate and land management practices. These drivers result in land cover departures that broadened the ecotone between shrubland and grassland relative to EP. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Continuity of MODIS and VIIRS Snow Cover Extent Data Products for Development of an Earth Science Data Record
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An Earth Observing System global snow cover extent data products record at moderate spatial resolution (375-500 m) began in February 2000 with the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the Terra satellite. The record continued with the Aqua MODIS in July 2002, the Suomi-National Polar Platform (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in January 2012 and continues with the Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) VIIRS, launched in November of 2017. The objective of this work is to develop a snow cover extent Earth Science Data Record (ESDR) using different satellites, sensors and algorithms. There are many issues to understand when data from different algorithms and sensors are used over a decade-scale time period to create a continuous dataset. Issues may also arise with sensor degradation and even differences in sensor band locations. In this paper we describe development of an ESDR derived from existing MODIS and VIIRS data products and demonstrate continuity among the products. The MODIS and VIIRS snow cover detection algorithms produce very similar daily snow cover maps, with 90-97% agreement in snow cover extent (SCE) in different landscapes. Differences in SCE between products ranged from 2-15% and are attributable to convolved factors of viewing geometry, pixel spread across a scan and time of observation. Compared at a common grid size of 1 km, there is a mean of 95% agreement in SCE and a difference range of 1-10% between the MODIS and VIIRS SCE maps. Mapping sensor observations to a coarser resolution grid reduces the effect of the factors convolved in the 500 m tile to tile comparisons. We conclude that the MODIS and VIIRS SCE data products are reliable constituents of a moderate-resolution ESDR.

TI  - Future perspectives of surgical treatment of breast cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease which requires updates on scientific research to offer patients the best possible and personalized treatment. Modern surgical treatment of breast cancer is recently been reviewed and it is clearly a field of continuous change and improvement. The change in treatment strategies is a challenge given that prognosis is already acceptable. The collaboration between specialties across different countries is needed to exchange experience and improve international guidelines. Multidisciplinary teams are mandatory for the patient to be provided with all treatment options and to make an informed decision on their treatment. The major trend in surgical treatment of breast cancer is de-escalating surgery and more focus on tumor biology. A "one-size-fits all" approach does not apply in treatment of breast cancer today. There are two major questions in future aspects of breast cancer treatment; Can surgery in the breast be omitted in patients with a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant therapy? And can some patients be spared axillary surgery? The timing of surgery is also debatable. These are major questions that need to be answered and through randomized controlled trials. This commentary gives an insight on thoughts and scientific research with focus on future aspects of breast cancer treatment.

TI  - Sensitivity of hydrology and water quality to variation in land use and land cover data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is critical to hydrologic study as it affects surface runoff, sediment yield, and nutrient load from watersheds. Change in LULC is a continuous process in agricultural watersheds as per the growing and harvesting seasons. In this study, monthly LULC data layers were generated for the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW), Mississippi by classifying cloud free Landsat images from 2014 to 2018 and combining them according to the season in order to obtain dominant LULC data layers for spring, summer, and fall. About 60 % of the total land area in summer was cultivated land, whereas only 20 and 5 % of the total land area were cultivated land during fall and spring, respectively. The rest of the total land area was constantly covered with urban, forest, and water for the three seasons. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient ranging from of 87 % to 92 % and 0.8 to 0.90 was obtained during accuracy assessment of the seasonal LULC data layers. This suggested that the seasonal data layers can reasonably be used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to analyze the effects of LULC data variation on hydrology and water quality of BSRW. SWAT was calibrated and validated for streamflow, sediment yield, and nutrient concentration using the summer LULC data layer and those parameters were applied to the models using the spring and fall LULC data layers. SWAT output for runoff, sediment yield, and nutrient load was found to be very sensitive to the change in LULC data layers. The average amount of runoff and sediment yield was higher during the summer while total nitrogen and total phosphorous yields were higher during the fall and spring, respectively. Agricultural operations are usually conducted during the summer and fields are mostly barren during the spring and fall. The use of seasonal LULC data layers is very beneficial to the scientific community as they can better explain the seasonal variation in hydrology and water quality as compared to the annual cropland data layer that is available for a single season of a year.

TI  - Spectral analysis using LANDSAT images to monitor the chlorophyll-a concentration in Lake Laja in Chile
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study remote sensing was used as an early alert tool for chlorophyll-a changes in a continental aquatic ecosystem in central Chile. To this end, 14 LANDSAT images of Laja Lake (36 degrees 54 'S, 71 degrees 05' W, 1,360 meters above sea level) were taken over a 6-year period. Eleven spectral indexes were calculated. At the same time, chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined experimentally. Correlations between vegetation indices and chlorophyll-a concentrations in different monitoring zones were established. The indices that presented a good correlation were NDVI and GNDVI. A new regression model was developed that allows the primary productivity values of Laja Lake to be estimated using satellite data. Finally, chlorophyll-a maps were created.

TI  - Resilience and values: Global perspectives on the values and worldviews underpinning the resilience concept
T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Instrumentalist and critical narratives of resilience have seldom engaged discussing the 'values' underpinning it. We propose that mapping resilience values against worldviews can help translate the articulation of theoretical narratives as public policy. This can help establish an evidence-base to assess if resilience thinking is in practice the inclusive and participatory agenda that policy claims it to be; or - on the other hand - to understand the ways in which resilience is a new market for exploitation, as its critics have claimed. The inclusion of a worldviews perspective in conjunction with the contextual aspect of place approach associated with geographers will help actors design better resilience-led interventions, by targeting such interventions more appropriately to the values of the target audience. The paper summarizes two dominant narratives and suggests pathways for the inclusion of a third pathway that derives empirical approaches from values-oriented research at multiple scales.

TI  - Evaluations of the Thermodynamic Phases of Clouds in a Cloud-System-Resolving Model Using <i>CALIPSO</i> and a Satellite Simulator over the Southern Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new evaluation method for the thermodynamic phases of clouds in cloud-system-resolving models is presented using CALIPSO observations and a satellite simulator. This method determines the thermodynamic phases using the depolarization ratio and a cloud extinction proxy. For the evaluation, we introduced empirical parameterization of the depolarization ratio of ice and water clouds using temperatures of a reanalysis dataset and total attenuated backscatters of CALIPSO. We evaluated the mixed-phase clouds simulated in a cloud-system-resolving model over the Southern Ocean using single-moment and double-moment bulk cloud microphysics schemes, referred to as NSW6 and NDW6, respectively. The NDW6 simulations reproduce supercooled water clouds near the boundary layer that are consistent with the observations. Conversely, the NSW6 simulations failed to reproduce such supercooled water clouds. Consistencies between the cloud classes diagnosed by the evaluation method and the simulated hydrometeor categories were examined. NDW6 shows diagnosed water and ice classes that are consistent with the simulated categories, whereas the ice category simulated with NSW6 is diagnosed as liquid water by the present method due to the large extinction from the ice cloud layers. Additional analyses indicated that ice clouds with a small effective radius and large ice water content in NSW6 lead to erroneous values for the fraction of the diagnosed liquid water. It is shown that the uncertainty in the cloud classification method depends on the details of the cloud microphysics schemes. It is important to understand the causes of inconsistencies in order to properly understand the cloud classification applied to model evaluations as well as retrievals.

TI  - Limitations of cloud cover for optical remote sensing of agricultural areas across South America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation data support the large-scale monitoring of croplands across South America (SA). For instance, optical remote sensing (ORS) data are typically used to map and monitor plant development during a crop season. However, the monitoring of agricultural areas is highly affected by cloud cover frequency (CCF), especially in the rainy season, and the implications of cloud cover for ORS of agricultural areas are still poorly understood in SA. In this study we evaluated the monthly CCF and variability focused on implications for agricultural monitoring in SA. Cloud cover was derived from daily MCD19A2 Collection 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product between 2000 and 2015. A monthly average was computed using daily observations for the studied period. To evaluate the effects of clouds in agricultural areas, we used a cropland mask from the Worldwide Croplands project and divided the CCF into quarters. The results show that cloud cover affects the monitoring of croplands depending on geographic location and crop season. In the P1 period (September to November) 68% of South American croplands have CCF between 40% and 60%. In the P2 period (December and February), SA croplands have CCF concentrated in the classes of 40%-50% and 70%-80%. In the P3 period (March to May) 42% of SA croplands have CCF concentration in class 5 (40-50% of cloud cover). In the P4 period (June to August), we observed values from 30% to 60% of cloud cover in 41% of South American croplands. These patterns make summer crop monitoring via ORS data difficult, mainly soybean and maize. In this sense, for the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso, Goias, Bahia, Tocantins, and Parana, the use of ORS is limited in providing an accurate summer crop monitoring. While cloud cover is an intrinsic challenge for agricultural monitoring of some crops, the combination of multi-sensors (e.g. microwave and optical sensors) and CubeSats can improve the earth observation frequency and help to work around this limitation, thus enabling a better time series analysis.

AB  - The author is aware of the importance of intelligent thinking and will, for the experience of values and spirituality. But what this work is concerned with will not be about these potentials of the human being, but with the sensitivity and feelings that have frequently tended to be underestimated, although there has also been, in recent decades, a rediscovery of their importance by of both scientific and philosophical psychological research. The main objectives of this work can be summarized in three: a) To provide an answer to the question about what is understood by spirituality, both within the framework of a religious worldview, as well as an atheist one; b) Show the growing psychological interest regarding spirituality; and c) Offer testimonies of experiences of spirituality in illustrious personalities -mainly scientific- linked to different worldviews and different personality styles.

TI  - Applying Multi-Index Approach from Sentinel-2 Imagery to Extract Urban Areas in Dry Season (Semi-Arid Land in North East Algeria)
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of urban areas mostly presents a big difficulty, particularly, in arid and semi-arid environments. For that reason, in this research, we expect to increase built up accuracy mapping for Bordj Bou Arreridj city in semi-arid regions (North-East Algeria) by focusing on the identification of appropriate combination of the remotely sensed spectral indices. The study applies the 'k-means' classifier. In this regard, four spectral indexes were selected, namely normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) for built-up, and both bare soil index (BSI) and dry bare-soil index (DBSI), which are related to bare soil, as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NOVI). All previous spectral indices mentioned were derived from Sentinel-2 data acquired during the dry season. Two combinations of them were generated using layer stack process, keeping both of NDTI and NDVI index constant in both combinations so that the multi-index NDTI/BSI/NDVI was the first single dataset combination, and the multi-index NDTI/DBSI/NDVI as the second component. The results show that BSI index works better with WTI index compared to the use of DBSI index. Therefore, BSI index provides improvements: bare soil classes and builtup were better discriminated, where the overall accuracy increased by 5.67% and the kappa coefficient increased by 12.05%. The use of k-means as unsupervised classifier provides an automatic and a rapid urban area detection. Therefore, the multi-index dataset NDTI/BSI/NDVI was suitable for mapping the cities in dry climate, and could provide a better urban management and future remote sensing applications in semi-arid areas particularly.

T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an exploration of tribal spirituality in India. The study sought to understand the spiritual worldview of tribal communities in India within the context of a community engagement program between a university in India and a tribal community outside Mumbai. The purpose of the engagement was for students and academics to have a deeper understanding of tribal communities, and to formulate community development interventions that could improve their individual and family well-being. A qualitative research approach was utilized to guide the study. The data was collected from two samples, namely, six social work academics and 23 students. Semi structured interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect data from these aforementioned samples following a two-year immersion within this community. The data was analyzed as one dataset using thematic analysis. Three broad themes emerged from the data which focused on the characteristics of tribal communities, tribal spirituality and the healing methodologies used.

TI  - Thicknesses of lava flows in satellite images: Comparison of layered mare units with terrestrial analogs
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in satellite imaging technology have greatly improved our observations of planetary surfaces. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) records images with resolutions on average of 0.5 m per pixel, resolving meter scale features on the surface of the Moon. NAC images have revealed layered deposits, interpreted to be sequences of mare basalt flows, in the walls of impact craters on the lunar nearside. However, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of surface processes from morphologies of features that are close to the limits of detectability. Our goal is to quantify where that limit is for lava flow stratigraphy.Here we report on a terrestrial analog study conduced to better constrain limitations in the measurements of thicknesses of lava flows observed in high-resolution satellite-collected images. Using WorldView-2 satellite images, we mapped layered basalt flows at three sites in the Wai'anae and Ko'olau Ranges of O'ahu, Hawai'i. Fieldwork conducted at these sites allowed for assessment of the accuracy of image interpretations. We found that flow thickness estimates made using WorldView-2 images overestimated thicknesses of individual lava flows measured in the field at all eight locations visited by a factor of 1.2 to 3.5. A primary reason for this overestimation by remote sensing analysis is that many outcropping "layers" within a transect contain more than one individual flow, a distinction that is not visible in satellite images. However, the mean thickness of the layers seen in the orbital data was 0.8 to 1.7 times the outcrop thickness measured in the field, suggesting that the remote measurements should be considered estimates of the outcrop thickness rather than the thickness of individual lava flows.Measurements of layered lunar mare lava units in LRO NAC images provided layer thicknesses that ranged from <1-6 times greater than those derived from images of the O'ahu study sites. It is reasonable to expect that many lunar outcrops similarly contain more than one individual flow and display similar outcropping patterns. This suggests that many current estimates of layer thicknesses derived by comparable methods actually correspond to outcrop thicknesses. Current interpretations of lava flow thicknesses derived from planetary images should be considered maximums for individual flow thicknesses with uncertainties that may be as high as a factor of 3 or more.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of available Earth observation data has increased dramatically in recent years. Efficiently making use of the entire body of information is a current challenge in remote sensing; it demands lightweight problemagnostic models that do not require region- or problem-specific expert knowledge. End-to-end trained deep learning models can make use of raw sensory data by learning feature extraction and classification in one step, solely from data. Still, many methods proposed in remote sensing research require implicit feature extraction through data preprocessing or explicit design of features.In this work, we compare recent deep learning models on crop type classification on raw and preprocessed Sentinel 2 data. We concentrate on the common neural network architectures for time series, i.e., 1D-convolutions, recurrence, and the novel self-attention architecture. Our central findings are that data preprocessing still increased the overall classification performance for all models while the choice of model was less crucial. Self-attention and recurrent neural networks, by their architecture, outperformed convolutional neural networks on raw satellite time series. We explore this by a feature importance analysis based on gradient backpropagation that exploits the differentiable nature of deep learning models. Further, we qualitatively show how self-attention scores focus selectively on a few classification-relevant observations.

TI  - Spatial variability of aerosols over Greek archaeological sites using Space-Borne Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty-one archaeological sites in Greece were selected to study their exposure to particulate pollution, in terms of aerosol loading and chemical type, to infer on the potential impact on the structural mate rials (specifically stone) of the monuments, using Space-Borne Remote Sensing instruments, MODIS and CALIPSO. The analysis revealed three geographical distributed clusters, with higher loads in the northern Greece, slightly lower values in the south-east corner of Greece and finally the lower values over an area that transverses Greece from its NW to its SE corners, with differences spanning from 15 to 20%. The most dominant aerosol types in terms of occurrence were polluted dust (38%) followed by dust (28%), together accounting for on average 66% of the time, while the sites located on islands showed increased exposure to clean marine aerosol (in the order of 25%). Polluted continental aerosol increased over continental areas at the north and west parts of Greece, while smoke contribution was as high as 35% in specific sites. Three distinct seasonal patterns were also revealed with respect to aerosol loadings, a summer maximum cycle in the north part of Greece, a spring maximum along an arc-like path from the west coastline towards the southern parts of Greece and a spring and summer plateau in different parts of the Greek territory. During the last decade, an important decrease in aerosol levels was observed (on average 15 +/- 6% per decade), attributed to effective controlling and mitigating measures in Europe. In conclusion, the exposure of antiquities to aerosols in Greece, varies in time, seasonal intensification and chemical type, thus continuous monitoring of particulate pollution over cultural heritage (CH) sites is imperative to support the selection and design of appropriate measures in the field of preventive conservation of monuments, in order to mitigate corrosion and avoid further damage.

T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews the most important information fusion data-driven algorithms based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques for problems in Earth observation. Nowadays we observe and model the Earth with a wealth of observations, from a plethora of different sensors, measuring states, fluxes, processes and variables, at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Earth observation is well equipped with remote sensing systems, mounted on satellites and airborne platforms, but it also involves in-situ observations, numerical models and social media data streams, among other data sources. Data-driven approaches, and ML techniques in particular, are the natural choice to extract significant information from this data deluge. This paper produces a thorough review of the latest work on information fusion for Earth observation, with a practical intention, not only focusing on describing the most relevant previous works in the field, but also the most important Earth observation applications where ML information fusion has obtained significant results. We also review some of the most currently used data sets, models and sources for Earth observation problems, describing their importance and how to obtain the data when needed. Finally, we illustrate the application of ML data fusion with a representative set of case studies, as well as we discuss and outlook the near future of the field.

TI  - Estimating Time Since the Last Stand-Replacing Disturbance (TSD) from Spaceborne Simulated GEDI Data: A Feasibility Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stand-level maps of past forest disturbances (expressed as time since disturbance, TSD) are needed to model forest ecosystem processes, but the conventional approaches based on remotely sensed satellite data can only extend as far back as the first available satellite observations. Stand-level analysis of airborne LiDAR data has been demonstrated to accurately estimate long-term TSD (similar to 100 years), but large-scale coverage of airborne LiDAR remains costly. NASA's spaceborne LiDAR Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument, launched in December 2018, is providing billions of measurements of tropical and temperate forest canopies around the globe. GEDI is a spatial sampling instrument and, as such, does not provide wall-to-wall data. GEDI's lasers illuminate ground footprints, which are separated by similar to 600 m across-track and similar to 60 m along-track, so new approaches are needed to generate wall-to-wall maps from the discrete measurements. In this paper, we studied the feasibility of a data fusion approach between GEDI and Landsat for wall-to-wall mapping of TSD. We tested the methodology on a similar to 52,500-ha area located in central Idaho (USA), where an extensive record of stand-replacing disturbances is available, starting in 1870. GEDI data were simulated over the nominal two-year planned mission lifetime from airborne LiDAR data and used for TSD estimation using a random forest (RF) classifier. Image segmentation was performed on Landsat-8 data, obtaining image-objects representing forest stands needed for the spatial extrapolation of estimated TSD from the discrete GEDI locations. We quantified the influence of (1) the forest stand map delineation, (2) the sample size of the training dataset, and (3) the number of GEDI footprints per stand on the accuracy of estimated TSD. The results show that GEDI-Landsat data fusion would allow for TSD estimation in stands covering similar to 95% of the study area, having the potential to reconstruct the long-term disturbance history of temperate even-aged forests with accuracy (median root mean square deviation = 22.14 years, median BIAS = 1.70 years, 60.13% of stands classified within 10 years of the reference disturbance date) comparable to the results obtained in the same study area with airborne LiDAR.

TI  - Selecting Relevant Biological Variables Derived from Sentinel-2 Data for Mapping Changes from Grassland to Arable Land Using Random Forest Classifier
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Permanent grassland is one of the monitored categories of land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) within the climate concept and greenhouse gas reduction policy (Regulation (EU) 2018/841). Mapping the conditions and changes of permanent grasslands is thus very important. The area of permanent grassland is strongly influenced by agricultural subsidy policies. Over the course of history, it is possible to trace different shares of permanent grassland within agricultural land and areas with significant changes from grassland to arable land. The need for monitoring permanent grassland and arable land has been growing in recent years. New subsidy policies determining farm management are beginning to affect land use, especially in countries that have joined the EU in recent waves. The large amount of freely available satellite data enables this monitoring to take place, mainly owing to data products of the Copernicus program. There are a large number of parameters (predictors) that can be calculated from satellite data, but finding the right combination is very difficult. This study presents a methodical, systematic procedure using the random forest classifier and its internal metric of mean decrease accuracy (MDA) to select the most suitable predictors to detect changes from permanent grassland to arable land. The relevance of suitable predictors takes into account the date of the satellite image, the overall accuracy of change detection, and the time required for calculations. Biological predictors, such as leaf area index (LAI), fraction absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), etc. were tested in the form of a time series from the Sentinel-2 satellite, and the most suitable ones were selected. FAPAR, canopy water content (CWC), and LAI seemed to be the most suitable. The proposed change detection procedure achieved a very high accuracy of more than 95% within the study site with an area of 8766 km(2).

TI  - Tropical Monsoon Forest Thermodynamics Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses thermodynamic variables that characterize the energy balance and structure of the solar energy transformation by the ecosystems of deciduous tropical forests. By analyzing the seasonal dynamics of these variables, two main states of the thermodynamic system are determined: the end of the drought season and the end of the wet season. Two sub-systems of solar energy transformation are also defined: a balance system that is responsible for the moisture transportation between the ecosystem and atmosphere; and a structural bioproductional system responsible for biological productivity. Several types of thermodynamic systems are determined based on the ratio between the invariants of the variables. They match the main classes of the landscape cover. A seasonal change of thermodynamic variables for different types of thermodynamic systems is additionally studied. The study reveals that temperature above the forest ecosystems is about 4 degrees lower than above the open areas during most of the year.

TI  - Effectiveness of air pollution standards in reducing mortality in India
T2  - RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - India experiences some of the highest air pollution levels globally, with 13 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world. In this paper, we estimate the relationship between air pollution policies in India and mortality for people of all ages and all causes. We estimate the relationship between mortality and two major air pollution regulations, the Supreme Court Action Plan (SCAP) and the Catalytic Converter (CC) policy. Although data for mortality in India have improved over time, the annual average mortality for many districts is volatile, with many outliers and missing values. After addressing these measurement issues in a difference-in-differences setup, we do not find evidence that the policies were effective in significantly reducing mortality. In an effort to understand the potential benefits of reducing pollution levels in India, we investigate the association of different pollution types with mortality. This analysis relies upon relatively recent satellite data on PM2.5 levels in India. We examine this relationship for India for the first time, using a fixed effects model in an attempt to address issues of endogeneity and measurement error. We find that PM2.5 levels are positively associated with mortality, with a 10% increase in pollution conditionally associated with a 2.0% increase in the mortality rate. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Axillary staging based on molecular analysis: Results of the B-CLOSER-II study
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Axillary staging (pN) is a strong predictor of outcome in early stage breast cancer yet following the publication of the Z0011 trial there has been an increasing tendency to spare lymph node dissection. Automated molecular detection of cytokeratin 19mRNA by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) has been demon-strated to be an accurate method to assess sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. In this study we compare histological and molecular methods following complete axillary lymph node dissection (cALND), determine whether molecular axillary staging affects survival, and evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of total tumor load in ALND (AD-TTL) and in all positive nodes (G-TTL).Material and methods: Axillary lymph nodes were collected from 102 patients with primary breast cancer with histological confirmation of axillary involvement (cN+) or positive SLN. The central 1-mm portion of each nonSLN was processed for hematoxylin-eosin staining and the remaining tissue was analyzed by OSNA.Results: Non-SLNs were diagnosed as positive in 72 out of 102 patients (70.6 %) on OSNA compared with only 53 (52 %) on histology (p < 0.01). Thirteen patients would have changed staging if the diagnoses provided had been by molecular methods (p < 0.01), but without a change in prognosis. AD-TTL and G-TTL were predictive of recurrence and mortality.Conclusions: Compared to molecular detection, histological examination significantly underestimates the frequency of axillary node metastases. However, the increase in pN did not show a clinical effect on survival in those patients.

TI  - Comparison of Post-fire Patterns in Brazilian Savanna and Tropical Forest from Remote Sensing Time Series
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of fire-related changes is essential to understand vegetation dynamics in the medium and long term. Remote sensing time series allows estimating biophysical variables of terrestrial vegetation and interference by extreme fires. This research evaluated fire recurrence in the Amazon and Cerrado regions, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo time series, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), gross primary productivity (GPP), and surface temperature. The annual aggregated time series (AAT) method recognized each pixel's slope trend in the 2001-2016 period and its statistical significance. A comparison of time trends of EVI, GPP, and surface temperature with total fire recurrence indicates that time trends in vegetation are highly affected by high fire recurrence scenarios (R-2 between 0.52 and 0.90). The fire recurrence and the albedo's persistent changes do not have a consistent relationship. Areas with the biggest evaluated changes may increase up to 0.25 Kelvin/Year at surface temperature and decrease up to -0.012 EVI/year in vegetation index. Although savannas are resistant to low severity fires, fire regime and forest structure changes tend to make vegetation more vulnerable to wildfires, reducing their regeneration capacity. In the Amazon area, protection of forests in conservation units and indigenous lands helped in the low occurrence of fires in these sensitive areas, resulting in positive vegetation index trends.

TI  - Assessing VIIRS capabilities to improve burned area mapping over the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coarse spatial resolution of remote sensing imagery still hampers a comprehensive representation of long-term fire patterns at the regional level, in particular in areas characterized by small and sparse fire scars. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor launched in 2011 upgrades the spatial resolution (375 m) and gives continuity to the Earth long-term monitoring initiated by Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Therefore, aiming to assess VIIRS 375 m imagery capabilities to improve the accuracy and reliability of fire scars mapping over the Brazilian Cerrado, we developed a burned area detection algorithm (VIIRS-SVM) based on machine learning techniques. For this purpose, the (V, W) burnt index adjusted to VIIRS near-infrared and middle-infrared channels and the One-Class Support Vector Machine algorithm were used for burned area identification. The VIIRS-SVM algorithm was applied over the Brazilian Cerrado and evaluated against reference scars from 15 Landsat-8 scenes during the fire season of 2015, covering a large area with substantial variability in terms of fire scars characteristics. We also performed a comparison with the MCD64A1 collection-6 product over the validation sites. Relying on VIIRS 375 m imagery, the VIIRS-SVM algorithm allows an enhancement of 25% in discrimination of small and medium fire scars (25 to 1000 ha), when compared to the MODIS-derived product. Results have demonstrated that the enhancement of medium and small fire scars mapping over the Cerrado is possible using VIIRS sensor capabilities.

TI  - Population study of orofacial injuries in adult family violence homicides in Victoria, Australia
T2  - FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study describes the prevalence and orofacial injury patterns associated with adult family violence (FV) homicides in Victoria, Australia. It follows a methods study for case selection of all FV homicides and injury measurement. Comprehensive analysis of orofacial injuries in FV homicides and their clinico-demographic context will inform future research on clinical FV indicators and sentinel injuries, and potentially lead to premorbid intervention in health services.Methods: All closed cases of FV homicides aged >18 years, January 2006 to December 2018, were identified by screening Victorian fatal assaults, based on victim-offender relationship. Primary data such as post-mortem computed tomography scans and photographs were assessed. Socio-demographic, clinical, interpersonal and incident parameters were descriptively analysed and statistically compared across FV homicides with and without facial injuries using cluster analysis and nonparametric tests.Results: Of 170 adult homicides screened for eligibility, 151 were included for final analysis. Over the 12-year period, 78.1% of all Victorian adult FV homicides had orofacial injuries. Significant cluster patterns of injury mechanism, victim-offender relationship and drug/alcohol impairment were identified in all homicides. Non-facial injuries were significantly higher in facial vs. non-facial injury homicides. Facial abrasion and incised wounds were the most common injury types.Conclusions: This is the first forensic-epidemiologic study evaluating the empirical evidence concerning orofacial injuries associated with population-wide adult Victorian FV homicides. The high level of orofacial injuries in this population during the study period may inform clinical practice and policy in FV intervention in Victoria and globally. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Model Selection in Atmospheric Remote Sensing with Application to Aerosol Retrieval from DSCOVR/EPIC. Part 2: Numerical Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for retrieving aerosol parameters by taking into account the uncertainty in aerosol model selection is applied to the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness and aerosol layer height from synthetic measurements from the EPIC sensor onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory. The synthetic measurements are generated using aerosol models derived from AERONET measurements at different sites, while other commonly used aerosol models, such as OPAC, GOCART, OMI, and MODIS databases are used in the retrieval. The numerical analysis is focused on the estimation of retrieval errors when the true aerosol model is unknown. We found that the best aerosol model is the one with a value of the asymmetry parameter and an angular variation of the phase function around the viewing direction that is close to the values corresponding to the reference aerosol model.

T2  - PROGRES EN UROLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. - To update French oncology guidelines concerning penile cancer.Methods. - Comprehensive Medline search between 2018 and 2020 upon diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of testicular germ cell cancer to update previous guidelines. Level of evidence was evaluated according to AGREE-II.Results. - Epidermoid carcinoma is the most common penile cancer histology. Physical examination is mandatory to define local and inguinal nodal cancer stage. MRI with artificial erection can help to assess deep infiltration in cases of organsparing intention. Node negative patients (defined by palpation and imaging) will present micro nodal metastases in up to 25% of cases. Invasive lymph node assessment is thus advocated except for low risk patients. Sentinel node dynamic biopsy is the first line technique. Modified bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy is an option with higher morbidity. 18-FDG-PET is recommended in patients with palpable nodes. Chest, abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography is an option. Fine needle aspiration (when positive) is an easy way to assess inguinal palpable node pathological involvement. Its results determine the type of lymphadenectomy to be performed (for diagnostic or curative purposes). Treatment is mostly surgical. Free margins status is essential, but it also has to be organ-sparing when possible. Brachytherapy and topic agents can cure in selected cases. Lymph node assessment should be synchronous to the removal of the tumour when possible. Limited inguinal lymph node involvement (pN1 stage) can be cured with the only lymphadenectomy. In case of larger lymph node stage, one should consider multidisciplinary treatment including chemotherapy and inclusion in a trial.Conclusions. - Penile cancer needs demanding surgery to be cured, surrounded by chemotherapy in node positive patients. Lymph nodes involvement is a major prognostic factor. Thus, inguinal node assessment cannot be neglected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Why Causal Mechanisms and Process Tracing Should Alter Case Selection Guidance
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Advice on case selection in small-N research emphasizes controlling for confounding variables to facilitate inferential tests of a cross-case pattern. Yet many researchers embrace the "mechanismic worldview" and aim to construct explanations. Explanations differ from inferences because one explains an outcome at the individual case level. Hence, explanatory case studies are not simultaneously inferential tests, rendering prevailing case selection guidance ill fitting. This article provides an alternative outlook on case studies and case selection. It conceives of case studies as things that engage an analytical ideal type. Researchers can construct case-specific explanations by coupling the general claims of an ideal type with contextual analysis. In terms of case selection, if a case has contextual features that make it relatable to an ideal type, one can viably study that case in relation to the ideal type, regardless of the case's other characteristics. This criterion diverges sharply from the conventional wisdom on case selection and can embolden unconventional comparisons.

TI  - Development of sentinel lymph node biopsy technique in patients with salivary gland cancer using the IDEAL framework
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Salivary cancer is rare and comprises a variety of histological subtypes and clinical behaviors. There is no agreed method of estimating the risk of occult metastasis or managing the clinically NO neck.Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) may offer a solution but previous studies have not produced a reliable imaging protocol. This study uses novel technology and trial methodology to develop a reliable SNB technique, with primary aim to identify peri-and intraglandular sentinel nodes.Methods: IDEAL framework was used to undertake SNB in clinically node negative salivary gland cancer. Patients with cT1-2 NO salivary cancer were eligible. Lymphoscintigraphy was undertaken using Tc-99 m labelled nanocoll. Injection technique as well as adjunctive use of freehand SPECT (fhSPECT), nearinfrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging, and navigation-guided surgery were used and optimisied during the study protocol.Results: 10 patients were recruited. Initial protocol of peritumoural injection of Tc99 m nanocoll showed poor image resolution. Subsequent adjustment to single intratumoural injection allowed identification of intraglandular sentinel nodes. Fh/SPECT and NIR fluorescence imaging found intraglandular lymph nodes otherwise not recognizable to the naked eye. In two cases occult lymph node metastasis were identified.Conclusion: This study has shown the IDEAL framework is vital in allowing iterative changes in surgical protocol in the light of experience. This study has produced a reliable method for detection of sentinel nodes, in particular the ability to identify intra- and periglandular nodes with diagnosis of occult metastatic deposits and no false negative results. Our protocol can be readily transferred in to larger scale studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd, BASO - The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Towards mapping the diversity of canopy structure from space with GEDI
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant biodiversity supports life on Earth and provides a range of important ecosystem services, but is under severe pressure by global change. Structural diversity plays a crucial role for carbon, water and energy cycles and animal habitats. However, it is very difficult to map and monitor over large areas, limiting our ability to assess the status of biodiversity and predict change. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provides a new opportunity to measure 3D plant canopy structure of the world's temperate, Mediterranean and tropical ecosystems, but its potential to map structural diversity is not yet tested. Here, we use wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) to simulate GEDI data (GEDI(sim)) over 7380 km(2) in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains in California and evaluate how well GEDI's sampling scheme captures patterns of structural diversity. We evaluate functional richness and functional beta diversity in a biodiversity hot spot. GEDI(sim) performed well for trait retrievals (r(2) = 0.68) and functional richness mapping (r(2) = 0.75) compared to ALS retrievals, despite lower correlations in complex terrain with steep slopes. Functional richness patterns were strongly associated with soil organic carbon stocks and density as well as variables related to water availability and could be appropriately mapped by GEDI(sim) with and without cloud cover. Functional beta diversity was more strongly related to local changes in topography and more challenging to map, especially with decreasing sampling density. The reduced number of GEDI(sim) shots when simulating cloud cover lead to a strong overestimation of beta diversity and a reduction of r(2) from 0.64 to 0.40 compared to ALS. The ability to map functional richness has been demonstrated with potential application at continental scales that could be transformative for our understanding of large-scale patterns of plant canopy structure, diversity and potential links to animal diversity, movement and habitats.

TI  - Integration of a 31-Gene Expression Profile Into Clinical Decision-Making in the Treatment of Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The practice of utilizing gene expression profile (GEP) for the evaluation and treatment of cutaneous melanomas has been found to predict the risk of sentinel-node metastasis and recurrence. Information obtained from this assay has been used to determine clinical decision-making, including serving as an indication for sentinel lymph node biopsy and also for the intensity of screening measures. Methods Herein we present our early experience in utilizing 31-GEP in intermediate melanomas and its effect on clinical management. A retrospective review was conducted of patients who had undergone treatment for melanoma whose tumors had been subjected to 31-GEP. Additionally, patient characteristics, attributes of the original tumor biopsied, findings on final pathology, and procedures performed were evaluated. Results 31-GEP stratified patients into 4 groups; groups 1A and 1B are considered low risk of metastasis or recurrence, while 2A and 2B are considered high risk. Over the study period, 31-GEP was conducted on 26 cutaneous melanoma patients. Testing and treatment data are available for 23 of these patients. Eleven patients were found to be low risk (9 as 1A, 2 as 1B), 12 were found to be high risk (4 as 2A, 8 as 2B). Decision-making was altered such that sentinel lymph node biopsy was omitted in 2 cases in which the patients were found to be low risk with age >65 years. Discussion In 8 cases of node-negative disease in genetically high-risk patients, surveillance measures were augmented with positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Utilization of 31-GEP is ongoing at our institution.

TI  - Advances in the Monitoring of Algal Blooms by Remote Sensing: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Since remote sensing of ocean colour began in 1978, several ocean-colour sensors have been launched to measure ocean properties. These measures have been applied to study water quality, and they specifically can be used to study algal blooms. Blooms are a natural phenomenon that, due to anthropogenic activities, appear to have increased in frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution. This paper aims to provide a systematic analysis of research on remote sensing of algal blooms during 1999-2019 via bibliometric technique. This study aims to reveal the limitations of current studies to analyse climatic variability effect. A total of 1292 peer-reviewed articles published between January 1999 and December 2019 were collected. We read all the literature individually to build a database. The number of publications increased since 2004 and reached the maximum value of 128 in 2014. The publications originated from 47 countries, but the number of papers published from the top 10 countries accounted for 77% of the total publications. To be able to distinguish between climate variability and changes of anthropogenic origin for a specific variable is necessary to define the baseline. However, long-term monitoring programs of phytoplankton are very scarce; only 1% of the articles included in this study analysed at least three decades and most of the existing algal blooms studies are based on sporadic sampling and short-term research programs.

TI  - Remote and Vis-NIR spectra sensing potential for soil salinization estimation in the eastern coast of Urmia hyper saline lake, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is an important threat for agriculture and environment in the eastern coast of Urmia hyper saline Lake, a lake in the western part of Iran. Predicting soil salinization requires rapid and low-cost measurement tools of soil salinity. It is hypothesized that remote sensing and visible near-infrared spectroscopy may offer a feasible method for that purpose. To test this hypothesis, 96 soil samples were collected using Latin hypercube sampling method. Soil salinity (ECe) and spectral reflectance at various bands were measured in all samples in the laboratory. The spectral indices derived from Landsat OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI and visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy data, as input variables, along with partial least squares regression (PLSR) method were used for predicting contents soil salt. The results revealed that the PLSR derived regression models of the spectral indices accounted for 42.7 and 45.3% of the soil salinity variation by Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data, respectively. And PLSR derived model using Vis-NIR spectroscopy data explained 59.4% of the variation in soil salt contents. Compared to derived models using Vis-NIR spectroscopy, Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data, the derived PLSR models (which were developed as a result of integrating Vis-NIR spectroscopy and remote sensing data) increased the power of soil salinity prediction Finally, the combined of Vis-NIR spectroscopy + Sentinel-2 MSI data was found to provide the best input data for the derived regression model to estimate soil salt contents (R-2 = 0.713 and RMSE = 21.76 dS m(-1)).

TI  - Quantifying the impact of industrialization on blue carbon storage in the coastal area of Metropolitan Semarang, Indonesia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the impact of the coastal industrialization policy which began in 2015 in Indonesia. Because this policy has effected physical change on the environment, it requires quantification to determine its driving factors, and to formulate solutions to its problems. In doing so, this research used remote sensing and machine learning techniques. Satellite data from Sentinel-2A were acquired for the years 2015 and 2019 for LULC model, and Landsat 8 OLI for industrial growth model in coastal area. The data were processed using QGIS 3.8 software with machine learning techniques, the Random Forest algorithm, and sci-kit learn library from Dzetsaka tools. The results showed that changes in land use and land cover areas significantly contributed to the loss of blue carbon storage of more than 20%. This finding confirms that the industrialization policy on the coastal area needs to be reviewed, and land use monitoring must be more strictly regulated.

TI  - Genomic and Resistance Epidemiology of Gram-Negative Bacteria in Africa: a Systematic Review and Phylogenomic Analyses from a One Health Perspective
T2  - MSYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Antibiotic resistance (AR) remains a major threat to public and animal health globally. However, AR ramifications in developing countries are worsened by limited molecular diagnostics, expensive therapeutics, inadequate numbers of skilled clinicians and scientists, and unsanitary environments. The epidemiology of Gramnegative bacteria, their AR genes, and geographical distribution in Africa are described here. Data were extracted and analyzed from English-language articles published between 2015 and December 2019. The genomes and AR genes of the various species, obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) and NCBI were analyzed phylogenetically using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) and annotated with Figtree. The geographic location of resistant clones/clades was mapped manually. Thirty species from 31 countries and 24 genera from 41 countries were analyzed from 146 articles and 3,028 genomes, respectively. Genes mediating resistance to beta-lactams (including bla(TEM-1), bla(CTX-M), bla(NDM), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), and bla(OXA)(-48/181)), fluoroquinolones (oqxAB, qnrA/B/D/S, gyrA/B, and parCE mutations, etc.), aminoglycosides (including armA and rmtC/F), sulfonamides (sul1/2/3), trimethoprim (dfrA), tetracycline (ter(A/B/C/D/G/O/M/39)], colistin (rncr-1), phenicols (catA/B, crnIA), and fosfomycin (fosA) were mostly found in Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and also in Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coil, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter baumannii, etc., on mostly IncF-type, IncX(3/4), CoIRNAI, and IncR plasmids, within lnt/1 gene cassettes, insertion sequences, and transposons. Clonal and multiclonal outbreaks and dissemination of resistance genes across species and countries and between humans, animals, plants, and the environment were observed; Escherichia coil ST103, K. pneumoniae ST101, S. enterica ST1/2, and Vibrio cholerae ST69/515 were common strains. Most pathogens were of human origin, and zoonotic transmissions were relatively limited.IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the major public health threats and challenges to effective containment and treatment of infectious bacterial diseases worldwide. Here, we used different methods to map out the geographical hot spots, sources, and evolutionary epidemiology of AR. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Neisseria meningitis/gonorrhoeae, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, etc., were common pathogens shuttling AR genes in Africa. Transmission of the same clones/strains across countries and between animals, humans, plants, and the environment was observed. We recommend Enterobacter spp. or K. pneumoniae as better sentinel species for AR surveillance.

TI  - Detection of banana plants and their major diseases through aerial images and machine learning methods: A case study in DR Congo and Republic of Benin
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Front-line remote sensing tools, coupled with machine learning (ML), have a significant role in crop monitoring and disease surveillance. Crop type classification and a disease early warning system are some of these remote sensing applications that provide precise, timely, and cost-effective information at different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. To our knowledge, most disease surveillance systems focus on a single-sensor based solutions and lagging the integration of multiple information sources. Moreover, monitoring larger landscapes using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are challenging, and, therefore combining high resolution satellite imagery data with advanced machine learning (ML) models through the use of mobile apps could help detect and classify banana plants and provide more information on its overall health status. In this study, we classified banana under mixed-complex African landscapes through pixel-based classifications and ML models derived from multi-level satellite images (Sentinel 2, PlanetScope and WorldView-2) and UAV (MicaSense RedEdge) platforms. Our pixel-based classification from random forest (RF) model using combined features of vegetation indices (VIs) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed up to 97% overall accuracy (OA) with less than 10% omission and commission errors (OE and CE) and Kappa coefficient of 0.96 in high resolution multispectral images. We used UAV-RGB aerial images from DR Congo and Republic of Benin fields to develop a mixed-model system combining object detection model (RetinaNet) and a custom classifier for simultaneous banana localization and disease classification. Their accuracies were tested using different performance metrics. Our UAV-RGB mixed-model revealed that the developed object detection and classification model successfully classified healthy and diseased plants with 99.4%, 92.8%, 93.3% and 90.8% accuracy for the four classes: banana bunchy top disease (BBTD), Xanthomonas Wilt of Banana (BXW), healthy banana cluster and individual banana plants, respectively. These approaches of aerial image-based ML models have high potential to provide a decision support system for major banana diseases in Africa.

TI  - Spatial forecasting of solar radiation using ARIMA model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is an attempt to forecast monthly solar radiation using remote sensing data on a region. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models are used for simulating and forecasting time series of insolation data from NASA's POWER (Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources) data archive. Remotely sensed modelled insolation data for 34 years (i.e. January 1984 to December 2017) has been retrieved and analysed for forecasting. Monthly average insolation forecasts of the region around India's capital Delhi have been generated for next four years (i.e. January 2018 to December 2021) and presented in the form of contours obtained using marching square algorithm. The overall accuracy of forecasts in terms of R-2 (0.9293), Root Mean Square Error (0.3529), Mean Absolute Error (0.2659) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (6.556) was obtained. The ARIMA model forecasted the maximum insolation values in the months of May (6.52-6.76 KwH/m(2)/day in year 2018, 6.56-6.8 KwH/m(2)/day in 2019, 6.6-6.8 KwH/m(2)/day in 2020 and 6.6-6.84 KwH/m(2)/day in 2021) and Minimum in the months of January and December (3.2-3.7 KwH/m(2)/day in January 2018, 3.28-3.52 KwH/m(2)/day in December 2018). Insolation contours were analysed for identification of potential regions receiving maximum insolation as well as high average annual values of insolation for implementing efficient solar power generation projects. Parts of Haryana and Rajasthan region in study area were found most suitable for such projects.

TI  - Automatic silage maize detection based on phenological rules using Sentinel-2 time-series dataset
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, availability of valuable high spatial and temporal resolution optical satellite imagery such as Sentinel-2 has provided a great opportunity for a wide variety of crop-related studies including crop phenology detection, crop biophysical and biochemical parameter estimation, and crop-type mapping. Most current crop mapping methods focus on supervised classification, demanding a large number of field sampling points to feed the classifier. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for silage maize mapping based on Sentinel-2 time-series data in three agricultural areas in Iran (namely Marvdasht, Abyek, and Mashhad) and an individual area in USA (Tulare County, California). We considered Marvdasht as the training site and other three sites as the test sites. After the preprocessing step, temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were computed from Sentinel-2 time-series images in 2017 and 2018. Then, the Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to the NDVI profile for noise reduction. Linear interpolation was also used for the construction of continuous NDVI time-series during the maize growing season. Then, phenological parameters were extracted in Marvdasht, for maize and other crops. After comprehensive analyses, the ratio of the slope from the peak of the greenness to the harvest (SPGH) to the length of the growing season (LOS) was suggested as an appropriate variable for automatic maize detection. Evaluation of this variable in the study sites confirmed its feasibility for automatic maize mapping, with the kappa coefficient values of 0.89, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.8 in Abyek, Marvdasht, Mashhad, and Tulare in 2017, respectively. The performance of the suggested method for the second year (2018) is close to those of 2017 which means that maize detection algorithm results are consistent and robust across years. Moreover, to ascertain high potential of the proposed variable, the results were compared with those of the maximum likelihood (ML) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in the test sites. The performance of SVM (with a large number of training samples) was analogous to that of the suggested automatic method in terms of accuracy; however, inferior performance of ML was evident. The results of this research demonstrated the great potential of our proposed phenological method in automatic silage maize mapping.

TI  - Axillary Clearance Following Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Symptomatic Breast Cancer
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Symptomatic cancers display a different biological behaviour from screen-detected cancers, which may impact the management of axillary metastases. We aimed to determine the role of unselected axillary nodal clearance (ANC) in symptomatic patients with positive sentinel node biopsies (SNBs). Patients and Methods: A case-note review was performed on 95 symptomatic breast cancer patients who underwent ANC following positive SNB. Results: Thirty-eight (40%) patients were treated with a mastectomy and 57 (60%) with breast-conserving surgery. At ANC, 25 patients (26.3%) showed evidence of further lymph node metastases, with 15 (60%) having two or fewer macrometastases. The presence of more than 2 SNB macrometastases was associated with further ANC metastases (p<0.001). The presence of further metastases at ANC was not associated with either reduced overall survival or disease-free survival. Conclusion: A number of symptomatic breast cancer patients with positive SNBs may be overtreated. Ongoing trials examining the management of low volume SNB macrometastases need to consider the symptomatic subgroup in their conclusions.

TI  - Multisource land-cover data category accuracy evaluation and the difference of landscape patterns: A case study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data of land cover is the basic information for large-scale landscape pattern research. Land-cover data from different research teams adopt different data sources and classification methods, which leads to inconsistent results of landscape pattern research. Quantitative analysis of the consistency of land-cover data and its impacts on landscape pattern research is of great significance. Here, with two sets of global scale 30-m resolution land-cover remote sensing data GlobeLand30 and FROM-GLC as the research objects, we compared their differences in soil and water conservation areas in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region from two aspects of land-cover type and landscape pattern index. The results showed that: (1) In the mountainous and hilly water conservation and soil conservation region in the eastern part of Taihang Mountains, the agreement in area size between the two datasets was the highest, with a consistency value of 96.8%. By contrast, the consistency was the lowest in the mountainous and hilly sand control and water conservation region in the northwestern Taihang Mountains, with a value of 3.6%; (2) The spatial consistency of those two datasets in the Jin-Yi-Lu Bohai Bay ecological maintenance area was the highest, with a spatial consistency value of 73.6%. In the mountainous and hilly area of the northwestern Taihang Mountains, the spatial consistency of sand control and water conservation area was the lowest, with a value of 25.17%; (3) In terms of landscape pattern, the complexity of GlobeLand30 dataset in the six ecological functional areas of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei was lower than that of the FROM-GLC dataset, indicating that diversity of landscape in GlobeLand30 dataset was lower, and homogeneity of surface landscape categories was stronger, while surface landscape heterogeneity and fragmentation degree of FROM-GLC dataset were stronger.

TI  - Identification and mapping of soybean and maize crops based on Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean and maize are important raw materials for the production of food and livestock feed. Accurate mapping of these two crops is of great significance to crop management, yield estimation, and crop-damage control. In this study, two towns in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, China, were selected as the study area, and Sentinel-2 images were adopted to map the distributions of both crops in the 2019 growing season. The data obtained on August 18 (early pod-setting stage of soybean) was determined to be the most applicable to soybean and maize mapping by means of the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance. Subsequently, three machine-learning algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) were employed and their respective performance in crop identification was evaluated with the aid of 254 ground truth plots. It appeared that RF with a Kappa of 0.83 was superior to the other two methods. Furthermore, twenty candidate features containing the reflectance of ten spectral bands (spatial resolution at 10 m or 20 m) and ten remote-sensing indices were input into the RF algorithm to conduct an important assessment. Seven features were screened out and served as the optimum subset, the mapping results of which were assessed based on the ground truth derived from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images covering six ground samples. The optimum feature-subset achieved high-accuracy crop mapping, with a reduction of data volume by 65% compared with the total twenty features, which also overrode the performance of ten spectral bands. Therefore, feature-optimization had great potential in the identification of the two crops. Generally, the findings of this study can provide a valuable reference for mapping soybean and maize in areas with a fragmented landscape of farmland and complex planting structure.

AB  - The study objective is to contemplate the effectiveness of COVID-19 on the air pollution of Indian territory from January 2020 to April 2020. We have executed data from European Space Agency (ESA) and CPCB online portal for air quality data dissemination. The Sentinel - 5 P satellite images elucidate that the Air quality of Indian territory has been improved significantly during COVID-19. Mumbai and Delhi are one of the most populated cities. These two cities have observed a substantial decrease in Nitrogen Dioxide (40-50%) compared to the same period last year. It suggests that the emergence of COVID-19 has been proved to a necessary evil as being advantageous for mitigating air pollution on Indian territory during the lock-down. The study found a significant decline in Nitrogen Dioxide in reputed states of India, i.e., Delhi and Mumbai. Moreover, a faded track of Nitrogen Dioxide can be seen at the Maritime route in the Indian Ocean. An upsurge in the environmental quality of India will also be beneficial for its neighbor countries, i.e., China, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Automated Mosaicking of Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat frequencies of optical remote sensing satellites have been increasing over the last 40 years, but there is still dependence on clear skies to acquire usable imagery. To increase the quality of data, composited mosaics of satellite imagery can be used. In this paper, we develop an automated method for clearing clouds and producing different types of composited mosaics suitable for use in cloud-affected countries, such as New Zealand. We improve the Tmask algorithm for cloud detection by using a parallax method to produce an initial cloud layer and by using an object-based cloud and shadow approach to remove false cloud detections. We develop several parametric scoring approaches for choosing best-pixel composites with minimal remaining cloud. The automated mosaicking approach produced Sentinel-2 mosaics of New Zealand for five successive summers, 2015/16 through 2019/20, with remaining cloud being less than 0.1%. Contributing satellite overpasses were typically of the order of 100. In comparison, manual methods for cloud clearing produced mosaics with 5% remaining cloud and from satellite overpasses typically of the order of 20. The improvements to cloud clearing enable the use of all possible Sentinel-2 imagery to produce automatic mosaics capable of regular land monitoring, at a reasonable cost.

TI  - Recent Ground Subsidence in the North China Plain, China, Revealed by Sentinel-1A Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater resources have been exploited and utilized on a large scale in the North China Plain (NCP) since the 1970s. As a result of extensive groundwater depletion, the NCP has experienced significant land subsidence, which threatens geological stability and infrastructure health and exacerbates the risks of other geohazards. In this study, we employed multi-track Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets acquired by the Sentinel-1A (S1A) satellite to detect spatial and temporal distributions of surface deformation in the NCP from 2016 to 2018 based on multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). The results show that the overall ground displacement ranged from -165.4 mm/yr (subsidence) to 9.9 mm/yr (uplift) with a standard variance of 28.8 mm/yr. During the InSAR monitoring period, the temporal pattern of land subsidence was dominated by a decreasing tendency and the spatial pattern of land subsidence in the coastal plain exhibited an expansion trend. Validation results show that the S1A datasets agree well with levelling data, indicating the reliability of the InSAR results. With groundwater level data, we found that the distribution of subsidence in the NCP is spatially consistent with that of deep groundwater depression cones. A comparison with land use data shows that the agricultural usage of groundwater is the dominant mechanism responsible for land subsidence in the whole study area. Through an integrated analysis of land subsidence distribution characteristics, geological data, and previous research results, we found that other triggering factors, such as active faults, precipitation recharge, urbanization, and oil/gas extraction, have also impacted land subsidence in the NCP to different degrees.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution of Land Subsidence and Rebound over Xi'an in Western China Revealed by SBAS-InSAR Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is one of the major urban geological hazards, which seriously restricts the development of many cities in the world. As one of the major cities in China, Xi'an has also been experiencing a large area of land subsidence due to excessive exploitation of groundwater. Since the Heihe Water Transfer Project (HWTP) became fully operational in late 2003, the problem of subsidence has been restrained, but other issues, such as ground rebounds, have appeared, and the effect of the underground space utilization on land subsidence remains unsolved. The spatial-temporal pattern of land subsidence and rebound in Xi'an after HWTP and their possible cause have so far not been well understood. In this study, the evolutionary characteristics of land subsidence and rebound in Xi'an city from 2007-2019 was investigated using Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-SAR) technology to process the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel-1A SAR datasets, and their cause and the correlation with groundwater level changes and the underground space utilization were discussed. We found that the land subsidence rate in the study area slowed from 2007-2019, and the subsidence area shrank and gradually developed into three relatively independent and isolated subsidence areas primarily. Significant local rebound deformation up to 22 mm/y commenced in the groundwater recharge region during 2015-2019. The magnitude of local rebound was dominated by the rise in groundwater level due to HWTP, whereas tectonic faults and ground fissures control the range of subsidence and the uplift area. The influence of building load on surface deformation became increasingly evident and primarily manifested by slowing the subsidence reduction trend. Additionally, land subsidence caused by the disturbances during the subway construction period was stronger than that in the operational stage. Future land subsidence in Xi'an is predicted to be alleviated overall, and the areas of rebound deformation will continue increasing for a limited time. However, uneven settlement range may extend to the Qujiang and Xixian New District due to the rapid urban construction. Our results could provide a scientific basis for land subsidence hazard mitigation, underground space planning, and groundwater management in Xi'an or similar regions where severe ground subsidence was induced by rapid urbanization.

TI  - Mapping Burned Areas of Mato Grosso State Brazilian Amazon Using Multisensor Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying forest fires remain a challenging task for the implementation of public policies aimed to mitigate climate change. In this paper, we propose a new method to provide an annual burned area map of Mato Grosso State located in the Brazilian Amazon region, taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution sensors. The method consists of generating the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images by applying the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) to the Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), PROBA-V (Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation), and Suomi NPP-VIIRS (National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) datasets. The shade fraction images highlight the burned areas, in which values are represented by low reflectance of ground targets, and the mapping was performed using an unsupervised classifier. Burned areas were evaluated in terms of land use and land cover classes over the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes in the Mato Grosso State. Our results showed that most of the burned areas occurred in non-forested areas (66.57%) and old deforestation (21.54%). However, burned areas over forestlands (11.03%), causing forest degradation, reached more than double compared with burned areas identified in consolidated croplands (5.32%). The results obtained were validated using the Sentinel-2 data and compared with active fire data and existing global burned areas products, such as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer product) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1, and Fire CCI (ESA Climate Change Initiative) products. Although there is a good visual agreement among the analyzed products, the areas estimated were quite different. Our results presented correlation of 51% with Sentinel-2 and agreement of r(2) = 0.31, r(2) = 0.29, and r(2) = 0.43 with MCD64A1, MCD45A1, and Fire CCI products, respectively. However, considering the active fire data, it was achieved the better performance between active fire presence and burn mapping (92%). The proposed method provided a general perspective about the patterns of fire in various biomes of Mato Grosso State, Brazil, that are important for the environmental studies, specially related to fire severity, regeneration, and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - IrrigaSys: A web-based irrigation decision support system based on open source data and technology
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - IrrigaSys is a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation water management based on online, open source tools. The aim of this paper is to describe the structure of IrrigaSys and how it is implementation at the plot scale. The DSS includes remote access to local meteorological stations for weather conditions, a meteorological model for weather forecast, the MOHID-Land model for the computation of the soil water balance and irrigation scheduling, and a database for data repository. Despite its complexity, the data necessary to run IrrigaSys is minimal, and include as mandatory input information on the location of field plots, crop type, sowing and harvest dates, soil texture, irrigation method, and daily/weekly applied irrigation depths. Based on this information, the system automatically downloads the weather data from the meteorological station located closest to the agricultural plot, as well as the weather forecast for the seven incoming days. The soil water balance is then computed from sowing to the present date (updating always the system with newly acquired information) as well as the recommended irrigation schedule for the incoming week. Results are made available via a web interface, a mobile app, a SMS, and email. The IrrigaSys further provides the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computed from the most recent Sentinel-2 imagery available with a resolution of 10 m. The IrrigaSys was developed in close cooperation with the Water Board from the Sorraia Valley irrigation district, southern Portugal, supporting 103 plots of 30 farmers over the last 5 years. This stakeholder has been fundamental for successfully running the system. This paper further discusses the main strengths and limitations of IrrigaSys, with the latter being naturally associated to difficulties in providing reliable estimates for all field plots based on limited data.

TI  - Testing the Performance of an Innovative Markerless Technique for Quantitative and Qualitative Gait Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gait abnormalities such as high stride and step frequency/cadence (SF-stride/second, CAD-step/second), stride variability (SV) and low harmony may increase the risk of injuries and be a sentinel of medical conditions. This research aims to present a new markerless video-based technology for quantitative and qualitative gait analysis. 86 healthy individuals (mead age 32 years) performed a 90 s test on treadmill at self-selected walking speed. We measured SF and CAD by a photoelectric sensors system; then, we calculated average +/- standard deviation (SD) and within-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of SF as an index of SV. We also recorded a 60 fps video of the patient. With a custom-designed web-based video analysis software, we performed a spectral analysis of the brightness over time for each pixel of the image, that reinstituted the frequency contents of the videos. The two main frequency contents (F1 and F2) from this analysis should reflect the forcing/dominant variables, i.e., SF and CAD. Then, a harmony index (HI) was calculated, that should reflect the proportion of the pixels of the image that move consistently with F1 or its supraharmonics. The higher the HI value, the less variable the gait. The correspondence SF-F1 and CAD-F2 was evaluated with both paired t-Test and correlation and the relationship between SV and HI with correlation. SF and CAD were not significantly different from and highly correlated with F1 (0.893 +/- 0.080 Hz vs. 0.895 +/- 0.084 Hz, p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.99) and F2 (1.787 +/- 0.163 Hz vs. 1.791 +/- 0.165 Hz, p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.97). The SV was 1.84% +/- 0.66% and it was significantly and moderately correlated with HI (0.082 +/- 0.028, p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.13). The innovative video-based technique of global, markerless gait analysis proposed in our study accurately identifies the main frequency contents and the variability of gait in healthy individuals, thus providing a time-efficient, low-cost means to quantitatively and qualitatively study human locomotion.

TI  - A high-resolution emission inventory of air pollutants from primary crop residue burning over Northern India based on VIIRS thermal anomalies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions from the crop residue burning adversely affect the regional and global air quality including public health. In this study, a district-wise comprehensive emission inventory of key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, SO2, NOx, N2O, NH3, CH4, NMVOC, EC, OC, PAH) emitted during primary crop residue burning was developed using activity data for the major agrarian states of north India for the agricultural year 2017-18. The emissions were scaled to the spatial resolution of 1 km grid to study the spatial distribution of crop residue burning activities using VIIRS Thermal anomalies datasets. An estimated 20.3 Mt and 9.6 Mt of crop residue were burned in Punjab and Haryana, resulting in an emission of 137.2 Gg and 56.9 Gg of PM2.5 and 163.7 Gg and 72.1 of PM10 Gg for respective states. The emissions of EC, OC, and PAHs were 8.6 Gg, 45.7 Gg, and 0.08 Gg in Punjab, whereas in Haryana emissions were 3.7 Gg, 17.7 Gg, and 0.03 Gg, respectively. The results show that rice and wheat crops were major contributor to residue burnt at the field (>90%) leading to the high load of atmospheric emissions in the IGP region. Further, CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions were 34.8 Tg and 17.3 Tg for Punjab and Haryana, respectively. Around 30000 and 8500 active fires were detected by VIIRS over the agricultural area of Punjab and Haryana during the studied year. The GIS-based bottom-up approach using gridded emission inventory shows pollutant distribution dominates over the south-western part of Punjab and northwestern region of Haryana. The proximity of these regions to Delhi and transboundary movement of emissions towards Indo-Gangetic plains causes high air pollution episodes. The high-resolution inventory of various pollutants will be useful for regional air quality models to better predict and manage the hotspot of air pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Flood and Tsunami Damage Indices Based on Remotely Sensed Data: An Application to Indonesia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - By using freely available remote sensing data, typically used for natural hazard modeling, and combining these with nightlight data as a proxy for economic activity, this paper constructs novel damage indices at the district level for Indonesia, showing how one can quickly find a relative economic impact up to a global scale for different disaster events, such as floods and the 2004 Christmas tsunami. Ex ante, prior to the incidence of a disaster, district-level damage indices could be used to determine the size of the annual fiscal transfers from the central government to the subnational governments. Ex post, or after the incidence of a natural hazard, damage indices are useful for quickly assessing and estimating the damages caused and are especially useful for central and local governments, emergency services, and aid workers so that they can respond efficiently and deploy resources where they are most needed.

TI  - Automatic detection of Japanese knotweed in urban areas from aerial and satellite data
T2  - MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Presence of invasive alien plant species in urban areas has become an issue throughout the globe. City administrations are making efforts to avoid invasions, to eradicate and/or control invasive species, or alternatively, try to process them into useful products. To monitor the spread of species over a region, it is important to map invasive species. In the scope of the APPLAUSE project, we have developed a One-Class support vector machine (SVM) approach to detect invasive species from individual aerial and multiple Sentinel-2 satellite images over the City of Ljubljana (Slovenia). In this paper, we focus specifically on the detection of Japanese knotweed, because it produces large stands and is therefore the most detectable invasive species in the studied area. The proposed SVM approach uses red-green-blue (RGB) band composites and infrared (IR) bands as input data for aerial images, while for satellite images additionally normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are used. In the study, we used ground tnith data collected by experts both as training and as validation data. On aerial images, we first perfonn segmentation, which is followed by two One-Class SVM classifications. On these classification outputs, we use K-means algorithm on the IR band, which groups the samples and removes the ones that were falsely recognized as Japanese knotweed. Merging the results together and masking out small samples and areas where Japanese knotweed is not present, we get the final result. On satellite data the approach is similar, the only difference is the usage of multiple input images from different acquisition dates for SVM classification. For detection of Japanese knotweed from the aerial images the accuracy was 83%, and 90% for stands larger than 100 m 2 on satellite data. The results demonstrate that the applied methodology with the qualitative ground truth data can be used operationally for automatic detection of Japanese knotweed on the municipality level.

TI  - West Nile virus in California, 2003-2018: A persistent threat
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The California Arbovirus Surveillance Program was initiated over 50 years ago to track endemic encephalitides and was enhanced in 2000 to include West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans, mosquitoes, sentinel chickens, dead birds and horses. This comprehensive, statewide program is a function of strong partnerships among the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the University of California, and local vector control and public health agencies. This manuscript summarizes WNV surveillance data in California since WNV was first detected in 2003 in southern California. From 2003 through 2018, 6,909 human cases of WNV disease, inclusive of 326 deaths, were reported to CDPH, as well as 730 asymptomatic WNV infections identified during screening of blood and organ donors. Of these, 4,073 (59.0%) were reported as West Nile neuroinvasive disease. California's WNV disease burden comprised 15% of all cases that were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during this time, more than any other state. Additionally, 1,299 equine WNV cases were identified, along with detections of WNV in 23,322 dead birds, 31,695 mosquito pools, and 7,340 sentinel chickens. Annual enzootic detection of WNV typically preceded detection in humans and prompted enhanced intervention to reduce the risk of WNV transmission. Peak WNV activity occurred from July through October in the Central Valley and southern California. Less than five percent of WNV activity occurred in other regions of the state or outside of this time. WNV continues to be a major threat to public and wild avian health in California, particularly in Southern California and the Central Valley during summer and early fall months. Local and state public health partners must continue statewide human and mosquito surveillance and facilitate effective mosquito control and bite prevention measures.Author summaryWest Nile virus (WNV) was first detected in the United States in 1999, and subsequently spread throughout the country. It is now the most commonly reported disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes in the United States. California has reported approximately 15% of all human WNV infections since the virus was first reported in the state in 2003. The California Department of Public Health works with partners throughout the state to conduct robust surveillance of WNV infections in mosquitoes, dead birds, and sentinel chickens, using these data to direct vector control activity and reduce the risk of WNV transmission to people. This article summarizes sixteen years of human, mosquito, chicken, equine, and dead wild bird surveillance for WNV in California, the most comprehensive description of WNV surveillance data to date. We found that WNV enzootic and human activity varied geographically and in intensity from year-to-year. Almost 95% of all WNV activity in California occurred in the Central Valley and southern California between April and November.

TI  - Effect of phytoplankton community size structure on remote-sensing refiectance and chlorophyll <i>a</i> products
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed ocean colour is the main tool for estimating chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration and primary productivity on the global scale. In order to investigate the source of errors in remotely-sensed Chl-a concentration we obtained in situ bio-optical properties, in situ refiectances, satellite-derived refiectances and the Chl-a concentration satellite products of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) Instrument on board Sentinel-3 A in waters off eastern Australia. The mesoscale eddies of these oligotrophic waters provide contrasting phytoplankton communities that allowed us to focus on the effect of phytoplankton size as a source of errors. In these waters, cold-core cyclonic eddies (CE) are dominated by large phytoplankton cells, while small cells dominate warm-core anticyclonic eddies (ACE). The chlorophyll-specific absorption and backscattering from contrasting sites show significant difference due to the differing package effect of phytoplankton size distributions. After normalising the absorption and backscattering spectra to Chl-a associated with just small phytoplankton, the spectra of optical properties become much more similar, showing that small-sized phytoplankton dominate IOPs even when large cells contain the greater fraction of Chl-a concentration of the phytoplankton community. Measured in situ refiectances agreed with refiectances calculated using a simple optical model based on measured IOPs. Furthermore, the in situ measured refiectances agreed well with the OLCI refiectance (mean normalised bias (MNB) of 7% for wavelengths < 600 nm). However, a systematic under estimation of Chl-a concentrations by the OLCI algorithms was found in the region of cyclonic eddies characterised by increased Chl-a concentration and dominance of large-sized phytoplankton. A similar underprediction was found in Chl-a concentration calculated with the band-ratio OC4Me algorithm using in situ and IOP-calculated refiectance. Excluding Chl-a associated with large-sized phytoplankton, reduced the bias in the OC4Me from -31% to -0.1%. The large cells absorbed and scattered less per unit of chlorophyll resulting in a smaller impact on the refiectance, and therefore are less detectable by remotely-sensed band-ratio-based Chl-a algorithms than small cells.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of Sentinel-2 observations at image- and pixel-level of the Mexican territory between 2015 and 2019
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 imagery has the highest temporal, spectral and spatial resolution to monitor land surface among the freely available multispectral collections. However, the possibility to use these images in different applications is conditioned by the number of cloudless observations available for a certain spatiotemporal window. Thus, the objective of this article is to analyze the number of Sentinel-2 observations available for the Mexican territory at image and pixel level. In the first case, the total number of available images and its cloud cover percentage was calculated; while in the second case, the number of cloudless observations was estimated for each pixel. Additionally, in order to take into account the territory diversity, the monthly mean number of cloudless observations, as well as the proportion of its surface with at least one cloudless observation in monthly, bimonthly, trimonthly and annual intervals, was computed for each one of the seven ecoregions of the country. The results show that annually, the number of valid observations per pixel is between 0 and 121 observations, while in monthly evaluations, between 0 and 6.58 observations. Additionally, in the 2017-2019 period annual observations can be obtained for the entire Mexican land surface, while in 2018-2019, monthly or trimonthly evaluations can be achieved, depending on the ecoregion. We consider that these results will provide useful information for researchers that are interested in using Sentinel-2 imagery for different applications.

TI  - Forecasting monthly fluctuations of lake surface areas using remote sensing techniques and novel machine learning methods
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most environmentally impactful hydrologic processes with devastating economic consequences for many rural communities in arid and semi-arid countries all over the world. In this research, we have employed satellite data and a stochastic approach for forecasting the changes in lake surface areas and demonstrated for the application of the new technique for the case study of the Lake Gregory in Australia. High-resolution Landsat satellite images are used on a monthly time scale from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, on days that are not cloudy. The software ENVI 5.3, using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and modify normalized difference water index (MNDWI) indices were employed to obtain the lake surface maps, and satellite images have been split into water and non-water using a decision tree. The ArcGIS 10.3 software was used to calculate the area of the Lake monthly. The overall trend data shows that from 2004 to 2019, the LS is steadily declining, reaching its lowest area in 2019.The TRMM satellite monthly precipitation (P) and temperature (T) measurement were obtained to investigate the correlation between these changes and regional precipitation. We developed a novel generalized group method of data handling (GGMDH) to forecast lake surface (LS) fluctuations, in which the LS time-series database is extracted from the satellite imagery. For downscaling, precipitation and three different scenarios are defined based on climate change projections to forecast the LS in the 2020-2060 period. The comparison of the GGMDH with stochastic models integrated with preprocessing scenarios indicates the GGMDH in long-term LS forecasting outperforms the stochastic model. The result showed GGMDH is the best model among other ones to modeling lake surface by R-2 (%) = 94.16, RMSE = 8.77 for the forecasting stage. The forecasted surface of the Lake Gregory fluctuated from 226 to 0.008 km(2) in the future.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Changes in Surface Water Area of Sri Lanka over a 30-Year Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sri Lanka contains a large number of natural and man-made water bodies, which play an essential role in irrigation and domestic use. The island has recently been identified as a global hotspot of climate change extremes. However, the extent, spatial distribution, and the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on these water bodies have remained unknown. We investigated the distribution, spatial and temporal changes, and the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic drivers on water dynamics in Dry, Intermediate, and Wet zones of the island. We used Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images to generate per-pixel seasonal and annual water occurrence frequency maps for the period of 1988-2019. The results of the study demonstrated high inter- and intra-annual variations in water with a rapid increase. Further, results showed strong zonal differences in water dynamics, with most dramatic variations in the Dry zone. Our results revealed that 1607.73 km(2) of the land area of the island is covered by water bodies, among this 882.01 km(2) (54.86%) is permanent and 725.72 km(2) (45.14%) is seasonal water area. Total inland seasonal water increased with a dramatic annual growth rate of 7.06 +/- 1.97 km(2) compared to that of permanent water (4.47 +/- 2.08 km(2)/year). Sri Lanka has the highest permanent water area during December-February (1045.97 km(2)), and drops to the lowest in May-September (761.92 km(2)) when the seasonal water (846.46 km(2)) is higher than permanent water. The surface water area was positively related to both precipitation and Gross Domestic Product, while negatively related to the temperature. Findings of our study provide important insights into possible spatiotemporal changes in surface water availability in Sri Lanka under certain climate change and anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Adjuvant treatment improves overall survival in women with high-intermediate risk early-stage endometrial cancer with lymphovascular space invasion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAdjuvant therapy in early-stage endometrial cancer has not shown a clear overall survival benefit, and hence, patient selection remains crucial.ObjectiveTo determine whether women with high-intermediate risk, early-stage endometrial cancer with lymphovascular space invasion particularly benefit from adjuvant treatment in improving oncologic outcomes.MethodsA multi-center retrospective study was conducted in women with stage IA, IB, and II endometrial cancer with lymphovascular space invasion who met criteria for high-intermediate risk by Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 99. Patients were stratified by the type of adjuvant treatment received. Clinical and pathologic features were abstracted. Progression-free and overall survival were evaluated using multivariable analysis.Results405 patients were included with the median age of 67 years (range 27-92, IQR 59-73). 75.0% of the patients had full staging with lymphadenectomy, and 8.6% had sentinel lymph node biopsy (total 83.6%). After surgery, 24.9% of the patients underwent observation and 75.1% received adjuvant therapy, which included external beam radiation therapy (15.1%), vaginal brachytherapy (45.4%), and combined brachytherapy + chemotherapy (19.1%). Overall, adjuvant treatment resulted in improved oncologic outcomes for both 5-year progression-free survival (77.2% vs 69.6%, HR 0.55, p=0.01) and overall survival (81.5% vs 60.2%, HR 0.42, p<0.001). After adjusting for stage, grade 2/3, and age, improved progression-free survival and overall survival were observed for the following adjuvant subgroups compared with observation: external beam radiation (overall survival HR 0.47, p=0.047, progression-free survival not significant), vaginal brachytherapy (overall survival HR 0.35, p<0.001; progression-free survival HR 0.42, p=0.003), and brachytherapy + chemotherapy (overall survival HR 0.30 p=0.002; progression-free survival HR 0.35, p=0.006). Compared with vaginal brachytherapy alone, external beam radiation or the addition of chemotherapy did not further improve progression-free survival (p=0.80, p=0.65, respectively) or overall survival (p=0.47, p=0.74, respectively).ConclusionAdjuvant therapy improves both progression-free survival and overall survival in women with early-stage endometrial cancer meeting high-intermediate risk criteria with lymphovascular space invasion. External beam radiation or adding chemotherapy did not confer additional survival advantage compared with vaginal brachytherapy alone.

TI  - Preliminary study on the tagging release of Anguilla japonica parents in the Yangtze Estuary.
T2  - Marine Fisheries
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the migratory habits of Anguilla japonica parents, 10 pop-up satellite archival tags (PAT) and 500 T-bar tags were used to carry out the study on tagging release of the wild and cultured A. japonica parents in the coastal waters of Sanjiagang (121[degree]49'E, 31[degree]12'N) in the Yangtze Estuary. The information recovery survey was conducted through satellite tracking and fishermen feedback. Satellite transmits a subset of stored date, such as light levels, depth and temperature, after the tags detach and float to the surface. Fishermen feed back the catching time and site information mainly through the contact method reserved on the tags. After 44 days, 4 individuals with PAT feedback messages were received, and 10 individuals with T-bar tags were recovered. The results showed that the wild parents had a long horizontal movement distance post release. After 9 days, they had reached Zhoushan (ZS) waters about 117.66 km from the release spot. The migration process of wild parents predominantly inhabited shallow water with obvious vertical movement and diurnal distribution difference. They prefered shallower depth water at night, and showed regular diving behavior. The horizontal movement distance of the cultured parents was relatively close. After 44 days, the cultured ones reached the farthest waters of Shengsi Islands waters about 106.13 km away from the release spot. The cultured parents moved along the bottom layer of the water without obvious vertical movement and diurnal distribution difference. To sum up, the released wild parents could quickly enter the migration state with regular movement characteristics. However, the cultured ones moved along the bottom of the water and stay in the coastal waters for a long time. The wild and cultured parents showed different migratory habits. It is suggested that in future release activities, the number of tagging releases of wild parents should be expanded, the cultivation and domestication of the cultured parents should be strengthened, and the open waters far offshore should be chosen for release. Then more detailed monitoring data should be obtained, the migration habits, paths and environmental adaptability of A. japonica parents should be proved. Studies on physiological and ecological changes of A. japonica parents post release should be further strengthened, and data support and scientific basis should be provided for optimization and evaluation of artificial propagation and release of A. japonica parents.

TI  - Review: Strategies for using satellite-based products in modeling PM<sub>2.5</sub> and short-term pollution episodes
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Short-term air pollution episodes motivate improved understanding of the association between air pollution and acute morbidity and mortality episodes, and triggers required mitigation plans. A variety of methods have been employed to estimate exposure to air pollution episodes, including GIS-based dispersion models, interpolation between sparse monitoring sites, land-use regression models, optimization models, line- or area-dispersion plume models, and models using information from imaging satellites, often including land-use and meteorological variables. There has been increasing use of satellite-borne aerosol products for assessing short-term air quality events. They provide better spatial coverage, but currently at the price of low temporal coverage and rather crude spatial resolution. This is a brief review on using satellite data for modeling short-term air quality and pollution events. The review can be pursued as a practical guide for modeling air quality with satellite-based products, as it includes important questions that should be considered in both the study design as well as the model development stages. Progress in this field is detailed and includes published models and their use in environmental and health studies. Both current and future satellite-borne capabilities are covered. It also provides links to access and download relevant datasets and some example R code for data processing and modeling.

TI  - Thirty Years of Land Cover and Fraction Cover Changes over the Sudano-Sahel Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical land cover maps are of high importance for scientists and policy makers studying the dynamic character of land cover change in the Sudano-Sahel, including anthropogenic and climatological drivers. Despite its relevance, an accurate high resolution record of historical land cover maps is currently lacking over the Sudano-Sahel. In this study, 30 m resolution historically consistent land cover and cover fraction maps are provided over the Sudano-Sahel for the period 1986-2015. These land cover/cover fraction maps are achieved based on the Landsat archive preprocessed on Google Earth Engine and a random forest classification/regression model, while historical consistency is achieved using the hidden Markov model. Using these historical maps, a multitude of variability in the dynamic Sudano-Sahel region over the past 30 years is revealed. On the one hand, Sahel-wide cropland expansion and the re-greening of the Sahel is observed in the discrete land cover classification. On the other hand, subtle changes such as forest degradation are detected based on the cover fraction maps. Additionally, exploiting the 30 m spatial resolution, fine-scale changes, such as smallholder or subsistence farming, can be detected. The historical land cover/cover fraction maps presented in this study are made available via an open-access platform.

TI  - Laparoscopic sentinel node mapping with intracervical indocyanine green injection for endometrial cancer: the SENTIFAIL study - a multicentric analysis of predictors of failed mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesLaparoscopy is commonly used for endometrial cancer treatment, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has become the standard procedure for nodal assessment. Despite the standardization of the technique, there is no definitive data regarding its failure rate. The objective of this study is to identify factors associated with unsuccessful SLN mapping in endometrial cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic SLN mapping after intracervical indocyanine green (ICG) injection.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated a consecutive series of endometrial cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic SLN mapping with intracervical ICG injection, in four oncological referral centers from January 2016 to July 2019. Inclusion criteria were biopsy-proven endometrial cancer, total laparoscopic approach, and intracervical ICG injection. Exclusion criteria were evidence of lymph node involvement or extrauterine disease at pre-operative imaging, synchronous invasive cancer, the use of tracers different from ICG, and the use of neoadjuvant treatment. Bilateral and failed bilateral SLN mapping groups were compared for clinical and pathological features. In patients with an unsuccessful procedure, side-specific lymphadenectomy was performed. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of failure.ResultsA total of 376 patients were included in the study. The overall bilateral and unilateral SLN detection rates were 96.3%, 76.3%, and 20.0% respectively. The failed bilateral mapping detection rate was 23.7%. The median number of sentinel nodes removed was 2.2 (range, 0-5). After multivariate analysis, lymph vascular space involvement [OR 2.4 (1.04-1.12), P=0.003], non-endometrioid histology [OR 3.0 (1.43-6.29), P=0.004], and intraoperative finding of enlarged lymph node [OR 2.3 (1.01-5.31), P=0.045] were identified as independent predictors of failure of SLN mapping.ConclusionLymph vascular space involvement, non-endometrioid histology, and intra-operative finding of enlarged lymph nodes were identified as independent risk factors for unsuccessful mapping in patients undergoing laparoscopic SLN mapping.

TI  - Crustal density and global gravitational field estimation of the Moon from GRAIL and LOLA satellite data
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We employ Newton's integral in the spectral domain to solve two geodetic/geophysical tasks for the Moon. Firstly, we determine 3D bulk density distribution within the lunar crust (inverse problem). For this purpose, we develop a linear mathematical model that parameterises the laterally variable density component by surface spherical harmonics. We exploit GL1500E GRAIL gravitational field model and LOLA topography model to determine bulk density in three types of function: 1) constant, 2) laterally variable, and 3) 3D spatially variable (assuming a linear change in the radial direction). Secondly, we calculate lunar gravitational field models inferred by these three crustal compositions (forward problem) up to spherical harmonic degree 2519 corresponding to a spatial resolution of similar to 2.2 km at the lunar equator. Efficacy of these models is assessed with respect to the GRAIL Level 2 gravitational field models. Our spatially variable crustal model represents the best fit globally and also locally in highland areas. We also test the performance of GRAIL models, recent and independent forward models, and our new models against Level 1B GRAIL satellite-to-satellite tracking data focusing on evaluation beyond Level 2 data (i.e., spherical harmonic degrees greater than 650). These medium- and high-frequency signals from our models correlate with the Level 1B observations the best among all global gravitational field models tested. Our high resolution geopotential model with the optimized 3D crustal density variation should be an asset to future lunar lander navigation and geophysical exploration.

TI  - Comparison of V4 and V3 CALIOP (L3) aerosol products: A global perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gridded satellite products provide (computationally less-intense) opportunities to compare and contrast parameters from different versions/sensors. In the present study, Level-3 (L3) Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol products from the most recent release (version 4, V4) are compared with its earlier version (version 3, V3) products. The various improvements in V4 are detailed and the resultant changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol vertical extinction profiles for various aerosol species (total aerosol, dust, polluted dust, smoke) over various regions are discussed. Broadly, V4 global AOD is higher than the V3 AOD (except for polluted dust). Significant differences in V4 and V3 AODs are observed over Africa, East Asia, Atlantic Ocean, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and South America. Seasonal-wise global mean percentage difference in V4 and V3 total-AODs (with respect to V4 AODs) ranged between 9% and 15%. The change in the spatial distribution of polluted dust over oceanic regions is one of the significant differences between V4 and V3. V4 total-AODs are closer to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AODs than V3 total-AODs are. The shape of the aerosol extinction profiles also differed between V4 and V3. The altitudinal differences in the V4 and V3 extinction values varied spatio-temporally.

TI  - Development of a multidisciplinary colorectal and pelvic health program: Program implementation and clinical impact
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Pediatric patients with complex colorectal and genitourinary conditions often require coordinated multidisciplinary care; however, this coordinated care can be hard to structure and deliver. The purpose of this paper is to review the development and implementation of a multidisciplinary colorectal and pelvic health program, one year after the program's initiation.Methods: This is an observational retrospective 1-year study (10/1/2017 to 9/30/2018). In fiscal year (FY) 2018, a multidisciplinary colorectal and pelvic health program was initiated. The program development incorporated bimonthly team meetings, educational conferences, and initiation of three clinics: a complex colorectal and genitourinary reconstruction clinic, a bowel management clinic, and a colonic motility clinic. Conditions treated included complex anorectal and cloacal malformations, Hirschsprung disease, and idiopathic constipation. The fiscal year was selected to provide comparative administrative data after program implementation.Results: During the study period, 121 patients underwent comprehensive collaborative evaluation of which 58 (47%) were new to the institution compared to 12 (19%) new patients in the previous year (p < 0.001). In FY 2018, there were 130 procedures performed and 512 collaborative visits with an average of 47 visits per month. This was a 3.4-fold increase in visits compared to FY2017 (171 visits). Of the new patients, 60% (35/ 58), traveled a median of 181 miles, representing 33 statewide counties, and 4 states compared to a median of 93 miles in the previous fiscal year (p = 0.004).Conclusion: The development of a colorectal and pelvic health program is feasible and requires a collaborative approach, necessitating multiple service lines within an institution. Program creation and implementation can re sult in rapid institutional clinical growth by filling a local and regional need through coordinated multidisciplinary care. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Prediction of Short-Time Cloud Motion Using a Deep-Learning Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A cloud image can provide significant information, such as precipitation and solar irradiation. Predicting short-time cloud motion from images is the primary means of making intra-hour irradiation forecasts for solar-energy production and is also important for precipitation forecasts. However, it is very challenging to predict cloud motion (especially nonlinear motion) accurately. Traditional methods of cloud-motion prediction are based on block matching and the linear extrapolation of cloud features; they largely ignore nonstationary processes, such as inversion and deformation, and the boundary conditions of the prediction region. In this paper, the prediction of cloud motion is regarded as a spatiotemporal sequence-forecasting problem, for which an end-to-end deep-learning model is established; both the input and output are spatiotemporal sequences. The model is based on gated recurrent unit (GRU)- recurrent convolutional network (RCN), a variant of the gated recurrent unit (GRU), which has convolutional structures to deal with spatiotemporal features. We further introduce surrounding context into the prediction task. We apply our proposed Multi-GRU-RCN model to FengYun-2G satellite infrared data and compare the results to those of the state-of-the-art method of cloud-motion prediction, the variational optical flow (VOF) method, and two well-known deep-learning models, namely, the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and GRU. The Multi-GRU-RCN model predicts intra-hour cloud motion better than the other methods, with the largest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index. The results prove the applicability of the GRU-RCN method for solving the spatiotemporal data prediction problem and indicate the advantages of our model for further applications.

TI  - URBAN ENERGY MODELING USING REMOTE SENSING APPROACHES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to discover the urban energy spatial pattern based on the analysis of urban heat island (UHI) and the land surface temperature (LST) in Yogyakarta city. The vegetation cover was analyzed using the vegetation index with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) formula. The satellite imagery used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), recorded on April 22, 2019, for the dry season images, and June 25, 2019, for the wet season images. The processing results showed that the maximum LST in the dry season was 34.09 degrees C, and the minimum was 27.22 degrees C; meanwhile, in the wet season, the maximum LST was 31.27 degrees C, and the minimum was 23.67 degrees C. The presence of vegetation indicated by NDVI values had a strong correlation with LST, i.e. R = 0.74 for the dry season and R = 0.60 for the wet season. The high NDVI had a low temperature, whereas the low NDVI had a high temperature. Based on the analysis results, UHI increases in temperature (7 degrees C) from the temperature threshold. The difference in the spatial distribution of LST and UHI in the dry and wet seasons is strongly influenced by the image recording time and the atmospheric conditions. The percentage of non-UHI area is deficient at around 0.35% in the dry season and 0.59% in the wet season, indicating that the Yogyakarta city's energy needs are very high. Therefore, it requires urban planning that considers urban green space area.

TI  - Long non-coding RNAs lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3 and lnc-GJA10-12:1 present as regulators of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in various biological processed involved in tumorigenesis, metastasis and proliferation. The aim of the present study was to identify candidate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in breast cancer. Specimens of SLNs were collected from patients with SLN metastasis via punch biopsy. Total RNA was extracted and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted. Differential expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs were obtained via bioinformatics analysis, and Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed on differentially expressed mRNAs. The expression levels of lncRNAs were analyzed via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the regulation network of the lncRNAs to downstream microRNAs (miRs) and mRNAs was predicted. Based on RNA-seq results, six differentially expressed candidate lncRNAs were identified in patients with and without SLN metastasis: lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3, lnc-GJA10-12:1, lnc-ACAN-2:1, lnc-ZPBP2-4:1, lnc-GATA3-16:1 and lnc-ACOX3-5:1. KEGG and GO analysis identified that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were the most enriched pathways. After RT-qPCR analysis, lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3 and lnc-GJA10-12:1 exhibited expression patterns that were consistent with those from RNA-seq. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3 and lnc-GJA10-12:1 expression levels had high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of SLN metastasis, and that their expression levels were upregulated in patients with axillary lymph node metastasis. Further analysis revealed that lnc-GJA10-12:1 and lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3 were commonly involved in regulating the miR-302 family, including miR-302d-3p and miR-302c-3p, which together targeted AKT1. Additionally, lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3 was predicted to target miR-520b to regulate MAP3K2 expression. lnc-GJA10-12:1 was also predicted to target miR-34a-5p to regulate MAP2K1 and MAP3K9 expression levels, as well as miR-449a to regulate MAP2K1 expression. The results of the present study suggested that lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3 and lnc-GJA10-12:1 may potentially serve a role in SLN metastasis of breast cancer by regulating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways via targeting the miR-302 family, miR-520a-3p, miR-34a-5p and miR-449a. Thus, lnc-ANGPTL1-3:3 and lnc-GJA10-12:1 in SLN may serve as potential markers of breast cancer metastasis.

TI  - Quantifying landscape-metrics impacts on urban green-spaces and water-bodies cooling effect: The study of Nanjing, China
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces and water bodies play major roles in effectively alleviating the urban heat island (UHI) effect by decreasing temperature. Here, statistical correlation and regression analyses were carried out to examine the relationships between metrics (vegetation coverage, water coverage, area, leaf area (LA), and patch shape index (PSI)) and land surface temperature (LST) or cooling effect intensity. Besides, the cooling ranges of green spaces and water bodies were explored by sampling and thresholds detection. Landsat satellite images were used to derive land cover map and LST map. Results show that: (1) average LST within given residential area decreases with the vegetation coverage and water coverage increasing; (2) area and LA are both significantly positively correlated with the cooling effect beneficial to people entering green spaces; (3) increasing the vegetation coverage in the range from approximately 0-28 % can effectively and economically alleviate the thermal environment of residential areas, and the economical optimal green space area and LA are both 0.26 ha; and (4) from 2010 to 2017, the cooling range of green spaces in the central districts of Nanjing is around between 180 and 810 m with the average value of 540 m, while the cooling range of water bodies ranges approximately from 510 to 1260 m with the average value of 840 m.

TI  - Forest Drought Response Index (ForDRI): A New Combined Model to Monitor Forest Drought in the Eastern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring drought impacts in forest ecosystems is a complex process because forest ecosystems are composed of different species with heterogeneous structural compositions. Even though forest drought status is a key control on the carbon cycle, very few indices exist to monitor and predict forest drought stress. The Forest Drought Indicator (ForDRI) is a new monitoring tool developed by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) to identify forest drought stress. ForDRI integrates 12 types of data, including satellite, climate, evaporative demand, ground water, and soil moisture, into a single hybrid index to estimate tree stress. The model uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the contribution of each input variable based on its covariance in the historical records (2003-2017). A 15-year time series of 780 ForDRI maps at a weekly interval were produced. The ForDRI values at a 12.5km spatial resolution were compared with normalized weekly Bowen ratio data, a biophysically based indicator of stress, from nine AmeriFlux sites. There were strong and significant correlations between Bowen ratio data and ForDRI at sites that had experienced intense drought. In addition, tree ring annual increment data at eight sites in four eastern U.S. national parks were compared with ForDRI values at the corresponding sites. The correlation between ForDRI and tree ring increments at the selected eight sites during the summer season ranged between 0.46 and 0.75. Generally, the correlation between the ForDRI and normalized Bowen ratio or tree ring increment are reasonably good and indicate the usefulness of the ForDRI model for estimating drought stress and providing decision support on forest drought management.

TI  - Air-Sea Interactions among Oceanic Low-Level Cloud, Sea Surface Temperature, and Atmospheric Circulation on an Intraseasonal Time Scale in the Summertime North Pacific Based on Satellite Data Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-level cloud plays a key role in modulating air-sea interaction processes and sea surface temperature (SST) variability. The present study investigated the evolution process of oceanic low-level cloud cover (LCC) and related air-sea interaction processes on an intraseasonal time scale in the summertime (June-October) North Pacific (30 degrees-40 degrees N, 165 degrees-175 degrees E) based on satellite observational and reanalysis datasets from 2003 to 2016. The intraseasonal time scale (20-100 days) is dominant not only for the LCC, but also for LCC controlling factors, that is, SST, estimated inversion strength (EIS), and horizontal temperature advection (T-adv). To reveal the lead-lag relationship among these variables, we conducted phase composite analysis with a bandpass filter based on the intraseasonal variability (ISV) of LCC. It suggests that ISV of LCC leads to that of SST and that horizontal dry-cold advection from the poleward region leads to increasing LCC and decreasing SST. The increasing LCC corresponds to a positive relative humidity (RH) anomaly in the lower troposphere, which is due to adiabatic cooling with shallow convection, vertical moisture advection, and meridionalRHadvection associated with the anomalous cold T-adv. Heat budget analysis of the ocean mixed layer suggests the importance of anomalous dry-cold advection for cooling SST, not only via enhanced latent heat release but also via decreased downward shortwave radiation at the sea surface according to cloud radiative effect with a positive LCC anomaly. Determining the detailed lead-lag relationship between LCC and its controlling factor is a good approach to understand mechanisms of the local processes of both low-level cloud evolution and air-sea interaction.

TI  - Mapping agricultural activities and their temporal variations in the riverine ecosystem of the Brahmaputra River using geospatial techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of spatiotemporal variations in agricultural activities in a riverine ecosystem is extremely important to understand the growth of crops during different seasons. The trend and pattern of change, help in understanding the suitability of different crops, cropping patterns practiced, and the scope of expanding agricultural activities for a better economy. In this study, the landuse land-cover (LULC) within the Brahmaputra River is categorized into different classes using unsupervised classification. The area under cropland and vegetation in the sandbars within the riverine is estimated, and the cropping pattern is analyzed on a decadal scale. Assessment of these classified maps is performed based on the overall accuracy and kappa statistics. Further, an agricultural portion in the mid sandbars of the river in the Lower Brahmaputra Valley (LBV) is considered to analyze the spatial cropping pattern as well as the expansion of cropland areas during different months in two different years. The temporal variation of the vegetation status of different classes is monitored using the Normalized Differential Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) for 2016 and 2019. Landsat MSS, Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS, IRS-1B LISS I, and IRS-P6 LISS III satellite images are used to understand the spatial and temporal variations as well as to evaluate the cropping pattern changes. On analyzing the trend of land cover changes during the period 1976-80, 1993-95, 2003-04, and 2008-11 from Sadiya to Dhubri, it is seen that the cropland area has decreased, vegetation area increased, and the sandbar area remained more or less unchanged. The average area of total sandbars within the Brahmaputra River is found to be 742002 Ha. Out of total area, 245395.75 Ha is found to be dry sandbars and 153148.23 Ha is covered under cropland and vegetation. On the contrary to the decreased cropland area, the monthly average percentage change was found to be + similar to 36% in the dominant agriculture sandbar between the years 2016 and 2019. We observed significant changes in the cropland as well as the conversion of barren sandbars into agricultural areas. The NDVI values obtained from the Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS satellite visibly indicated the change in the crop cultivation period as well as different phases of growth and shifting of cropping patterns. This study shows the potential and suitability of utilizing these vast sandbars of Brahmaputra River for various agricultural activities and improving the socio economic development of the people.

TI  - Impact of Hydro-Climatic Changes on Coastal Dunes Landscape According to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (The Case Study of Curonian Spit)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dunes are recognized as one of the most threatened ecosystems, the formation of which mainly depends on two opposite processes-sand dunes overgrowth and formation of open dunes. The application of cost-effective remote sensing methods permits monitoring the interaction of these two processes over a large area and long periods of time. Therefore in this study we assessed the links between hydro-meteorological parameters and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in Curonian spit coastal dunes landscape-a creation of human and nature integrity situated in the South eastern part of the Baltic Sea. Time series of NDVI (2000-2019) were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer and compared with hydro-meteorological parameters in three different ecosystems-forest, herbaceous and open sands. Moderate and strong positive correlation between NDVI and average wind speed was detected in non-forested ecosystems. Moderate positive correlation was detected between NDVI and the Baltic sea water level in all three analyzed ecosystems. Moderate positive correlation between NDVI and air temperature was found in forest ecosystem. This confirms that NDVI could be treated as an appropriate indicator, showing the interaction of coastal dunes overgrowth and formation of open dunes, and could be applied in its management that should be reconsidered under nowadays climate change.

TI  - Modeling landslide failure surfaces by polynomial surface fitting
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating landslide volume based on pre- and post-event elevation models without detailed field investigations is still a major challenge due to hidden failure surfaces. A MATLAB model named "SLIPMTER" was developed to model failure surfaces using polynomial surface to lit the geometry of exposed scarps extracted from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). To test our model, a series of analog experiments were designed to acquire data for model testing in a controlled environment. The test indicates the only option to simulate failure surfaces with only remotely sensed data, is to assume that the failure surface was outcropping at the toe of slopes. It is not possible to model landslides that do not reach the bottom of slopes without survey data. Using the assumption, the model was tested on real landslides, showing its capability of modeling for multiple landslides over an area in a single simulation, and the possibility to predict potential failure surfaces from a reported crack. The major limitations of the model include the high requirement for the input DEM quality, the incapability to consider underlying bedrock structures, and the difficulty of simulating landslides with complex movements.

TI  - Can VIIRS continue the legacy of MODIS for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real-time monitoring of forest disturbance is a critical tool for combating illegal logging. The only feasible data sources for near real-time monitoring over large area are remote sensing data, and historically the only sensors with repeat times sufficient for near-real time monitoring are from coarse-resolution sensors such as MODIS. The MODIS sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites have provided near daily global observations in the red and NIR spectral bands at 250 m resolution since 1999. While their longevity is impressive, the sensors are nearing the end of their lifespan and the MODIS data record will be continued by the VIIRS sensor onboard Suomi NPP. But because of the spatial and spectral differences between MODIS and VIIRS, it is worth investigating whether VIIRS can replace MODIS as input data for near real-time monitoring. In this article, we compared the performance of the NRT-CCDC (Near Real-Time Continuous Change Detection and Classification) algorithm using the Terra/ and Aqua/MODIS composites at 250 m resolution, Terra/MODIS 250 m and 500 m surface reflectance, Aqua/MODIS 250 m and 500 m surface reflectance, and VIIRS 500 m surface reflectance. We found that the algorithm using composites from both MODIS sensors and Terra/MODIS data at 250 m resolution outperformed the results obtained when using VIIRS data. The results were similar when using 500 m data from Terra/MODIS alone compared to VIIRS data. We found that a morning overpass, like that of Terra, is preferable to an afternoon overpass, which is employed by VIIRS and Aqua. Spatial and temporal resolution of the input data are two key factors in successful near real-time monitoring of forest disturbance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fibroblasts are an important resident cell population in the heart involved in maintaining homeostasis and structure during normal conditions. They are also crucial in disease states for sensing signals and initiating the appropriate repair responses to maintain the structural integrity of the heart. This sentinel role of cardiac fibroblasts occurs, in part, through their ability to secrete cytokines. beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR) are also critical regulators of cardiac function in the normal and diseased state and a major therapeutic target clinically. beta AR are known to influence cytokine secretion in various cell types and they have been shown to be involved in cytokine production in the heart, but their role in regulating cytokine production in cardiac fibroblasts is not well understood. Thus, we hypothesized that beta AR activation on cardiac fibroblasts modulates cytokine production to influence fibroblast function. Using primary fibroblast cultures from neonatal rats and adult mice, increased interleukin (IL)-6 expression and secretion occurred following beta 2AR activation. The use of pharmacological inhibitors and genetic manipulations showed that IL-6 elevations occurred through the G alpha s-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and resulted in increased fibroblast proliferation. In vivo, a lack of beta 2AR resulted in increased infarct size following myocardial infarction and impaired wound closure in a murine dermal wound healing assay. These findings identify an important role for beta 2AR in regulating fibroblast proliferation through G alpha s/ERK1/2-dependent alterations in IL-6 and may lead to the development of improved heart failure therapies through targeting fibrotic function of beta 2AR.

TI  - Object-Oriented LULC Classification in Google Earth Engine Combining SNIC, GLCM, and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a versatile cloud platform in which pixel-based (PB) and object-oriented (OO) Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) classification approaches can be implemented, thanks to the availability of the many state-of-art functions comprising various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. OO approaches, including both object segmentation and object textural analysis, are still not common in the GEE environment, probably due to the difficulties existing in concatenating the proper functions, and in tuning the various parameters to overcome the GEE computational limits. In this context, this work is aimed at developing and testing an OO classification approach combining the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm to identify spatial clusters, the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to calculate cluster textural indices, and two ML algorithms (Random Forest (RF) or Support Vector Machine (SVM)) to perform the final classification. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is applied to the main seven GLCM indices to synthesize in one band the textural information used for the OO classification. The proposed approach is implemented in a user-friendly, freely available GEE code useful to perform the OO classification, tuning various parameters (e.g., choose the input bands, select the classification algorithm, test various segmentation scales) and compare it with a PB approach. The accuracy of OO and PB classifications can be assessed both visually and through two confusion matrices that can be used to calculate the relevant statistics (producer's, user's, overall accuracy (OA)). The proposed methodology was broadly tested in a 154 km(2) study area, located in the Lake Trasimeno area (central Italy), using Landsat 8 (L8), Sentinel 2 (S2), and PlanetScope (PS) data. The area was selected considering its complex LULC mosaic mainly composed of artificial surfaces, annual and permanent crops, small lakes, and wooded areas. In the study area, the various tests produced interesting results on the different datasets (OA: PB RF (L8 = 72.7%, S2 = 82%, PS = 74.2), PB SVM (L8 = 79.1%, S2 = 80.2%, PS = 74.8%), OO RF (L8 = 64%, S2 = 89.3%, PS = 77.9), OO SVM (L8 = 70.4, S2 = 86.9%, PS = 73.9)). The broad code application demonstrated very good reliability of the whole process, even though the OO classification process resulted, sometimes, too demanding on higher resolution data, considering the available computational GEE resources.

TI  - El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects on the variability of Patos Lagoon Suspended Particulate Matter
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - South America is particularly subject to El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-triggered phenomena, with above-average precipitation during ENSO warm events (El Nino) and below-average precipitation during cold events (La Nina). Seventeen years (2003-2019) of reflectance data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua sensor were used to quantify the Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) distribution and variability in Patos Lagoon, southern Brazil, based on three semi-analytical algorithms. An atmospheric correction suitable for extremely turbid coastal waters was applied. Occasional negative retrievals of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products were filtered and removed. SPM concentrations were modeled from filtered Rrs values by applying the chosen semi analytical algorithms: a single band algorithm, a weighted algorithm, and a multi-band algorithm (referred here as NECHAD10, HAN16, and NOVOA17, respectively). After those steps, the daily modeled SPM data were averaged into eight-day, monthly, and yearly composites. SPM time series were then compared to the ENSO index and environmental parameters. As a result of substantial interannual variability, the highest SPM concentrations were found to match El-Nino events (in 2009 and 2012) while the lowest corresponded to a strong La Nina (2010) and a neutral year (2014). The modeled SPM was compared to in-situ SPM data to ensure the applicability to/in Patos Lagoon. Our main results suggest that while the three tested algorithms allow the analysis of temporal and spatial SPM variability, HAN16 and NOVOA17 seem to provide the best results for the Patos Lagoon region. On the other hand, NECHAD10 yields more satisfactory results considering the yearly and eight-day composites. Therefore, we call attention to the methods of handling data as each approach might lead to a different interpretation of the same phenomena. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimal parameters for delineating agricultural parcels from satellite images based on supervised Bayesian optimization
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information of agricultural parcels is fundamental to any system used in monitoring greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity developments, and nutrient loading in agriculture. The inefficiency of the traditional methods used in obtaining this information is increasingly paving the way for Remote Sensing (RS). The Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS) algorithm is a well-known method for segmenting objects from images. The quality of segmentation depends on the a priori knowledge of which scale, shape and compactness values to use. With each parameter taking a varied range of input values, this research developed an automated approach for identifying the optimal parameter set without testing all possible combinations. At the core of our approach is Bayesian optimization, which is a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) method for maximizing or minimizing an objective function. We maximized the Jaccard index, which is a measure that indicates the similarity between segmented agricultural objects and their corresponding reference parcels. As the optimal parameter combination varies between different agricultural landscapes, they were determined at a grid resolution of 10 km. Mono-temporal Sentinel-2 images covering Lower Saxony in Germany were tiled to these grids and the optimal parameters were subsequently identified for each tiled grid. The optimal parameter combinations identified over the grids varied considerably, which indicated that a single parameter combination would have failed to achieve optimal segmentation. We found that the quality of segmentation correlated with the size of agricultural parcels. Under-segmentation was largely minimized but in areas with a predominant agricultural land-use, it was unavoidable. In agricultural parcels composed of heterogeneous pixels, over-segmentation was prevalent. Our approach outperformed other segmentation optimization methods existing in the literature.

TI  - Assimilation of Sentinel-2 Estimated LAI into a Crop Model: Influence of Timing and Frequency of Acquisitions on Simulation of Water Stress and Biomass Production of Winter Wheat
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 (S2) Toolbox permits for the automated retrieval of leaf area index (LAI). LAI assimilation into crop simulation models could aid to improve the prediction accuracy for biomass at field level. We investigated if the combined effects of assimilation date and corresponding growth stage plus observational frequency have an impact on the crop model-based simulation of water stress and biomass production. We simulated winter wheat growth in nine fields in Germany over two years. S2 LAI estimations for each field were categorized into three phases, depending on the development stage of the crop at acquisition date (tillering, stem elongation, booting to flowering). LAI was assimilated in every possible combinational setup using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). We evaluated the performance of the simulations based on the comparison of measured and simulated aboveground biomass at harvest. The results showed that the effects on water stress remained largely limited, because it mostly occurred after we stopped LAI assimilation. With regard to aboveground biomass, we found that the assimilation of only one LAI estimate from either the tillering or the booting to flowering stage resulted in simulated biomass values similar or closer to measured values than in those where more than one LAI estimate from the stem elongation phase were assimilated. LAI assimilation after the tillering phase might therefore be not necessarily required, as it may not lead to the desired improvement effect.

TI  - Does hospitalization for thromboembolism improve oral anticoagulant adherence in patients with atrial fibrillation?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is not known how medication adherence changes after hospitalization for a sentinel thromboembolic event.Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of hospitalization for ischemic stroke or thromboembolism on postdischarge adherence to oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation.Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental pre-post observational study using a large U.S. commercial insurance health care claims database. Adult patients with atrial fibrillation taking oral anticoagulants with a random hospitalization for a nonbleeding-related reason occurring after the first observed oral anticoagulant prescription fill, with no other admissions within the preceding and following 6 months, were identified in Optum Clinformatics (Eden Prairie, MN) from 2009 to 2016. Adherence was estimated by the proportion of days covered within 6 and 12 months before and after hospitalization. Difference-in-difference analysis using a generalized linear model was employed to compare pre- and post-hospitalization proportions of days covered (PDCs) by reasons for hospitalization (i.e., ischemic stroke or thromboembolism vs. other nonbleeding-related reasons), adjusting for imbalanced baseline characteristics.Results: Of the 21,400 individuals meeting inclusion criteria, 5.4% were hospitalized for ischemic stroke or thromboembolism and 94.6% for other nonbleeding-related reasons. Baseline characteristics were quite similar between groups, except for a few covariables such as age or CHA(2)DS(2) -VASc score. Minority race or ethnicity individuals had 0.7% lower overall PDC than whites (P = 0.006). After covariate adjustment, 6-month adherence declined by 1.1% less in individuals hospitalized for ischemic stroke or thromboembolism, compared with other nonbleeding reasons, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). Similar results were observed for the 12-month window.Conclusion: This real-world study suggests that more effective strategies are needed to improve adherence to oral anticoagulant, particularly after a thromboembolic event.

TI  - Snow cover change and its relationship with land surface temperature and vegetation in northeastern North America from 2000 to 2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover has a major influence on the global energy balance through the reflection of shortwave solar radiation as well as influencing ecological processes and human activity. Numerous studies have found that snow cover extent (SCE) is decreasing in the Northern Hemisphere and this decline appears to be influencing temperatures and might be a major factor in the polar amplification. This research used satellite-derived Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data (MOD10C2), Land Surface Temperature (LST) data (MOD11C3), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (MOD13C2) to detect changes in SCE and its potential relationship to changes in land surface temperature and vegetation growth from 2000 to 2017 over northeastern North America. There is a lack of detailed research concerning these variables for northeastern North America. The data were composited into seasonal and annual (snow-year: September-June) groupings. Two different change analyses were undertaken: 1) significant change using the Mann-Kendall statistical analysis and 2) univariate differencing using three different time periods (3 years, 5 years, 8 years). A regression and correlation analysis was undertaken between SCE and LST and NDVI to determine the relationship between changing SCE and changes in LST and NDVI. Based on the Mann-Kendall statistical change analysis (p-value = 0.05) for the 16-day data (32-day data), the area of declining SCE was more than 12 times the area of increasing SCE (more than 5 times for 32-day data) with declines occurring in all seasons, most notably in fall, June and the entire snow-year. Based on the univariate differencing analysis, SCE declined more than increased 96% of the time. Based on the regression/correlation analysis, SCE explains variability in LST (NDVI) for the snow-year: 43% (51%), spring: 31% (22%), June 34% (no significant relationship), fall: 40% (no significant relationship), and winter with no significant relationship (30%). It was determined that there is a weak to moderate inverse relationship between SCE and LST and a similar, but less prominent relationship between SCE and NDVI. A multiple regression/correlation with SCE and LST (independent) and NDVI (dependent), LST was a better predictor of NDVI than SCE. This relationship indicates that there is a potential positive feedback mechanism warming the region and increasing the region's NDVI.

TI  - Garlic and Winter Wheat Identification Based on Active and Passive Satellite Imagery and the Google Earth Engine in Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Garlic and winter wheat are major economic and grain crops in China, and their boundaries have increased substantially in recent decades. Updated and accurate garlic and winter wheat maps are critical for assessing their impacts on society and the environment. Remote sensing imagery can be used to monitor spatial and temporal changes in croplands such as winter wheat and maize. However, to our knowledge, few studies are focusing on garlic area mapping. Here, we proposed a method for coupling active and passive satellite imagery for the identification of both garlic and winter wheat in Northern China. First, we used passive satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images) to extract winter crops (garlic and winter wheat) with high accuracy. Second, we applied active satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 images) to distinguish garlic from winter wheat. Third, we generated a map of the garlic and winter wheat by coupling the above two classification results. For the evaluation of classification, the overall accuracy was 95.97%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.94 by eighteen validation quadrats (3 km by 3 km). The user's and producer's accuracies of garlic are 95.83% and 95.85%, respectively; and for the winter wheat, these two accuracies are 97.20% and 97.45%, respectively. This study provides a practical exploration of targeted crop identification in mixed planting areas using multisource remote sensing data.

TI  - Unsupervised Change Detection Using Spectrum-Trend and Shape Similarity Measure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of very high resolution (VHR) images contributes to big challenges in change detection. It is hard for traditional pixel-level approaches to achieve satisfying performance due to radiometric difference. This work proposes a novel feature descriptor that is based on spectrum-trend and shape context for VHR remote sensing images. The proposed method is mainly composed of two aspects. The spectrum-trend graph is generated first, and then the shape context is applied in order to describe the shape of spectrum-trend. By constructing spectrum-trend graph, spatial and spectral information is integrated effectively. The approach is performed and assessed by QuickBird and SPOT-5 satellite images. The quantitative analysis of comparative experiments proves the effectiveness of the proposed technique in dealing with the radiometric difference and improving the accuracy of change detection. The results indicate that the overall accuracy and robustness are both boosted. Moreover, this work provides a novel viewpoint for discriminating changed and unchanged pixels by comparing the shape similarity of local spectrum-trend.

TI  - Ice Monitoring in Swiss Lakes from Optical Satellites and Webcams Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous observation of climate indicators, such as trends in lake freezing, is important to understand the dynamics of the local and global climate system. Consequently, lake ice has been included among the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and there is a need to set up operational monitoring capabilities. Multi-temporal satellite images and publicly available webcam streams are among the viable data sources capable of monitoring lake ice. In this work we investigate machine learning-based image analysis as a tool to determine the spatio-temporal extent of ice on Swiss Alpine lakes as well as the ice-on and ice-off dates, from both multispectral optical satellite images (VIIRS and MODIS) and RGB webcam images. We model lake ice monitoring as a pixel-wise semantic segmentation problem, i.e., each pixel on the lake surface is classified to obtain a spatially explicit map of ice cover. We show experimentally that the proposed system produces consistently good results when tested on data from multiple winters and lakes. Our satellite-based method obtains mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores > 93%, for both sensors. It also generalises well across lakes and winters with mIoU scores > 78% and >80% respectively. On average, our webcam approach achieves mIoU values of approximate to 87% and generalisation scores of approximate to 71% and approximate to 69% across different cameras and winters respectively. Additionally, we generate and make available a new benchmark dataset of webcam images (Photi-LakeIce) which includes data from two winters and three cameras.

TI  - Mapping snow cover from daily Collection 6 MODIS products over Austria
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover maps have been successfully applied in regional snow cover mapping and hydrological modelling in many regions. The new MODIS products (i.e. Collection 6) provide information about the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) instead of simple binary information about snow cover of the former products. The objective of this study is to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of different NDSI thresholds used for snow cover mapping and to compare the results with former snow cover classification based on a fixed NDSI threshold (NDSI = 0.4). The accuracy is tested for both Aqua (MYD10A1) and Terra (MOD10A1) daily snow cover products by using daily snow depth observations at 665 climate stations in Austria in the period 2002-2014. The results show the overall classification accuracy over 665 climate stations to be larger than 97% (97.4% for Terra and 97.6% for Aqua) in Austria. The best NDSI thresholds fitted to individual stations can differ from a fixed threshold (NDSI = 0.4) and are sensitive to the snow depth threshold indicating snow cover at the ground. The NDSI thresholds vary seasonally, decrease with increasing elevation and are lower in forested than open land cover settings. We found that the NDSI thresholds fitted to different elevation and land cover classes improve regional snow cover mapping by 3-10% in forested regions above 900 m a.s.l. in January to March.

T2  - PLANT DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Species of Pythium cause root and stem rot in cucurbits, but no formal surveys have been conducted in the United States to identify which species are responsible. The cucurbit hosts bottle gourd, cucumber, Hubbard squash, and watermelon were transplanted in May, July, September, and November into sentinel plots in four and five different fields in 2017 and 2018, respectively, in South Carolina. Eight of the nine fields were replanted in March 2019. Isolates (600) were collected and identified by sequencing DNA of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I region. The four most common species were P. spinosum (45.6% of all isolates), P. myriotylum (20.0%), P. irregulare (15.3%), and P. aphanidermatum (12.8%). P. myriotylum and P. aphanidermatum were predominantly isolated in May, July, and September, whereas P. spinosum and P. irregulare were predominantly isolated in November and March. Isolates of P. ultimum, P. irregulare, and P. spinosum were more virulent than isolates of P. myriotylum and P. aphanidermatum at 25 degrees C. Representative isolates were screened in vitro for sensitivity to three fungicides: mefenoxam, propamocarb, and oxathiapiprolin. All isolates were sensitive to mefenoxam and propamocarb, but these same isolates were insensitive to oxathiapiprolin, except those classified taxonomically in Pythium Glade I.

TI  - RESPECT: Radiology Employees Striving for Productive and Effective Communication
T2  - RADIOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ineffective communication is commonly listed as a root cause of sentinel events and other adverse events in the health care setting. The psychological safety of all employees is considered to be a factor that promotes effective communication. Recently, leaders of a radiology department learned that many of the frontline staff did not feel they were being treated respectfully by radiologists during routine interactions. On a baseline survey, only 48% of technologists, reading room assistants, and child life specialists rated their interactions with radiologists as very good or excellent. An improvement team was formed, representing radiologists, technologists, reading room assistants, and child life specialists throughout the department. The improvement team launched a series of interventions with a goal of increasing the percentage of interactions rated as very good or excellent from 48% to 90%. The improvement team focused interventions on three topics: in-person interactions, telephone interactions, and trainee interactions. By the time of this publication, the median percentage of interactions rated as very good or excellent improved to 75%, with a maximum surveyed value of 90%. (C) RSNA, 2020

TI  - Forecasting Sunflower Grain Yield by Assimilating Leaf Area Index into a Crop Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting sunflower grain yield a few weeks before crop harvesting is of strategic interest for cooperatives that collect and store grains. With such information, they can optimize their logistics and thus reduce the financial and environmental costs of grain storage. To provide these predictions, data assimilation approaches involving the crop model SUNFLO are used. The methods are based on the re-estimation of soil conditions and on the sequential update of crop model states using an ensemble Kalman filter. They combine the simulation of the crop model and time series of leaf area index (LAI) derived from remote sensors and extracted over 281 fields near Toulouse, France. A sensitivity analysis is used to identify the most relevant model inputs to consider into the data assimilation process. Results show that data assimilation leads to statistically significant better predictions than the simulation alone (from an RMSE of 9.88 q.ha(-1) to an RMSE 7.49 q.ha(-1)). Significant improvement is achieved by relying on smoothed LAI rather than raw LAI. Nevertheless, there is still an over estimation of the grain yield that can be partially explained by the limiting factors observed on the fields and the forecast yield still need improvements to meet the required applications' accuracy.

TI  - Labor market impacts and responses: The economic consequences of a marine environmental disaster
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the aggregate and distributional labor-market impacts of a large-scale marine environmental crisis caused by an industrial pollution in Vietnam. Combining labor force surveys with a novel satellite data on fishing-boat detection, the analysis finds negative and heterogeneous impacts on fishery incomes and employment, and uncovers interesting coping patterns. Satellite data suggest that the affected upstream fishers traveled north to unaffected area to continue fishing. These individuals thus bore a lower income damage. The affected downstream fishers, instead, were more likely to reduce fishing hours and work secondary jobs. The paper also finds evidence on a gradual decline in the damages on fishing intensity and fishery incomes, and a positive labor-market spillover to freshwater fishery.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy versus pelvic lymphadenectomy in early-stage cervical cancer: a multi-center randomized trial (PHENIX/CSEM 010)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThere is no accepted strategy for applying sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy as an alternative to pelvic lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer. It is unclear whether and when pelvic lymphadenectomy can be safely replaced by SLN biopsy alone.Primary ObjectiveTo comprehensively compare the oncological outcomes of SLN biopsy with pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with and without SLN metastasis.Study HypothesisIt is hypothesized that the oncological outcomes provided by SLN biopsy are non-inferior to those of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with clinically early-stage cervical cancer if risk-adapted adjuvant treatments are given.Trial DesignAll eligible patients will undergo SLN biopsy at the start of surgery. The resected SLNs will be submitted for frozen section examination. and patients will be triaged into the PHENIX-I (SLN-negative) or PHENIX-II (SLN-positive) cohort. In each cohort of this trial, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the experimental (SLN biopsy alone) or reference (pelvic lymphadenectomy) arm. Radical hysterectomy will be performed for all patients, and adjuvant treatments will be planned according to post-operative pathological factors.Major Inclusion/Exclusion CriteriaPatients aged between 18 and 65 years with histologically confirmed, untreated stage IA1 (lymphovascular space involvement), IA2, IB1, and IB2 cervical squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma.Primary EndpointThe primary endpoint is disease-free survival.Sample SizeEstimated sample sizes of 830 and 250 are required to fulfill the study objectives of PHENIX-I and II, respectively.Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting ResultsAs of May 2020, more than 600 eligible patients have been enrolled. Enrollment is expected to be completed by December 2022, and presentation of results is expected in 2026.

TI  - Bringing Bathymetry LiDAR to Coastal Zone Assessment: A Case Study in the Southern Baltic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major tasks in environmental protection is monitoring the coast for negative impacts due to climate change and anthropopressure. Remote sensing techniques are often used in studies of impact assessment. Topographic and bathymetric procedures are treated as separate measurement methods, while methods that combine coastal zone analysis with underwater impacts are rarely used in geotechnical analyses. This study presents an assessment of the bathymetry airborne system used for coastal monitoring, taking into account environmental conditions and providing a comparison with other monitoring methods. The tests were carried out on a section of the Baltic Sea where, despite successful monitoring, coastal degradation continues. This technology is able to determine the threat of coastal cliff erosion (based on the geotechnical analyses). Shallow depths have been reported to be a challenge for bathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), due to the difficulty in separating surface, water column and bottom reflections from each other. This challenge was overcome by describing the classification method used which was the CANUPO classification method as the most suitable for the point cloud processing. This study presents an innovative approach to identifying natural hazards, by combining analyses of coastal features with underwater factors. The main goal of this manuscript is to assess the suitability of using bathymetry scanning in the Baltic Sea to determine the factors causing coastal erosion. Furthermore, a geotechnical analysis was conducted, taking into account geometrical ground change underwater. This is the first study which uses a coastal monitoring approach, combining geotechnical computations with remote sensing data. This interdisciplinary scientific research can increase the awareness of the environmental processes.

TI  - Dialogue, Worldview Inclusivity, and Intra-Religious Diversity: Addressing Diversity through Religious Education in the Finnish Basic Education Curriculum
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to discuss how religious and non-religious diversity are addressed in the current national core curriculum for religious education (RE) in basic education in Finland. We first discuss the educational developments behind the Finnish curricular reform, and then focus on issues related to RE and RE research in Finland. We then describe the key contextual contributors to the current RE curriculum in basic education before proceeding to examine how diversity is addressed in the curriculum. Based on our examination, we identify four themes in the curriculum: inter-religious diversity, religious and non-religious worldviews, cultural diversity, and dialogue skills. In RE, diversity is largely addressed within a framework of religion and multiculturality. The article ends with a call for renewal of research foci in RE.

TI  - Vertical Accuracy of Freely Available Global Digital Elevation Models (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freely available global digital elevation models (DEMs) are important inputs for many research fields and applications. During the last decade, several global DEMs have been released based on satellite data. ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, but the more recently released, AW3D30, TanDEM-X and MERIT, are being increasingly used. Many researchers have studied the quality of these DEM products in recent years. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their quality over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. To provide this comparison, we examined the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four geographic regions with different topographic and land use conditions. We used local high-precision elevation models (Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Pleiades-1A) as reference models and all global models were resampled to reference model resolution (1m). In total, 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed. To estimate the accuracy, we generated error rasters by subtracting each reference model from the corresponding global DEM and calculated descriptive statistics for this difference (e.g., median, mean, root-mean-square error (RMSE)). We also assessed the vertical accuracy as a function of the slope, slope aspect, and land cover. We found that slope had the strongest effect on DEM accuracy, with no relationship for slope aspect. The AW3D30 was the most robust and had the most stable performance in most of the tests and is therefore the best choice for an analysis of multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also performed well where available, whereas NASADEM, as a successor of SRTM, showed only slight improvement in comparison to SRTM. MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well despite their lower spatial resolution.

TI  - Winter wheat growth assessment using Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI) in Bhuj Taluka, Gujarat State, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study on winter crop growth monitoring in Bhuj Taluka of Kachchh district was carried out using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data (spatial resolution 10-m). Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data for the period from October-2018 to March-2019 was analysed in this study. The major objective of this study was to generate crop growth profiles of different crops and identify the relationships between crop phenology and crop growth stages by generating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles of wheat and mustard crops.The results of spectral behavior of wheat (normal & late sown) and mustard during active growth stages indicated that these winter crops have distinct spectral signatures in Sentinel-2 spectral bands. The NDVI growth profiles of wheat and mustard indicate the temporal variations during different growth stages of these crops. The maximum temporal variations were observed during early growth stages to flowering & grain filling stages. The difference in sowing dates of wheat and mustard crops result in different phenological stages of these winter crops. The NDVI curve of Rabi Season-2018-19 was divided into different phenological growth phases namely, i) Phase-I: G(0) (Spectral emergence) to G(1)(Flag leaf emergence), Phase-II: G(1) (Flag leaf emergence) to G(max) (Flowering and Grain filling), Phase-III: G(max) (Flowering and Grain filling) to G(2) (Dough Stage) and Phase-IV: G(2) (Dough Stage) to G(3) (Physiological Maturity). The temporal changes in the NDVI was analysed by computing the Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI) between different phenological phases from G(0) to G(3).Mean TNPI values of wheat crop for different phenological phases were computed which indicated that rising part of NDVI profile of growth phases from G(0) to G(max) higher TNPI values whereas the declining part of NDVI profile of growth phases from G(max) to G(3) showed lower TNPI values. The difference NDVI images were generated using the NDVI images of two different phenological phases of wheat crop which represent the temporal changes in wheat crop greenness, where "0" represents no temporal change and "1" represents the maximum temporal change in vegetation greenness across wheat crop areas in the study area.

TI  - The Mw = 5.6 Kanallaki Earthquake of 21 March 2020 in West Epirus, Greece: Reverse Fault Model from InSAR Data and Seismotectonic Implications for Apulia-Eurasia Collision
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We identify the source of the Mw = 5.6 earthquake that hit west-central Epirus on 21 March 2020 00:49:52 UTC. We use Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar interferograms tied to one permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) station (GARD). We model the source by inverting the INSAR displacement data. The inversion model suggests a shallow source on a low-angle fault (39 degrees) dipping towards east with a centroid depth of 8.5 km. The seismic moment deduced from our model agrees with those of the published seismic moment tensors. This geometry is compatible with reverse-slip motion along the west-verging Margariti thrust fault that accommodates part of the convergence within the collision zone between Apulia and Eurasia. We also processed new GNSS data and estimate a total convergence rate between Apulia and Eurasia of 8.9 mm yr(-1), of which the shortening of the crust between the Epirus coastal GNSS stations and station PAXO in the Ionian Sea (across the Ionian Thrust) is equivalent to similar to 50% of it or 4.6 mm yr(-1). By back-slip modelling we found that a 60-km wide deformation zone takes up nearly most of the convergence between Apulia-Eurasia, trending N318 degrees E. Its central axis runs along the southwest coast of Corfu, along the northeast coast of Paxoi, heading toward the northern extremity of the Lefkada island. The island of Paxoi appears kinematically as part of the Apulian plate.

TI  - Association between STI screening intensity in men who have sex with men and gonococcal susceptibility in 21 States in the USA: an ecological study
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesAntimicrobial resistance is generally linked to antimicrobial selection pressure. Antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections frequently emerge in core groups. We hypothesised that these groups are more often exposed to antimicrobials as a consequence of the repeated treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and that frequent STI screening in asymptomatic patients may contribute indirectly to antimicrobial exposure. In this study, we explored the ecological association between screening intensity in men who have sex with men and antimicrobial susceptibility in N. gonorrhoeae in the USA.MethodsData on STI screening intensity came from the American Men's Internet Survey between October 2014 and March 2015. Data on gonococcal susceptibility to azithromycin, ceftriaxone and cefixime were used from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project in 2015. Spearman's correlation was used to determine the association between these two variables.ResultsA positive ecological association was found between STI screening intensity and geometric mean gonococcal minimum inhibitory concentration for ceftriaxone (rho=0.42, p=0.031) and cefixime (rho=0.42, p=0.029), but not for azithromycin (rho=0.31, p=0.11). The above results must be interpreted with caution as many limitations apply.ConclusionsVariation in STI screening intensity may contribute to differences in gonococcal resistance between States in the USA.

TI  - Water vapor satellite products in the European Arctic: An inter-comparison against GNSS data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Arctic is a region of high interest for climate change. Water vapor plays a fundamental role in global warming; therefore, high-quality water vapor monitoring is essential for assimilation in forecast simulations. The seven analyzed instruments on-board satellite platforms are: Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME-2), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), SCanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Carthography (SCIAMACHY) and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER). The GNSS data from Ny-angstrom lesund are matched to satellite observations of IWV in a 30-min temporal window, and 100-km radius. Then, statistics and the distribution of satellite-ground differences under different conditions are studied. The correlation coefficient (R-2) with ground-based measurements is about 0.7 for all products except OMI (R-2= 0.5), and MODIS NIR and POLDER (R-2=0.3). OMI shows high bias and variability compared to the rest of products. RMSE values are of the order of 3 mm for all satellites, except OMI (7 mm) and POLDER (5 mm). Bias (MBE) is negligible for AIRS, close to +1.6 mm for GOME-2 and MODIS IR, +0.8 mm for MODIS NIR, +5.9 mm for OMI, -2.7 mm for POLDER and -1.2 mm for SCIAMCHY. All satellite products tend to overestimate small IWV values and underestimate large IWV values. Variability also increases with IWV. An underestimation of the satellite products and an increase on the variability is generally observed for large Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) values. Under cloudy conditions, underestimation and variability are increased. Seasonal behavior is driven by the typical cloud cover (CC), SZA, and IWV values. In summer, it is typical to find conditions with large IWV, small SZA and large CC values. Therefore, in summer months satellite products are more biased (either positively or negatively) and with more variability, but in relative terms they are less biased and exhibit less variability.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection and Mapping: A 50-Year Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill detection and mapping (OSPM) is an extremely relevant issue from a scientific point of view due to the environmental impact on coastal and marine ecosystems. In this study, we present a new approach to assess scientific literature for the past 50 years. In this sense, our study aims to perform a bibliometric and network analysis using a literature review on the application of OSPM to assess researchers and trends in this field of science. In methodological terms we used the Scopus base to search for articles in the literature, then we used bibliometric tools to access information and reveal quantifying patterns in this field of literature. Our results suggest that the detection of oil in the sea has undergone a great evolution in the last decades and there is a strong relationship between the technological evolution aimed at detection with the improvement of remote sensing data acquisition methods. The most relevant contributions in this field of science involved countries such as China, the United States, and Canada. We revealed aspects of great importance and interest in OSPM literature using a bibliometric and network approach to give a clear overview of this field's research trends.

TI  - Land use and land cover classification and change analysis in the area surrounding the Manglares Churute Ecological Reserve (Ecuador) using Sentinel-1 time series
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Management practices adopted in protected natural areas often ignore the relevance of the territory surrounding the actual protected land (buffer area). These areas can be the source of impacts that threaten the protected ecosystems. This paper reports a case study where a time series of Sentinel-1 imagery was used to classify the land-use/land-cover and to evaluate its change between 2015 and 2018 in the buffer area around the Manglares Churute Ecological Reserve (REMCh) in Ecuador. Sentinel-1 scenes were processed and ground-truth data were collected consisting of samples of the main land-use/land-cover classes in the region. Then, a Random Forests (RF) classification algorithm was built and optimized, following a five-fold cross validation scheme using the training dataset (70% of the ground truth). The remaining 30% was used for validation, achieving an Overall Accuracy of 84%, a Kappa coefficient of 0.8 and successful class performance metrics for the main crops and land use classes. Results were poorer for heterogeneous and minor classes, nevertheless the performance of the classification was deemed sufficient for the targeted change analysis. Between 2015 and 2018, an increase in the area covered by intensive land uses was evidenced, such as shrimp farms and sugarcane, which replaced traditional crops (mainly rice and banana). Even though such changes only affected the land area around the natural reserve, they might affect its water quality due to the use of fertilizers and pesticides that easily. Therefore, it is recommended that these buffer areas around natural protected areas be taken into account when designing adequate environmental protection measures and polices.

TI  - Green Apartheid: Urban green infrastructure remains unequally distributed across income and race geographies in South Africa
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green infrastructure provides ecosystem services that are essential to human wellbeing. A dearth of national-scale assessments in the Global South has precluded the ability to explore how political regimes, such as the forced racial segregation in South Africa during and after Apartheid, have influenced the extent of and access to green infrastructure over time. We investigate whether there are disparities in green infrastructure distributions across race and income geographies in urban South Africa. Using open-source satellite imagery and geographic information, along with national census statistics, we find that public and private green infrastructure is more abundant, accessible, greener and more treed in high-income relative to low-income areas, and in areas where previously advantaged racial groups (i.e. White citizens) reside. Areas with White residents report 6-fold higher income, have 11.7% greater tree cover, 8.9% higher vegetation greenness and live 700 m closer to a public park than areas with predominantly Black African, Indian, and Coloured residents. The inequity in neighborhood greenness levels has been maintained (for Indian and Coloured areas) and further entrenched (for Black African areas) since the end of Apartheid in 1994 across the country. We also find that these spatial inequities are mirrored in both private (gardens) and public (street verges, parks, green belts) spaces, hinting at the failure of governance structures to plan for and implement urban greening initiatives. By leveraging open-access satellite data and methods presented here, there is scope for civil society to monitor urban green infrastructure over time and thereby hold governments accountable to addressing environmental justice imperatives in the future.

TI  - Role of FDG PET in the assessment of locoregional and distant melanoma stadification
T2  - MEDECINE NUCLEAIRE-IMAGERIE FONCTIONNELLE ET METABOLIQUE
M3  - Review
AB  - FDG PET/CT is a relevant examination for patients with high-risk melanoma. For early stages with thickness >= 1 mm, lymph node ultrasound, and when negative, lymphoscintigraphy for determination of sentinel lymph node, remain necessary. For more advanced stages, FDG PET can map the lesions and guide the therapeutic strategy, either with surgical management, or systemic therapy (or sometimes both). In patients with high-risk melanoma, it allows to detect relapses early, including in asymptomatic patients, with a potential impact on therapeutic decisions. Beside the detection of classical secondary localizations, FDG PET has the advantage of allowing whole-body imaging, the identification of soft tissue lesions, frequent in melanomas, as well as rarer sites of involvement, such as those of the gastrointestinal tract. For the assessment of cerebral and leptomeningeal involvement, MRI remains mandatory. Evolutions in the therapeutic management of advanced melanomas, and the search for biomarkers to guide the therapeutic strategy, ask for more refined analyses of PET, with metabolic tumour volume analysis and radiomics. The combination of metabolic imaging data with biological and molecular data, and the development of new PET tracers may improve the assessment of prognosis and the prediction of response to therapies, in order to tailor the therapeutic strategy to each patient. Further studies are needed to consolidate the role of PET/CT in this disease for which numerous therapeutic innovations are emerging. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Postfire Tree Structure from High-Resolution LiDAR and RBR Sentinel 2A Fire Severity Metrics in a <i>Pinus halepensis</i>-Dominated Burned Stand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree and plant structures remaining after fires reflect well their degree of consumption, and are therefore good indicators of fire severity. Satellite optical images are commonly used to estimate fire severity. However, depending on the severity of a fire, these sensors have a limited ability to penetrate the canopy down to the ground. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can overcome this limitation. Assessing the differences between areas that have been burned in different fire severities based on satellite images of plant and tree structures remaining after fires is important, given its widespread use to characterize fires and fire impacts (e.g., carbon emissions). Here, we measured the remaining tree structures after a fire in a forest stand burned in SE Spain in the summer of 2017. We used high-resolution LiDAR data, acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) six months after the fire. This information was crossed with fire severity levels based on the relativized burnt ratio (RBR) derived from Sentinel 2A images acquired a few months before and after fire. LiDAR tree structure data derived from vertical canopy profiles (VCPs) were classified into three clusters, using hierarchical principal component analysis (HPCA), followed by a random forest (RF) to select the most important variables in distinguishing the cluster groups. Among these, crown leaf area index (LAI), crown leaf area density (LAD), crown volume, tree height and tree height skewness, among others, were the most significant variables, and reflected well the degree of combustion undergone by the trees based on the response of these variables to variations in fire severity from RBR Sentinel 2A. LiDAR metrics were able to distinguish crown fire from surface fire through changes in the understory LAI and understory and midstory vegetation. The three tree structure clusters were well separated among each other and significantly related with the RBR Sentinel 2A-derived fire severity categories. Unburned and low-severity burned areas were more diverse in tree structures than moderate and high severity burned ones. The LiDAR metrics derived from VCPs demonstrated promising potential for characterizing fine-grained post-fire plant structures and fire damage when crossed with satellite-based fire severity metrics, turning into a promising approach for better characterizing fire impacts at a resolution needed for many ecological processes.

TI  - Wave energy flux variability and trend along the United Arab Emirates coastline based on a 40-year hindcast
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave climate and associated energy characterization is essential for an assessment of a country's renewable energy potential. A wave model was validated against satellite data with good performance in terms of error metrics. The hindcast data, covering the period 1979-2018, was used to describe the spatial, seasonal and interannual variability and trend of wave energy flux along the United Arab Emirates coastline. The annual mean wave energy flux along the study area is higher at the central region reducing towards the south and north. The wave energy shows a clear seasonality and interannual variability for all locations with higher and lower energy during winter and autumn, respectively. A trend analysis of the historical data indicates an increase in annual mean energy flux along the coast. Along-shore, seasonal and interannual variability of wave energy flux and direction should be considered in the initial stages of marine renewable energy projects. A detailed analysis of historical wave energy trends and influence of large-scale climate indices will be particularly relevant for longer-term projects. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contemporary Fire Regimes Provide a Critical Perspective on Restoration Needs in the Mexico-United States Borderlands
T2  - AIR SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between people and wildfire has always been paradoxical: fire is an essential ecological process and management tool, but can also be detrimental to life and property. Consequently, fire regimes have been modified throughout history through both intentional burning to promote benefits and active suppression to reduce risks. Reintroducing fire and its benefits back into the Sky Island mountains of the United States-Mexico borderlands has the potential to reduce adverse effects of altered fire regimes and build resilient ecosystems and human communities. To help guide regional fire restoration, we describe the frequency and severity of recent fires over a 32-year period (1985-2017) across a vast binational region in the United States-Mexico borderlands and assess variation in fire frequency and severity across climate gradients and in relation to vegetation and land tenure classes. We synthesize relevant literature on historical fire regimes within 9 major vegetation types and assess how observed contemporary fire characteristics vary from expectations based on historical patterns. Less than 28% of the study area burned during the observation period, excluding vegetation types in warmer climates that are not adapted to fire (eg, Desertscrub and Thornscrub). Average severity of recent fires was low despite some extreme outliers in cooler, wetter environments. Midway along regional temperature and precipitation gradients, approximately 64% of Pine-Oak Forests burned at least once, with fire frequencies that mainly corresponded to historical expectations on private lands in Mexico but less so on communal lands, suggesting the influence of land management. Fire frequency was higher than historical expectations in extremely cool and wet environments that support forest types such as Spruce-Fir, indicating threats to these systems possibly attributable to drought and other factors. In contrast, fires were absent or infrequent across large areas of Woodlands (similar to 73% unburned) and Grasslands (similar to 88% unburned) due possibly to overgrazing, which reduces abundance and continuity of fine fuels needed to carry fire. Our findings provide a new depiction of fire regimes in the Sky Islands that can help inform fire management, restoration, and regional conservation planning, fostered by local and traditional knowledge and collaboration among landowners and managers.

TI  - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) Pollution Monitoring with Sentinel-5P Satellite Imagery over Europe during the Coronavirus Pandemic Outbreak
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the main air quality pollutants of concern in many urban and industrial areas worldwide, and particularly in the European region, where in 2017 almost 20 countries exceeded the NO2 annual limit values imposed by the European Commission Directive 2008/50/EC (EEA, 2019). NO2 pollution monitoring and regulation is a necessary task to help decision makers to search for a sustainable solution for environmental quality and population health status improvement. In this study, we propose a comparative analysis of the tropospheric NO2 column spatial configuration over Europe between similar periods in 2019 and 2020, based on the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-5P products. The results highlight the NO2 pollution dynamics over the abrupt transition from a normal condition situation to the COVID-19 outbreak context, characterized by a short-time decrease of traffic intensities and industrial activities, revealing remarkable tropospheric NO2 column number density decreases even of 85% in some of the European big cities. The validation approach of the satellite-derived data, based on a cross-correlation analysis with independent data from ground-based observations, provided encouraging values of the correlation coefficients (R-2), ranging between 0.5 and 0.75 in different locations. The remarkable decrease of NO2 pollution over Europe during the COVID-19 lockdown is highlighted by S-5P products and confirmed by the Industrial Production Index and air traffic volumes.

TI  - Catastrophic flood of August 2018, Kerala, India: Study of partitioning role of lineaments in modulating flood level using remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - India's Kerala state, sandwiched between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats, witnessed a catastrophic flood during the southwest monsoon in mid-August 2018. Unusual precipitation (24% in excess of the normal) coupled with opening of flood gates of dams in the highland and high tide level in the coastal plains were the drivers of the flood. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired from multiple satellites were used to demarcate area inundated by flood, which covered over 521 km(2) in the coastal lowlands. Flood waters receded rather abruptly during the initial days between 18 August and August 21, 2018 where the flooded area dropped from 521 to 395 km(2) and water levels dropped from 10 m to 5 m. But subsequent level fall was tremendously slow, taking 40 days to reach similar to 50% or 260 km(2) on September 26, 2018. The chaotic distribution and discharge of flood water, together with structural controls of the coastal lowland, initiated the investigation to examine whether or not geologic lineaments of the basement terrain was involved in modulating the location and discharge of flood waters. The investigation resulted in identifying two scenarios around the lineaments: (1) pooling of flood water over extended periods and (2) rapid discharge of flood water, named as pooling and discharging lineaments, respectively. Flood water recession, for the 40 days, through discharging lineaments was 87.15% when compared to the low rate of recession through pooling lineaments (33.07%). Moreover, morphology-wise discharging lineaments are characterized by high relative relief whereas pooling lineaments were depressions. Results suggest, other than lineament's role in aiding water percolation, lineaments can also act as conduits for rapid discharge.

TI  - Stewart-Treves syndrome: Case report and literature review
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymphangiosarcoma, or Stewart-Treves Syndrome (STS), is a very rare skin angiosarcoma with poor prognosis, which usually affects the upper limbs of patients who underwent breast cancer surgery, including axillary dissection followed by radiotherapy (RT). Cutaneous lymphangiosarcomas, which account for approximately 5% of all angiosarcomas, usually originate in the limb with chronic lymphedema. Lymphatic blockade is involved in the onset of STS. RT contributes indirectly to an increased risk of developing STS by causing axillary-node sclerosis and resulting in a lymphatic blockade and lymphedema. Chronic lymphedema causes local immunodeficiency, which indirectly leads to oncogenesis. Currently, axillary nodes are no longer routinely irradiated after axillary dissection, which is associated with a reduction in the incidence of chronic lymphedema from 40% to 4%. The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy technique is also widespread and the associated risk of lymphedema is further reduced. Thus, the incidence of STS decreased significantly with improved surgical and radiation techniques. The overall prognosis of STS patients is very poor. Only early radical surgical removal, including amputation or disarticulation of the affected limb, or wide excision at an early stage offers the greatest chance of long-term survival. Only a few case reports and series with a small number of patients with lymphangiosarcoma can be found in the literature. We present a case report of the first diagnosed STS at our department in an effort to highlight the need of the consideration of developing lymphangiosarcoma in patients with chronic lymphedema.

TI  - The Representation of the Concept "Road" in Oral Stories of Siberians
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes the concept "road" as represented in oral stories of Siberians. This investigation is part of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of Siberia as a cross-border area. The research materials are: texts of the Tomsk Dialect Corpus, which were recorded during dialectological expeditions from the 1940s to 2019 in the areas where old-timer Middle Ob region dialects are spoken; information from dialect dictionaries, memoirs and oral stories of eyewitnesses and witnesses of dekulakization and exile to the Narym region; materials of the project "Free and Non-Free Siberians" published on the website of the Tomsk Regional Museum of Local Lore. A concept is a unit of consciousness that is represented by means of a language. The article uses a modeling method that is implemented through the description of the nominative field of the concept "road", which includes both direct nominations of the concept itself and nominations of its individual cognitive features. Among the units that represent the concept "road", there are: the word road and its synonym way, their derivatives, as well as words that name roads in accordance with their various characteristics, words of different parts of speech and phrases that contain the seme "road": traffic, taxi, taxi driver, turnpike, country road, to go, to swim, to get lost, and many others. The contextual analysis of the material revealed that the following cognitive features receive language objectification: 1) the size of the road and its importance, 2) the use of roads depending on the time of year, 3) place of laying the road, 4) the kind of transport and method of travel, 5) the material from which the road is made, 5) the quality of the road 6) the direction of the road, 7) the road as an integral part of migration processes, 8) construction, laying and maintenance of roads, 9) the road as a factor in the formation of different social ties, communities and an additional reason for economic activity (crafts, entrepreneurship, etc.), 10) the road as an indicator of the development of Siberia, civilization and improvement, 11) the road as a dangerous place, 12) the road as a way of localization, 13) the road as an attribute of superstitions, rituals. Siberians' autobiographical stories and memoirs contain fragments that reflect the importance and significance of the road in human life. Facts from people's life connected with the road are: birth on the road, road to school/university/institute, wedding, work, moving, death. The road is a significant fragment of the Siberians' worldview; it reflects the spatial and temporal characteristics of people's lives, representing the "friend/foe" opposition. Formal (changes in road categories, obsolescence of expressions, new stable combinations and lexemes) and substantive (new roads, reinterpretation, de-ideologization of road spaces associated with the repressive policy of the state, etc.) transformations in the structure of the concept are due to time (change of epochs) and to political and economic factors.

TI  - Separability of Mowing and Ploughing Events on Short Temporal Baseline Sentinel-1 Coherence Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Short temporal baseline regular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry is a tool well suited for wide area monitoring of agricultural activities, urgently needed in European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) enforcement. In this study, we demonstrate and describe in detail, how mowing and ploughing events can be identified from Sentinel-1 6-day interferometric coherence time series. The study is based on a large dataset of 386 dual polarimetric Sentinel-1 VV/VH SAR and 351 Sentinel-2 optical images, and nearly 2000 documented mowing and ploughing events on more than 1000 parcels (average 10.6 ha, smallest 0.6 ha, largest 108.5 ha). Statistical analysis revealed that mowing and ploughing cause coherence to increase when compared to values before an event. In the case of mowing, the coherence increased from 0.18 to 0.35, while Sentinel-2 NDVI (indicating the amount of green chlorophyll containing biomass) at the same time decreased from 0.75 to 0.5. For mowing, there was virtually no difference between the polarisations. After ploughing, VV-coherence grew up to 0.65 and VH-coherence to 0.45, while NDVI was around 0.2 at the same time. Before ploughing, both coherence and NDVI values were very variable, determined by the agricultural management practices of the parcel. Results presented here can be used for planning further studies and developing mowing and ploughing detection algorithms based on Sentinel-1 data. Besides CAP enforcement, the results are also useful for food security and land use change detection applications.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques to Study Sediment Movement along Harwada Beach, Uttar Kannada, West Coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Beaches, the most dynamic coastal landform on Earth, show dynamic changes over different timescales such as diurnal, tidal, monthly, and seasonal changes. These changes can be constructive or destructive. The long-term studies on beaches help in understanding and planning for any coastal management programs. The present study was undertaken on Harwada Beach located in Karwar of Uttara Kannada district, on the West Coast of India, mainly to understand the morphological changes, sediment movement, and depositional environment through bimonthly beach profiles at five stations. In the present study correlation of the field data along with the remote sensing data (Sentinel 2A multispectral sensor) was carried out to understand the long-term changes. This study shows that the beach has undergone dominant erosion and exhibits cyclic movement of the sediments within the study area. The seasonal and annual study undertaken on Harwada Beach showed that the central part of the study area is most stable during the 4-year observation, while rest of the beach shows erosion.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Land Cover Change Mapping Using Google Earth Engine and Ensemble Learning Methods
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study deals with the application of Google Earth Engine (GEE), Landsat data and ensemble-learning methods (ELMs) to map land cover (LC) change over a decade in the Kaski district of Nepal. As Nepal has experienced extensive changes due to natural and anthropogenic activities, monitoring such changes are crucial for understanding relationships and interactions between social and natural phenomena and to promote better decision-making. The main novelty lies in applying the XGBoost classifier for LC mapping over Nepal and monitoring the decadal changes of LC using ELMs. To map the LC change, a yearly cloud-free composite Landsat image was selected for the year 2010 and 2020. Combining the annual normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference built-up index and modified normalized difference water index, with elevation and slope data from shuttle radar topography mission, supervised classification was performed using a random forest and extreme gradient boosting ELMs. Post classification change detection, validation and accuracy assessment were executed after the preparation of the LC maps. Three evaluation indices, namely overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient, and F1 score from confusion matrix reports, were calculated for all the points used for validation purposes. We have obtained an OA of 0.8792 and 0.875 for RF and 0.8926 and 0.8603 for XGBoost at the 95% confidence level for 2010 and 2020 LC maps, which are better for mountainous terrain. The applied methodology could be significant in utilizing the big earth observation data and overcoming the traditional computational challenges using GEE. In addition, the quantification of changes over time would be helpful for decision-makers to understand current environmental dynamics in the study area.

TI  - Suspended Sediment within Estuaries and along Coasts: A Review of Spatial and Temporal Variations based on Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Suspended sediment is an essential factor in the ecological environment of estuaries and coasts because it significantly affects the optical properties of the water body. Studies on suspended sediment concentration in estuaries and coasts have garnered attention for a long time. Remote sensing is important in the monitoring of suspended sediment. Previous studies have made considerable technological and theoretical progress and obtained significant achievements. However, several current studies have focused on the establishment of suspended sediment-retrieval models. There is still considerable scope of extensive and applied research on suspended sediment in estuaries and coasts. Based on a general retrospect of research studies on suspended sediment, this article summarizes the processes and tendency of suspended sediment development and provides perspectives for future studies on suspended sediment in estuaries and coasts. These perspectives include (1) increased focus on the examination of the suspended sediment-retrieval model of the multiple-band forms belonging to nonmonotonic functions and aimed at improving applicability, (2) strengthened research on the impacts of extreme weather conditions on suspended sediment concentration to identify the features of abnormal changes, and (3) increased effort in the research of long-term spatial and temporal variations of suspended sediment concentration in estuaries and coasts to promote better understanding of the rules and trends of its change.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution, Future Trend and Phenology Regularity of Net Primary Productivity of Forests in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is one of the significant indicators to measure environmental changes; thus, the relevant study of NPP in Northeast China, Asia, is essential to climate changes and ecological sustainable development. Based on the Global Production Efficiency (GLO-PEM) model, this study firstly estimated the NPP in Northeast China, from 2001 to 2019, and then analyzed its spatio-temporal evolution, future changing trend and phenology regularity. Over the years, the NPP of different forests type in Northeast China showed a gradual increasing trend. Compared with other different time stages, the high-value NPP (700-1300 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1)) in Changbai Mountain, from 2017 to 2019, is more widely distributed. For instance, the NPP has an increasing rate of 6.92% compared to the stage of 2011-2015. Additionally, there was a significant advance at the start of the vegetation growth season (SOS), and a lag at the end of the vegetation growth season (EOS), from 2001 to 2019. Thus, the whole growth period of forests in Northeast China became prolonged with the change of phenology. Moreover, analysis on the sustainability of NPP in the future indicates that the reverse direction feature of NPP change will be slightly stronger than the co-directional feature, meaning that about 30.68% of the study area will switch from improvement to degradation. To conclude, these above studies could provide an important reference for the sustainable development of forests in Northeast China.

TI  - Proton belt variations traced back to Fengyun-1C satellite observations
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We used historical data to trace trapped protons observed by the Fengyun-1C (FY-1C) satellite at low Earth orbits (-800 km) and chose data at 5-10 MeV, 10-40 MeV, 40-100 MeV, and -100-300 MeV from 25 March to 18 April 2000 to analyze the proton variations. Only one isolated strong storm was associated with a solar proton event during this period, and there was no influence from previous proton variations. Complex dynamic phenomena of proton trapping and loss were affected by this disturbance differently depending on the energy and L location. The flux of 5-10 MeV protons increased and created new trapping with a maximum at L similar to 2.0, and the peak flux was significantly higher than that at the center of the South Atlantic Anomaly. However, at higher L, the flux showed obvious loss, with retreat of the outer boundary from L similar to 2.7 to L similar to 2.5. The increase in the 10-40 MeV proton flux was similar to that of the 5-10 MeV flux; however, the peak flux intensity was lower than that at the center of the South Atlantic Anomaly. The loss of the 10-40 MeV proton flux was closer to the Earth side, and the outer boundary was reduced from L similar to 2.3 to L similar to 2.25. For the higher energy protons of 40-100 MeV and 100-300 MeV, no new trapping was found. Loss of the 40-100 MeV protons was observed, and the outer boundary shifted from L similar to 2.0 to L similar to 1.9. Loss was not obvious for the 100-400 MeV protons, which were distributed within L < 1.8. New proton trapping was more likely to be created at lower energy in the region of solar proton injection by the strong magnetic storm, whereas loss occurred in a wide energy range and reduced the outer boundary on the Earth side. Similar dynamic changes were observed by the NOAA-15 satellite in the same period, but the FY-1C satellite observed more complex changes in lower energy protons. These results revealed that the dynamic behavior of protons with different L-shells was due to differences in the pitch angle. Possible mechanisms related to new trapping and loss are also discussed. These mechanisms are very important for understanding the behavior of the proton belt in the coming solar cycle.

TI  - Automatic Identification and Dynamic Monitoring of Open-Pit Mines Based on Improved Mask R-CNN and Transfer Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the ecological problems caused by mine development become increasingly prominent, the conflict between mining activity and environmental protection is gradually intensifying. There is an urgent problem regarding how to effectively monitor mineral exploitation activities. In order to automatic identify and dynamically monitor open-pit mines of Hubei Province, an open-pit mine extraction model based on Improved Mask R-CNN (Region Convolutional Neural Network) and Transfer learning (IMRT) is proposed, a set of multi-source open-pit mine sample databases consisting of Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2 and Google Earth satellite images with a resolution of two meters is constructed, and an automatic batch production process of open-pit mine targets is designed. In this paper, pixel-based evaluation indexes and object-based evaluation indexes are used to compare the recognition effect of IMRT, faster R-CNN, Maximum Likelihood (MLE) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The IMRT model has the best performance in Pixel Accuracy (PA), Kappa and MissingAlarm, with values of 0.9718, 0.8251 and 0.0862, respectively, which shows that the IMRT model has a better effect on open-pit mine automatic identification, and the results are also used as evaluation units of the environmental damages of the mines. The evaluation results show that level ROMAN NUMERAL ONE (serious) land occupation and destruction of key mining areas account for 34.62%, and 36.2% of topographical landscape damage approached level I. This study has great practical significance in terms of realizing the coordinated development of mines and ecological environments.

TI  - Improved multichannel singular spectrum analysis for post-processing GRACE monthly gravity field models
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) is a powerful tool to extract spatiotemporal signals and filter errors from the noisy time-series of monthly gravity field models from the satellite data of gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE). Since the GRACE monthly gravity models are missed about 17 months, we develop an improved MSSA approach, which can directly process the incomplete time-series without either data interpolation or iteration. The time-series of 14-yr (2002.04-2016.08) monthly gravity field models of CSR-RL06 up to degree and order 60 arc analysed with improved MSSA compared to the MSSA with linear data interpolation and iteration MSSA. By using our improved MSSA approach, the first 11 principal components derived can capture 91.18 per cent of the total variance, higher than 85.80 and 86.44 per cent of the total variance, derived by linear interpolation MSSA and iteration MSSA, respectively. The ratios of the latitude weighted RMS over the land and ocean signals are used to evaluate the efficiency of eliminating noise by the MSSA approach. For improved MSSA, the mean RMS ratio of land and ocean signals of all available months is higher than linear interpolation and iteration MSSA, which indicates that improved MSSA can suppress noise more efficiently and extract more geophysical signals from real GRACE data. Furthermore, the 50 repeated experiments show that all the root mean squared errors and mean absolute errors derived by our improved MSSA are smaller than other MSSA approaches. Moreover, the improved MSSA performs still better than other MSSA based approaches for the cases of large data gaps.

TI  - Ensemble machine-learning-based framework for estimating total nitrogen concentration in water using drone-borne hyperspectral imagery of emergent plants: A case study in an arid oasis, NW China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, water-quality problems are crucial to local social demand and human well-being. However, the conventional remote sensing-based direct detection of water quality parameters, especially using spectral reflectance of water, must satisfy certain preconditions (e.g., flat water surface and ideal radiation geometry). In this study, we hypothesized that drone-borne hyperspectral imagery of emergent plants could be better applied to retrieval total nitrogen (TN) concentration in water regardless of preconditions possibly due to the spectral responses of emergent plants on nitrogen removal and water purification. To test this hypothesis, a total of 200 groups of bootstrap samples were used to examine the relationship between the extracted TN concentrations from the drone-borne hyperspectral imagery of emergent plants and the experimentally measured TN concentrations in Ebinur Lake Oasis using four machine learning (ML) models (Partial Least Squares (PLS), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Gaussian Process (GP)). Through the introduction of the fractional order derivative (FOD), we build a decision-level fusion (DLF) model to minimize the regression results' biases of individual ML models. For individual ML model, GP performed the best. Still, the amount of uncertainty in individual ML models renders their performance to be subpar. The introduction of the DLF model greatly minimizes the regression results' biases. The DLF model allows to reduce potential uncertainties without sacrificing accuracy. In conclusion, the spectral response caused by nitrogen removal and water purification on emergent plants could be used to retrieve TN concentration in water with a DLF model framework. Our study offers a new perspective and a basic scientific support for water quality monitoring in arid regions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Probing Fault Frictional Properties During Afterslip Updip and Downdip of the 2017 <i>Mw</i> 7.3 Sarpol-e Zahab Earthquake With Space Geodesy
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data collected by the Sentinel-1 mission to study the coseismic and postseismic deformation due to the 2017 Mw 7.3 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake that occurred near the Iran-Iraq border in Northwest Zagros. We find that most of the coseismic moment release is between 15- and 21-km depths, well beneath the boundary between the sedimentary cover and underlying basement. Data from four satellite tracks reveal robust postseismic deformation during similar to 12 months after the mainshock (from November 2017 to December 2018). Kinematic inversions show that the observed postseismic InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) displacements are well explained by oblique (thrust + dextral) afterslip both updip and downdip of the coseismic peak slip area. The dip angle of the shallow afterslip fault plane is found to be significantly smaller than that of the coseismic rupture, corresponding to a shallowly dipping detachment located near the base of the sediments or within the basement, depending on the thickness of the sedimentary cover, which is not well constrained over the epicentral area. Aftershocks during the same time period exhibit a similar temporal evolution as the InSAR time series, with most of aftershocks being located within and around the area of maximum surface deformation. The postseismic deformation data are consistent with stress-driven afterslip models, assuming that the afterslip evolution is governed by rate-strengthening friction. The inferred frictional properties updip and downdip of the coseismic rupture are significantly different, which likely reflect differences in fault zone material at different depths along the Zagros.

TI  - Nomogram for predicting axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Many breast cancer patients benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC remains controversial, especially for patients with axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) at diagnosis. We developed a nomogram for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) status after NAC to screen for patients for whom SLNB may be beneficial.Methods: A total of 320 cT1-4N0-1M0 breast cancer patients receiving ALN dissection (ALND) after NAC were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses determined significant factors for predicting ALN status. Efficacy of the resulting nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves, while decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluated net clinical benefit. Our nomogram was validated using female patients grouped according to a diagnosis of node-positive (cN1) or node-negative (cN0) by ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of suspected lymph nodes before NAC.Results: Logistic regression analyses indicated that estrogen receptor (ER), Ki67, degree of tumor regression, clinical tumor T stage after NAC, and ALN Breast Imagining-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category after NAC, were associated with ALN status. The resulting nomogram had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.802 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7485-0.8554], and the calibration plot showed strong uniformity between predicted and actual ALN status. DCA indicated a positive net benefit of nomogram predictions in our cohort. After internal validation, the cN1 and cN0 groups had an AUC of 0.7926 (95% CI, 0.7187-0.8665) and 0.8165 (95% CI, 0.7381-0.8949), respectively. The calibration plot indicated better performance in the cN0 group.Conclusions: After NAC, some patients may benefit from SLNB. Our nomogram predicts ALN status after NAC and has great potential to assist in clinical decision-making.

TI  - Virtual image pair-based spatio-temporal fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion is a technique used to produce images with both fine spatial and temporal resolution. Generally, the principle of existing spatio-temporal fusion methods can be characterized by a unified framework of prediction based on two parts: (i) the known fine spatial resolution images (e.g., Landsat images), and (ii) the fine spatial resolution increment predicted from the available coarse spatial resolution increment (i.e., a downscaling process), that is, the difference between the coarse spatial resolution images (e.g., MODIS images) acquired at the known and prediction times. Owing to seasonal changes and land cover changes, there always exist large differences between images acquired at different times, resulting in a large increment and, further, great uncertainty in downscaling. In this paper, a virtual image pair-based spatio-temporal fusion (VIPSTF) approach was proposed to deal with this problem. VIPSTF is based on the concept of a virtual image pair (VIP), which is produced based on the available, known MODIS-Landsat image pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that compared to the known image pairs, the VIP is closer to the data at the prediction time. The VIP can capture more fine spatial resolution information directly from known images and reduce the challenge in downscaling. VIPSTF is a flexible framework suitable for existing spatial weighting- and spatial unmixing-based methods, and two versions VIPSTF-SW and VIPSTF-SU are, thus, developed. Experimental results on a heterogeneous site and a site experiencing land cover type changes show that both spatial weighting- and spatial unmixing-based methods can be enhanced by VIPSTF, and the advantage is particularly noticeable when the observed image pairs are temporally far from the prediction time. Moreover, VIPSTF is free of the need for image pair selection and robust to the use of multiple image pairs. VIPSTF is also computationally faster than the original methods when using multiple image pairs. The concept of VIP provides a new insight to enhance spatio-temporal fusion by making fuller use of the observed image pairs and reducing the uncertainty of estimating the fine spatial resolution increment.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring of Surface Water Area during 1989-2019 in the Hetao Plain Using Landsat Data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal change of the surface water is very important to agricultural, economic, and social development in the Hetao Plain, as well as the structure and function of the ecosystem. To understand the long-term changes of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain, we used all available Landsat images (7534 scenes) and adopted the modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map the open-surface water from 1989 to 2019 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. We further analyzed precipitation, temperature, and irrigated area, revealing the impact of climate change and human activities on long-term surface water changes. The results show the following. (1) In the last 31 years, the maximum, seasonal, and annual average water body area values in the Hetao Plain have exhibited a downward trend. Meanwhile, the number of maximum, seasonal, and permanent water bodies displayed a significant upward trend. (2) The variation of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain is mainly affected by the maximum water body area, while the variation of the water body number is mainly affected by the number of minimum water bodies. (3) Precipitation has statistically significant positive effects on the water body area and water body number, which has statistically significant negative effects with temperature and irrigation. The findings of this study can be used to help the policy-makers and farmers understand changing water resources and its driving mechanism and provide a reference for water resources management, agricultural irrigation, and ecological protection.

TI  - Inversion of Aerosol Optical Depth in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on PSO Clustering Algorithm
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical thickness (AOD) is an important characterization parameter of aerosol concentration and atmospheric turbidity. Inversion of atmospheric AOD by remote sensing is an important way in the process of atmospheric monitoring and management, and in which the selection of methods suitable for the imaging characteristics of satellite sensors and the type of aerosols in line with the study area has always been the focus and difficulty of AOD inversion. In view of the problem that the traditional dark target method can not be directly applied to the multispectral remote sensing data of Gaofen N (GF-4) satellite, this paper studies the distribution of the red and blue band equivalent surface reflectivity in GF-4 multispectral data and the linear relationship between them, and improves the dark target method to make it suitable for GF-4 satellite multispectral remote sensing data in combination with AOD inversion principle. The effect of input parameters on AOD inversion accuracy in the 6S radiation transfer model was analyzed, and the experimental results showed that aerosol type is one of the key factors affecting the high-precision inversion of AOD. The samples of aerosol characteristics in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area was analyzed by particle swarm optimization (PSO) cluster algorithm, by analyzing the proportion and half-life changes of the clustering results of each aerosol type, the C1 and C4 aerosol types in cluster results and the continental aerosol type of 6S models are finally determined to invert the AOD in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The inversion results were compared with MODIS aerosol products and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) ground-based site data, and the suitability and characteristics of different aerosol types are evaluated by evaluation criteria such as correlation coefficient and absolute error. The experimental results show that the C4 aerosol type, which is dominated by fine particles, is more satisfied with the characteristics of aerosols in the summer and autumn of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and has better consistency with AERONET ground-based data. It is further proved that the PSO clustering algorithm can effectively reduce the influence of aerosol type difference on AOD inversion accuracy.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice with the random forest algorithm using MODIS and SMAP time series
T2  - CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice production is very important for national food security in China. Time series vegetation indices and phenology-based algorithms have been utilized to map paddy rice fields by identifying the flooding and seedling transplanting phases from multitemporal moderate-resolution (500 m to 1 km) images. Satellite imagery in other electromagnetic spectrum such as microwave region provides supplementary information about land surface characteristics such as soil moisture, which may improve the accuracy of rice mapping. In this study, we developed a method for identifying paddy rice at the regional scale based on the potential relationship between soil moisture and crop growth. Random forest classification optimized by the coordinate descent algorithm was used to generate a 500 m resolution paddy rice map with time series downscaled soil moisture based on Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) images and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of the northern Songnen Plain in Northeast China-one of the major paddy rice cultivation regions in China. A combination of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Phenological Parameters (PH), and Soil Moisture (SM) was used to identify the rice fields during the flooding/transplanting and ripening phases. Two scenarios (EVI + L SWI + PH and EVI + L SWI + PH + SM as the input parameters) were developed to extract the paddy rice from the images. A comparison of the two identification scenarios indicated that the addition of the soil moisture to the combination achieved higher identification accuracy, especially at the junction of the different crop phases. The proposed method could be beneficial to researchers attempting to improve the accuracy of paddy rice identification at regional scale. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Resolving and Analyzing Landfast Ice Deformation by InSAR Technology Combined with Sentinel-1A Ascending and Descending Orbits Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed mapping of landfast ice deformation can be used to characterize the rheological behavior of landfast ice effectively and to improve sea ice modeling subsequently. In order to analyze the characteristics, trends and causes of deformation comprehensively and accurately, the Sentinel-1A ascending and descending orbits data were used to detect the horizontal and vertical deformation of the fast ice in the Baltic Sea. Firstly, the fast ice edge lines were acquired through feature extraction with interferometric coherence images and SAR amplitude images. Then, the deformation transformed model was constructed according to the geometric relationship of multi-orbits deformation measurements. Finally, the landfast ice deformations were resolved and the horizontal and vertical deformations were obtained. The results showed that the maximum deformation was-44 cm in horizontal direction and 16 cm in vertical direction within the fast ice region of 960 km(2) during the time from 2 to 16 February 2018. The southwest wind was the principal reason for the deformation, which made the deformation mainly occur in the horizontal direction from east to west. Moreover, the inner fast ice kept stable due to the protection of outer consolidated ice. The results showed that the deformation trend and characteristics can be better understood by using InSAR technology that was combined with multi-orbits SAR data to resolve and analyze the landfast ice deformation.

TI  - MODIS Collection 6.1 3 km resolution aerosol optical depth product: global evaluation and uncertainty analysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, NASA has released the newest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra Collection 6.1 (C6.1) aerosol product generated at a higher spatial resolution of 3 km (i.e., MOD04_3K) with main updates in the radiation calibration and the Dark Target (DT) aerosol algorithm. This product is of great importance for air pollution studies at small to medium scales but has not been fully evaluated. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive validation and error analysis of the MOD04_3K C6.1 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data set against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 AOD measurements at different spatiotemporal scales from 2013 to 2017 over land and ocean. Results suggest that the data quality of the MOD04_3K AOD data set is overall improved at different spatial scales after quality control. In general, the highest-quality 3 km AOD retrievals (quality assurance = 3) and ground-based measurements are highly correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.81), with a mean absolute error of 0.08 and a root-mean-square error of 0.12. About 63% of the data samples fall within the expected error envelope on a global scale. Nevertheless, there is large spatial heterogeneity in the performance at regional and site scales, with the worse accuracy generally observed in areas covered by bright surfaces or dominated by human activities. This is mainly due to the difficulties in estimating surface reflectance and the aerosol-type assumption. In addition, aerosol retrievals are overall overestimated, especially over North America, Europe, and East Asia. Furthermore, the estimation errors and uncertainties are highly related to varying surface and atmospheric aerosol conditions, which become larger with increases in surface brightness, aerosol loading, Angstrom exponent and single scattering albedo. The MODIS 3 km AOD data set is generally less accurate than its coarser-spatial-resolution (10 km) counterpart due to a decrease in the opportunity to discard marginal pixels from the retrieval. Therefore, further algorithm improvements are needed to reduce the estimation uncertainty, especially for heterogeneous urban and bright surfaces.

TI  - A Participatory Science Approach to Expanding Instream Infrastructure Inventories
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, remote sensing data have improved in resolution and become more widely available, bringing new opportunities for its use in environmental science and conservation. One potential application is to identify and map instream infrastructure across the world, with important implications for fisheries, hydrology, flooding, and more. To date, databases of instream infrastructure focus on larger dams with reservoirs that are comparatively easy to detect with remotely sensed imagery. Despite their impact on freshwater ecosystems, smaller infrastructure is often overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we require more systematic approaches, such as the Global River Obstruction Database (GROD) presented here, to map instream infrastructure. We present a participatory approach to identify, map, and validate infrastructure and provide an initial data set for the contiguous United States (n = 4,197). We highlight the value of participatory methods that include the public and suggest ways they could be fused with machine learning for future applications.

TI  - Estimation of Land Subsidence Using Sentinel Image Analysis and Its Relation to Subsurface Lithology Based on Resistivity Data in the Coastal Area of Semarang City, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Semarang city is the capital of the Central Java Province that is experiencing rapid urban growth. Land subsidence in Semarang has been widely reported and its impacts can be seen already in daily life. In order to minimize its damage, land subsidence monitoring is required as a part of natural disaster mitigation. On the other hand. understanding of the subsurface lithology conditions is needed to explore the causes of subsidence in certain areas. One of the methods of monitoring land subsidence is by utilizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite image which is used in this research. In turn, the subsurface lithology can be studied with the geoelectric methods, one of which is the resistivity method. The purpose of this research is to estimate the land subsidence in the Semarang city using the Sentinel Image Analysis by means of the DInSAR Method and its relation with subsurface lithology studied using the resistivity geoclectric method. The result of the research shows that the average value of subsidence was located in the Genuk District area and Semarang Utara District area which each subsidence value is 9.8 cm/year and 12.7 cm/year. This is because the lithology under the surface of the two locations is clay and silt in a soft condition that is thicker than other locations. The saltwater content contributes to the consolidation process in the lithology. There is a tendency that land subsidence is greater in the port and industrial areas than in other regions, due to building loads.

TI  - Discriminating Forest Successional Stages, Forest Degradation, and Land Use in Central Amazon Using ALOS/PALSAR-2 Full-Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We discriminated different successional forest stages, forest degradation, and land use classes in the Tapajos National Forest (TNF), located in the Central Brazilian Amazon. We used full polarimetric images from ALOS/PALSAR-2 that have not yet been tested for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, neither for forest degradation classification in the TNF. Our specific objectives were: (1) to test the potential of ALOS/PALSAR-2 full polarimetric images to discriminate LULC classes and forest degradation; (2) to determine the optimum subset of attributes to be used in LULC classification and forest degradation studies; and (3) to evaluate the performance of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classifications to discriminate LULC classes and forest degradation. PALSAR-2 images from 2015 and 2016 were processed to generate Radar Vegetation Index, Canopy Structure Index, Volume Scattering Index, Biomass Index, and Cloude-Pottier, van Zyl, Freeman-Durden, and Yamaguchi polarimetric decompositions. To determine the optimum subset, we used principal component analysis in order to select the best attributes to discriminate the LULC classes and forest degradation, which were classified by RF. Based on the variable importance score, we selected the four first attributes for 2015, alpha, anisotropy, volumetric scattering, and double-bounce, and for 2016, entropy, anisotropy, surface scattering, and biomass index, subsequently classified by SVM. Individual backscattering indexes and polarimetric decompositions were also considered in both RF and SVM classifiers. Yamaguchi decomposition performed by RF presented the best results, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 76.9% and 83.3%, and Kappa index of 0.70 and 0.80 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The optimum subset classified by RF showed an OA of 75.4% and 79.9%, and Kappa index of 0.68 and 0.76 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. RF exhibited superior performance in relation to SVM in both years. Polarimetric attributes exhibited an adequate capability to discriminate forest degradation and classes of different ecological succession from the ones with less vegetation cover.

TI  - Ekman dynamics variability along the southern coast of Java revealed by satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been widely known that the coastal upwelling along the southern coast of Java is generated by southeasterly wind which induces offshore Ekman Mass Transport (EMT) during southeast monsoon. However, the variability of EMT has not been fully described in previous studies. The present study investigated the variability of Ekman dynamics which consist of EMT and Ekman Pumping Velocity (EPV) along the southern coast of Java, based on remotely sensed data. We demonstrated the incongruity between the distribution of southeasterly wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST) during southeast monsoon which is related to the distribution of Ekman dynamics. Offshore EMT at the western region of the southern coast of Java is stronger than offshore EMT at the eastern region. However, stronger offshore EMT at the western part is inhibited by downwelling EPV while weaker offshore EMT at the eastern part is accelerated by upwelling EPV. Consequently, SSTs at the eastern parts are lower than those at the western parts. Thus, the changes of offshore EMT intensity from eastern to western parts are balanced by their EPV distributions which explain the incongruity between the distribution of wind speed and SST during southeast monsoon. On an interannual timescale, the combination of La Nina and negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events tends to weaken offshore EMT and EPV which reduce the intensity of Chl-abloom and SST cooling during southeast monsoon season. Furthermore, ENSO has a less significant impact on the Ekman dynamics variability than IOD.

TI  - Dynamic change and prediction of vegetation cover in Shenzhen, China from 2000 to 2018
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - With landsat-series multi-temporal image data, percentage of vegetation cover ( PVC ) was estimated by pixel dichotomy. The linear regression analysis and center of gravity migration methods were used to explore the characteristics of the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation cover in Shenzhen from 2000 to 2018. The CA-Markov model was combined to predict future land cover in Shenzhen. The results showed that the PVC in Shenzhen demonstrated obvious regional differentiation characteristics from 2000 to 2018. The eastern region occupied larger proportion than the western part, while the southern region was larger than the north part. This feature exhibited good consistency with regional topographic effect. The spatial migration characteristic of the center of gravity of PVC was from northwest to southeast, and then from southeast to northwest, with a migration rate of 551.2 m . a(-1). This process was closely related to urbanization in Shenzhen. The PVC in Shenzhen tended to be generally improved from 2000-2018, with a improvement rate of 0.005 . a(-1). The percentage of significantly improved and degraded PVC area was 30.8% and 12.8%, respectively. The CA-Markov method was used to predict the land cover/use pattern of Shenzhen in 2024 under two scenarios, theoretical scenario and natural scenario. There was no significant difference in proportion of the area of the land cover/use patterns obtained by the two kinds of prediction method, with the difference threshold being 0-1.2%. Compared with the data before 2018, the proportion of arbor forests and arable land converted into construction land in Shenzhen would be significantly reduced in 2024, whereas the contradiction between supply and demand would be still tense.

TI  - Dynamics of glacier surface velocity and ice thickness for maritime glaciers in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenced by climate warming, glacial hazards become increasingly frequent after glacier mass loss in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Investigations of mountain glacier surface velocities and volume are of great significance. However, no information is given regarding the specific changes in ice flow to climate warming, the spatiotemporal variations of glacier surface velocity and ice thickness are still unclear. In this study, offset tracking was used to measure glacier surface velocity in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau using Landsat TM/ETM +/OLI imagery from 1990 to 2018. And then spatially-distributed glacier ice thickness was estimated from mass-balance distribution data, glacier surface velocities and the principles of ice-flow. Results show that all maritime glaciers velocity in study area experienced a clear regional slowdown from 1991 to 2018, with robust overall trends of -5.26 m a(-1) dec(-1) (-19.8% dec(-1)) and 7.16 m a(-1) dec(-1) (25.2% dec(-1)) at elevations below and above 4 600 m a.s.l., respectively. Total volume for glaciers with an area of 954.34 km(2) was found to be similar to 86.64 +/- 11.09 km(3) in 2013, corresponding to an average ice thickness of similar to 91 +/- 12 m. The average ice thickness thinned by 0.62% a(-1) during 2000-2013, and an accelerated melting can be expected in the long term and then glacier volume decreases more rapidly than in the last decades.

TI  - Remote sensing extraction and feature analysis of abandoned farmland in hilly and mountainous areas:A case study of Xingning, Guangdong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the rising costs of farming and an aging agrarian population, large-scale cultivated lands have been abandoned in China's rural areas, especially in remote mountainous areas. Remote sensing technology can quickly extract abandoned farmland and reveal its formation laws, and this is of great significance to food security and to the economical and intensive utilization of cultivated land. Xingning city in Guangdong, China was selected as the research area. Based on Landsat 8 images, Google Earth images, and digital elevation models, we developed an archival classification method, which we used to extract abandoned farmland in Xingning according to the variation of crop life cycles. On this basis, we reveal the spatial distribution characteristics, natural ecology, and production conditions of abandoned farmland, and we propose differentiated countermeasures. The results show that our archival classification method extracted abandoned farmland with 92% accuracy, while the accuracy of the classification supervised by the artificial neural network was 80%. Abandoned farmland on the plains of Xingning is mainly distributed around the town center and the industrial park, while that in the mountainous area is mainly located on ridges and saddles. From the point of view of natural ecology, abandoned farmland in the study area is generally located on the ridge and saddle area with a large slope close to timberland. From the perspective of agricultural production, abandoned farmland is mainly restricted by field roads and irrigation conditions. Most of the abandoned farmland is limited by both natural ecology and production conditions, and so it should be treated by classification. We expect that our results can provide a reference for the extraction of the abandoned farmland and a basis for analyzing its formation mechanism.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation based on the microwave scattering mechanism during different crop phenological periods in a winter wheat-producing region
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, a novel microwave scattering model-based semiempirical method for estimating the soil moisture of areas covered with winter wheat was proposed. In the proposed soil moisture estimation method, the crop and soil microwave scattering mechanisms during different crop phenological periods were considered to remove the influences of the wheat crop canopy on soil backscattering. Using RADARSAT-2 images and field-measured sample data, the validity and feasibility of the proposed soil moisture estimation method were verified in the study region of Hengshui City in the North China Plain. Among the winter wheat jointing stage, heading stage and maturity stage, the R-2, adjusted R-2 and RMSE values between the estimated soil moisture value and field-measured value were 0.762, 0.762 and 2.36%, respectively. The results indicate that high-accuracy soil moisture estimations could be obtained, and the proposed method had good performance in regional applications in the study region at key growth stages of winter wheat.

TI  - A Socio-Spatial Analysis of Land Use Dynamics and Process of Land Intervention in the Peri-Urban Areas of Bahir Dar City
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The contemporary urbanization and its implication to land use dynamics especially in the peri-urban areas are emerging as a cross-cutting theme in policy debates and scientific discourse. As most cities in developing countries, including Ethiopia, are experiencing continuous expansion of built-ups and dynamic land use changes, monitoring and an in-depth analysis of the past, present and future predictions of these changes are important for a holistic understanding of the problem, its consequence, and to regulate proper land use intervention options. Thus, the main objective of this research is to assess land use dynamics and processes of land intervention in the peri-urban areas of Bahir Dar city using a socio-spatial analysis. It assesses to what extent the existing peri-urban land intervention processes and land use decisions are effective in combating and controlling unwanted land use changes. Primary socio-economic data were collected using questionnaires, focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews; in addition, spatial data including Landsat and Sentinel imageries of 1993, 2001, 2011 and 2020 were utilized. Land use/land cover (LULC) classes were computed using the integration of spectral and object-based image classification techniques. The results signal that built-ups are expanding horizontally with unpredicted patterns. This is because the existing land intervention processes are lacking effectiveness to govern the spatial patterns of built-ups. The results further depict that processes of land use intervention do not only determine horizontal urban expansion but also determine the nature of people-to-land relationships, which involve both formal and informal processes. This creates haphazard, disputed and unregulated land use systems in peri-urban areas of Bahir Dar. The socio-spatial methodology applied in this research is effective in monitoring both the spatial and social dimensions of land use changes. The spatial results effectively demonstrate the dynamics of land uses; whereas, the social analysis supports understanding of the processes of land use interventions. In conclusion, monitoring processes of land use interventions are key policy and decision making directions to regulate and manage land use dynamics in the peri-urban area.

TI  - Probabilistic Mangrove Species Mapping with Multiple-Source Remote-Sensing Datasets Using Label Distribution Learning in Xuan Thuy National Park, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in maintaining water quality, mitigating climate change impacts, and providing a wide range of ecosystem services. Effective identification of mangrove species using remote-sensing images remains a challenge. The combinations of multi-source remote-sensing datasets (with different spectral/spatial resolution) are beneficial to the improvement of mangrove tree species discrimination. In this paper, various combinations of remote-sensing datasets including Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 multispectral, and Gaofen-3 full-polarimetric SAR data were used to classify the mangrove communities in Xuan Thuy National Park, Vietnam. The mixture of mangrove communities consisting of small and shrub mangrove patches is generally difficult to separate using low/medium spatial resolution. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use label distribution learning (LDL) to provide the probabilistic mapping of tree species, including Sonneratia caseolaris (SC), Kandelia obovata (KO), Aegiceras corniculatum (AC), Rhizophora stylosa (RS), and Avicennia marina (AM). The experimental results show that the best classification performance was achieved by an integration of Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-3 datasets, demonstrating that full-polarimetric Gaofen-3 data is superior to the dual-polarimetric Sentinel-1 data for mapping mangrove tree species in the tropics.

TI  - Reconstruction and Nowcasting of Rainfall Field by Oblique Earth-Space Links Network: Preliminary Results from Numerical Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision rainfall field reconstruction and nowcasting play an important role in many aspects of social life. In recent years, the rain-induced signal attenuation of oblique earth-space links (OELs) has been presented to monitor regional rainfall. In this paper, we set up the first OEL in Nanjing, China, for the estimation of rain intensity. A year of observations from this link are also compared with the measurements from laser disdrometer OTT-Parsivel (OTT), between which the correlation is 0.86 and the determination coefficient is 0.73. Then, the simulation experiment is carried out: an OELs network is built, and the Kriging interpolation algorithm is employed to perform rainfall field reconstruction. The rainfall fields of plum rain season from 2016 to 2019 have been reconstructed by this network, which shows a good agreement with satellite remote sensing data. The resulting root-mean-square errors are lower than 3.46 mm/h and spatial correlations are higher than 0.80. Finally, we have achieved the nowcasting of rainfall field based on a machine-learning approach, especially deep learning. It can be seen from experiment results that the motion of rain cell and the position of peak rain intensity are predicted successfully, which is of great significant for taking concerted actions in case of emergency. Our experiment demonstrates that the densely distributed OELs are expected to become a futuristic rainfall monitoring system complementing existing weather radar and rain gauge observation networks.

TI  - A review on plant high-throughput phenotyping traits using UAV-based sensors
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - The current methods of phenotyping for breeding lines require a lot of time, labor and cost. In recent years, unmanned aerial system (UAS) has paved the way for the development of field high-throughput phenotyping for crops rapidly. Different sensors such as regular RGB camera (Red, Green and Blue), multispectral imaging camera (several wavebands), hyperspectral imaging camera (hundreds and even thousands of wavebands), thermal imaging sensor and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor can be placed on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect remote sensing data in field-scale trials. Based on this technique, the plant traits (e.g., yield, biomass, height, and leaf area index) can be estimated non-destructively, which is critical for high-throughput phenotyping in agriculture. Compared with ground vehicle-based sensors, UAS can increase throughput and frequency for phenotyping. It is low-cost and could provide high-resolution images compared with satellite-based technique. Based upon the phenotypic traits, those crops with high yield and strong stress resistance (e.g., disease resistance and salt resistance) can be selected, which could finally improve the production. This paper talked about the plant high-throughput phenotyping traits based on the sensors on the UAV. Also, the challenges and obstacles of UAV (e.g., flight safety, flight altitude, flight time, and sensor accuracy) were analyzed. In order to provide the updated information of the relationships between remote sensing information taken from UAV and plant phenotyping traits, we summarized the sensors, plants and traits reported in previous research articles. As a result, the review can be very useful for researchers to use appropriate UAV-based sensors to carry out plant phenotyping experiments, and for farmers to use this advanced technology in managing agricultural production.

TI  - Mining and Restoration Monitoring of Rare Earth Element (REE) Exploitation by New Remote Sensing Indicators in Southern Jiangxi, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) are widely used in various industries. The open-pit mining and chemical extraction of REEs in the weathered crust in southern Jiangxi, China, since the 1970s have provoked severe damages to the environment. After 2010, different restorations have been implemented by various enterprises, which seem to have a spatial variability in both management techniques and efficiency from one mine to another. A number of vegetation indices, e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI), can be used for this kind of monitoring and assessment but lack sensitivity to subtle differences. For this reason, the main objective of this study was to explore the possibility to develop new, mining-tailored remote sensing indicators to monitor the impacts of REE mining on the environment and to assess the effectiveness of its related restoration using multitemporal Landsat data from 1988 to 2019. The new indicators, termed mining and restoration assessment indicators (MRAIs), were developed based on the strong contrast of spectral reflectance, albedo, land surface temperature (LST) and tasseled cap brightness (TCB) of REE mines between mining and postmining restoration management. These indicators were tested against vegetation indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI and generalized difference vegetation index (GDVI), and found to be more sensitive. Of similar sensitivity to each other, one of the new indicators was employed to conduct the restoration assessment of the mined areas. Six typically managed mines with different restoration degrees and management approaches were selected as hotspots for a comparative analysis to highlight their temporal trajectories using the selected MRAI. The results show that REE mining had experienced a rapid expansion in 1988-2010 with a total mined area of about 66.29 km(2) in the observed counties. With implementation of the post-2010 restoration measures, an improvement of varying degrees in vegetation cover in most mines was distinguished and quantified. Hence, this study with the newly developed indicators provides a relevant approach for assessing the sustainable exploitation and management of REE resources in the study area.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of TRMM Precipitation Using an Optimal Regression Model with NDVI in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially high-resolution precipitation data is important for the users to study basin-scale hydro-logy and climate change. Inner Mongolia is a vast and sparsely populated region with sparse rainfall distribution. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites provide a remote-sensing data source covering the whole globe but is generally in coarse spatial resolution and cannot satisfy the needs of users for driving hydrological models or making sustainable plans for local areas. Downscaling is needed to achieve resolution refinement on the TRMM data. In this study, for the area of Inner Mongolia, four different models including exponential regression model (ERM), multiple linear regression model (MLR), generalized linear regression model (GLM), geographically weighted regression model (GWR) were used to obtain annual average precipitation data in a high resolution (1.0 km(2)), based on the 0.25-degree TRMM data during 2005-2016. The predictors for the downscaling were screened using stepwise regression. Results indicated that: (1) Compared with the GWR, only the MLR performs better in the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia; (2) According to the spatial pattern of precipitation and the verification based on the measured precipitation, GWR is the most suitable model for the region; (3) Due to the varied climates in different parts of Inner Mongolia, the idea of common regression, which uses a set of constant parameters across different areas, has a poor capability in capturing the high-value areas of precipitation, and local regression which uses varying parameters has a better performance, comparatively; (4) In the northwest Inner Mongolia, due to low vegetation coverage and sparse gauges, all the four models performs poorly.

TI  - Striking seasonal pattern of primary production in the river-dominated ocean margin of the northern South China Sea (NSCS-RiOMar) revealed by new field and remotely sensed data
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass and primary production (PP) are important features characterizing a marine ecosystem. The South China Sea (SCS) has been arbitrarily illustrated as an ecosystem with low PP in summer and high PP in winter. However, there is an emerging consensus about a lack of unity of PP seasonality in the SCS even in the northern SCS shelf-sea. Through analysis of the distributions of the remotely sensed colored dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient, a river-dominated ocean margin in the northern SCS (NSCS-RiOMar) with the 50 m isobath as its southeastern boundary has been defined. The difference in PP seasonality between the NSCS-RiOMar and the whole shelf-sea was evaluated by both the measured and the remotely sensed depth-integrated primary production (Sigma PP). A diagnostic analysis found that euphotic depth and a function of the half-saturation light intensity accounted for the seasonal variation of Sigma PP in the NSCS-RiOMar. Accordingly, the Platt and Sathyendranath (1993) model plus the nearest neighbor method and the semi analytical estimates of euphotic depth were used to compute the remotely sensed Sigma PP. The average Sigma PP in the NSCS-RiOMar were 1146.4, 1604.7, 979.5, and 891.3 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively, contrasted with small seasonal variations in the whole shelf-sea. The unimodal EPP peak was in June-July in accordance with the peak of Pearl River discharge. This result was striking because previous remote sensing studies all showed the reversed seasonal pattern of EPP in both the NSCS-RiOMar and the whole shelf sea. The annual PP was estimated to be 33.5 +/- 2.3 Mt C yr(-1) and 56.2 +/- 3.2 Mt C yr(-1) in the NSCS-RiOMar and the whole shelf-sea, respectively. The nutrients inputted by the China Coastal Current might account for 4-23% of EPP in the NSCS-RiOMar between December and February.

TI  - An Effective High Spatiotemporal Resolution NDVI Fusion Model Based on Histogram Clustering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a powerful tool for understanding past vegetation, monitoring the current state, and predicting its future. Due to technological and budget limitations, the existing global NDVI time-series data cannot simultaneously meet the needs of high spatial and temporal resolution. This study proposes a high spatiotemporal resolution NDVI fusion model based on histogram clustering (NDVI_FMHC), which uses a new spatiotemporal fusion framework to predict phenological and shape changes. Meanwhile, this model also uses four strategies to reduce error, including the construction of an overdetermined linear mixed model, multiscale prediction, residual distribution, and Gaussian filtering. Five groups of real MODIS_NDVI and Landsat_NDVI datasets were used to verify the predictive performance of the NDVI_FMHC. The results indicate that NDVI_FMHC has higher accuracy and robustness in forest areas (r = 0.9488 and ADD = 0.0229) and cultivated land areas (r = 0.9493 and ADD = 0.0605), while the prediction effect is relatively weak in areas subject to shape changes, such as flooded areas (r = 0.8450 and ADD = 0.0968), urban areas (r = 0.8855 and ADD = 0.0756), and fire areas (r = 0.8417 and ADD = 0.0749). Compared with ESTARFM, NDVI_LMGM, and FSDAF, NDVI_FMHC has the highest prediction accuracy, the best spatial detail retention, and the strongest ability to capture shape changes. Therefore, the NDVI_FMHC can obtain NDVI time-series data with high spatiotemporal resolution, which can be used to realize long-term land surface dynamic process research in a complex environment.

TI  - Identification of Electromagnetic Pre-Earthquake Perturbations from the DEMETER Data by Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-altitude satellite DEMETER recorded many cases of ionospheric perturbations observed on occasion of large seismic events. In this paper, we explore 16 spot-checking classification algorithms, among which, the top classifier with low-frequency power spectra of electric and magnetic fields was used for ionospheric perturbation analysis. This study included the analysis of satellite data spanning over six years, during which about 8760 earthquakes with magnitude greater than or equal to 5.0 occurred in the world. We discover that among these methods, a gradient boosting-based method called LightGBM outperforms others and achieves superior performance in a five-fold cross-validation test on the benchmarking datasets, which shows a strong capability in discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations. The results show that the electromagnetic pre-earthquake data within a circular region with its center at the epicenter and its radius given by the Dobrovolsky's formula and the time window of about a few hours before shocks are much better at discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations. Moreover, by investigating different earthquake databases, we confirm that some low-frequency electric and magnetic fields' frequency bands are the dominant features for electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations identification. We have also found that the choice of the geographical region used to simulate the training set of non-seismic data influences, to a certain extent, the performance of the LightGBM model, by reducing its capability in discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations.

TI  - A large-scale remote sensing database for subjective and objective quality assessment of pansharpened images
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a process to fuse a low spatial resolution multispectral image and a high spatial resolution panchromatic image to produce a high-resolution multispectral image. Quality assessment of pansharpened images is challenging due to without actual reference images. There are two main types of assessment methods: reduced resolution (RR) assessment based on Wald's protocol, and full resolution (FR) assessment without reference. Currently, it is lack of large-scale benchmark databases for subjective and objective performance evaluation of different image pansharpening methods. In this paper, we construct a large-scale database named Pansharpened Remote Sensing Image Quality Database (PRSIQD) from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives, which contains 13,620 pansharpened images acquired from IKONOS, QuickBird, Gaofen-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3 and WorldView-4 satellite sensors. In addition, we have comprehensively analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the existing pansharpening quality assessment methods on different satellite sensors, thematic datasets and bands.

TI  - RFI Suppression for SAR Systems Based on Removed Spectrum Iterative Adaptive Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system can be seriously contaminated by radio frequency systems because of working in the same microwave frequency bands, which would degrade the SAR image quality and affect the accuracy of image interpretation. In this paper, a novel radio frequency interference (RFI) suppression approach including RFI identification, band-stop filtering and a removed spectrum iterative adaptive approach (RSIAA) is proposed. First, the smoothing process is added before RFI signal detection to improve the RFI detection capacity. Afterwards, the band-stop filtering with a broaden factor is proposed to mitigate the residual RFI, and it ensures the accuracy of the following removed spectrum recovery by the RSIAA. Finally, the removed spectrum components are estimated from available adjacent spectrum data by the RSIAA in turn to obtain the desired range spectra. Compared with the conventional range frequency filtering method for RFI suppression, the capacity of the weak RFI signal detection is improved, and the increased sidelobes due to the discontinuous spectra are well suppressed. Simulation experiments on both simulated SAR raw data, Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1 SAR raw data validate the proposed RFI suppression approach.

TI  - Evaluation of SMAP Level 2, 3, and 4 Soil Moisture Datasets over the Great Lakes Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sensor systems for soil moisture measurements have been continuously evolving. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission represents one of the latest advances in this regard. Thus far, much of our knowledge of the accuracy of SMAP soil moisture over the Great Lakes region of North America has originated from evaluation studies using in situ data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Climate Analysis Network and/or the U.S. Climate Reference Network, which provide only several in situ sensor stations for this region. As such, these results typically underrepresent the accuracy of SMAP soil moisture in this region, which is characterized by a relatively large soil moisture variability and is one of the least studied regions. In this work, SMAP Level 2-4 soil moisture products: SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2 Radiometer/Radar Soil Moisture (SPL2SMAP_S), SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer Soil Moisture (SPL3SMP_E), and SMAP L4 Surface and Root-Zone Soil Moisture Analysis Update (SPL4SMAU) are evaluated over the southern portion of the Great Lakes region using in situ measurements from Michigan State University's Enviro-weather Automated Weather Station Network. The unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) values for both SPL4SMAU surface and root zone soil moisture estimates are below 0.04 m(3) m(-3) at the 36-km scale, with an average ubRMSE of 0.045 m(3) m(-3) (0.037 m(3) m(-3)) for the surface (root-zone) soil moisture against the sparse network. The ubRMSE values for SPL3SMP_E a.m. (i.e., descending overpasses) soil moisture retrievals are close to or below 0.04 m(3) m(-3) at the 36-km scale, with an average ubRMSE of similar to 0.06 m(3) m(-3) against the sparse network. The average ubRMSE values are similar to 0.05-0.06 m(3) m(-3) for high-resolution SPL2SMAP_S soil moisture retrievals against the sparse network, with the skill of the baseline algorithm-based soil moisture retrievals exceeding that of the optional algorithm-based counterparts. Clearly, the skill of SPL4SMAU surface soil moisture exceeds that of the SPL3SMP_E and SPL2SMAP_S soil moisture retrievals.

TI  - A Novel Method to Remove Interference Fringes for Hyperspectral SWIR Imagers
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A hyperspectral short-wave infrared (SWIR) imager with a HgCdTe focal plane detector usually suffers from interference fringes in spectral and spatial dimension due to the etalon effect. It can cause a modulation of sensitivity higher than 15% when the spectral resolution is higher than 10 nm. In this article, a two-step method is proposed and evaluated to remove interference fringes for hyperspectral SWIR imagers. First, we extract the spectral data, conduct harmonic decomposition to suppress the fringes in spectral dimension, and calculate the correction coefficients. Second, we optimize the correction coefficients according to the distribution of the interference fringes in spatial dimension. Sample SWIR images acquired from the Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI) on China's GaoFen-5 satellite are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. It shows that the proposed method can well preserve the original spectral pattern and reduce the peakto-peak amplitude of spatial fringing from +/- 15% to +/- 4%. The method is compared with three other previously proposed methods. It turns out that the newly proposed method has strong adaptability, high accuracy, and high efficiency.

TI  - Assessing water storage changes of Lake Poyang from multi-mission satellite data and hydrological models
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding water storage changes in Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China, is essential for local hydro-ecological assessments and water resource management. The integration of mull-mission satellite data, hydrological models, and in situ measurements allows for a comprehensive estimate of Lake Poyang's storage variations. We here estimated Lake Poyang water storage changes during the recent decade by using inundation areas mapped from optical satellite imagery and water levels measured by satellite radar altimetry and gauging stations. The amplitudes of seasonal variation from altimetry data are smaller than those from station measurements. This is likely attributed to their low temporal resolutions and limited footprint coverage, together with a complex surface gradient over Lake Poyang. The residual fields between land water storage changes assessed by the GRACE satellites and simulated by two hydrological models (GLDAS Noah and WGHM) were applied to estimate Poyang water storage changes. Leakage errors in the GRACE-model residuals are further corrected by a constrained forward modeling method, resulting in recovered water storage trends -66 times of the uncorrected signals. Water level changes estimated by different methods are then compared. Results show that level changes inverted from recovered storage variations by GRACE-GLDAS and GRACE-WGHM are significantly larger than those from satellite altimetry and in situ measurements. This indicates that the combination of GRACE observation and global hydrological modeling is likely insufficient to estimate accurate water storage changes in Lake Poyang. Our methods and results provide a valuable example of using integrated methods for monitoring water storage changes in highly dynamic fluvial lake systems.

TI  - A Novel Intelligent Classification Method for Urban Green Space Based on High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The real-time, accurate, and refined monitoring of urban green space status information is of great significance in the construction of urban ecological environment and the improvement of urban ecological benefits. The high-resolution technology can provide abundant information of ground objects, which makes the information of urban green surface more complicated. The existing classification methods are challenging to meet the classification accuracy and automation requirements of high-resolution images. This paper proposed a deep learning classification method for urban green space based on phenological features constraints in order to make full use of the spectral and spatial information of green space provided by high-resolution remote sensing images (GaoFen-2) in different periods. The vegetation phenological features were added as auxiliary bands to the deep learning network for training and classification. We used the HRNet (High-Resolution Network) as our model and introduced the Focal Tversky Loss function to solve the sample imbalance problem. The experimental results show that the introduction of phenological features into HRNet model training can effectively improve urban green space classification accuracy by solving the problem of misclassification of evergreen and deciduous trees. The improvement rate of F1-Score of deciduous trees, evergreen trees, and grassland were 0.48%, 4.77%, and 3.93%, respectively, which proved that the combination of vegetation phenology and high-resolution remote sensing image can improve the results of deep learning urban green space classification.

TI  - Forest cover dynamics and its drivers of the Arba Gugu forest in the Eastern highlands of Ethiopia during 1986 - 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Change in forest cover can affect both ecological and socio-economic systems. In order to understand the dynamics of this process, accurate and spatially explicit information is urgently required. Quantifying the past forest cover change of Arba Gugu forest of Ethiopia has been lacking despite its significance in formulating effective forest conservation and management policy and strategy in the area. This study was intended to quantify the dynamics of forest cover over a period of 29 years (1986-2015) and to identify related driving forces or causal mechanisms. Satellite images of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) were used for the year 1986 and 1999. For the year 2015, the latest Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor of Landsat was used. The three images were classified using the random forest algorithm of the supervised classification technique. In addition, focus group discussions were conducted with three groups (a youth group from both sexes within 15-24 age range, a landowner group from women and a landowner group from men) in two highly deforested and two low deforested villages to explore drivers of deforestation. The results depicted that, the landscape encompasses stable non-forestland (54.6%) and stable forestland (13.9%) which were not converted since 1986 up to 2015. The remaining 31.5% experienced changes, of which 23% was converted from forest to non-forest and the rest (8.5%) transitioned from non-forest to forest class. The forest cover declined from 99,416 ha in 1986 to 60,334 ha in 2015. The rates of net-deforestation were 1.6% year 1 and 1.4% year 1 in the period 1986-1999 and 1999-2015, respectively. The most commonly reported drivers of deforestation were logging (39.1%) and farm expansion (36.8%). Thus, establishing a continuous forest monitoring system after formulating site-specific forest conservation plan is important.

AB  - Particulate matter with a mass concentration of particles with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is a key air quality parameter. A real-time knowledge of PM2.5 is highly valuable for lowering the risk of detrimental impacts on human health. To achieve this goal, we developed a new deep learning model-EntityDenseNet to retrieve ground-level PM2.5 concentrations from Himawari-8, a geostationary satellite providing high temporal resolution data. In contrast to the traditional machine learning model, the new model has the capability to automatically extract PM2.5 spatio-temporal characteristics. Validation across mainland China demonstrates that hourly, daily and monthly PM2.5 retrievals contain the root-mean-square errors of 26.85, 25.3, and 15.34 mu g/m(3), respectively. In addition to a higher accuracy achievement when compared with various machine learning inversion methods (backpropagation neural network, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, and random forest), EntityDenseNet can "peek inside the black box" to extract the spatio-temporal features of PM2.5. This model can show, for example, that PM2.5 levels in the coastal city of Tianjin were more influenced by air from Hebei than Beijing. Further, EntityDenseNet can still extract the seasonal characteristics that demonstrate that PM2.5 is more closely related within three month groups over mainland China: (1) December, January and February, (2) March, April and May, (3) July, August and September, even without meteorological information. EntityDenseNet has the ability to obtain high temporal resolution satellite-based PM2.5 data over China in real-time. This could act as an important tool to improve our understanding of PM2.5 spatio-temporal features.

TI  - The Google Earth Engine Mangrove Mapping Methodology (GEEMMM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are found globally throughout tropical and sub-tropical inter-tidal coastlines. These highly biodiverse and carbon-dense ecosystems have multi-faceted value, providing critical goods and services to millions living in coastal communities and making significant contributions to global climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration and storage. Despite their many values, mangrove loss continues to be widespread in many regions due primarily to anthropogenic activities. Accessible, intuitive tools that enable coastal managers to map and monitor mangrove cover are needed to stem this loss. Remotely sensed data have a proven record for successfully mapping and monitoring mangroves, but conventional methods are limited by imagery availability, computing resources and accessibility. In addition, the variable tidal levels in mangroves presents a unique mapping challenge, particularly over geographically large extents. Here we present a new tool-the Google Earth Engine Mangrove Mapping Methodology (GEEMMM)-an intuitive, accessible and replicable approach which caters to a wide audience of non-specialist coastal managers and decision makers. The GEEMMM was developed based on a thorough review and incorporation of relevant mangrove remote sensing literature and harnesses the power of cloud computing including a simplified image-based tidal calibration approach. We demonstrate the tool for all of coastal Myanmar (Burma)-a global mangrove loss hotspot-including an assessment of multi-date mapping and dynamics outputs and a comparison of GEEMMM results to existing studies. Results-including both quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessments and comparisons to existing studies-indicate that the GEEMMM provides an accessible approach to map and monitor mangrove ecosystems anywhere within their global distribution.

TI  - Validation of remotely sensed estimates of snow water equivalent using multiple reference datasets from the middle and high latitudes of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A key variable describing the mass of seasonal snow cover is snow water equivalent (SWE), which plays an important role in hydrological applications, weather forecasting and land surface process simulations. In this paper, the accuracy of an SWE product, GlobSnow-2, which combines microwave satellite data and in situ measurements, is assessed using three reference evaluation datasets north of 35 degrees N in China. The GlobSnow-2 estimates are also compared with stand-alone satellite products (AMSR2, Chang and FY-3D SWE). The overall unbiased root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of the GlobSnow-2 SWE product validated with three reference datasets are 17.4 mm and 11.2 mm, respectively, which outperforms the AMSR2 SWE (39.3 mm and 37.3 mm, respectively) and Chang SWE (57.5 mm and 46.2 mm, respectively) products. The FY-3D SWE product performs better than the GlobSnow-2 estimate for shallow snow (SWE < 50 mm) and tends to underestimate snow cover, particularly when SWE exceeds 80 mm. A retrieval sensitivity analysis against land cover types shows that the highest SWE uncertainties for GlobSnow-2 are exhibited in grassland (unbiased RMSE, 27.8 mm), and the most serious overestimation occurs in forested areas (bias, 23.6 mm). The GlobSnow-2 performances at various elevations show an increasing bias trend, ranging from 5 to 61 mm with increasing elevation. The GlobSnow-2 estimate analyses under different snow regimes show that the GlobSnow-2 SWE product performs best in taiga snow, with high uncertainties (unbiased RMSE, 28.3 mm) in prairie snow and serious overestimations (bias, 23.2 mm) for alpine snow. The results of this study demonstrate that the GlobSnow-2 assimilation approach tends to overestimate SWE in China. One of the major reasons that overestimations occur is that the GlobSnow-2 SWE retrieval scheme utilizes a fixed density of 240 kg/m(3), which is larger than the average value derived from ground measurements for China (180 kg/m(3)), which undoubtedly contributes to the observed SWE overestimation. Another reason is that forest effects on satellite signals remain challenging for SWE estimations in the GlobSnow-2 assimilation system. The retrieval errors in prairie and alpine are also higher than others due to the snowpack stratigraphy and complex topography. The GlobSnow-2 SWE product performance is evaluated over China in this study, and the major factors that affect the assimilation scheme accuracy are determined. These results will provide a reference to improve the GlobSnow-2 SWE product in future work.

TI  - A Method of Marine Moving Targets Detection in Multi-Channel ScanSAR System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Azimuth multi-channel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system operated in burst mode makes high-resolution ultrawide-swath (HRUS) imaging become a reality. This kind of imaging mode has excellent application value for the maritime scenarios requiring wide-area monitoring. This paper suggests a moving target detection (MTD) method of marine scenes based on sparse recovery, which integrates detection, velocity estimation, and relocation. Firstly, the typical phenomenon of scene folding in the coarse-focused domain is introduced in detail. Given that the spatial distribution of moving vessels is highly sparse, the idea of sparse recovery is utilized to acquire the azimuth time characterizing the position of the moving target reasonably. Subsequently, the radial velocity and position information about the targets are obtained simultaneously. What makes the proposed method effective are two characteristics of the moving targets in ocean scenes, high signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) and sparsity of the spatial distribution. Then, estimation performances under different SCR are analyzed by Monte Carlo experiments. And the actual SCR of the vessels in the ocean scene obtained by GaoFen-3 dual-receive channel mode is invoked as a reference value to verify the effectiveness. Besides, some simulation experiments demonstrate the capability to indicate marine moving targets.

TI  - Detecting functional field units from satellite images in smallholder farming systems using a deep learning based computer vision approach: A case study from Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving agricultural productivity of smallholder farms (which are typically less than 2 ha) is key to food security for millions of people in developing nations. Knowledge of the size and location of crop fields forms the basis for crop statistics, yield forecasting, resource allocation, economic planning, and for monitoring the effectiveness of development interventions and investments. We evaluated three different full convolutional neural network (F-CNN) models (U-Net, SegNet, and DenseNet) with deep neural architecture to detect functional field boundaries from the very high resolution (VHR) WorldView-3 satellite imagery from Southern Bangladesh. The precision of the three F-CNN was up to 0.8, and among the three F-CNN models, the highest precision, recalls, and F-1 score was obtained using a DenseNet model. This architecture provided the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) when tested with independent images. We also found that 4-channel images (blue, green, red, and near-infrared) provided small gains in performance when compared to 3-channel images (blue, green, and red). Our results indicate the potential of using CNN based computer vision techniques to detect field boundaries of small, irregularly shaped agricultural fields.

TI  - Rapid Assessment of Hillslope Erosion Risk after the 2019-2020 Wildfires and Storm Events in Sydney Drinking Water Catchment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Australian Black Summer wildfires between September 2019 and January 2020 burnt many parts of eastern Australia including major forests within the Sydney drinking water catchment (SDWC) area, almost 16.000 km(2). There was great concern on post-fire erosion and water quality hazards to Sydney's drinking water supply, especially after the heavy rainfall events in February 2020. We developed a rapid and innovative approach to estimate post-fire hillslope erosion using weather radar, remote sensing, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The event-based rainfall erosivity was estimated from radar-derived rainfall accumulations for all storm events after the wildfires. Satellite data including Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to estimate the fractional vegetation covers and the RUSLE cover-management factor. The study reveals that the average post-fire erosion rate over SDWC in February 2020 was 4.9 Mg ha(-1) month(-1), about 30 times higher than the pre-fire erosion and 10 times higher than the average erosion rate at the same period because of the intense storm events and rainfall erosivity with a return period over 40 years. The high post-fire erosion risk areas (up to 23.8 Mg ha(-1) month(-1)) were at sub-catchments near Warragamba Dam which forms Lake Burragorang and supplies drinking water to more than four million people in Sydney. These findings assist in the timely assessment of post-fire erosion and water quality risks and help develop cost-effective fire incident management and mitigation actions for such an area with both significant ecological and drinking water assets. The methodology developed from this study is potentially applicable elsewhere for similar studies as the input datasets (satellite and radar data) and computing platforms (GEE, GIS) are available and accessible worldwide.

TI  - Secondary Genome-Wide Association Study Using Novel Analytical Strategies Disentangle Genetic Components of Cleft Lip and/or Cleft Palate in 1q32.2
T2  - GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - Orofacial cleft (OFC) is one of the most prevalent birth defects, leading to substantial and long-term burdens in a newborn's quality of life. Although studies revealed several genetic variants associated with the birth defect, novel approaches may provide additional clues about its etiology. Using the Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics project data (n = 10,542), we performed linear mixed-model analyses to study the genetic compositions of OFC and investigated the dependence among identified loci using conditional analyses. To identify genes associated with OFC, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) based on predicted expression levels. In addition to confirming the previous findings at four loci, 1q32.2, 8q24, 2p24.2 and 17p13.1, we untwined two independent loci at 1q32.2, TRAF3IP3 and IRF6. The sentinel SNP in TRAF3IP3 (rs2235370, p-value = 5.15 x 10(-9)) was independent of the sentinel SNP at IRF6 (rs2235373, r(2) < 0.3). We found that the IRF6 effect became nonsignificant once the 8q24 effect was conditioned, while the TRAF3IP3 effect remained significant. Furthermore, we identified nine genes associated with OFC in TWAS, implicating a glutathione synthesis and drug detoxification pathway. We identified some meaningful additions to the OFC etiology using novel statistical methods in the existing data.

TI  - Evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> associations for air quality assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional station-based PM2.5 monitoring method has significant spatial gaps. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product (10 km spatial resolution) derived from the imagery of NASA Terra satellite has been used as a tool for regional PM2.5 studies for many years. Literature suggested mixed results on AOD-PM2.5 correlation across geographic location, size of study area, and spatial resolution of MODIS AOD product. Also, correlation coefficient was reported at seasonal or yearly level and seldom any atmospheric research reported the AOD-PM2.5 correlation at daily level, which is crucial to utilize MODIS AOD products in air quality assessment. In this study, MODIS AOD product with 1, 3, and 10 km spatial resolutions were employed to examine their linear relationship with hourly PM2.5 data at daily level in order to evaluate their feasibility for PM2.5 remote monitoring in the state of North Carolina, U.S. First, the daily correlation between MODIS AOD value and ground PM2.5 concentration was statistically analyzed for the day in which both data existed. Next, a site-specific AOD-PM2.5 correlation was examined for each AirNow PM2.5 station in NC at 1 km, 3 km and 10 km spatial resolutions respectively in 2011 and 2012. The significance of all correlations was tested at 95% confidence level for each day at which two pairs of PM2.5 and AOD existed and each station in both years. It was found that the site-specific correlation between MODIS AOD value and ground PM2.5 concentration was statistically significant (95% confidence level) at majority of PM2.5 monitoring stations at 1 km, 3 km and 10 km level in both 2011 and 2012 in NC. Our results suggest that it is practicable to use MODIS AOD data to assess PM2.5 concentrations monthly at both city and state level without incorporating meteorological parameters.Main finding: Significant site-specific AOD-PM2.5 correlations allow the application of MODIS AOD to air quality assessment;

TI  - Can atmospheric reanalyses (CRA and ERA5) represent cloud spatiotemporal characteristics?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric reanalysis normally provides a comprehensive record of Earth's weather and climate changes over time, and is extensively used in climate and energy researches. Among various atmospheric variables, clouds play a unique and important role in the atmosphere. However, there are still significant uncertainties on our understanding of cloud properties, and it is still unclear how those newly developed atmospheric reanalyses represent cloud spatiotemporal characteristics. This study evaluates the cloud properties in two atmospheric reanalyses, i.e., the China Meteorological Administration Reanalysis data (CRA) and the ECMWF's Fifth-generation Reanalysis (ERAS), and monthly mean cloud cover from satellite radiometers are considered as the reference. Both CRA and ERAS generally represent cloud temporal and spatial distributions. To be more specific, ERAS gives monthly mean cloud cover closely to the MODIS observation over land, but its value over ocean is similar to 10% smaller than MODIS. CRA underestimates global cloud cover for similar to 20%, especially over subtropical zones. The differences between the MODIS and reanalysis cloud cover are mostly significant over the polar regions, whereas they can be contributed by the uncertainties of both. Furthermore, the interannual climate variability of cloud cover influenced by ENSO can also be reasonably captured by the two reanalyses, especially ERAS, whereas the CRA and ERAS cloud cover anomalies are both spreading over a slightly larger region than those from MODIS. Such evaluations are suggested to be extended to even more detailed cloud properties and variations in the reanalysis for further improvements.

TI  - Mapping and Discriminating Rural Settlements Using Gaofen-2 Images and a Fully Convolutional Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - New ongoing rural construction has resulted in an extensive mixture of new settlements with old ones in the rural areas of China. Understanding the spatial characteristic of these rural settlements is of crucial importance as it provides essential information for land management and decision-making. Despite a great advance in High Spatial Resolution (HSR) satellite images and deep learning techniques, it remains a challenging task for mapping rural settlements accurately because of their irregular morphology and distribution pattern. In this study, we proposed a novel framework to map rural settlements by leveraging the merits of Gaofen-2 HSR images and representation learning of deep learning. We combined a dilated residual convolutional network (Dilated-ResNet) and a multi-scale context subnetwork into an end-to-end architecture in order to learn high resolution feature representations from HSR images and to aggregate and refine the multi-scale features extracted by the aforementioned network. Our experiment in Tongxiang city showed that the proposed framework effectively mapped and discriminated rural settlements with an overall accuracy of 98% and Kappa coefficient of 85%, achieving comparable and improved performance compared to other existing methods. Our results bring tangible benefits to support other convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods in accurate and timely rural settlement mapping, particularly when up-to-date ground truth is absent. The proposed method does not only offer an effective way to extract rural settlement from HSR images but open a new opportunity to obtain spatial-explicit understanding of rural settlements.

TI  - A machine learning approach to tungsten prospectivity modelling using knowledge-driven feature extraction and model confidence
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel mineral prospectivity modelling presented here applies knowledge-driven feature extraction to a datadriven machine learning approach for tungsten mineralisation. The method emphasises the importance of appropriate model evaluation and develops a new Confidence Metric to generate spatially refined and robust exploration targets. The data-driven Random Forest (TM) algorithm is employed to model tungsten mineralisation in SW England using a range of geological, geochemical and geophysical evidence layers which include a depth to granite evidence layer. Two models are presented, one using standardised input variables and a second that implements fuzzy set theory as part of an augmented feature extraction step. The use of fuzzy data transformations mean feature extraction can incorporate some user-knowledge about the mineralisation into the model. The typically subjective approach is guided using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve tool where transformed data are compared to known training samples. The modelling is conducted using 34 known true positive samples with 10 sets of randomly generated true negative samples to test the random effect on the model. The two models have similar accuracy but show different spatial distributions when identifying highly prospective targets. Areal analysis shows that the fuzzy-transformed model is a better discriminator and highlights three areas of high prospectivity that were not previously known. The Confidence Metric, derived from model variance, is employed to further evaluate the models. The new metric is useful for refining exploration targets and highlighting the most robust areas for follow-up investigation. The fuzzy-transformed model is shown to contain larger areas of high model confidence compared to the model using standardised variables. Finally, legacy mining data, from drilling reports and mine descriptions, is used to further validate the fuzzy-transformed model and gauge the depth of potential deposits. Descriptions of mineralisation corroborate that the targets generated in these models could be undercover a depths of less than 300 m. In summary, the modelling workflow presented herein provides a novel integration of knowledge-driven feature extraction with data-driven machine learning modelling, while the newly derived Confidence Metric generates reliable mineral exploration targets.

TI  - "We all know each other": A Strengths-based Approach to Understanding Social Capital in Pictou Landing First Nation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With over three decades of attention drawn to the health of Indigenous peoples in Canada and around the world, an outpouring of health research has been undertaken. Much of this research, however, has emphasized the experience of disparity at the expense of recognizing strengths. In this case study, we challenge the damage-centred rhetoric of mainstream health research by reporting the findings of 20 qualitative interviews on community strength and health with members of Pictou Landing First Nation, a Mi'kmaw nation located in Nova Scotia, Canada. We then relate and compare these findings with the merging conceptualization of Indigenous social capital, which is a concept that has been associated with positive health outcomes in a variety of contexts. Our findings indicate that Pictou Landing First Nation is strengthened by qualities of familiarity, reciprocity, safety, and solidarity, which are rooted in the value of family and embedded within a broader Mi'kmaw Worldview. These strengths align, in part, with the concept of Indigenous social capital, which we suggest may be better harnessed to be a means for conducting strengths-based health research. To this end, our findings support the need for reworking social capital conceptualizations to more strongly centralize cultural identities and worldviews in order to authentically and comprehensively affirm Indigenous and decolonizing health research practices.

TI  - Developing urban built-up area extraction method based on land surface emissivity differences
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately extracting the boundaries of urban built-up area (UBA) borders is vital for scientific urban planning and construction. Based on the land surface emissivity (LSE) and land surface temperature calculation difference between the linear spectral mixing model and Qin normalised difference vegetation index threshold improvement algorithm (Delta LST), a new method for extracting UBA is proposed. The performance of this method is assessed using Landsat images of six typical Chinese cities. The Delta LST threshold method based on the LSE difference demonstrates that the UBA boundary range is accurately extracted, and the overall average accuracy is 86.42%, which has a sufficient universality and application value. Compared with the traditional remote sensing method for extracting UBA, the method proposed in this study avoids the interference of the cloud layer, effectively solving the problem arising due to an easily extracted cloud layer, and the UBA can be accurately identified and extracted under partial cloud coverage. The proposed Delta LST threshold method that is based on the LSE difference makes up for the over-reliance on the urban heat island effect in the UBA method based on the LST inversion results.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Burn Severity Using Coupled Radiative Transfer Model: A Case Study on Chinese Qinyuan Pine Fires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn severity mapping is critical to quantifying fire impact on key ecological processes and post-fire forest management. Satellite remote sensing has the advantages of high spatial-temporal resolution and large-scale monitoring and provides a more efficient way to evaluate forest fire burn severity than traditional field or aerial surveys. However, the proportion of tree canopy cover (TCC) affects the spectral signal received by remote sensing sensors from the background charcoal and ash. Consequently, not considering this factor normally leads a spectral confusion in burn severity retrieval. In this study, the burn severity of two Qinyuan forest fires was estimated using a coupled Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) and Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) reflectance data. A two-layer Canopy Reflectance Model (ACRM) RTM was coupled with the GeoSail RTM by replacing the spectra of the background input of GeoSail RTM to simulate the spectra of the three-layered forests for burn severity retrieval measured as the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The TCC data was then served to RTM parameterization and constrain the backward inversion procedure of the coupled RTM to alleviate spectral confusion. Finally, the inversion retrievals were evaluated using 163 field measured CBI. The coupled RTM can simulate the radiative transfer characteristics of three-layer vegetation and has greater potential to accurately estimate burn severity worldwide. To evaluate the merit of our proposed method, the CBI was estimated through coupled RTM inversion with TCC constraint (CP_RTM+TCC), coupled RTM inversion with global optimal search (CP-RTM+GOS), Forest Reflectance and Transmittance (FRT) RTM inversion with TCC constraint (FRT+TCC), and random forest (RF) algorithm. The results showed that the method proposed in this study (CP_RTM+TCC) yielded the highest estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.2) among the four methods used as benchmark, indicating its reasonable ability to assist forest managers to better understand post-fire vegetation regeneration and forest management.

TI  - Urban ambient air temperature estimation using hyperlocal data from smart vehicle-borne sensors
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality temperature data at a finer spatio-temporal scale is critical for analyzing the risk of heat exposure and hazards in urban environments. The variability of urban landscapes makes cities a challenging environment for quantifying heat exposure. Most of the existing heat hazard studies have inherent limitations on two fronts; first, the spatio-temporal granularities are too coarse, and second, the inability to track the ambient air temperature (AAT) instead of land surface temperature (LST). Overcoming these limitations requires developing models for mapping the variability in heat exposure in urban environments. We investigated an integrated approach for mapping urban heat hazards by harnessing a diverse set of high-resolution measurements, including both ground-based and satellite-based temperature data. We mounted vehicle-borne mobile sensors on city buses to collect high-frequency temperature data throughout 2018 and 2019. Our research also incorporated key biophysical parameters and Landsat 8 LST data into Random Forest regression modeling to map the hyperlocal variability of heat hazard over areas not covered by the buses. The vehicle-borne temperature sensor data showed large temperature differences within the city, with the largest variations of up to 10 degrees C and morning-afternoon diurnal changes at a magnitude around 20 degrees C. Random Forest modeling on noontime (11:30 am - 12:30 pm) data to predict AAT produced accurate results with a mean absolute error of 0.29 degrees C and successfully showcased the enhanced granularity in urban heat hazard mapping. These maps revealed well-defined hyperlocal variabilities in AAT, which were not evident with other research approaches. Urban core and dense residential areas revealed larger than 5 degrees C AAT differences from their nearby green spaces. The sensing framework developed in this study can be easily implemented in other urban areas, and findings from this study will be beneficial in understanding the heat vulnerabilities of individual communities. It can be used by the local government to devise targeted hazard mitigation efforts such as increasing green space, developing better heat-safety policies, and exposure warning for workers.

TI  - Improving Local Climate Zone Classification Using Incomplete Building Data and Sentinel 2 Images Based on Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have enhanced the mapping performance of the local climate zone (LCZ), a standard framework for evaluating urban form and function for urban heat island research, through remote sensing (RS) images and deep learning classifiers such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The accuracy in the urban-type LCZ (LCZ1-10), however, remains relatively low because RS data cannot provide vertical or horizontal building components in detail. Geographic information system (GIS)-based building datasets can be used as primary sources in LCZ classification, but there is a limit to using them as input data for CNN due to their incompleteness. This study proposes novel methods to classify LCZ using Sentinel 2 images and incomplete building data based on a CNN classifier. We designed three schemes (S1, S2, and a scheme fusion; SF) for mapping 50 m LCZs in two megacities: Berlin and Seoul. S1 used only RS images, and S2 used RS and building components such as area and height (or the number of stories). SF combined two schemes (S1 and S2) based on three conditions, mainly focusing on the confidence level of the CNN classifier. When compared to S1, the overall accuracies for all LCZ classes (OA) and the urban-type LCZ (OA(urb)) of SF increased by about 4% and 7-9%, respectively, for the two study areas. This study shows that SF can compensate for the imperfections in the building data, which causes misclassifications in S2. The suggested approach can be excellent guidance to produce a high accuracy LCZ map for cities where building databases can be obtained, even if they are incomplete.

TI  - Change Points Detected in Decadal and Seasonal Trends of Outlet Glacier Terminus Positions across West Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the change in terminus position between 1985 and 2015 of 17 marine-terminating glaciers that drain into Disko and Uummannaq Bays, West Greenland, by manually digitizing over 5000 individual frontal positions from over 1200 Landsat images. We find that 15 of 17 glacier termini retreated over the study period, with similar to 80% of this retreat occurring since 2000. Increased frequency of Landsat observations since 2000 allowed for further investigation of the seasonal variability in terminus position. We identified 10 actively retreating glaciers based on a significant positive relationship between glaciers with cumulative retreat >300 m since 2000 and their average annual amplitude (seasonal range) in terminus position. Finally, using the Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST) program, we investigated whether the 2000-2015 trends in terminus position were explained by the occurrence of change points (significant trend transitions). Based on the change point analysis, we found that nine of 10 glaciers identified as actively retreating also underwent two or three periods of change, during which their terminus positions were characterized by increases in cumulative retreat. Previous literature suggests potential relationships between our identified change dates with anomalous ocean conditions, such as low sea ice concentration and high sea surface temperatures, and our change durations with individual fjord geometry.

TI  - Elevation dependent warming over the Tibetan Plateau: Patterns, mechanisms and perspectives
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is also known as the "Third Pole". Elevation dependent warming (EDW), the phenomenon that warming rate changes systematically with elevation, is of high significance for realistically estimating warming rates and their impacts over the TP. This review summarizes studies of characteristics and mechanisms behind EDW over the TP based on multiple observed datasets and model simulations. Spatial expression of EDW and explanatory mechanisms are still largely unknown because of the lack of suitable data over the TP. The focus is on the roles played by known mechanisms such as snow/ice-albedo feed-back, cloud feedback, atmospheric water vapor feedback, aerosol feedback, and changes in land use, ozone and vegetation. At present, there is limited consensus on the main mechanisms controlling EDW. Finally, new perspectives and unresolved issues are outlined, including quantification of EDW in climate model simulations, explanation of the long-term EDW reconstructed from proxies, interaction between the Asian summer monsoon and EDW, importance of EDW for future environmental changes and water resources, and current gaps in understanding EDW over extremely high elevations. Further progress requires a more comprehensive ground observation network, greater use of remote sensing data, and high-resolution climate modeling with better representation of both atmospheric and cryospheric processes.

TI  - Saharan Dust Aerosols Change Deep Convective Cloud Prevalence, Possibly by Inhibiting Marine New Particle Formation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convective clouds (DCCs) are important to global climate, atmospheric chemistry, and precipitation. Dust, a dominant aerosol type over the tropical North Atlantic, has potentially large microphysical impacts on DCCs over this region. However, dust effects are difficult to identify, being confounded by covarying meteorology and other factors. Here, a method is developed to quantify DCC responses to dust and other aerosols at large spatial and temporal scales despite these uncertainties. Over 7 million tropical North Atlantic cloud, aerosol, and meteorological profiles from CloudSat satellite data and MERRA-2 reanalysis products are used to stratify cloud observations into meteorological regimes, objectively select a priori assumptions, and iteratively test uncertainty sensitivity. Dust is robustly associated with a 54% increase in DCC prevalence. However, marine aerosol proxy concentrations are 5 times more predictive of dust-associated increases in DCC prevalence than the dust itself, or any other aerosol or meteorological factor. Marine aerosols are also the most predictive factor for the even larger increases in DCC prevalence (61%-87%) associated with enhanced dimethyl sulfide and combustion and sulfate aerosols. Dust-associated increases in DCC prevalence are smaller at high dust concentrations than at low concentrations. These observations suggest that not only is dust a comparatively ineffective CCN source, but it may also act as a condensation/coagulation sink for chemical precursors to CCN, reducing total CCN availability over large spatial scales by inhibiting new particle formation from marine emissions. These observations represent the first time this process, previously predicted by models, has been supported and quantified by measurements.

TI  - Monogenic variants in dystonia: an exome-wide sequencing study
T2  - LANCET NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Dystonia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition that occurs in isolation (isolated dystonia), in combination with other movement disorders (combined dystonia), or in the context of multisymptomatic phenotypes (isolated or combined dystonia with other neurological involvement). However, our understanding of its aetiology is still incomplete. We aimed to elucidate the monogenic causes for the major clinical categories of dystonia.Methods For this exome-wide sequencing study, study participants were identified at 33 movement-disorder and neuropaediatric specialty centres in Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Switzerland. Each individual with dystonia was diagnosed in accordance with the dystonia consensus definition. Index cases were eligible for this study if they had no previous genetic diagnosis and no indication of an acquired cause of their illness. The second criterion was not applied to a subset of participants with a working clinical diagnosis of dystonic cerebral palsy. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood of participants and whole-exome sequenced. To find causative variants in known disorder-associated genes, all variants were filtered, and unreported variants were classified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. All considered variants were reviewed in expert round-table sessions to validate their clinical significance. Variants that survived filtering and interpretation procedures were defined as diagnostic variants. In the cases that went undiagnosed, candidate dystonia-causing genes were prioritised in a stepwise workflow.Findings We sequenced the exomes of 764 individuals with dystonia and 346 healthy parents who were recruited between June 1, 2015, and July 31, 2019. We identified causative or probable causative variants in 135 (19%) of 728 families, involving 78 distinct monogenic disorders. We observed a larger proportion of individuals with diagnostic variants in those with dystonia (either isolated or combined) with coexisting non-movement disorder-related neurological symptoms (100 [45%] of 222; excepting cases with evidence of perinatal brain injury) than in those with combined (19 [19%] of 98) or isolated (16 [4%] of 388) dystonia. Across all categories of dystonia, 104 (65%) of the 160 detected variants affected genes which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We found diagnostic variants in 11 genes not previously linked to dystonia, and propose a predictive clinical score that could guide the implementation of exome sequencing in routine diagnostics. In cases without perinatal sentinel events, genomic alterations contributed substantively to the diagnosis of dystonic cerebral palsy. In 15 families, we delineated 12 candidate genes. These include IMPDH2, encoding a key purine biosynthetic enzyme, for which robust evidence existed for its involvement in a neurodevelopmental disorder with dystonia. We identified six variants in IMPDH2, collected from four independent cohorts, that were predicted to be deleterious de-novo variants and expected to result in deregulation of purine metabolism.Interpretation In this study, we have determined the role of monogenic variants across the range of dystonic disorders, providing guidance for the introduction of personalised care strategies and fostering follow-up pathophysiological explorations.

TI  - Prospecting for gold mineralization with the use of remote sensing and GIS technology in North Kordofan State, central Sudan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to carry out regional geological mapping and gold prospecting in the poor savannah Northern Kordofan State, central Sudan. The selection of the study area was based on its favorable gold mineralization geological setting. Syntheses of the various forms of imagery, digital image processing, spectral analysis and office mapping were conducted before going into the field. Field observations, chemical analysis and petrographic investigations have all been integrated with the help of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to come out with reliable interpretation that can be implemented in similar geologic setting and climatic conditions. A package of digital image processing techniques was applied to Landsat7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image in order to increase the visual interpretability of the various lithological units for the purpose of geological mapping and delineation of alteration zones, which represent possible target zones for gold mineralization. Different color composite images in addition to the result of image transformation (including Red Green Blue, RGB to Intensity Hue Saturation, IHS; Principal Component Analysis, PCA) were prepared to facilitate the delineation of the main rock groups. Several ratio images were prepared, combined together and displayed in RGB color composites. The outcome of the image processing is the discovery of many alteration and shear zones which trend north-northeast to south-southwest affecting most of the rock types. 139 chip samples were collected from the alteration and shear zones, which were delineated by remote sensing data interpretation and actual field work. They include samples from quartz veins and rock alteration zones which were analyzed by fire assay. All the collected samples proved to be gold-bearing. The Au values range from 0.1 to 84.9 g/ton. Artisanal mining activity in the study area coincided with the remotely sensed data interpretation results conducted in this work, i.e. during the field checkup artisanal miners were found in the places where anomalous signals appeared in the satellite image, thus reinforcing the reliability of the employed approach of remote sensing and GIS for gold prospecting in poor savannah zones.

TI  - Fourier Domain Anomaly Detection and Spectral Fusion for Stripe Noise Removal of TIR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe noise is a common and unwelcome noise pattern in various thermal infrared (TIR) image data including conventional TIR images and remote sensing TIR spectral images. Most existing stripe noise removal (destriping) methods are often difficult to keep a good and robust efficacy in dealing with the real-life complex noise cases. In this paper, based on the intrinsic spectral properties of TIR images and stripe noise, we propose a novel two-stage transform domain destriping method called Fourier domain anomaly detection and spectral fusion (ADSF). Considering the principal frequencies polluted by stripe noise as outliers in the statistical spectrum of TIR images, our naive idea is first to detect the potential anomalies and then correct them effectively in the Fourier domain to reconstruct a desired destriping result. More specifically, anomaly detection for stripe frequencies is achieved through a regional comparison between the original spectrum and the expected spectrum that statistically follows a generalized Laplacian regression model, and then an anomaly weight map is generated accordingly. In the correction stage, we propose a guidance-image-based spectrum fusion strategy, which integrates the original spectrum and the spectrum of a guidance image via the anomaly weight map. The final reconstruction result not only has no stripe noise but also maintains image structures and details well. Extensive real experiments are performed on conventional TIR images and remote sensing spectral images, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative assessment results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and strong robustness of the proposed method.

TI  - One and a half century of avalanche risk to settlements in the upper Maurienne valley inferred from land cover and socio-environmental changes
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in mountain landscape can affect avalanche activity, causing changes in risk, potentially enhanced by a transition of the socio-environmental system and its underlying dynamics. Thus, integrative approaches combining biophysical and social sciences are required to assess changes in risk in all its dimensions. This study proposes a holistic methodology combining land cover change detection using advanced image processing techniques, geohistorical investigations and qualitative modelling of risk changes in order to infer the evolution of avalanche risk and its drivers in the upper Maurienne (French Alps) from 1860 to 2017. Results show that a continuous increase of forested areas associated with the retraction of agro-pastoral zones followed a period of land abandonment and depopulation. However, reforestation within avalanche paths remains largely incomplete and mostly absent in the majority of release areas, making a decrease in avalanche occurrence and propagation unlikely. This, combined with marked urban sprawl partially concentrated in avalanche prone areas, locally increased the exposure of residential settlements to avalanches. Hence, even if new defense structures have been set up, our analysis indicates that avalanche risk in the upper Maurienne increased through the study period. Even if local specificity related to physical dissimilarities and/or distinguished socio-economic trends always exist, our results may be valid for many high alpine valleys. Our approach is also transferable to other natural hazards, notably in wider mountain environments, as a contribution to the elaboration of effective adaptation strategies in a context of increasing risks related to combined climate change and socio-economic transitions.

TI  - Response of Natural Vegetation to Climate in Dryland Ecosystems: A Comparative Study between Xinjiang and Arizona
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most sensitive areas to climate change, drylands cover similar to 40% of the Earth's terrestrial land surface and host more than 38% of the global population. Meanwhile, their response to climate change and variability carries large uncertainties as induced by background climate, topography, and land cover composition; but there is a lack of intercomparison of different dryland ecosystems. In this study, we compare the changing climate and corresponding responses of major natural vegetation cover types in Xinjiang and Arizona, two typical drylands with similar landscapes in Asia and North America. Long-term (2002-2019) quasi-8-day datasets of daily precipitation, daily mean temperature, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were constructed based on station observations and remote sensing products. We found that much of Xinjiang experienced warming and wetting trends (although not co-located) over the past 18 years. In contrast, Arizona was dominated by warming with insignificant wetting or drying trends. Significant greening trends were observed in most parts of both study areas, while the increasing rate of NDVI anomalies was relatively higher in Xinjiang, jointly contributed by its colder and drier conditions. Significant degradation of vegetation growth (especially for shrubland) was observed over 18.8% of Arizona due to warming. Our results suggest that responses of similar natural vegetation types under changing climate can be diversified, as controlled by temperature and moisture in areas with different aridity.

TI  - Development of a high-resolution emission inventory of agricultural machinery with a novel methodology: A case study for Yangtze River Delta region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent increased use of agricultural machines elevated the atmospheric pollutant emissions in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in eastern China. Given the potentially large environmental and health impacts in busy seasons with enhanced machinery usage, it is important to accurately estimate the magnitude, spatial and temporal distributions of the emissions. We developed a novel method to estimate the real-world in-use agricultural machinery emissions, by combining satellite data, land and soil information, and in-house investigation. The machinery usage was determined based on the spatial distribution, growing and rotation pattern of the crops. The varied requirement of machinery power by heterogeneous soil texture, which was ignored in the previous studies, was considered in our methodology. The spatiotemporal pattern of machinery usage was determined based on the explored quantitative correlation between the local agricultural activity duration and the geographic location of the activity. A "grid-based" (30 x 30 m) inventory with daily emissions was then obtained, achieving significant improvement on spatial and temporal resolution. It substantially diminished the bias of previous inventories based on the machinery population or power installation census data. The emissions of NOX, PM2.5, CO and THC were estimated at 36300, 2000, 36900 and 8430 metric tons in YRD, with the majority contribution from Anhui and Jiangsu. Ten cities locating in northern and central Anhui and Jiangsu contributed the largest machinery emissions, accounting for 60% of the total emissions in YRD. Harvesting was found to have the largest emissions, followed by tilling and planting. Regarding the crops, the emissions from wheat and rice related machinery usage were the largest. In the busy seasons (spring and autumn), larger daily NOx and PM2.5 emissions were found from machinery than on-road vehicles in 42% of counties in Anhui and Jiangsu, highlighting the necessity of careful strategy making on controls of priority emission source.

TI  - Temporal paradox in soil potassium estimations using spaceborne multispectral imagery
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The time difference between the field sampling and acquired spaceborne imagery has always been ignored in satellite-based soil analyses. In this study, the impacts of the time difference on soil nutrient predictions and the underlying mechanism for these predictions were investigated using a case study from the North China Plain. Soil total potassium (TK) was sampled in 2016 and was subsequently analyzed, with the soil TK content then predicted using the original reflectances from eight Landsat TM/OLI images that spanned the 1986-2016 period as inputs to multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The results reveal a temporal paradox, where earlier satellite imagery yields higher accuracy in the predictions than does the more recent imagery. Historical soil nutrient data sets were used to explain this temporal paradox, which indicated that both an internal and external factor influenced the soil TK predictions. The internal factor, the deposition pattern across the study region, was found to strongly control the spatial distribution of potassium and exhibited minimal changes over the past 30 years, which influenced the good soil TK predictions using the early satellite imagery. The external factor, the soil organic matter (SOM), which has a stronger impact on the spectral reflectances than the soil TK, indicated that the increase and regional uniformization of SOM contents caused by Chinese agricultural development from the 1980s to the early 2000s masked the true spectral response of soil TK and explained the decline in the prediction accuracy of soil TK with time. This study reveals a potential limitation in remote-sensing-based soil TK predictions, and indicates that early satellite imagery should be considered as a potentially important factor in future research in order to accurately assess soil nutrient.

TI  - Comparison of land surface phenology in the Northern Hemisphere based on AVHRR GIMMS3g and MODIS datasets
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes inconsistencies in remotely sensed land surface phenology (LSP) reported by AVHRR GIMMS3g and MODIS datasets across land cover types of the Northern Hemisphere. We extracted the start of the growing season (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS) from the AVHRR GIMMS3g (1982-2015) and MODIS (2000-2015) datasets, and weekly GPP mean data from the Fluxnet2015 dataset to compare spatial patterns and trends of the phenological indicators in the Northern Hemisphere. We used the same method to fit the time series curves and extract phenological parameters from the two datasets to avoid uncertainties caused by differences in fitting and extraction approach. The results showed that (1) The multi-year means extracted from the GIMMS3g (1982-2015 and 2000-2015) and MODIS (2000-2015) datasets in the Northern Hemisphere display greater differences in the spatial distribution of SOS than EOS; (2) Under the 95% confidence level, GIMMS3g showed a significantly delayed (0.1716 days/year) SOS and advanced (0.9172 days/year) EOS in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere between 2000 and 2015. The SOS and EOS extracted from the MODIS dataset exhibited significantly advanced (0.5861 days/year) and delayed (0.6305 days/year) trends, respectively; (3) From 2000 to 2015, the same significant trends were observed in the SOS and EOS from two datasets, accounting for 1.33% and 1.17% of the total pixels in the Northern Hemisphere, respectively. (4) From 2000 to 2015, a significantly advanced trends in SOS extracted from MODIS (M_SOS) was more frequent than for GIMMS3g (G_SOS) in different land cover types at high latitude. EOS extracted from GIMMS3g (G_EOS) had a significantly advanced trend, and EOS extracted from MODIS (M_EOS) had a significantly delayed trend in different land cover types. The phenological parameters obtained from GIMMS3g are closer to ground phenology than those from MODIS. The results suggest that the phenological parameters derived from different datasets have different effects on the LSP trend.

TI  - Influence of Land Use Change on Hydrological Cycle: Application of SWAT to Su-Mi-Huai Area in Beijing, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The human activities and urbanization process have changed the underlying surface of urban areas, which would affect the recharge of groundwater through rainfall infiltration and may further influence the groundwater environment. Accordingly, it is imperative to investigate the variation of hydrological cycle under the condition of underlying surface change. Based on the high-precision remote sensing data of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015, and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, this work firstly studied the land use change and the corresponding changes in runoff generation mechanism and rainfall infiltration coefficient in Su-Mi-Huai area, Beijing, China. Meanwhile, SWAT-MODFLOW semi-loose coupling model was applied to analyze the water balance in the study area in typical hydrological years. The results showed that the area of the construction land (urban and rural residential land) increased by 1.04 times from 2000 to 2015, which is mainly attributed to the conversion of cultivated land to construction land in the plain area. This change caused the runoff in the area to increase by 7 x 10(6) m(3), the runoff coefficient increased by 17.9%, and the precipitation infiltration coefficient was less than the empirical value determined by lithology. Compared with 2000, the average annual precipitation infiltration coefficient in 2018 decreased by 6.5%. Under the influence of urbanization process, the maximum reduction rate of precipitation infiltration recharge is up to 38%. The study investigated the response of surface runoff and precipitation infiltration recharge to land use change, which can provide helps for water resources managers to coordinate the relationship between land use change and rational water resources planning.

TI  - Evaluation of effective spectral features for glacial lake mapping by using Landsat-8 OLI imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake mapping provides the most feasible way for investigating the water resources and monitoring the flood outburst hazards in High Mountain Region. However, various types of glacial lakes with different properties bring a constraint to the rapid and accurate glacial lake mapping over a large scale. Existing spectral features to map glacial lakes are diverse but some are generally limited to the specific glaciated regions or lake types, some have unclear applicability, which hamper their application for the large areas. To this end, this study provides a solution for evaluating the most effective spectral features in glacial lake mapping using Landsat-8 imagery. The 23 frequently-used lake mapping spectral features, including single band reflectance features, Water Index features and image transformation features were selected, then the insignificant features were filtered out based on scoring calculated from two classical feature selection methods - random forest and decision tree algorithm. The result shows that the three most prominent spectral features (SF) with high scores are NDWI1, EWI, and NDWI3 (renamed as SF8, SF19 and SF12 respectively). Accuracy assessment of glacial lake mapping results in five different test sites demonstrate that the selected features performed well and robustly in classifying different types of glacial lakes without any influence from the mountain shadows. SF8 and SF19 are superior for the detection of large amount of small glacial lakes, while some lake areas extracted by SF12 are incomplete. Moreover, SF8 achieved better accuracy than the other two features in terms of both Kappa Coefficient (0.88(12)) and Prediction (0.9025), which further indicates that SF8 has great potential for large scale glacial lake mapping in high mountainous area.

TI  - Automatic High-Resolution Land Cover Production in Madagascar Using Sentinel-2 Time Series, Tile-Based Image Classification and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Madagascar, one of Earth's biodiversity hotpots, is characterized by heterogeneous landscapes and huge land cover change. To date, fine, reliable and timely land cover information is scarce in Madagascar. However, mapping high-resolution land cover map in the tropics has been challenging due to limitations associated with heterogeneous landscapes, the volume of satellite data used, and the design of methodology. In this study, we proposed an automatic approach in which the tile-based model was used on each tile (defining an extent of 1 degrees x 1 degrees as a tile) for mapping land cover in Madagascar. We combined spectral-temporal, textural and topographical features derived from all available Sentinel-2 observations (i.e., 11,083 images) on Google Earth Engine (GEE). We generated a 10-m land cover map for Madagascar, with an overall accuracy of 89.2% based on independent validation samples obtained from a field survey and visual interpretation of very high-resolution (0.5-5 m) images. Compared with the conventional approach (i.e., the overall model used in the entire study area), our method enables reduce the misclassifications between several land cover types, including impervious land, grassland and wetland. The proposed approach demonstrates a great potential for mapping land cover in other tropical or subtropical regions.

TI  - Remote sensing modeling of urban density dynamics across 36 major cities in China: Fresh insights from hierarchical urbanized space
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is considered to be of high relevance for global/local environment change, but its multidimensional change features over time have rarely been reported, especially for the process, states and consequences of urban density growth at hierarchical scales of urbanized area. To fill this gap, here, we firstly integrated 27-years' worth of consistent nighttime light (NTL) time series with land cover dataset, to reconstruct 4 basic, 13 archetypes of temporal trajectories of urban density dynamics with an objected-oriented analysis, and measured their spatio-temporal patterns over hierarchical urbanized space that spanned from landscape patches to 36 major cities in China. Our results showed that, from the micro patch dynamics, the logistic pattern is striking among 4 models over most of time periods, accounting for similar to 45.63% of the total patch amounts and similar to 43.73% of the total patch area, respectively, while the exponential pattern contributes the least. Moreover, the structural transition of thematic features revealed their spatial gradient delay from established patches to newly developed patches, from infilling patches to outlying patches. In terms of the space of cities, seven typical clusters of urbanization evolution were identified, however, under different policies, reform practice and developmental history. Additional three alternative states of urban density were also organized for estimated future pathways. Therefore, according to our new insights into inter- and intra-city analysis, both the differentiated strategies for horizontal cities and trade-offs of spatial configuration for urban interior areas were informed to formulate effective science-policy interface.

TI  - Impact of Rapid and Intensive Land Use/Land Cover Change on Soil Properties in Arid Regions: A Case Study of Lanzhou New Area, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change widely occurs during urbanization and can affect the functionality of soil ecosystems by altering soil physicochemical properties. However, few studies have evaluated the impacts of LULC change on soils in arid regions. This study investigates LULC change patterns during 2010-2017 in Lanzhou New Area, China based on remotely sensed data (Chinese GaoFen-1 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite). We identified five main land use change types and reference native grassland and farmland to determine soil properties at different depths. Principal component analysis and scatter matrix were employed to evaluate the effect of LULC change on soil properties. The results showed that LULC changes that occurred in Lanzhou New Area were characterized by the rapid growth of construction and bare land (increased by 13.06% and 5.97%, respectively) at the expense of farmland (decreased by 25.38%). The conversion of native grassland to artificial grassland and bare land, and farmland to bare land had similar effects on soil properties; i.e., a significant decline and a lower level in total nitrogen and soil organic carbon. The farmland to construction land transition deteriorated soil nutrients and increased soil compaction by both increasing bulk density (BD, mean = 1.63 g cm(-3)) and enhancing sand content by 69.21%. All land use change types increased BD and decreased soil water content and saturated soil water content when compared to the reference areas. These results indicate that changes in LULC have significant impacts on soil physicochemical properties. Thus, it is essential to optimize land planning and improve soil quality in arid ecosystems to ensure sustainable resource management and ecosystem conservation.

TI  - On the Nonlinear Mapping of an Ocean Wave Spectrum into a New Polarimetric SAR Image Spectrum
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new nonlinear transformation relation is derived to describe the mapping of a two-dimensional ocean wave spectrum into a new polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image spectrum. It is a further expansion and improvement of Hasselmann's work. First, the nonlinear mapping relation proposed is derived on the basis of a new polarimetric SAR image instead of the conventional single-polarization SAR image. Second, the nonlinear mapping relation no longer includes the complex hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (MTF). Third, the traditional tilt MTF, which is not accurate enough for the retrieval of sea wave spectrum, is replaced by an empirical tilt MTF derived on the basis of the C-band geophysical model function [i.e., C-band synthetic aperture radar (CSAR) normalized radar cross section (NRCS) model]. A sea wave spectrum retrieval algorithm is then proposed that is based on the new nonlinear mapping and the empirical tilt MTF. The retrieved spectra from C-band polarized RADARSAT-2 SAR images are compared with the results obtained by the ECMWF Ocean Wave Model (ECWAM) and buoy measurements.

TI  - Variation of Melt Water and Rainfall Runoff and Their Impacts on Streamflow Changes during Recent Decades in Two Tibetan Plateau Basins
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To fully understand potential changes in hydrological regime over the Lhasa River Basin (LRB) and the upstream of Niyang River Basin (UNRB) in Tibetan Plateau under global warming, the VIC-glacier model was employed to analyze the responses of rainfall runoff and melt water to recent climate change, and we also quantify their roles in controlling the trend of river streamflow during 1963-2012. The hydrological model was calibrated using the observed streamflow, glacier mass balance, and MODIS snow cover. The simulations indicate that there is a significant increasing trend in glacier runoff for both basins during 1963-2012, especially in the period of 2000s when it exhibits a large increment up to about 45% relative to baseline period. Rainfall runoff suggests a rising tendency whereas snowmelt runoff displays a general decreasing tendency. For both basins, increasing rainfall runoff was identified as the dominant driver for the upward trend in total runoff during 1963-2012. The role of glacier runoff in controlling the trend of total runoff is also obvious, especially in the more glaciated UNRB where increased glacier runoff accounts for up to 41% of the tendency in river discharge. Snowmelt runoff plays a minor role in affecting the trend of total runoff.

TI  - SAR imaging of multiple maritime moving targets based on sparsity Bayesian learning
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging of multiple maritime moving targets is a challenging task in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system owing to the fact that the complex target motion produces evident image defocusing. Given that the sparsity of ship targets in the SAR image, the authors propose a new imaging method of multiple maritime moving targets based on sparsity Bayesian learning. To avoid the overcomplete velocity dictionary with heavy computational burden, the Gaussian chirplet transform is exploited and improved based on the velocity constraint to estimate target Doppler parameters for the observation matrix construction. An observation model is established for imaging multiple ship targets. In the proposed method, the multiple ship target imaging task is formulated into the sparsity Bayesian framework, which provides a posterior density function for the target image and improves the imaging quality over the conventional methods based on the point estimate. The Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) using a hierarchical form of the Laplace prior is applied to reconstruct the moving target image. Since BCS provides an estimation of the uncertainty in the reconstruction, the sea clutter can be well suppressed while the multiple targets are refocused. Simulations and experimental Gaofen-3 data are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - 10-m-resolution mangrove maps of China derived from multi-source and multi-temporal satellite observations
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China has lost 50% of its mangroves since the 1950s, while the remaining mangroves are exhibiting an increase in fragmentation. While a detailed mangrove map of China derived from remote sensing imagery is crucial for protecting mangroves, fragmented mangrove patches are hardly captured by Landsat-derived 30-m-resolution maps. To overcome this limitation, we proposed 10-m-resolution mangrove maps for 2017 using Sentinel SAR and optical time-series imagery, together with terrain data. We first classified coastal land covers based on quantile synthesis; following this, the mangrove category was refined by applying the tidal flat constraint and manual editing. The proposed approach considered factors that limit the accuracy of mangrove maps, including tidal inundation, intertidal terrain, cloudiness, and phenological variations of vegetation. A pixel-based mangrove map (PXL_Map) and an object-based mangrove map (OBJ_Map) were produced using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. PXL_Map achieved an overall accuracy of 95.3 +/- 0.2% based on validation samples, and a 91.6% accuracy based on field sample plots. OBJ_Map had a slightly lower performance than PXL_Map. The maps produced in this study improved the delineation of small mangrove patches along tidal creeks relative to recent Landsat-based maps. The total mangrove area was estimated to be between 21,148 ha (by PXL_Map) and 24,801 ha (by OBJ_Map). Furthermore, the spatial differences among the mangrove maps produced in this study were quantitatively compared with three other existing mangrove maps. The discrepancies among maps could have been due to the size and the location of the mangrove patches. The 10-m-resolution mangrove maps from this study can help manage and protect mangroves in China, especially the small fragmented mangrove patches scattered along the coast.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION

AB  - Mapping population distribution at fine resolutions with high accuracy is crucial to urban planning and management. This paper takes Guangzhou city as the study area, illustrates the gridded population distribution map by using machine learning methods based on zoning strategy with multisource geospatial data such as night light remote sensing data, point of interest data, land use data, and so on. The street-level accuracy evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieved good overall accuracy, with determinant coefficient (R-2) being 0.713 and root mean square error (RMSE) being 5512.9. Meanwhile, the goodness of fit for single linear regression (LR) model and random forest (RF) regression model are 0.0039 and 0.605, respectively. For dense area, the accuracy of the random forest model is better than the linear regression model, while for sparse area, the accuracy of the linear regression model is better than the random forest model. The results indicated that the proposed method has great potential in fine-scale population mapping. Therefore, it is advised that the zonal modeling strategy should be the primary choice for solving regional differences in the population distribution mapping research.

TI  - The Spatial-Spectral-Environmental Extraction Endmember Algorithm and Application in the MODIS Fractional Snow Cover Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Endmember extraction is a primary and indispensable component of the spectral mixing analysis model applicated to quantitatively retrieve fractional snow cover (FSC) from satellite observation. In this study, a new endmember extraction algorithm, the spatial-spectral-environmental (SSE) endmember extraction algorithm, is developed, in which spatial, spectral and environmental information are integrated together to automatically extract different types of endmembers from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Then, combining the linear spectral mixture analysis model (LSMA), the SSE endmember extraction algorithm is practically applied to retrieve FSC from standard MODIS surface reflectance products in China. The new algorithm of MODIS FSC retrieval is named as SSEmod. The accuracy of SSEmod is quantitatively validated with 16 higher spatial-resolution FSC maps derived from Landsat 8 binary snow cover maps. Averaged over all regions, the average root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are 0.136 and 0.092, respectively. Simultaneously, we also compared the SSEmod with MODImLAB, MODSCAG and MOD10A1. In all regions, the average RMSE of SSEmod is improved by 2.3%, 2.6% and 5.3% compared to MODImLAB for 0.157, MODSCAG for 0.157 and MOD10A1 for 0.189. Therefore, our SSE endmember extraction algorithm is reliable for the MODIS FSC retrieval and may be also promising to apply other similar satellites in view of its accuracy and efficiency.

TI  - Connections between the hydrological cycle and crop yield in the rainfed US Corn Belt
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water stress is one of the major abiotic stresses and directly affects crop growth and influences crop yields. To better quantify the responses of crop yield to hydrological variability in the rainfed Corn Belt of the United States (U.S.), we analyzed the relationships between corn/soybean yield and hydrological cycle metrics, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamic at the agricultural district and interannual scale between 2003 and 2014. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) to optimally integrate different hydrological metrics and drought indices to define a crop-specific new drought index that uses crop yield as the target, and investigated the contributions of those hydrological cycle components to the new drought index. We used both observed and modeled hydrological cycle metrics, as well as several drought indices in this study, including evapotranspiration (ET) and potential ET (PET), terrestrial water storage change (Delta S), surface soil moisture (SSM), river discharge (Q), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), fET (the ratio of ET to PET), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Our results revealed that: (1) VPD, SSM, and fET showed the strongest correlations with crop yield, among the observation-based hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices considered here. Most of the hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices showed similar seasonal correlation patterns with crop yield, and this pattern revealed that the sensitivity of crop growth to water stress peaked in July for corn and in August for soybean in the rainfed U.S. Corn Belt. (2) The drought in 2012 started with higher water demand (reflected in abnormally high ET, PET, and VPD) and lower water supply (reflected in abnormally low P), followed by soil water depletion (as revealed in SSM and Delta S), leading to massive crop yield losses due to increased constraints on both water supply and demand. (3) The R-2 of the PLSR-based crop yield model reached 0.76 and 0.70 for corn and soybean, respectively. For both corn and soybean, the first PLSR component was mainly composed of information from VPD, fET,Delta S and SSM, indicating atmospheric water deficit and soil water storage both play critical roles in quantifying corn and soybean yield loss due to water stress.

TI  - Combining Phenological Camera Photos and MODIS Reflectance Data to Predict GPP Daily Dynamics for Alpine Meadows on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is the overall photosynthetic fixation of carbon per unit space and time. Due to uncertainties resulting from clouds, snow, aerosol, and topography, it is a challenging task to accurately estimate daily GPP. Daily digital photos from a phenological camera record vegetation daily greenness dynamics with little cloud or aerosol disturbance. It can be fused with satellite remote sensing data to improve daily GPP prediction accuracy. In this study, we combine the two types of datasets to improve the estimation accuracy of GPP for alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. To examine the performance of different methods and vegetation indices (VIs), three experiments were designed. First, GPP was estimated with the light use efficiency (LUE) model with the green chromatic coordinate (GCC) from the phenological camera and vegetation index from MODIS, respectively. Second, GPP was estimated with the Backpropagation neural network machine learning algorithm (BNNA) method with GCC from the phenological camera and vegetation index from MODIS, respectively. Finally, GPP was estimated with the BNNA method using GCC and vegetation index as inputs at the same time. Compared with eddy covariance GPP, GPP predicted by the BNNA method with GCC and vegetation indices as inputs at the same time showed the highest accuracy of all the experiments. The results indicated that GCC had a higher accuracy than NDVI and EVI when only one vegetation index data was used in the LUE model or the BNNA method. The R-2 of GPP estimated by BNNA and GPP from eddy covariance increased by 0.12 on average, RMSE decreased by 1.13 g C center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) on average, and MAD decreased by 0.87 g C center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) on average compared with GPP estimated by the traditional LUE model and GPP from eddy covariance. This study puts forth a new way to improve the estimation accuracy of GPP on the Tibetan Plateau. With the emergence of a large number of phenological cameras, this method has great potential for use on the Tibetan Plateau, which is heavily affected by clouds and snow.

TI  - Evaluation of TMPA Satellite Precipitation in Driving VIC Hydrological Model over the Upper Yangtze River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) has come to an end, the evaluation of TRMM satellite precipitation is still of great significance for the improvement of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM). In this paper, the hydrological utility of TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42 RTV7/V7 precipitation products was evaluated using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model in the upper Yangtze River basin. The main results show that (1) TMPA 3B42V7 had a reliable performance in precipitation estimation compared with the gauged precipitation on both spatial and temporal scales over the upper Yangtze River basin. Although TMPA 3B42V7 slightly underestimated precipitation, TMPA 3B42RTV7 significantly overestimated precipitation at daily and monthly time scales; (2) the simulated runoff by the VIC hydrological model showed a high correlation with the gauged runoff and lower bias at daily and monthly time scales. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) value was as high as 0.85, the relative bias (RB) was -6.36% and the correlation coefficient (CC) was 0.93 at the daily scale; (3) the accuracy of the 3B42RTV7-driven runoff simulation had been greatly improved by using the hydrological calibration parameters obtained from 3B42RTV7 compared with that of gauged precipitation. A lower RB (14.38% vs. 66.58%) and a higher CC (0.87 vs. 0.85) and NSCE (0.71 vs. -0.92) can be found at daily time scales when we use satellite data instead of gauged precipitation data to calibrate the VIC model. However, the performance of the 3B42V7-driven runoff simulation did not improve in the same operation accordingly. The cause might be that the 3B42V7 satellite products have been adjusted by gauged precipitation. This study suggests that it might be better to calibrate the parameters using satellite data in hydrological simulations, especially for unadjusted satellite data. This study is not only helpful for understanding the assessment of multi-satellite precipitation products in large-scale and complex areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, but also can provide a reference for the hydrological utility of the satellite precipitation products in other river basins of the world.

TI  - Delay-Throughput Tradeoff in Satellite Data Relay Networks with Prioritized User Satellites
T2  - CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficient antenna scheduling strategy for data relay satellites (DRSs) is essential to optimize the throughput or delay of the satellite data relay network. However, these two objectives conflict with each other since the user satellites (USs) with higher priorities take up more transmission time of DRSs' antennas for greater throughput but the USs storing more packets cause a severer waiting delay to the whole network. To balance the conflicting metrics for meeting the delay-throughput integrated requirements, we formulate the antenna scheduling as a stochastic non-convex fractional programming, which is challenging to be solved. For the tractability, we equivalently transform the fractional programming to a parametric problem and implement the Lyapunov drift to guarantee the constraint of mean rate stability. By proposing a delay and throughput tradeoff based antenna scheduling algorithm, we further transform the parametric problem to a solvable weight matching problem. Simulation results reveal the feasible region of the preference control parameter for integrated QoS cases and its variation relationship with network delay and throughput.

M3  - Article
AB  - Annotation. The article is devoted to the study of the image of Peter I, which is considered as a sense-forming, integral attitude of the subject to the phenomena of the external world. Describes what queries in search engines Yandex and Goggle, demonstrated a high interest in Peter, not only Russians, but also representatives of many foreign countries, which is caused by the representation of his life in periodical literature. The purpose of the research was a content-structural analysis of the image of Peter I in the Electronic scientific library, in particular in the RSCI. The research revealed that the leading topics of analysis in the scientific library are the personality of Peter I,' his reform efforts and the very atmosphere of that historical period. It is shown that the image of the Emperor is most often associated with his historical achievements, which were entirely devoted to serving the Fatherland. Nevertheless, the activities of the Emperor and his reforms are characterized ambiguously and even contradictory, ambivalence is also present in the assessment of the social environment of Emperor. It is shown that the inconsistency of assessments is associated with historical periods and ideological positions of the authors. Thus, foreign researchers are characterized by the idea of the special role of England in the worldview of Peter I. The bibliographic analysis was performed by automated analysis of texts containing the word "personality", as well as its corresponding synonyms. The study also used frequency analysis of words. In conclusion, it is noted that the presented automated developments of bibliographic analysis of large text materials have a high scientific potential.

TI  - MW-ACGAN: Generating Multiscale High-Resolution SAR Images for Ship Detection
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection, the number of SAR samples seriously affects the performance of the algorithms based on deep learning. In this paper, aiming at the application requirements of high-resolution ship detection in small samples, a high-resolution SAR ship detection method combining an improved sample generation network, Multiscale Wasserstein Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (MW-ACGAN) and the Yolo v3 network is proposed. Firstly, the multi-scale Wasserstein distance and gradient penalty loss are used to improve the original Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN), so that the improved network can stably generate high-resolution SAR ship images. Secondly, the multi-scale loss term is added to the network, so the multi-scale image output layers are added, and multi-scale SAR ship images can be generated. Then, the original ship data set and the generated data are combined into a composite data set to train the Yolo v3 target detection network, so as to solve the problem of low detection accuracy under small sample data set. The experimental results of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) 3 m SAR data show that the MW-ACGAN network can generate multi-scale and multi-class ship slices, and the confidence level of ResNet18 is higher than that of ACGAN network, with an average score of 0.91. The detection results of Yolo v3 network model show that the detection accuracy trained by the composite data set is as high as 94%, which is far better than that trained only by the original SAR data set. These results show that our method can make the best use of the original data set, improve the accuracy of ship detection.

TI  - Privacy for the weak, transparency for the powerful: the cypherpunk ethics of Julian Assange
T2  - ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - WikiLeaks is among the most controversial institutions of the last decade, and this essay contributes to an understanding of WikiLeaks by revealing the philosophical paradigm at the foundation of Julian Assange's worldview: cypherpunk ethics. The cypherpunk movement emerged in the early-1990s, advocating the widespread use of strong cryptography as the best means for defending individual privacy and resisting authoritarian governments in the digital age. For the cypherpunks, censorship and surveillance were the twin evils of the computer age, but they viewed encryption as a means to circumvent both. As a cypherpunk, Assange advocates for the use of cryptography in the fight for individual privacy as well as the fight for global justice. His cosmopolitan disposition is informed by his hacker background, antiwar principles, and Enlightenment outlook. This essay places Assange's philosophical idea in historical context, exploring his views on censorship, surveillance, and the right to communicate. It also connects his cypherpunk principles to WikiLeaks, showing that the strategy of encouraging data leaks from powerful political and economic organizations is classic cypherpunk political praxis.

TI  - Numerical modelling of land subsidence related to groundwater withdrawal in the Firenze-Prato-Pistoia basin (central Italy)
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tuscany region of Italy is widely affected by subsidence, landslides and floods, which severely impact buildings and infrastructure. In particular, Firenze-Prato-Pistoia basin has a long experience of ground deformation related to groundwater withdrawal. European remote-sensing satellite (ERS) data collected since 1992 have revealed the presence of several subsiding areas in the basin such as the south-eastern portion of the city of Pistoia. Sentinel-1 persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) measurements for 2015-2018 confirmed the long-term subsidence of this area, associated with intense horticulture (plant nurseries). At the same time, Sentinel-1 data revealed the unexpected movement of Pistoia historic center, which has always been considered stable in the past. To identify the complex relationship between aquifer conditions and ground displacement, a hydrogeologic model of the Pistoia aquifers was developed, applying an integrated modelling procedure. Hydrodynamic-parameter distributions, calibrated and validated by means of Sentinel-1 PSI measurements, suggest that subsidence in Pistoia area is probably related with the combined impacts of groundwater extraction and highly compressible aquitards. To evaluate the potential evolution of ground displacement, numerical simulations were extended until 2050, using regional and global climate model data, analyzing three different pumping-rate scenarios. This led to the development of several subsidence hazard maps of the city of Pistoia that display the influence of groundwater extraction in controlling land subsidence in the area. This study emphasizes the importance of developing proper groundwater management policies, especially in alluvial aquifers made of fine compressible sediments, in order to sustainably utilize underground freshwater resources and to avoid related side effects.

TI  - Fusion of Geochemical and Remote-Sensing Data for Lithological Mapping Using Random Forest Metric Learning
T2  - MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource geoscience data can provide significant information for mineral exploration in a variety of ways. For example, remote-sensing images record the spectral characteristics of objects, and geochemical data represent the enrichment or depletion of geochemical elements, which reflect the physical and chemical attributes of geological features. In this study, a hybrid model comprising data fusion and machine learning was applied for lithological mapping. This process is illustrated through a case study of mapping several lithological units in the Cuonadong Dome, in the northeastern part of the Himalayas, China. In this process, multisource data fusion technology is first used to provide more abundant information by integrating geochemical data and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) remote-sensing images, retaining both the geochemical patterns and the textural structure of the remote-sensing images. Then, a random forest metric learning (RFML) approach is employed to achieve a high classification performance based on the fused data. RFML adopts metric learning in the classification process of each decision tree calculation, making full use of the advantages of random forest and metric learning. Seven target lithological units were discriminated with 93.0% overall accuracy. This excellent performance demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid method in the geological exploration of areas in poor environments that have undergone limited geological research.

TI  - Harmonized One Health Trans-Species and Community Surveillance for Tackling Antibacterial Resistance in India: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: India has the largest burden of drug-resistant organisms compared with other countries around the world, including multiresistant and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis and resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are found in all living hosts and in the environment and move between hosts and ecosystems. An intricate interplay of infections, exposure to antibiotics, and disinfectants at individual and community levels among humans, animals, birds, and fishes triggers evolution and spread of resistance. The One Health framework proposes addressing antibiotic resistance as a complex multidisciplinary problem. However, the evidence base in the Indian context is limited.Objective: This multisectoral, trans-species surveillance project aims to document the infection and resistance patterns of 7 resistant-priority bacteria and the risk factors for resistance following the One Health framework and geospatial epidemiology.Methods: This hospital- and community-based surveillance adopts a cross-sectional design with mixed methodology (quantitative, qualitative, and spatial) data collection. This study is being conducted at 6 microbiology laboratories and communities in Khurda district, Odisha, India. The laboratory surveillance collects data on bacteria isolates from different hosts and their resistance patterns. The hosts for infection surveillance include humans, animals (livestock, food chain, and pet animals), birds (poultry), and freshwater fishes (not crustaceans). For eligible patients, animals, birds and fishes, detailed data from their households or farms on health care seeking (for animals, birds and fishes, the illness, and care seeking of the caretakers), antibiotic use, disinfection practices, and neighborhood exposure to infection risks will be collected. Antibiotic prescription and use patterns at hospitals and clinics, and therapeutic and nontherapeutic antibiotic and disinfectant use in farms will also be collected. Interviews with key informants from animal breeding, agriculture, and food processing will explore the perceptions, attitudes, and practices related to antibiotic use. The data analysis will follow quantitative (descriptive and analytical), qualitative, and geospatial epidemiology principles.Results: The study was funded in May 2019 and approved by Institute Ethics Committees in March 2019. The data collection started in September 2019 and shall continue till March 2021. As of June 2020, data for 56 humans, 30 animals and birds, and fishes from 10 ponds have been collected. Data analysis is yet to be done.Conclusions: This study will inform about the bacterial infection and resistance epidemiology among different hosts, the risk factors for infection, and resistance transmission. In addition, it will identify the potential triggers and levers for further exploration and action.

TI  - A SIMULATION APPROACH TO USING LANDSAT 8 IMAGERY TO DETERMINE A THRESHOLD FOR DETECTING CHANGES ALONG A STREAMSIDE MANAGEMENT ZONE: A CASE STUDY IN LOUISIANA
T2  - MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL FORESTRY & NATURAL-RESOURCE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data is often employed to assess land use/land cover changes, particularly over larger areas. However, little attention is given to how much area can change before a given land use/cover classification is detected using satellite data. This is an important consideration, particularly in the use of image classifications to assess best management practices (BMPs). To determine these changes, and their corresponding impacts on land cover classification, Landsat 8 data was acquired and an area selected where two land cover classes meet (i.e., forest and field). The Landsat pixels were subset into 900 one square meter (1 m(2)) pixels and the average pixel values for grass were utilized to simulate tree/forest removal. The objective is to determine how many pixels would be converted from forest to field before an unsupervised classification detected the change. Approximately 25 percent of the area changed before one Landsat pixel (30m) changed classes and 43 % of pixels changed before a row, representing a streamside management zone (SMZ), changed. This indicates that image resolution should be considered when using satellite imagery to assess BMPs/land cover changes.

TI  - Sentinel node occult lesion localization technique for impalpable breast cancer
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mammographic screening has enabled earlier detection of breast cancer, with 25-35% of malignancies being non-palpable at diagnosis. Accurate removal and sentinel node biopsy for staging these lesions are crucial to successful management. Both these aspects are achieved by peritumoural localization with radioisotope and lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node (SN) mapping using the sentinel node and occult lesion localization (SNOLL) technique. This study reports SNOLL outcomes in a large cohort of women with non-palpable breast cancers to assess its performance and promote its logistic advantages.Methods This retrospective cohort study used data from BreastSurgANZ Quality Audit supplemented with private case notes. Inclusion criteria were females >18 years, with invasive breast cancer that was asymptomatic and non-palpable at presentation, who underwent SNOLL (n = 450). Primary outcomes were proportion of successful lesion localization, proportion of patients requiring re-excision and volume of tissue excised. Secondary outcomes focused on lymphoscintigraphy success rate in detecting sentinel nodes and SN positivity rates.Results Tumours were successfully removed with the initial SNOLL procedure in 449 cases (99.8%). The re-excision rate was 15.1% (n = 68). The mean total excision volume was 54.69 cm(3) (95% CI 51.49-57.88 cm(3); range 2.75-195.33 cm(3)), with a mean closest circumferential margin of 7.05 mm (95% CI 6.60-7.49 mm; range 0 to >= 10 mm). Lymphoscintigraphy was successful in 96.9% (n = 436) of cases. Sentinel nodes were successfully identified and removed in 99.6% (n = 448) of cases. SN positivity rate was 18.4%.Conclusion SNOLL is an efficient and effective technique for localizing non-palpable invasive breast lesions while simultaneously identifying sentinel nodes.

TI  - Variance based fusion of VCI and TCI for efficient classification of agriculture drought using MODIS data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Overall health condition of the vegetation is obtained by combining satellite data derived moisture and thermal stresses present in vegetation condition index (VCI) and thermal condition index (TCI), respectively and improves the accuracy of drought classification. Although vegetation health index fuses the information present in VCI and TCI, the relative contribution of each index depends on prior knowledge of the study area. Therefore, the random weighing method is used to obtain optimal weights of VCI and TCI based on variances of individual indices. The obtained fusion results of a normal and drought year demonstrate that the random weighing fusion achieves better estimation of agriculture drought without requiring apriori information and the obtained drought classification results are in line with the available ground truth precipitation records. In addition, the correlation analysis of the obtained optimal weights and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index exhibited a strong correlation with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of above 0.8. The study also showed that the relative contribution of VCI is prevalent in normal conditions while TCI in dry to extreme dry conditions.

TI  - Cropland data fusion and correction using spatial analysis techniques and the Google Earth Engine
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate regional identification of cropland quantities and spatial distributions is important for cropland monitoring, food security, and sustainable regional development. Various countries and organizations have produced series of land-cover products. However, variability among remote sensors, land-cover classification schemes, and classification methods has resulted in discrepancies. In this study, we develop a novel method to improve cropland data accuracy for the Belt and Road (B&R) region, by fusing and correcting four cropland products: CCI-LC, GFSAD30, MCD12Q1, and FROM-GLC. Spatial analysis techniques are implemented, including climate stratification, consistency assessment, and statistical filtering, to develop training samples for model correction. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and random forest (RF) algorithm are executed with these training samples to correct fused multi-data product and generate a corrected 2015 cropland product. The corrected product indicates that cropland accounts for 14.94% of the B&R region, which is closer to the results found via FAO statistics than the results from any of the four individual land-cover products. On the national scale, the root mean square error between the corrected cropland product quantities and FAO statistics is 11.39% and the correlation coefficient value is 0.77. This indicates that the method exhibits better fitting characteristics. The accuracies of the areas of inconsistency among the four cropland products and our corrected product are assessed using 3112 visually interpreted samples and Google Earth. The overall accuracy of the corrected cropland product is 77.54% in inconsistent areas. The highest accuracy produced by the corrected cropland product indicates the effectiveness of our method, which can rapidly improve cropland data accuracy in heterogeneous regions. Combining the training samples produced by fusing existing cropland products and updating techniques with multi-source remote sensing data from the GEE platform, we foresee potential applications to update global cropland product.

TI  - Detecting Spatiotemporal Features of Phosphorus Concentrations Using MODIS Images: A Case Study of Hongze Lake, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal tendency of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in Hongze Lake were estimated using multiple Moderate - Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer/Aqua images (MODIS) from 2003 to 2017. Considering the non-significant spectral features of phosphorus, this study was designed to primarily link TP with sensitive water quality parameters. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was identified because SPM contents are sensitive to TP in Hongze Lake and also have notable response wavelengths including red, blue, and green bands. Therefore, a TP estimation model was developed based on the band integration methods suitable for lake SPM. The results showed that: 1) the exponential model of 645 nm and 555 nm is the most suitable model for TP estimation in Hongze Lake, in which the R-2 value for calculation and validation can both reach 0.7; 2) the best TP assessment accuracy always occurred when the SPM values were of a moderate level. The threshold values can be approximately designated as 40 similar to 70 mg/L; 3) the TP concentrations of the entire lake have apparently increased since 2012, and achieved a peak in 2014 because of substantial dredging activities; and 4) the center of the lake showed the highest TP concentrations, while the two bays in the northern and western lake showed the lowest TP concentrations. These spatial variations can be attributed to the integration of several factors including meteorological phenomena, land use change, and human disturbance such as dredging activities. This study further indicates that the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance of red band and green band derived from MODIS can be proposed as the suitable indicators for TP monitoring, especially in SPM-dominated lakes. In addition, more ideal modeling effect can be expected when lake SPM contents kept in a medium level (e.g. 40 similar to 70 mg/L within Hongze Lake).

TI  - Analyzing short term spatial and temporal dynamics of water presence at a basin-scale in Mexico using SAR data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic nature of continental water body covers is a main indicator of the status of this ecological capital and its trends on the land surface. With synthetic aperture radar (SAR), various water coverage processes can be identified using satellite data. This study proposes the use of a basin-level analysis with SAR images at a medium spatial resolution to perform a regional spatial-temporal analysis for detecting water presence. It develops a methodology to improve the separation of water bodies from other land covers by using a texture analysis, a support-vector machine classification, and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). GLCM-mean texture parameter was found to offer sufficient texture information for separating the water class from the land class by providing a more homogeneous measurement of water bodies. The case under study is the Grijalva River Basin, Mexico, a region that requires more in-depth research so that the management of surface water coverage can be integrated with ecosystems, particularly those that are subject to intense human activity. The entire basin was mapped using a series of observations from Sentinel-1. This study produced a total of 36 water body maps with an acceptable classification accuracy of over 90% for each year studied (2016, 2017, and 2018). Water presence was also quantified, resulting in a set of maps containing regional detail, from which temporal data can be obtained on areas with water presence year-round and areas with seasonal flooding. Frequency maps with a 10-km unit cell as the spatial unit were used to detect trends and thereby identify water distribution patterns. The results show the importance of ongoing, basin-level quantifications of zones with dynamic water presence and those with stable water presence.

TI  - An AeroCom-AeroSat study: intercomparison of satellite AOD datasets for aerosol model evaluation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand and characterize current uncertainties in the important observational constraint of climate models of aerosol optical depth (AOD), we evaluate and intercompare 14 satellite products, representing nine different retrieval algorithm families using observations from five different sensors on six different platforms. The satellite products (super-observations consisting of 1 degrees x 1 degrees daily aggregated retrievals drawn from the years 2006, 2008 and 2010) are evaluated with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) data. Results show that different products exhibit different regionally varying biases (both under- and overestimates) that may reach +/- 50 %, although a typical bias would be 15 %-25 % (depending on the product). In addition to these biases, the products exhibit random errors that can be 1.6 to 3 times as large. Most products show similar performance, although there are a few exceptions with either larger biases or larger random errors. The intercomparison of satellite products extends this analysis and provides spatial context to it. In particular, we show that aggregated satellite AOD agrees much better than the spatial coverage (often driven by cloud masks) within the 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid cells. Up to similar to 50 % of the difference between satellite AOD is attributed to cloud contamination. The diversity in AOD products shows clear spatial patterns and varies from 10 % (parts of the ocean) to 100 % (central Asia and Australia). More importantly, we show that the diversity may be used as an indication of AOD uncertainty, at least for the better performing products. This provides modellers with a global map of expected AOD uncertainty in satellite products, allows assessment of products away from AERONET sites, can provide guidance for future AERONET locations and offers suggestions for product improvements. We account for statistical and sampling noise in our analyses. Sampling noise, variations due to the evaluation of different subsets of the data, causes important changes in error metrics. The consequences of this noise term for product evaluation are discussed.

TI  - Fatty acid sentinels as covalently bound randomization standards for triacylglycerol (TAG) quantitative analysis
T2  - RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale Quantitative analysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) is impeded by a lack of standards and the huge number of potential TAG molecular species that may be present due to the combinatorial nature of glycerolipids. Randomization of acyl groups yields TAG mixtures with profiles predictable from fatty acid profiles; however, their use as calibration mixtures has been limited. Methods We introduce here the principle of fatty acid isotopic sentinels that are quantitatively added prior to randomization to enable verification that randomization is complete, and that can be used as internal standards. A mixture of two isotopically labeled fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is prepared at a ratio of 2:1 and the exact ratio is carefully measured by gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and randomized covalently into the acyl groups of TAG mixtures. Results Reaction with catalytic amounts of NaOCH(3)yields complete randomization, such that the product FAME and TAG have the same fatty acid profile. TAG mixture analysis reveals that the isotopic sentinels have been covalently incorporated into the TAG molecular species at <1% deviation from the expected proportions, thus verifying randomization within experimental error. Conclusions The sentinel principle demonstrated here as covalently incorporated internal standards verifies that randomization chemistry went to completion. It applies in general to use of combinatorial chemistry for quantitative standards.

TI  - A framework for climate change assessment in Mediterranean data-sparse watersheds using remote sensing and ARIMA modeling
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to propose a framework for assessing climate change in Mediterranean data-sparse contexts. For that purpose, the 309-km(2) Lebanese Nahr Ibrahim watershed, extending over 3% of Lebanon's surface, was chosen as a representative of the targeted settings. Generally, holistic climate change assessments encompass both climate trend analysis and future forecasting. According to the World Meteorological Organization, a continuous, homogenous, and uninterrupted climatic record for at least 30 years is needed to fulfill these tasks. Often, some Mediterranean watersheds lack such data and are hence characterized by climatic data scarcity. Such is the case of Lebanon where 30 years of wars have considerably disrupted the country's climatic record. In an effort to overcome this state of data scarcity, remote sensing-derived drought indicators were used to determine the climate's evolution during the last 28 years. For that purpose, several remote sensing indices were extracted from LANDSAT imageries for the period 1990-2018 at a 3-year interval, and were coupled to meteorological indicators. Forecasting was then performed using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Meteorological indices showed increased variability of precipitations and aridity periods, while remote sensing indicators collectively revealed slight shifts towards increasing droughts. Projections using ARIMA models forecasted increases of 0.9 degrees C, 0.7 degrees C, and 0.8 degrees C for average, maximal, minimal temperatures, and an average 6 mm decrease of precipitations at the 95% confidence level for the year 2030. The presented approach can serve as a tool for proactive climate change mitigation or adaptation plans.

TI  - Multi-decadal decline in cover of giant kelp <i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i> at the southern limit of its Australian range
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of long-term and multi-scale trends in ecological systems is a vital component in understanding their dynamics. We used Landsat satellite imagery to develop the first long-term (1986-2015) data set describing the cover of dense surface canopies of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera around the entire coastline of Tasmania, Australia, and assessed the extent to which potential environmental drivers explain the dynamics of surface canopies at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Broad-scale temporal patterns in canopy cover are correlated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation events, while regional patterns are related to sea surface temperature and nutrient regimes are associated with the East Australian Current. Regression models developed to predict the presence or absence of giant kelp canopy emphasise the importance of sea surface temperature in these systems. Long-term decline in canopy cover is clearly evident in most regions, and in light of increasing thermal stress associated with a changing ocean climate, this raises concern for the future of this species as a major habitat-forming kelp in Australia and some other regions worldwide. Given that Tasmania represents the stronghold of the range of this species in Australia, but is a geographic trap in that there is no suitable habitat for M. pyrifera to the south, our findings support the Federal listing of giant kelp communities in Australia as an endangered marine community type.

TI  - The contribution of HIV point-of-care tests in early HIV diagnosis: community-based HIV testing monitoring in Catalonia, 1995 to 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Community-based HIV testing services combined with the use of point-of-care tests (POCT) have the potential to improve early diagnosis through increasing availability, accessibility and uptake of HIV testing. Aim: To describe community-based HIV testing activity in Catalonia, Spain, from 1995 to 2018, and to evaluate the impact of HIV POCT on the HIV continuum of care. Methods: A community-based network of voluntary counselling and testing services in Catalonia, Spain has been collecting systematic data on activity, process and results since 1995. A descriptive analysis was performed on pooled data, describing the data in terms of people tested and reactive screening test results. Results: Between 1995 and 2018, 125,876 HIV tests were performed (2.1% reactive). Since the introduction of HIV POCT in 2007, a large increase in the number of tests performed was observed, reaching 14,537 tests alone in 2018 (1.3% reactive). Men who have sex with men (MSM), as a proportion of all people tested, has increased greatly over time reaching 74.7% in 2018. The highest percentage of reactive tests was found in people who inject drugs followed by MSM. The contribution of community-based HIV testing to the overall total notified cases in the Catalonia HIV registry has gradually increased, reaching 37.9% in 2018, and 70% of all MSM cases. In 2018, the percentage of individuals with a reactive screening test who were linked to care was 89.0%. Conclusion: Our study reinforces the important role that community-based HIV POCT has on the diagnosis of HIV in key populations.

TI  - Prediction of probability of rubella based on eye outcomes (PORBEO Nomogram)-a cross-sectional sentinel surveillance of 1134 infants
T2  - GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Rubella is an important infectious, vaccine-preventable etiology of congenital defects. The aim of the study was to develop a prediction nomogram to assess the probability of an infant being at risk for congenital rubella based on demographics and ophthalmological findings. Methods This was a cross-sectional sentinel surveillance study conducted at 5 centers spanning pan-India and involved 1134 infants. The diagnosis of rubella was made using standard guidelines. For the construction of the prediction model, laboratory-confirmed cases were grouped as "at-risk" (AR) infants and the discarded cases into "not at risk" (NAR) infants. Univariate analysis (p value cut-off < 0.05) followed by multivariate binary logistic regression model development was performed. Results The average (median) age of the suspected CRS infants was 3 (IQR 1-6) months, and the average (mean) age of their mothers was 25.8 +/- 4.1 years. Out of the total infants, 81 (7.3%) died, 975 (88%) were alive, and 55 (5.0%) were lost to follow-up. The final model showed that the odds of cataract, retinopathy, glaucoma, microcornea, and age of the infant at presentation were 3.1 (2.2-4.3), 4.9(2.3-10.4), 2.7(1.1-5.9), 2.3(1.1-4.7), and 1.1 (1-1.1), respectively, for the AR infant as compared to NAR infant. AUC of final model was 0.68 (95% CI Delong, 0.64-0.72). Bootstrapping for calibration of the model showed satisfactory results. Nomogram, along with a web version, was developed. Conclusion The developed nomogram would have a wide community-based utilization and will help in prioritizing attention to high-risk children, thereby avoiding loss to follow-up.

TI  - Rapid spread and population genetics of <i>Aedes japonicus japonicus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in southeastern Europe (Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian bush mosquito, Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald, 1901), a potential vector of several pathogens, has recently established in North America and Central Europe. In 2013, it was found on the Slovenian-Croatian border, and during the following years, it emerged in more and more counties of northwestern Croatia. Surveillance of Ae. j. japonicus and other invasive mosquito species was subsequently extended both spatially and temporally in Croatia and neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Mosquito collections were conducted in 2017 and 2018, based on adult trapping through dry ice-baited CDC traps and BG-Lure-baited BG-Sentinel traps, larval sampling through dippers and nets, and ovitrapping. Aedes j. japonicus specimens from collected samples were subjected to population genetic analysis by comparing microsatellite signatures and nad4 DNA sequences between sampled locations and with data previously obtained from more western European distribution areas. Aedes j. japonicus immature stages were found at 19 sites in Croatia, two sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one site in Serbia. In Croatia, four new counties were found colonised, two in the east and two in the south of the previously known distribution area. A spread of 250 km could thus be documented within five years. The findings in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia represent the first records of Ae. j. japonicus in these countries. Genetic analysis suggests at least two introduction events into the surveyed area. Among the locations analysed, Orahovica can be considered a genetic border. The individuals collected west of this point were found to be similar to samples previously collected in the border regions of Southeast Germany/Austria and Austria/Slovenia, while the specimens from more eastern Croatian localities, together with those from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, were genetically different and could not be assigned to a probable origin. Thus, introduction from Central Europe, possibly by vehicular traffic, into the study area is likely, but other origins, transportation routes and modes of entry appear to contribute. Further dispersal of Ae. j. japonicus to other parts of southeastern Europe is anticipated.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method for Near-Real-Time Cloud and Cloud Shadow Segmentation from Gaofen-1 Images
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an essential application of remote sensing using deep learning functionality is presented. Gaofen-1 satellite mission, developed by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) for the civilian high-definition Earth observation satellite program, provides near-real-time observations for geographical mapping, environment surveying, and climate change monitoring. Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation are a crucial element to enable automatic near-real-time processing of Gaofen-1 images, and therefore, their performances must be accurately validated. In this paper, a robust multiscale segmentation method based on deep learning is proposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cloud and cloud shadow segmentation from Gaofen-1 images. The proposed method first implements feature map based on the spectral-spatial features from residual convolutional layers and the cloud/cloud shadow footprints extraction based on a novel loss function to generate the final footprints. The experimental results using Gaofen-1 images demonstrate the more reasonable accuracy and efficient computational cost achievement of the proposed method compared to the cloud and cloud shadow segmentation performance of two existing state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - On the Long Range Clustering of Global Seismicity and its Correlation With Solar Activity: A New Perspective for Earthquake Forecasting
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large earthquakes occurring worldwide have long been recognized to be non Poisson distributed, so involving some large scale correlation mechanism, which could be internal or external to the Earth. We have recently demonstrated this observation can be explained by the correlation of global seismicity with solar activity. We inferred such a clear correlation, highly statistically significant, analyzing the ISI-GEM catalog 1996-2016, as compared to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite data, reporting proton density and proton velocity in the same period. However, some questions could arise that the internal correlation of global seismicity could be mainly due to local earthquake clustering, which is a well-recognized process depending on physical mechanisms of local stress transfer. We then apply, to the ISI-GEM catalog, a simple and appropriate de-clustering procedure, meant to recognize and eliminate local clustering. As a result, we again obtain a non poissonian, internally correlated catalog, which shows the same, high level correlation with the proton density linked to solar activity. We can hence confirm that global seismicity contains a long-range correlation, not linked to local clustering processes, which is clearly linked to solar activity. Once we explain in some details the proposed mechanism for such correlation, we also give insight on how such mechanism could be used, in a near future, to help in earthquake forecasting.

TI  - Synergistic utilization of optical and microwave satellite data for coastal bathymetry estimation
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study adopts a multi-sensor approach that utilizes optical remote sensing and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data complimentarily for coastal bathymetry estimation. The depths between 0-15 m are derived from Landsat 8 OLI imageries, by using the machine learning approach of Support Vector Regression (SVR); and high accuracies with RMSEs ranging between 0.17 m-0.95 m are obtained for the chosen study regions. Further, ALOS PALSAR images are used to obtain depths beyond 15 m, by applying the Wave Based Approach (WBA) which is based on the wave transformation and linear dispersion principles. The estimated depths are compared with the bathymetry obtained from admiralty charts or GEBCO and RMSEs between 0.83-1.34m are observed. Finally, the outputs of the SVR and WBA are combined to derive depths between 0-50 m at 75 m spatial resolution. The resultant depth maps agree with those obtained from GEBCO, with an additional advantage of higher accuracy in the near-shore region.

TI  - Assessment of paddy fields' damage caused by Cyclone Nargis using MODIS time-series images (2004-2013)
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ayeyarwady Delta in the Bay of Bengal, the rice bowl of Myanmar, depends on natural conditions, especially rainfall. During the dry season, the delta's coastal zone experiences saline water intrusion due to its low-lying topography. On May 2, 2008, Cyclone Nargis made landfall and crossed Ayeyarwady Region and Yangon City, affecting more than 50 townships and causing massive destruction of personal property and natural ecosystems. There is no doubt that Nargis caused an unprecedented large-scale disaster, but there is no objective method to quantify crop yield and salinity damage in the delta post-Nargis. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to clarify the changes in vegetation in paddy fields in the Ayeyarwady Delta using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data pre- and post-Nargis and determine whether this method can be applied to measure crop and salinity damage. The study used daily composite data at a 250-m resolution (MOD09GQ, collection 6) from 2004 to 2013 and calculated NDVI and salinity indices smoothed by locally weighted regression (Lowess). Based on the results of our studies, NDVI peak value in 2008 was lower by 19% compared to 2007 data, and that the NDVI peak values declined for three straight years since May 2008 when Nargis struck. However, salinity damage evaluation pre- and post-Nargis (using the salinity index equation) showed that soil electrical conductivity did not tend to move up in the post-Nargis dry season (2009), indicating that the decrease in NDVI values was not due to salinity damage.

TI  - Assessing and mapping landslide susceptibility using different machine learning methods
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of the present study was to produce and compare landslide susceptibility maps by using five machine learning techniques, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and, classification and regression tree (CART). The study area was determined as the Arhavi-Kabisre river basin, a region in which the most landslide incidents occur in Turkey. Firstly, a landslide inventory was produced by identifying a total of 252 landslides. Secondly, a total of 11 landslide conditioning factors were considered for the landslide susceptibility mapping. Subsequently, the five machine learning techniques were constructed with the help of the training dataset for the landslide susceptibility maps. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, accuracy and kappa index were applied to compare and validate the performance of the five machine learning techniques.

TI  - Arctic landscape transitions: ice cap and terrestrial margins across Hofsjokull, Iceland
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dramatic shifts in sea and terrestrial ice coverage across the Arctic has prompted urgent calls for systematic glacier and ice cap monitoring efforts. We use satellite-derived data from NASA's Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor to focus on landscape-level changes to Iceland's dome-shaped Hofsjokull ice cap and its surrounding over a recent twenty-five year period, from 1992 to 2017. We offer a practicable technique using available moderate resolution satellite data with a relatively long historical record to monitor changes to Hofsjokull and its surrounding. Our analysis reveals substantial shifts in snow, ice cover, and vegetation over the study period. Observed is a twenty-three percent decrease in the spatial extent of snow and ice between the two years. The ice front margin has receded along the entire periphery of the ice cap, with an average retreat of 743 m across a sample of transects. In a few cases, the retreat is more than one kilometer from the 1992 margin. Employing an automated machine learning technique to analyze satellite data can reduce errors, allow for systematic frequent assessments and provide urgently needed finer-scale spatio-temporal records across the rapidly changing Arctic.

TI  - Comparing Water Level Estimation in Coastal and Shelf Seas From Satellite Altimetry and Numerical Models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately resolving coastal Total Water Levels (TWL) is crucial for socio-economic and environmental reasons. Recent efforts in satellite altimetry and numerical modeling have improved accuracy over near-shore areas. In this study we used data from tide gauges (TGs), SAR-mode altimetry from two satellites [Sentinel-3A (S3) and CryoSat-2 (C2)], and a state-of-the-art high-resolution regional coupled environmental prediction model (Amm15) to undertake an inter-comparison between the observations and the model. The aim is to quantify our capability to measure TWL around the United Kingdom coast, and to quantify the capacity of the model to represent coastal TWL. Results show good agreement between the satellite and TG data [the mean correlation (R) over seventeen TGs between June 2016 and September 2017 is 0.85 for S3 and 0.80 for C2]. The satellite-model comparison shows that the variability is well captured (R = 0.98 for both satellite), however, there is an offset (-0.23 m for S3, -0.15 m for C2) between the satellite and model data, that is near-constant across the domain. This offset is partly attributed to the difference in the reference level used by the satellites and the model, and residual differences linked to the temporal resolution of the model. The best agreement between model and satellite is seen away from the coast, further than 3- 4 km offshore. However, even within the coastal band, R remains high, similar to 0.95 (S3) and similar to 0.96 (C2). In conclusion, models are still essential to represent TWL in coastal regions where there is no cover from in-situ observations, but satellite altimeters can now provide valuable observations that are reliable much closer to the coast than before.

TI  - Assimilation of chlorophyll data into a stochastic ensemble simulation for the North Atlantic Ocean
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived surface chlorophyll data are assimilated daily into a three-dimensional 24-member ensemble configuration of an online-coupled NEMO (Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean)-PISCES (Pelagic Interaction Scheme of Carbon and Ecosystem Stu dies) model for the North Atlantic Ocean. A 1-year multivariate assimilation experiment is performed to evaluate the impacts on analyses and forecast ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the integration of data improves surface analysis and forecast chlorophyll representation in a major part of the model domain, where the assimilated simulation outperforms the probabilistic skills of a non-assimilated analogous simulation. However, improvements are dependent on the reliability of the prior free ensemble. A regional diagnosis shows that surface chlorophyll is overestimated in the northern limit of the subtropical North Atlantic, where the prior ensemble spread does not cover the observation's variability. There, the system cannot deal with corrections that alter the equilibrium between the observed and unobserved state variables producing instabilities that propagate into the forecast. To alleviate these inconsistencies, a 1-month sensitivity experiment in which the assimilation process is only applied to model fluctuations is performed. Results suggest the use of this methodology may decrease the effect of corrections on the correlations between state vectors. Overall, the experiments presented here evidence the need of refining the description of model's uncertainties according to the biogeochemical characteristics of each oceanic region.

TI  - Spatial databases and techniques to assist with prescribed fire management in the south-east Queensland bioregion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper identifies key fire history and fire-related spatial databases that can be utilised for effective planning and assessment of prescribed burns in south-eastern Queensland. To ensure that appropriate fire regimes are maintained for specific management objectives (e.g. biodiversity conservation or risk management), and to assist fire managers with planning prescribed fire and post-fire assessments, we describe, using case studies and existing tools, the application of remote sensing data and derived burned area products together with field data to potentially: (1) improve mapping of fire-prone areas; (2) improve the accuracy of mapping burned areas; (3) monitor temporal changes in fuel structure; and (4) map post-fire severity. This study utilised data collected from aerial and satellite-based multispectral, microwave and laser (LiDAR) sensors. There are several spatial databases and analytical methods available that are not currently used by fire management agencies in this region. For example, the methods to estimate fuel, such as LiDAR, are underutilised and unburned patches within a burned area are not routinely mapped. Better use of spatial datasets could lead to an improved understanding of variables such as fuel status, resulting in more efficient use of fire management resources.

TI  - Improvement of mapping vegetation cover for arid and semiarid areas using a local nonlinear modelling method and landsat images
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating and mapping vegetation cover for monitoring land degradation and desertification of arid and semiarid areas using remotely sensed images is promising but challenging in remote, sparsely vegetated and large areas. In this study, a novel method - geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR - integrating geographically weighted regression (GWR) and a logistic model) was proposed to improve vegetation cover mapping of Kangbao County, Hebei of China using Landsat 8 image and field data. Additionally, a new method to determine the bandwidth of GWLR is presented. Using cross-validation, GWLR was compared with a globally linear stepwise regression (LSR), a local linear modelling method GWR and a nonparametric method, k-nearest neighbours (kNN) with varying numbers of nearest plots. Results demonstrated (1) the red and near infrared relevant band ratios and vegetation indices significantly improved mapping; (2) the GWLR, GWR and kNN methods led to more accurate predictions than LSR; (3) GWLR reduced overestimations and underestimations compared with LSR, kNN and GWR, and also eliminated negative and very large estimates caused by GWR and LSR; and (4) The maximum distance of spatial autocorrelation could be used to determine the bandwidth for GWLR. Overall, GWLR proved more promising for mapping vegetation cover of arid and semiarid areas.

TI  - Assessing the Response of Satellite Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence and NDVI to Impacts of Heat Waves on Winter Wheat in the North China Plain
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has increased the chance of concurrent extreme climate events (weather or climate events that are rare within their statistical reference distributions in a particular place, such as heat waves, floods, and droughts). Crops grow best within specific temperature intervals, and excessive heat is detrimental to the physiological processes of crops and eventually affects yield levels. Analysing historical changes in concurrent extreme high temperatures is critical to preparing for and mitigating the negative effects of climatic change. The North China Plain (NCP) is the most important wheat production area in China. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations in temperature and heat wave trends in the NCP were analysed. Furthermore, we examined the potential of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to capture the influence of heat wave impacts on wheat crops in the NCP by comparing satellite remote sensing data of SIF and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and validated ground-based yield data. The results indicate that temperatures and the number of heat wave days in the study region all show increasing trends, especially daily minimum temperature, which has increased by 0.38 degrees C per decade for the past 30 years. Spatially, the southern NCP has suffered greater increasing-temperature trends and more heat wave days than the northern region. Regarding the response of SIF and NDVI to heat waves, SIF can better capture wheat yield decline due to heat waves compared to NDVI; thus, the SIF result indicated more sensitivity to heat waves compared to NDVI.

TI  - Forest age mapping based on multiple-resource remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest age is an important stand description factor and plays an important role in the carbon cycle of forest ecosystems. However, forest age data are typically lacking or are difficult to acquire at large spatial scale. Thus, it is important to develop a method of spatial forest age mapping. In this study, a method of forest age estimation based on multiple-resource remote sensing data was developed. Forest age was estimated by using average tree height estimated from the ICESat/GLAS and MODIS BRDF products. The results showed that forest age was significantly related to average tree height with a correlation coefficient of 0.752. Then, the average tree height was inversed using a waveform parameter extracted from ICESat/GLAS and was extended to continuous space with the help of the MODIS BRDF product. Thus, forest age mapping was realized. Lastly, the structure of forest age in the study area was evaluated. The results indicated that this method can be used to estimate forest age at the local scale and at large scale and can facilitate understandings of the real forest age structure features of a research area.

TI  - Optimal Interpolation Model for Synthetic Aperture Radar Wind Retrieval
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The variational model inversion (VAR) method for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind retrieval based on the Bayesian theory can overcome the limitations of the traditional wind streak algorithm by introducing background wind and considering all sources of error, but its optimal solution is unstable and the time latency is long. In this article, we propose a new wind retrieval method by applying the optimal interpolation (OI) theory to construct a formula that considers the SAR information, background information coming from the numerical prediction model, and their associated well-characterized errors. The retrieved wind vector can be acquired by the analytic solution of the OI formula. The results from the simulation data show that the error of the OI-retrieved wind is smaller than that of background wind in all considered cases; in particular, the accuracy of the OI-retrieved wind speed is significantly improved. Experiments on the Sentinel-1 SAR data show that the root mean square error of the OI-retrieved wind speed and direction are 1.4 m/s and 35 degrees, respectively. Compared with other methods, the retrieved wind speed accuracy of the OI method is similar to that of the VAR method but higher than that of the direct wind retrieval method. The time latency of the OI method is the shortest, and the calculation efficiency is much higher than that of the VAR method. The results indicate that the OI method can be effectively applied to SAR wind retrieval.

TI  - Flood Variability Determines the Location of Lobe-Scale Avulsions on Deltas: Madagascar
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - River deltas grow through repeated lobe-scale avulsions, which often occur at a location that correlates with the backwater lengthscale. Competing hypotheses attribute the avulsion node origin to either the morphodynamic feedbacks caused by natural flood discharge variability (backwater hypothesis) or to the prograding delta lobe geometry (geometric hypothesis). Here, using theory, historical flood records, and remotely sensed elevation data, we analyzed five lobe-scale delta avulsions in Madagascar, captured by Landsat imagery. Avulsion lengths were 5-55 km, distances significantly longer than the backwater lengthscale and inconsistent with the geometric hypothesis. We show that the steep, silt-bedded rivers of Madagascar have flood-induced bed scour, driven by backwater hydrodynamics, that propagates farther upstream than the backwater lengthscale. The avulsion lengths are 3.1 +/- 1.5 times the predicted flood scour lengths, similar to low-gradient deltas, and consistent with backwater hypothesis. Results demonstrate that erosion initiated by nonuniform flows in the backwater zone is a primary control on delta avulsion locations.

TI  - Examination of seasonal water and carbon dynamics in eastern Amazonia: a comparison of Noah-MP and MODIS
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon region of Brazil is a vitally important region for water and carbon cycling both for the region and the globe. This region is experiencing the impacts of global climate change as well as local land cover changes. Here, we investigated water and carbon estimates and related remotely sensed variables from both MODIS satellite and the Noah-MP land surface model for 3 years (2015-2017) in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Land surface temperature agrees well between MODIS and the model, while the leaf area index (LAI) is higher in the model simulations. The monthly evapotranspiration (ET) from MODIS (MOD16A2) and gross primary productivity (GPP, MOD17A2) were lower than, but well correlated with, the model simulations. A noticeable exception was in the Broadleaf Forest class, which accounts for approximately 50% of the land cover in the state, where the modeled LAI was out of phase with the satellite observations, resulting in significantly poorer performance in the water and carbon fluxes for that land cover class. In addition, we investigated the sensitivity of the ET and GPP to precipitation forcing. The modeled ET relationships show correlations of approximately 0.6 for all classes (Broadleaf Forest being the exception, 0.24), while the MODIS shows reduced values averaging about 0.5 (Broadleaf Forest = 0.03). The slopes of the relationships illustrated the same sensitivity between MODIS and Noah-MP with the exception of Grasslands and Open Shrublands. The GPP relationships with precipitation show lower correlations across all land cover types for both MODIS and Noah-MP, with the slopes being significantly different for the Open Shrublands and Broadleaf Forest classes. In each of these classes, the Noah-MP simulations resulted in increased sensitivity to precipitation than was observed in the MODIS products. We highlight that this comparison is essential for increasing our understanding of how these different sources estimate water and carbon cycling and can be utilized for assessing the impacts of climate and land cover change in the region.

TI  - Earth Observation for agricultural drought monitoring in the Pannonian Basin (southeastern Europe): current state and future directions
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Pannonian Basin in southeastern Europe is heavily used for rain-fed agriculture. The region experienced several droughts in the last years, causing major yield losses. Ongoing climate change, characterised by increasing temperatures and potential evapotranspiration, and by changes in precipitation distribution will likely increase the frequency and intensity of drought episodes in the future. Hence, ongoing monitoring of droughts and estimation of their impact on agriculture is necessary to adapt agricultural practices to changing weather and climate extremes. Several regional initiatives, projects and online tools have been established to facilitate drought monitoring and management in the Pannonian Basin. However, reliable systems to forecast potential drought impacts on plant productivity and agricultural yields at monthly to seasonal scales are only in their infancy, as plant response to climatic extremes is still poorly understood. With the increasing availability of high-resolution and long-term Earth Observation (EO) data and recent progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence, further improvements in drought monitoring and impact prediction capacities are expected. Here we review the current state of drought monitoring in the Pannonian Basin, identify EO-based variables to potentially improve regional drought impact monitoring and outline future perspectives for seasonal forecasts of drought impacts on agriculture.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil texture classes using Random Forest classification algorithm
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture is the most important soil physical property that determines water holding capacity, nutrient availability and crop growth. Spatial distribution of soil texture at a higher spatial resolution at regional and national level is essential for crop planning and management. In the present study, we mapped the soil textural classes over 16.2 M ha area of Andhra Pradesh state, India, at 250 m spatial resolution up to 2 m depth using the digital soil mapping approach. A total of 2,272 profile observations were used for the prediction of soil textural classes using the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. To estimate textural classes at six standard soil depth intervals (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 and 100-200 cm), we used continuous depth function of texture distribution using average sand, silt and clay content of different textural classes. Depth-wise spline outputs were then transformed into textural classes as per USDA textural classification. Sixteen environmental variables including Landsat-8 data, digital elevation model attributes and climatic variables were used for modelling. For model building, 75% of data was used and 25% of data was used for validation. Overall classification accuracy index and kappa index were calculated for validation data sets using 100 RF models. We recorded overall accuracy of 50%-65% and kappa index of 35%-47% for various depths. We found that equal-area quadratic splines of average sand, silt and clay are useful for soil profile depth harmonization of soil textural classes and random forest classification algorithm is a promising tool for spatial prediction of texture classes at the regional level. The present high-resolution (250 m) maps of soil texture classes are useful for different hydrological studies and preparation of proper land-use plans.

AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to offer an integration of Vladimir Lepskiy's third-order cybernetics and Raul Espejo's Viplan methodology. Key ideas are mechanisms for social responsibility and a methodology to improve them through self-developing reflexive-active environments.Design/methodology/approachThe authors propose a methodology based on modern philosophy of science, which sets the foundation of ontological cybernetics, constructed by subjects with different epistemological stances. This methodology includes considerations for social values, worldview principles, multiple viewpoints and subject-oriented information and communication platforms.FindingsCurrent negative trends in socio-economic and environmental developments are associated with weaker social responsibilities of those holding power in society. To increase their social responsibility, the authors argue it is necessary for them to have more effective governance and development mechanisms. The proposed methodology ensures more effective interactions of stakeholders toward creating, regulating and implementing societal problem-solving.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper offers an initial theoretical conceptualization and illustration of social responsibility, which would benefit from further conceptual developments and practical applications.Social implicationsThe methodology helps increasing the level of social responsibility of all participants in control and development processes in social systems. The proposed approach allows ensuring the inclusion of stakeholders in societal problem solving through participatory methods and democratic approaches.Originality/valueThe conceptual and methodological ideas of this paper are based on the authors' original research. The methodology and model of ontological cybernetics proposed in this paper are based on organizational cybernetics and modern views of philosophy of science. The methodology and model include basic ontological values and principles.

AB  - The treatment of the early-stage cervical cancer is surgical. In the last ten years we have seen a surgical de-escalation and the development of new techniques such as the sentinel node biopsy. In 2018, absolutely against the trend, the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Pedro Ramirez upset the world of gynecologic-oncologists by demonstrating that the open approach is superior to the minimally invasive technique in the surgical management of these cancers. A long debate arose after the publication of this article, which remains the only prospective randomized study published to date on the subject. We therefore must take a step back and return to open surgery in the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer.

TI  - The Gut Microbial Community Structure of the North American River Otter (<i>Lontra canadensis</i>) in the Alberta Oil Sands Region in Canada: Relationship with Local Environmental Variables and Metal Body Burden
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alberta Oil Sands Region in Canada is home to one of the largest oil bitumen deposits in the world. The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is a top predator with a small home range and is sensitive to disturbances; it has been designated as a sentinel species for the potential impacts of the natural resource exploitation on freshwater ecosystems in the Alberta Oil Sands Region. With an increasing interest in noninvasive biomarkers, recent studies suggest that gut microbiota can be used as a potential biomarker of early biological effects on aquatic wildlife. The goal of the present study was to determine the river otter gut microbial structure related to environmental variables characterizing mining activities and metal body burden. We obtained 18 trapped animals from and surrounding the surface mineable area of the Alberta Oil Sands Region. The gut microbial community structure was characterized using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses. Trace metal concentrations in the liver were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Our study revealed that the gut bacteria of river otters in the Alberta Oil Sands Region clustered in 4 groups dominated by Peptostreptococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Nostocaceae. We show that arsenic, barium, rubidium, liver-body weight ratio, and delta N-15 were associated with each cluster. When comparing affected versus less affected sites, we show that river otter gut bacterial community and structure are significantly related to trophic level of the river otter but not to Alberta Oil Sands Region mining activities. Our study reveals that the gut bacterial dynamics can provide insights into the diet and habitat use of river otters but that more work is needed to use it as a pollution biomarker.

TI  - Beyond tradition and convention: benefits of non-traditional model organisms in cancer research
T2  - CANCER AND METASTASIS REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Traditional laboratory model organisms are indispensable for cancer research and have provided insight into numerous mechanisms that contribute to cancer development and progression in humans. However, these models do have some limitations, most notably related to successful drug translation, because traditional model organisms are often short-lived, small-bodied, genetically homogeneous, often immunocompromised, are not exposed to natural environments shared with humans, and usually do not develop cancer spontaneously. We propose that assimilating information from a variety of long-lived, large, genetically diverse, and immunocompetent species that live in natural environments and do develop cancer spontaneously (or do not develop cancer at all) will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of human cancers. These non-traditional model organisms can also serve as sentinels for environmental risk factors that contribute to human cancers. Ultimately, expanding the range of animal models that can be used to study cancer will lead to improved insights into cancer development, progression and metastasis, tumor microenvironment, as well as improved therapies and diagnostics, and will consequently reduce the negative impacts of the wide variety of cancers afflicting humans overall.

TI  - Retrieving Heterogeneous Surface Soil Moisture at 100m Across the Globe via Fusion of Remote Sensing and Land Surface Parameters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful monitoring of soil moisture dynamics at high spatio-temporal resolutions globally is hampered by the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties in space and complex interactions between water and the environmental variables that control it. Current soil moisture monitoring schemes via in situ station networks are sparsely distributed while remote sensing satellite soil moisture maps have a very coarse spatial resolution. In this study, an empirical surface soil moisture (SSM) model was established via fusion of in situ continental and regional scale soil moisture networks, remote sensing data (SMAP and Sentinel-1) and high-resolution land surface parameters (e.g., soil texture, terrain) using a quantile random forest (QRF) algorithm. The model had a spatial resolution of 100m and performed well under cultivated, herbaceous, forest, and shrub soils (overall R-2 = 0.524, RMSE = 0.07 m(3) m(-3)). It has a relatively good transferability at the regional scale among different soil moisture networks (mean RMSE = 0.08-0.10 m(3) m(-3)). The global model was applied to map SSM dynamics at 30-100m across a field-scale soilmoisture network (TERENO-Wustebach) and an 80-ha cultivated cropland in Wisconsin, USA. Without the use of local training data, the model was able to delineate the variations in SSM at the field scale but contained large bias. With the addition of 10% local training datasets ("spiking"), the bias of the model was significantly reduced. The QRF model was relatively insensitive to the resolution of Sentinel-1 data but was affected by the resolution and accuracy of soil maps. It was concluded that the empirical model has the potential to be applied elsewhere across the globe to map SSM at the regional to field scales for research and applications. Future research is required to improve the performance of the model by incorporating more field-scale soil moisture sensor networks and assimilation with process-based models.

TI  - Trends and determinants of condomless sex in gonorrhoea patients diagnosed in France through the sentinel surveillance network ResIST, 2005-2014
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundGonorrhoea is increasing in France since its resurgence in the late 1990's. Understanding trends of condomless sex is a requirement to tailor prevention toward most exposed individuals. This study aims to analyse trends and determinants of condomless penetrative sex (PS) in MSM and heterosexuals diagnosed with gonorrhoea in France.MethodsA standardized self-administered questionnaire filled by 3453 patients was used to monitor condomless sex through the sentinel surveillance network ResIST between 2005 and 2014. Trends were used to describe consistent condom use for penetrative sex (PS). A logistic regression model analysed patients' characteristics associated with condomless PS.ResultsBetween 2005 and 2014, condomless PS increased regardless of sexual orientation. Condomless PS was particularly common among HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM (65%)). People living in metropolitan regions outside Paris area (adjusted odds-ratio (AOR) [95% CI] =1.33[1.12-1.58]) were more likely to engage in condomless PS. Conversely, MSM (AOR [95% CI] =0.21 [0.16-0.29]), HIV seronegative patients (AOR [95% CI] =0.68 [0.51-0.89]), patients diagnosed in hospital (AOR [95% CI]=0.66 [0.45-0.97]) and multi-partners (>= 10 partners, AOR [95% CI]=0.54 [0.40-0.74]) were more likely to use condoms.ConclusionsThese findings highlight a decreasing use of condom in MSM and heterosexuals diagnosed with gonorrhoea. Prevention strategies should take in account drivers of condomless sex in a context of uncontrolled STI epidemics.

TI  - Impact of Calving Dynamics on Kangilernata Sermia, Greenland
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Iceberg calving is a major component of glacier mass ablation that is not well understood due to a lack of detailed temporal and spatial observations. Here, we measure glacier speed and surface elevation at 3 min intervals using a portable radar interferometer at Kangilernata Sermia, West Greenland, for a period of 2 weeks in July 2016. We detect a 20% diurnal variation in glacier speed in phase with tidal height propagating kilometers inland. We find no speedup from ice shedding off the calving face or the detachment of floating ice blocks but a 30% speedup within a few hundred meters of the ice front that persists for days when calving removes full-thickness grounded ice blocks. Within one ice thickness from the calving front, we detect maximum strain rates 2 to 3 times larger than observable from satellite data, which has implications for studying iceberg calving as a fracturing process.

TI  - Dust Impacts of Rapid Agricultural Expansion on the Great Plains
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and land use are altering the landscape of the U.S. Great Plains, producing increases in windblown dust. These increases are investigated by combining coarse mode aerosol observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor in addition to the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) aerosol monitoring networks. Increasing trends of up to 5%/year in MODIS aerosol optical depth for dust observations are observed throughout the Great Plains (2000-2018). Cropland coverage has increased 5-10% over the majority of the Great Plains (2008-2018), and positive monthly trends in IMPROVE (1988-2018) and AERONET (1995-2018) coarse mode 90th percentile observations coincide with planting and harvesting seasons of predominant crops. Presently, results suggest increased dust due to agricultural expansion is negatively influencing human health and visibility in the Great Plains. Furthermore, results foreshadow a future where desertification becomes an increasing risk in the Great Plains.

TI  - Lymphatic filariasis in Fiji: progress towards elimination, 1997-2007.
T2  - Tropical medicine and health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major public health problem in the Pacific Region, including in Fiji. Through transmission by the mosquito vector Aedes, Fiji has suffered the burden of remaining endemic with LF despite efforts at elimination prior to 1999. In the year 1999, Fiji agreed to take part in the Pacific Programme for Elimination of LF (PacELF) and the Global Programme to Eliminate LF.METHODS: This study reviewed and collated past data on LF in Fiji between 1997 and 2007. Sources included published papers as well as unpublished PacELF and WHO program meeting and survey reports. Records were held at Fiji's Department of Health and Medical Services, James Cook University and the WHO office in Suva, Fiji.RESULTS: Baseline surveys between 1997 and 2002 showed that Fiji was highly endemic for LF with an estimated 16.6% of the population antigen positive and 6.3% microfilaria positive at that time. Five rounds of annual mass drug administration (MDA) using albendazole and diethylcarbamazine commenced in 2002. Programmatic coverage reported was 58-70% per year, but an independent coverage survey in 2006 in Northern Division after the fifth MDA suggested that actual coverage may have been higher. Monitoring of the program consisted of antigen prevalence surveys in all ages with sentinel and spot check surveys carried out in 2002 (pre MDA), 2004, and 2005, together with knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys. The stop-MDA survey (C survey) in 2007 was a nationwide stratified cluster survey of all ages according to PacELF guidelines, designed to sample by administrative division to identify areas still needing MDA. The national antigen prevalence in 2007 was reduced by more than a third to 9.5%, ranging from 0.9% in Western Division to 15.4% in Eastern Division, while microfilaria prevalence was reduced by almost four-fifths to 1.4%. Having not reached the target threshold of 1% prevalence in all ages, Fiji wisely decided to continue MDA after 2007 but to move from nationwide implementation to four (later five) separate evaluation units with independent timelines using global guidelines, building on program experience to put more emphasis on increasing coverage through prioritized communication strategies, community participation, and morbidity alleviation.CONCLUSION: Fiji conducted nationwide MDA for LF annually between 2002 and 2006, monitored by extensive surveys of prevalence, knowledge, and coverage. From a high baseline prevalence in all divisions, large reductions in overall and age-specific prevalence were achieved, especially in the prevalence of microfilariae, but the threshold for stopping MDA was not reached. Fiji has a large rural and geographically widespread population, program management was not consistent over this period, and coverage achieved was likely not optimal in all areas. After learning from these many challenges and activities, Fiji was able to build on the progress achieved and the heterogeneity observed in prevalence to realign towards a more stratified and improved program after 2007. The information presented here will assist the country to progress towards validating elimination in subsequent years.

TI  - Lymphatic filariasis in Fiji: progress towards elimination, 1997-2007
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major public health problem in the Pacific Region, including in Fiji. Through transmission by the mosquito vector Aedes, Fiji has suffered the burden of remaining endemic with LF despite efforts at elimination prior to 1999. In the year 1999, Fiji agreed to take part in the Pacific Programme for Elimination of LF (PacELF) and the Global Programme to Eliminate LF. Methods This study reviewed and collated past data on LF in Fiji between 1997 and 2007. Sources included published papers as well as unpublished PacELF and WHO program meeting and survey reports. Records were held at Fiji's Department of Health and Medical Services, James Cook University and the WHO office in Suva, Fiji. Results Baseline surveys between 1997 and 2002 showed that Fiji was highly endemic for LF with an estimated 16.6% of the population antigen positive and 6.3% microfilaria positive at that time. Five rounds of annual mass drug administration (MDA) using albendazole and diethylcarbamazine commenced in 2002. Programmatic coverage reported was 58-70% per year, but an independent coverage survey in 2006 in Northern Division after the fifth MDA suggested that actual coverage may have been higher. Monitoring of the program consisted of antigen prevalence surveys in all ages with sentinel and spot check surveys carried out in 2002 (pre MDA), 2004, and 2005, together with knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys. The stop-MDA survey (C survey) in 2007 was a nationwide stratified cluster survey of all ages according to PacELF guidelines, designed to sample by administrative division to identify areas still needing MDA. The national antigen prevalence in 2007 was reduced by more than a third to 9.5%, ranging from 0.9% in Western Division to 15.4% in Eastern Division, while microfilaria prevalence was reduced by almost four-fifths to 1.4%. Having not reached the target threshold of 1% prevalence in all ages, Fiji wisely decided to continue MDA after 2007 but to move from nationwide implementation to four (later five) separate evaluation units with independent timelines using global guidelines, building on program experience to put more emphasis on increasing coverage through prioritized communication strategies, community participation, and morbidity alleviation. Conclusion Fiji conducted nationwide MDA for LF annually between 2002 and 2006, monitored by extensive surveys of prevalence, knowledge, and coverage. From a high baseline prevalence in all divisions, large reductions in overall and age-specific prevalence were achieved, especially in the prevalence of microfilariae, but the threshold for stopping MDA was not reached. Fiji has a large rural and geographically widespread population, program management was not consistent over this period, and coverage achieved was likely not optimal in all areas. After learning from these many challenges and activities, Fiji was able to build on the progress achieved and the heterogeneity observed in prevalence to realign towards a more stratified and improved program after 2007. The information presented here will assist the country to progress towards validating elimination in subsequent years.

TI  - Religious Education in Europe - Quo Vadis? Unconventional Thoughts in Unconventional Times
T2  - RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Corona crisis is forcing scholarly circles of religious education in Europe not only to answer local organizational questions, but above all to start a more general self-reflection on what the fundamental contribution of religious education at school could be in times of deep social and existential crises. In this paper a narrative and performative reconstruction of the European learning space of religious and worldview education is undertaken. In three biographical steps, the author goes on a journey in Central-Europe, deals with the writings of John Amos Comenius and reconsiders his own work in light of the ongoing struggle with uncertainties and ambiguities. Of central concern is the issue of working "on equal terrain", the necessary connection of generations, seeking together shared perspectives for the future, and being aware of the permanent "cloud of unknowing" that is affecting religious learning processes in these unconventional times.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural network-based pixel-wise landslide inventory mapping
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports a feasible alternative to compile a landslide inventory map (LIM) from remote sensing datasets using the application of an artificial intelligence-driven methodology. A deep convolutional neural network model, called LanDCNN, was developed to generate segmentation maps of landslides, and its performance was compared with the benchmark model, named U-Net, and other conventional object-based methods. The landslides that occurred in Lantau Island, Hong Kong, were taken as the case study, in which the pre- and post-landslide aerial images, and a rasterized digital terrain model (DTM) were used. The assessment reveals that LanDCNN trained with bitemporal images and DTM yields the smoothest and most semantically meaningfully LIM, compared to other methods. This LIM is the most balanced segmentation results, represented by the highest F-1 measure among all analyzed cases. With the encoding capability of LanDCNN, the application of DTM as the input renders better LIM production, especially when the landslide signatures are relatively subtle. With the computational setup used in this study, LanDCNN requires similar to 3 min to map landslides from the datasets of approximately 25 km(2) in area and with a resolution of 0.5 m. In short, the proposed landslide mapping framework, featured LanDCNN, is scalable to handle the vast amount of remote sensing data from different types of measurements within a short processing period.

TI  - Estimation of the distribution of the total net radiative flux from satellite and automatic weather station data in the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Net radiation is an important factor in studies of land-atmosphere processes, water resource management, and global climate change. This is particularly true for the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin, where significant parts of the basin are dry and evapotranspiration (ET) is a major mechanism for water loss. However, net radiation has not yet been appropriately parameterized in the basin. In this study, we estimated the instantaneous distribution of the net radiation flux in the basin using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra satellite and Automatic Weather Station (AWS) data. Downward shortwave radiation and air temperature usually vary with topography, so we applied residual kriging spatial interpolation techniques to convert AWS data for point locations into gridded surface data. Simulated net radiation outputs were validated through comparison with independent field measurements. Validation results show that our method successfully reproduced the downward shortwave, upward shortwave, and net radiation fluxes. Using AWS data and residual kriging spatial interpolation techniques makes our results robust and comparable to previous works that used satellite data at a finer spatial resolution than MODIS. The estimated net shortwave, longwave, and total radiation fluxes were in close agreement with ground truth measurements, with mean bias (MB) values of - 14.84, 5.7, and 20.53 W m(-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values 83.43, 32.54, and 78.07 W m(-2), respectively. The method presented here has potential applications in research focused on energy balance, ET estimation, and weather prediction for regions with similar physiographic features to those of the Nile basin.

TI  - Post-seismic deformation mechanism of the July 2015 MW 6.5 Pishan earthquake revealed by Sentinel-1A InSAR observation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 3 July 2015, the Mw 6.5 Pishan earthquake occurred at the junction of the southwestern margin of the Tarim Basin and the northwestern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. To understand the seismogenic mechanism and the post-seismic deformation behavior, we investigated the characteristics of the post-seismic deformation fields in the seismic area, using 9 Sentinel-1A TOPS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from 18 July 2015 to 22 September 2016 with the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. Postseismic LOS deformation displayed logarithmic behavior, and the temporal evolution of the post-seismic deformation is consistent with the aftershock sequence. The main driving mechanism of near-field post-seismic displacement was most likely to be afterslip on the fault and the entire creep process consists of three creeping stages. Afterward, we used the steepest descent method to invert the afterslip evolution process and analyzed the relationship between post-seismic afterslip and co-seismic slip. The results witness that 447 days after the mainshock (22 September 2016), the afterslip was concentrated within one principal slip center. It was located 5-25 km along the fault strike, 0-10 km along with the fault dip, with a cumulative peak slip of 0.18 m. The 447 days afterslip seismic moment was approximately 2.65 x 10(17) N m, accounting for approximately 4.1% of the co-seismic geodetic moment. The deep afterslip revealed that a creeping process from steady-state "secondary" creeping to accelerating "tertiary" creep in the deep of fault. The future seismic hazard deserves further attention and research.

TI  - Application of Empirical Orthogonal Function Interpolation to Reconstruct Hourly Fine Particulate Matter Concentration Data in Tianjin, China
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) concentration monitoring is closely related to public health, outdoor activities, environmental protection, and other fields. However, the incomplete PM2.5 observation records provided by ground-based PM2.5 concentration monitoring stations pose a challenge to the study of PM2.5 propagation and evolution model. Consequently, PM2.5 concentration data imputation has been widely studied. Based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF), a new spatiotemporal interpolation method, EOF interpolation (EOFI) is introduced in this paper, and then, EOFI is applied to reconstruct the hourly PM2.5 concentration records of two stations in the first half of the year. The main steps of EOFI here are to firstly decompose the spatiotemporal data matrix of the original observation site into mutually orthogonal temporal and spatial modes with EOF method. Secondly, the spatial mode of the missing data station is estimated by inverse distance weighting interpolation of the spatial mode of the observation sites. After that, the records of the missing data station can be reconstructed by multiplying the estimated spatial mode and the corresponding temporal mode. The optimal mode number for EOFI is determined by minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE) between reconstructed records and corresponding valid records. Finally, six evaluation indices (mean absolute error (MAE), RMSE, correlation coefficient (Corr), deviation rate bias, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and index of agreement (IA)) are calculated. The results show that EOFI performs better than the other three interpolation methods, namely, inverse distance weight interpolation, thin plate spline, and surface spline interpolation. The EOFI has the advantages of less computation, less parameter selection, and ease of implementation, it is an alternative method when the number of observation stations is rare, and the proportion of missing value at some stations is large. Moreover, it can also be applied to other spatiotemporal variables interpolation and imputation.

TI  - Retrieval of monthly maximum and minimum air temperature using MODIS aqua land surface temperature data over the United Arab Emirates
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially distributed air temperature (Ta) data are essential for environmental studies. Ta data are collected from meteorological stations of sparse distribution. This problem can be overcome by using remotely sensed datasets at different scales. This study used land-based temperature measurements and satellite data for estimating Ta distribution over the United Arab Emirates. Land-based Ta data from 11 weather stations during 2003 to 2019 were used with MODIS Aqua LST for both daytime (LSTd) and nighttime (LSTn) data. The results indicate a significant correlation between LST and Ta with regression coefficients R-2 > 0.94/0.96 and Root Mean Square Error about 1.75/0.97 degrees C of LSTd/T-max and LSTn/T-min, respectively. Large variability was observed between the daytime and nighttime mean temperature distribution indicating the importance of MODIS LST as a proxy for Ta. These countrywide Ta grids provide vital tools for the planning of environmental and economic developments in the era of global climate change.

TI  - Convolutional neural networks for global human settlements mapping from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially consistent and up-to-date maps of human settlements are crucial for addressing policies related to urbanization and sustainability, especially in the era of an increasingly urbanized world. The availability of open and free Sentinel-2 data of the Copernicus Earth Observation program offers a new opportunity for wall-to-wall mapping of human settlements at a global scale. This paper presents a deep-learning-based framework for a fully automated extraction of built-up areas at a spatial resolution of 10 m from a global composite of Sentinel-2 imagery. A multi-neuro modeling methodology building on a simple Convolution Neural Networks architecture for pixel-wise image classification of built-up areas is developed. The core features of the proposed model are the image patch of size 5 x 5 pixels adequate for describing built-up areas from Sentinel-2 imagery and the lightweight topology with a total number of 1,448,578 trainable parameters and 4 2D convolutional layers and 2 flattened layers. The deployment of the model on the global Sentinel-2 image composite provides the most detailed and complete map reporting about built-up areas for reference year 2018. The validation of the results with an independent reference dataset of building footprints covering 277 sites across the world establishes the reliability of the built-up layer produced by the proposed framework and the model robustness. The results of this study contribute to cutting-edge research in the field of automated built-up areas mapping from remote sensing data and establish a new reference layer for the analysis of the spatial distribution of human settlements across the rural-urban continuum.

TI  - Impact of Sentinel Node Mapping in Decreasing the Risk of Lymphocele in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Due to the growing evidence of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in endometrial cancer (EC), our aim was to evaluate the impact of SLN mapping and other clinical-pathological variables in the risk of developing lymphocele. Methods We retrospectively analyzed a series of patients with ECs who underwent lymph node staging with SLN mapping with or without systematic pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy from November 2012 to January 2020. The lymphocele diagnosis was performed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Results Of 348 patients included, 178 underwent SLN mapping only and 170 underwent SLN mapping and systematic lymphadenectomy (46.5% pelvic only; 53.5% pelvic and para-aortic). Seventy-three (21%) patients had open surgery and 275 (79%) had a minimally invasive approach. After a median follow-up of 25.4 months, the overall prevalence of lymphocele was 8.6% (n = 30), with 29 cases in a pelvic location. Lymphocele was found in 3.4% (n = 6/178) of patients submitted to SLN mapping only, compared with 14.1% (n = 24/170) among those who underwent SLN with lymphadenectomy (p = 0.009). Among those patients with lymphocele, seven (23.3%) were symptomatic and five (16.6%) required drainage. All symptomatic cases occurred in lymphoceles larger than 4 cm (p = 0.001). Neither resected lymph node count nor the type of systematic lymphadenectomy were related to the presence of lymphocele. Systematic lymphadenectomy was the only factor that emerged as a risk factor for the presence of lymphocele in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 3.68, 95% confidence interval 1.39-9.79; p = 0.009). Conclusions Our data suggest that SLN mapping independently decreases the risk of lymphocele formation compared with full lymphadenectomy in EC.

TI  - Impact of Lake/Reservoir Expansion and Shrinkage on Energy and Water Vapor Fluxes in the Surrounding Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and reservoirs are important components of freshwater. The expansion and shrinkage of lakes/reservoirs may have impacts on meteorological characteristics and the underlying surface conditions in the surrounding areas, which would further affect energy and water vapor fluxes. In this study, the expansion and shrinkage of the Guanting Reservoir during 2013-2017 were analyzed using remote sensing data. Data collected from the Huailai Remote Sensing Experiment Station were used to analyze the impact of reservoir expansion/shrinkage on energy and water vapor fluxes in the surrounding area. Results showed the annual expansion of the Guanting Reservoir from 2013 to 2017 and a seasonal variation characterized by expansion in spring, shrinkage in summer and autumn, and expansion again in winter was exhibited. Meanwhile, the evapotranspiration (ET) in the surrounding area increased by about 96%, from 446.6 mm in 2013 to 874.7 mm in 2017. In growing season (May to September), the seasonal shrinkage of the reservoir affected ET through net radiation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and deep soil moisture, while in nongrowing season (January to April and October to December), the seasonal expansion increased ET through the distance between 40-m tower and the reservoir, net radiation, and surface soil moisture. In addition, with the reservoir expanding year by year, the difference in ET between the closer site and further site from the reservoir increased obviously, especially in the nongrowing season during the seasonal expansion of the reservoir. The findings of this study are beneficial for ecosystem restoration and sustainable development of lakes/reservoirs in arid and semiarid areas.

TI  - Predicting and mapping land cover/land use changes in Erbil/Iraq using CA-Markov synergy model
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most dynamic components of the environment is land use land cover (LULC), which have been changing remarkably since after the industrial revolution at various scales. Frequent monitoring and quantifying LULC change dynamics provide a better understanding of the function and health of ecosystems. This study aimed at modelling the future changes of LULC for the Erbil governorate in the Kurdistan region of Iraq (KRI) using the synergy Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model. For this aim, three consecutive-year Landsat imagery (i.e., 1988, 2002, and 2017) were classified using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier. From the classification, three LULC maps with several class categories were generated, and then change-detection analysis was executed. Using the classified (1988-2002) and (2002-2017) LULC maps in the hybrid model, LULC maps for 2017 and 2050 were modelled respectively. The model output (modelled 2017) was validated with the classified 2017 LULC map. The accuracy of agreements between the classified and the modelled maps were K-no = 0.8339, K-location = 0.8222, K-standard = 0.7491, respectively. Future predictions demonstrate between 2017 and 2050, built-up land, agricultural land, plantation, dense vegetation and water body will increase by 173.7% (from 424.1 to 1160.8 km(2)), 79.5% (from 230 to 412.9 km(2)), 70.2% (from 70.2 to 119.5 km(2)), 48.9% (from 367.2 to 546.9 km(2)) and 132.7% (from 10.7 to 24.9 km(2)), respectively. In contrast, sparse vegetation, barren land will decrease by 9.7% (2274.6 to 2052.8 km(2)), 18.4% (from 9463.9-7721 km(2)), respectively. The output of this study is invaluable for environmental scientists, conservation biologists, nature-related NGOs, decision-makers, and urban planners.

TI  - Spatial analysis of soil erosion sensitivity using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model in Nyamasheke District, Western Province of Rwanda
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have identified that Nyamasheke District in Rwanda is highly vulnerable to soil erosion. This has led to a loss of fertile soil, with a high level of land degradation. Nevertheless, the district's spatial and temporal sensitivity to soil erosion remains unknown in different specific parts of the district. This study aimed to analyze spatial soil erosion sensitivity and mapping of vulnerable areas to soil erosion in the district. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model integrated within a GIS environment was used to estimate annual soil loss for the district. The RUSLE factors were derived from a 30 m resolution digital elevation model, digital soil map of the world, monthly rainfall records from 20 stations within and around the district, and Landsat7/ETM + and Landsat8/OLI imagery. Annual soil loss change was statistically analyzed using an empirical model in the district. The results showed a decreasing trend in soil erosion over time, with the highest annual soil losses estimated at 92.4, 16.1, and 15.1 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the years 2008, 2015, and 2018, respectively. Areas with the highest soil erosion sensitivity, with soil loss ranging between 10 and 40 t ha(-1) year(-1), were found in sectors of Kanjongo, Cyato, Rangiro, Macuba, and Karambi.

TI  - Geomorphology and Landslide Proneness of Kerala, India A Geospatial study
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - It was thought for a long time that only the younger and tectonically active mountains are prone to landslides and hence more attention was given in studying them the world over. But, when the landslides have started occurring in other mountain regions of high rainfall and human interventions also, these mountains too came under the purview of landslide studies. The studies thus widened to the other mountains revealed that the various geological/terrain parameters and the degree of anthropogenic activities occur in different combinations and assign varying grades of landslide probabilities. According to it, these mountains succumb to different degrees of landslides when heavy rainfall occurs. The state of Kerala, which is 600 km long in North Northwest-South Southeast and 35 to 120 km broad in East-West directions, is one such a region of recurring landslides. It is a unique physiographic/geomorphic province with highly elevated NNW-SSE oriented Western Ghat Mountains in the east, that are rimmed by the sub parallel systems of landforms like composite slopes, marginally raised lateritic uplands and the coastal plains successively in the west with gradual descending elevation, thus providing a step like topography. The regular annual rainfall of the southwest monsoons cause devastating landslides in Kerala due to the unique geomorphic setting. So the present study was carried out to analyse the geomorphology of the region in details, which is dominantly evolved by the tectonics, to elucidate its input over the landslides. In the study, the geomorphic features were studied in detail using the (i) satellite false colour composite imagery wrapped over the digital elevation model of the terrain, (ii) shaded relief maps and (iii) the topographic cross sections drawn over the above satellite data wrapped 3D terrain model. These were accomplished using the advanced options available with geospatial technology. The study revealed that due to the high degree of deformation and the resultant development of geomorphology of the study area, the rainwater infiltrates and cause landslides in the form of rock and cliff topples, rock and cliff falls, landslides, talus and debris falls/flows.

TI  - Crop Situation in India, Before, During and After COVID-19 Lockdown, as Seen from the Satellite Data of Resourcesat-2 AWiFS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the crop situation in India, before the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, during the lockdown and after the lockdown. In India, the lockdown was imposed from 24 March to 31 May 2020. That was the period of harvesting of Rabi (winter) season crop and sowing of Zaid (summer) season crop. However, the government announced a large number of measures to provide relaxation to agricultural activities during the lockdown. A satellite remote sensing-based assessment was carried out to see the impact of the lockdown and government measures. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time composite all-India product derived from Resourcesat-2/2A Advanced Wide Field Sensor for February, May, and July 2020 was used to assess the crop situation, representing three crop seasons, i.e. Rabi, Zaid and Kharif (rainy). NDVI images of 2020 were compared with corresponding images of 2019. Change images were generated, and state-level NDVI values were computed. The state-level cropped area proportion was also mapped using the NDVI thresholding approach. The crop sown area statistics, crop cutting experiment (CCE) numbers and rainfall data were also compared for both the years. It was observed that the differences were very low between the NDVI of 2019 and 2020 in February month. However, the differences were high in many states during May and in most of the states during July. A statistical test of significance (paired t test) was carried out for state-level NDVI and crop area values, which validated this result. This NDVI change was mostly due to increased crop area during Zaid and Kharif (rainy) seasons and higher rainfall from May to July. The satellite and other data (crop area and CCE numbers) analysis also showed the sowing and harvesting operations in major parts of the country went on smoothly, during the lockdown period.

TI  - A combined Terra and Aqua MODIS land surface temperature and meteorological station data product for China from 2003 to 2017
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable for high temperature and drought monitoring and climate and ecological environment research. Due to the sparse distribution of ground observation stations, thermal infrared remote sensing technology has become an important means of quickly obtaining ground temperature over large areas. However, there are many missing and low-quality values in satellite-based LST data because clouds cover more than 60% of the global surface every day. This article presents a unique LST dataset with a monthly temporal resolution for China from 2003 to 2017 that makes full use of the advantages of MODIS data and meteorological station data to overcome the defects of cloud influence via a reconstruction model. We specifically describe the reconstruction model, which uses a combination of MODIS daily data, monthly data and meteorological station data to reconstruct the LST in areas with cloud coverage and for grid cells with elevated LST error, and the data performance is then further improved by establishing a regression analysis model. The validation indicates that the new LST dataset is highly consistent with in situ observations. For the six natural subregions with different climatic conditions in China, verification using ground observation data shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 1.24 to 1.58 similar to C, the mean absolute error (MAE) varies from 1.23 to 1.37 ffiC and the Pearson coefficient (R 2) ranges from 0.93 to 0.99. The new dataset adequately captures the spatiotemporal variations in LST at annual, seasonal and monthly scales. From 2003 to 2017, the overall annual mean LST in China showed a weak increase. Moreover, the positive trend was remarkably unevenly distributed across China. The most significant warming occurred in the central and western areas of the Inner Mongolia Plateau in the Northwest Region, and the average annual temperature change is greater than 0.1K (R>0:71, P<0:05), and a strong negative trend was observed in some parts of the Northeast Region and South China Region. Seasonally, there was significant warming in western China in winter, which was most pronounced in December. The reconstructed dataset exhibits significant improvements and can be used for the spatiotemporal evaluation of LST in high-temperature and drought-monitoring studies. The data are available through Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3528024 (Zhao et al., 2019).

TI  - Investigation on Spectral Indices and Soft Classifiers-Based Water Body Segmentation Approaches for Satellite Image Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The emerging threat for eco-sustainability has led to a breakthrough in satellite image analyses and such instantaneous monitoring of hazards could replenish the rejuvenation of natural ecosystem. Generally, the satellite images are huge dimensional data with numerous bands of specific details about the observed region. To apply immediate precautionary measures for environmental hazards and natural devastations, deploying a cloud-based intelligent web service for handling real time satellite image processing is inevitable. Therefore, the cloud implementation could afford integrated huge storage and parallel data processing tasks, the outcome of instantaneous satellite image processing relies with the effective data processing methods of less complexity. In this regard to address a major hazard of today which is drought monitoring, this paper focuses on developing an effective water segmentation method for such geospatial cloud web services. The Landsat 8 images of Sambhar lake region has been chosen for exploiting the water segmentation results. Most prevalent approaches from Spectral indices and unsupervised clustering such as normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index, fuzzy C means, K-Means, Adaptive Regularized kernel fuzzy C means (ARKFCM) and simple linear iterative clustering-based superpixel segmentation (SLIC-SUPER) are compared, respectively. On comparative assessment using standard image quality assessment metrics, NDWI and ARKFCM outstands the rest with more accurate water body delineation. However, based on reduced computational complexity and instant localization, NDWI of spectral indexing approach clearly portray the significance of spectral influence in water body segmentation from satellite images. And it can be adapted as a persistent choice for instantaneous water body segmentation in a cloud-centered geospatial module.

TI  - Development and fabrication of disease resistance protein in recombinant <i>Escherichia coli</i>
T2  - BIORESOURCES AND BIOPROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria and Spirulina produce C-phycocyanin (CPC), a water soluble protein associated pigment, which is extensively used in food and pharmaceutical industries. Other therapeutic proteins might exist in microalgal cells, of which there is limited knowledge. Such proteins/peptides with antibiotic properties are crucial due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens. In addition, the native expression levels of such disease resistant proteins are low, hindering further investigation. Thus, screening and overexpression of such novel proteins is urgent and important. In this study, a protein which was identified as a putative disease resistance protein (DRP) in the mixture of Spirulina product has been explored for the first time. To improve protein expression, DRP was cloned in the pET system, co-transformed with pRARE plasmid for codon optimization and was significantly overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) under induction with isopropyl-beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Furthermore, soluble DRP exhibited intense antimicrobial activity against predominant pathogens, and an inhibition zone of 1.59 to 1.74 cm was obtained for E. coli. At a concentration 4 mg/mL, DRP significantly elevated the growth of L. rhamnosus ZY up to twofold showing probable prebiotic activities. Moreover, DRP showed potential as an effective antioxidant, and the scavenging ability for ROS was in the order of hydroxyl > DPPH > superoxide radicals. A putative disease resistance protein (DRP) has been identified, sequenced, cloned and over-expressed in E. coli as a functional protein. Thus expressed DRP showed potential anti-microbial and antioxidant properties, with promising therapeutic applications.

TI  - The effect of green spaces on the urban thermal environment during a hot-dry season: a case study of Port Harcourt, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the planning and management of urban green spaces can cause a drastic reduction in land surface temperature (LST). This research explored the geospatial techniques in assessing the effect of green spaces on the thermal environment of Port Harcourt, Nigeria during a hot-dry season. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were employed to investigate the effects of vegetation distribution of urban green spaces on the urban thermal environment. LST maps were retrieved from the Thermal Infrared Sensor data of Landsat 8 acquired on 27 December 2018, while urban green spaces were extracted from high-resolution Google Earth Pro imagery. The results showed that a strong negative relationship exists between NDVI and LST, as well as between SAVI and LST which showed that urban green spaces have proven to have substantial cooling effects on the urban thermal environment within the study area. Results further revealed that increasing the area of green spaces to 28.67 ha and above will ensure the attainment of a stronger Park Cooling Intensity (PCI) effect. On the other hand, green spaces which are 8.28 ha or less have a lower PCI effect. The shape (perimeter/area) of green spaces has proven to have a negative correlation with the PCI effect. Green spaces with near-circular configurations will produce a stronger PCI effect. The role of urban greenery in mitigating high discomfort experienced in urban environments is crucial to urban planners and managers in the design of green spaces with a high cooling effect.

TI  - Bamboo phenology and life cycle drive seasonal and long-term functioning of Amazonian bamboo-dominated forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Bamboo-dominated forests (BDF) extend over large areas in the drought-prone Southwestern Amazon, yet little is known about the dynamics of these ecosystems. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that bamboo modulates large-scale ecosystem dynamics through competition with coexisting trees for water.2. We examined spatio-temporal patterns of remotely sensed metrics (Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI], Normalized Difference Moisture Index [NDMI]) in >300 Landsat images as proxies for canopy leaf phenology and water content at two time scales: (1) a complete bamboo life cycle (similar to 28 years), and (2) the seasonal cycle; and at two spatial scales: (a) comparing adjacent areas of BDF vs. Terra-firme forests (TFF) to investigate regional dynamics, and (b) comparing the vegetation classes of bamboo, trees in BDF, and trees in TFF to investigate the effects of bamboo on coexisting trees.3. At the regional scale, BDF showed higher EVI (leaf area density) and lower NDMI (water content) than nearby TFF but these differences disappeared as bamboo died, suggesting a strong influence of bamboo life stage in the functioning of these forests. BDF seasonal cycle showed a bimodal EVI pattern as trees and bamboos had asynchronized leaf production peaks.4. At the scale of vegetation classes, trees in BDF showed lower NDMI (i.e. water content) than trees in TFF except after bamboo mortality, indicating a release from competition with bamboo for water. Canopy water content of trees in BDF was also reduced during bamboo dry-season greening (increased EVI - leaf production) due to increased water demands. Nevertheless, long-term and seasonal phenology of trees in BDF did not differ from that of trees in TFF suggesting a potential selection for drought-tolerant trees in BDF.5. Synthesis. Bamboo-dominated forests have received less attention than other Amazonian forests and their functional dynamics are commonly ignored or misinterpreted. Using remote sensing to characterize forest phenology and water content, we show the distinctive seasonal and long-term dynamics of BDF and coexisting trees and the importance of bamboo competition for water in shaping this ecosystem. Our results suggest a potential selection for drought-tolerant trees in BDF since they maintain the same EVI as trees in bamboo-free forests but with lower water content. A better characterization of BDF and their cyclical dynamics is crucial for accurately interpreting Amazonian forests' responses to extreme climatic events such as high temperatures and droughts.

TI  - The vertical stratification of potential bridge vectors of mosquito-borne viruses in a central Amazonian forest bordering Manaus, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Latin America brought to the fore longstanding concerns that forests bordering urban areas may provide a gateway for arbovirus spillback from humans to wildlife. To bridge urban and sylvatic transmission cycles, mosquitoes must co-occur with both humans and potential wildlife hosts, such as monkeys, in space and time. We deployed BG-Sentinel traps at heights of 0, 5, 10, and 15 m in trees in a rainforest reserve bordering Manaus, Brazil, to characterize the vertical stratification of mosquitoes and their associations with microclimate and to identify potential bridge vectors. Haemagogus janthinomys and Sabethes chloropterus, two known flavivirus vectors, showed significant stratification, occurring most frequently above the ground. Psorophora amazonica, a poorly studied anthropophilic species of unknown vector status, showed no stratification and was the most abundant species at all heights sampled. High temperatures and low humidity are common features of forest edges and microclimate analyses revealed negative associations between minimum relative humidity, which was inversely correlated with maximum temperature, and the occurrence of Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes. In this reserve, human habitations border the forest while tamarin and capuchin monkeys are also common to edge habitats, creating opportunities for the spillback of mosquito-borne viruses.

TI  - Assessing land use land cover dynamics of wetland ecosystems using Landsat satellite data
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the light of growing debates over climate change, population growth, and associated activities, wetland ecosystems have gained immeasurable importance as they have potential to serve both environmentally and economically. Hence, the evaluation of wetland ecosystems dynamics and development of comprehensive management policies demand accurate assessment of land use-land cover changes over time and distinct hydrological processes taking place in such aquatic ecosystems. Assessment of such changes is imperative to deal with various perspectives of resource management, ecosystem conservation, sustainable development and land use planning, etc. The present study aims to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC in wetland ecosystems of Kashmir Valley using Landsat datasets of the period 1994-2018. Maximum likelihood classifier was used to quantify LULC changes in ERDAS IMAGINE (14). A total of seven categories were classified viz. forest, plantation, marshy land, water body, horticulture, agriculture, and built-up. From the present analysis, two patterns of LULC changes were observed in the study area (in both cases: Wular, as well as, Hokersar and Anchar): (1) Continuous increase in area of respective categories: agriculture, horticulture, and built-up (Wular Lake); forest, plantation, agriculture, and built-up (Hokersar and Anchar Lake); (2) a consistent decrease in categories like: forest, plantation, water body, and marshy land (Wular Lake); water body, marshy land, agriculture (Hokersar and Anchar Lake). Most significant change in terms of area has been observed in plantation -5378.18 ha, water body -3954.94 ha, and built-up +2556.18 (Wular Lake); horticulture +4884.3 ha, built-up +6071.96 ha, agriculture -11,605.43 ha, and water body -106.01 ha (Hokersar and Anchar Lake). The LULC transformation, mostly driven by human-induced factors, pose a severe threat to wetland ecosystems of Kashmir Valley. Anthropogenic activities threatening the wetland ecosystems may include urban development, agriculture and horticulture practices, impacts of insecticides and pesticides, fertilizers, climate change and invasion of alien species.

TI  - Phenological synchronization of seasonal bird migration with vegetation greenness across dietary guilds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal movement of animals has been linked to seasonal variation in ecological productivity, and it has been hypothesized that primary consumers synchronize migration with vegetation phenology. Within temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, herbivorous bird species often track the phenology of vegetation greenness during spring migration. Phenological synchronization with vegetation greenness by migratory birds in other dietary guilds, across the full extent of their annual distributions during both spring and autumn migration, has not been explored.Here, we document population-level associations with a remotely sensed measure of vegetation greenness for 230 North American migratory bird species in seven dietary guilds across the full annual cycle using eBird occurrence information for the combined period 2006-2018.Evidence of phenological synchronization was strongest for omnivores, herbivores, herbivore-granivores and granivores during spring and autumn migration, except for omnivores in the west during spring migration. Strong evidence of synchronization was also observed for insectivores during spring migration and carnivores during spring and autumn migration that migrated across the entire breadth of the continent. The level of evidence declined for insectivores in the west and east during spring migration, and for nectarivores in the west during spring and autumn migration. Limited evidence was also found for insectivores in the east during autumn migration, insectivores in the west and the centre of the continent during spring and autumn migration, and carnivores in the west during spring migration. Carnivores in the west during autumn migration showed the weakest evidence of synchronization.We found broad support across an array of dietary guilds for phenological coupling between vegetation greenness and seasonal bird migration within North America. Our results highlight the potential for many migratory bird species to encounter phenological mismatches as vegetation phenology responds to climate change. Our findings emphasize the need to better understand the environmental cues that regulate migratory behaviour across dietary guilds, consumer levels and migration tactics.

T2  - RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent rises in anti-Semitism and other types of religious bullying on college campuses have highlighted the importance of curricular interventions. Despite this salience, little is known about students' decisions to enroll in courses that address religious difference. This paper used logistic regression to explore the influence of institutional characteristics, student demographics, and student identity and worldview on course decisions in the IDEALS data set. A number of variables emerged as significant with the largest coefficients relating to institutional characteristics. This paper offers empirical basis for expanded curricular engagement with religious difference and advances research on student course decisions generally.

TI  - Haiti has more forest than previously reported: land change 2000-2015
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of forest cover have important political, conservation, and funding implications, but methods vary greatly. Haiti has often been cited as one of the most deforested countries in the world, yet estimates of forest cover range from <1% to 33%. Here, we analyze land change for seven land cover classes (forest, shrub land, agriculture/pasture, plantation, urban/infrastructure, barren land, and water) between 2000 and 2015 using Landsat imagery (30 m resolution) in the Google Earth Engine platform. Forest cover was estimated at 26% in 2000 and 21% in 2015. Although forest cover is declining in Haiti, our quantitative analysis resulted in considerably higher forest cover than what is usually reported by local and international institutions. Our results determined that areas of forest decline were mainly converted to shrubs and mixed agriculture/pasture. An important driver of forest loss and degradation could be the high demand for charcoal, which is the principal source of cooking fuel. Our results differ from other forest cover estimates and forest reports from national and international institutions, most likely due to differences in forest definition, data sources, spatial resolution, and methods. In the case of Haiti, this work demonstrates the need for clear and functional definitions and classification methods to accurately represent land use/cover change. Regardless of how forests are defined, forest cover in Haiti will continue to decline unless corrective actions are taken to protect remaining forest patches. This can serve as a warning of the destructive land use patterns and can help us target efforts for better planning, management, and conservation.

TI  - Insight into the precipitation behavior of gridded precipitation data in the Sina basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the performance of three gridded precipitation data sets, namely, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Tropical Precipitation Measuring Mission (TRMM), and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), for the duration of 25 years using 9 rain gauge data sets of the Sina basin, India. Statistical measures were employed to measure the performance in reproducing the rainfall and to assess its ability to detect the rainfall/no rainfall events, its structure, pattern, and spatio-temporal variations in the monthly and annual time scales. Compromise programming (CP) is used to rank the statistical performances of selected gridded precipitation data sets and found that TRMM attained first rank for the 8 stations followed by MERRA. The precipitation concentration index (PCI) checks the pattern and distribution of rainfall and found that observed data shows a uniform distribution in the basin; however, all the three gridded data sets failed to demonstrate uniform distribution. Categorical metrics like Probability of Detection (POD) and False Alarm Ratio (FAR) revealed that TRMM followed by MERRA and GPCC have good capabilities to detect rainfall/no rainfall events at different thresholds. All the trends drawn between observed data set and gridded precipitation data sets revealed that the MERRA data tend to underestimate and the TRMM and GPCC data tend to overestimate the values and intensities of rainfall data sets at most of the stations for both monthly and annual time scales. The data analysis of extreme rainfall points at monthly and annual time scales exhibits better performance of TRMM data sets. Overall, the TRMM data set is capable in replicating different characteristics of the observed data in the study area and could be used for hydro-meteorological and climatic studies when continuous observed data set is not available.

TI  - Dynamics of savanna clearing and land degradation in the newest agricultural frontier in Brazil
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the dynamics of savanna clearing and land degradation in the MATOPIBA region, the newest agricultural frontier over the Cerrado in Brazil. For geospatial analysis of the "big data," we used algorithms available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform along with different satellite products. For the detection of vegetation clearing in the 1985-2018 period, we applied the LandTrendr algorithm to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat satellite instruments. In the evaluation of land degradation (2001-2015), we used the Trends.Earth algorithm to analyze NDVI data calculated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). By combining different datasets into the analysis, we discussed the relationships among savanna clearings, land degradation, topographic attributes, and fire frequency. The results showed that the largest proportions of savanna clearing in the 1985-1990 period were detected in the south of MATOPIBA (mesoregions Ocidental do Tocantins and Extremo Oeste Baiano). The savanna clearing progressed toward the mesoregions Oriental do Tocantins, Sudoeste Piauiense, and Sul Maranhense between 1991 and 2005. Variations over time in cleared areas ranged from 0.086 Mha to 2.146 Mha per year, showing well-defined peaks in 1986, 1991, and 2012. The clearing events followed the soybean expansion, especially over flat terrains at high elevations. In addition to the spillover effects of the Amazon Soy Moratorium on the savannas, other political and economic factors promoted changes in cleared areas of MATOPIBA. Compared to the decade preceding the signature of the Amazon Soy Moratorium in 2006, the cleared area of MATOPIBA increased 41% in the 10-year post-moratorium period. In the other analysis, our Trends.Earth results showed that the largest proportions of land degradation areas, as proxied by the MODIS NDVI, were the Sudoeste Piauiense and Centro Maranhense. These mesoregions presented distinct patterns of precipitation and soil composition. The number of fire events increased with vegetation clearing. However, the amount of cleared areas correlated moderately with that of burned areas due to the multi-use of fire in the region. Finally, we observed that the amount of land-degraded areas increased with fire frequency over agricultural areas, but remained relatively stable over native vegetated areas. Results highlight the importance of satellite sensors and cloud-computing platforms to inspect long-term trajectories of land occupation and degradation over broad savanna areas.

TI  - Alteration and structural features mapping in Kacho-Mesqal zone, Central Iran using ASTER remote sensing data for porphyry copper exploration
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery was used to identify argillic, phyllic and propylitic alteration zones and mapping geological structural features for porphyry copper exploration in the Kacho-Mesqal zone, Urumieh- Dokhtar Magmatic Arc, Iran. The image processing techniques such as specialised band ratio, Selective Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), and Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) image processing methods were implemented to the visible and near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands of ASTER. Results indicate that the argillic alteration zone is broadly distributed in the granodiorite intrusion, andesitic rock, tuff breccia and ignimbrite. Phyllic alteration is mainly mapped associated with sandstone and some parts of andesitic lithology. Propylitic alteration zone is identified in andesite, sandstone, shale and marl, dacite to rhyodacite, andesite-basalt, tuff and andesite lava and granodiorite intrusion. The fracture density map shows that the argillic alteration is mostly abundant in the high-density fracture zone, whereas propylitic and phyllic zones are located in moderate to low-density fracture zones. Consequently, high potential zones for copper mineralisation in the study area are identified within the high to moderate fracture density zones associated with argillic and assemblage of argillic, phyllic and propylitic alteration zones in granodiorite and andesite units.

TI  - Assessment of drought with a real-time web-based application for drought management in humid tropical Kerala, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial techniques are useful for near real-time monitoring of drought and towards devising local-level effective drought management plan. Based on the historic and current remote sensing data, one can identify the influence of drought on the vegetation status by analyzing the anomaly/drought condition of a particular area of interest (AOI) through different digital image processing techniques. In this study, an attempt has been made to develop a web-based application for generating drought maps and district-wise drought information at real time in the web server using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and Python scripts. A web-based application was developed and drought conditions existing in the study area were understood both spatially and temporally. The results of the application showed distinct variation of drought prevalence within the administrative boundaries. This web-based application was validated with drought analysis carried out using different drought indices, viz., standard precipitation index and reconnaissance drought index. The results established that this validated approach could be used for developing disaster management plan well in advance to combat the consequences of drought across the globe and to evolve strategic decisions which will have implications in the various sectors of the economy.

TI  - Analysis on Dynamic Changes and Driving Force of Lake Area in Wuhan City Circle From 1994 to 2015
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing ima g e data, the temporal and spatial changes of lakes in Wuhan City Circle from 1994 to 2015 were monitored dynamically. At the same time, Using land use cover obtained from remote sensing images in 1994, 2003, 2009, and 2015, combining with climate and economic data, multivariate statistical methods were used to quantitatively analyze the driving factors of the lake evolution. The results show that during the 21 years, the lake area in Wuhan City Circle showed a decreasing trend overall. The evolution process can he roughly divided into three stages : the period of complex changes in lake area(1994-2003) , the period of rapid reduction in lake area (2003-2009) and the period of slow reduction in lake area (2009-2015). The most prominent decrease in lake area occurred at the second stage with total lake area declining by 117 km(2) totally. The driving factors for lake area changes include human activities and climate change. Human activities are the main driving factors that dominate the evolution of lakes. Among them, urban expansion has the greatest impact in lake evolution, followed by population pressure and agricultural development. The impact coefficients are 0. 54, 0. 51, and 0. 47 respectively. Climate change has also contributed to lake evolution in Wuhan City Circle, but it has less influence than human activities.

TI  - Evolution of economic thought in the Ottoman Empire and early Republican Turkey
T2  - MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Up until the late eighteenth century, the economic understanding of the Ottoman elite was based on the worldview of the scholars of the Madrasah system. The first Ottoman treatises in modern economics began to be written in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, close to 300 years after the emergence of the subject during the Mercantilist era. The nineteenth century witnessed a gradual increase in economic analyses, together with the introduction of the subject in various institutions of higher education. However, a breakthrough in the development of economic thinking in the country had to wait until the foundation of the Republic in 1923, the emergence of the journal Kadro and the establishment of Istanbul University a decade later. This article traces the emergence and development of economics in the Ottoman Empire and in the first decade and a half of the Turkish Republic.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to estimate biomass extraction from multi-frequency and multi-polarization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data coupled with optical data. Further, the estimated biomass was validated with field-observed data. ALOS-2/PALSAR was utilized for retrieval of forest above- ground biomass (AGB) biophysical parameters. Subsequently, Sentinel-2 optical data and 90 m TanDEM were used to identify the bare ground area for calculating pseudo height. Ground-truth data were utilized for estimation and validation of the modelled biomass from radar data. In this study, five allometric models were used. Multivariate regression models were trained using backscatter from the same acquisition (date) on 10 randomly selected samples from 21 field plots. The validation was carried out on the remaining 11 field plots. Co-validation method was used to validate these models. Biomass was estimated from radar data using regression models. Since the objective of the study was to present generalized biomass estimation models using backscatter information and AGB, the AGB value range 100-400 tonne/ha was estimated/mapped. Combined backscatter and height inputs were better than backscatter models. In the estimation of AGB, polarimetric information content and backscatter information played a significant role.

AB  - For radiance images on the top of atmosphere obtained by wide field of view (WFV) camera in GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite, atmospheric corrections at four bands arc made to obtain surface reflectance images based on 6S atmospheric radiation transmission model, aerosol optical depth from Terra in Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MONS) and the parameter products (MCD13A1) of MONS bi-directional reflection distribution function model. Then the calculation methods of the image definition values arc based on Brenner gradient operator and medium frequency discrete cosine transform. The calculation results show that the image definition values after correction arc higher than those before correction, so the edge texture information of the image after correction is clearer than that before correction. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is evaluated based on the principle of threshold segmentation. The results show that the SNR of each band before and after correction has an increasing relationship with the radiance. The atmosphere has more influence on the short-wave band than the long-wave band.

TI  - Giant lung metastasis of NRAS-mutant melanoma in a 24-year-old patient with a history of BRAF-mutant conventional melanoma harboring Spitzoid morphology: a case report
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Spitzoid melanocytic lesions represent a heterogeneous group of proliferations with ambiguous and overlapping terminology. The exact distinction of a Spitz nevus from a Spitzoid melanoma can be very difficult or, in some cases, impossible. Among the Spitzoid lesions, there is a lesion termed an atypical Spitz tumour (AST) that has intermediate histopathologic features between those of a Spitz nevus and a Spitzoid melanoma and thus uncertain malignant potential. There are several rare cases of patients with a Spitzoid melanoma initially misdiagnosed as a Spitz nevus or an AST with fatal consequences. It is, therefore, advised to perform a molecular characterization in cases where uncertain skin lesions are presented, as it may provide extended set of information with a possible impact on the treatment options. Furthermore, preventive measures, such as regular physical and skin examinations, as well as thorough scheduling of individual follow-up visits, are essential in patients with potentially malignant skin nevi. Case report We report a case of a young adult female with a history of AST excision with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and insufficient follow-up. Four years after the primary dermatological diagnosis, she presented with a giant tumour in the right hemithorax. Radical en bloc resection of the tumour with right pneumonectomy and resection of the pericardium with reconstruction of the pericardium using mesh was performed. A definitive histopathological examination revealed a metastatic melanoma. The association of the previously diagnosed AST and subsequent appearance of melanoma metastases led to a retrospective re-evaluation of the initial lesion. The suspected diagnosis of Spitzoid melanoma, however, was not confirmed. Moreover, the molecular examination revealed a major discordance between the initial lesion and the lung tumour, which most likely excluded the possible association of the lung metastasis with the initial skin lesion. The initial skin lesion was a BRAF-mutant melanoma with Spitzoid features and termed as AST, while the giant lung metastasis was NRAS-mutant melanoma. The subsequent postoperative course was complicated by the appearance of brain metastases that were stereotactically irradiated. Nevertheless, despite complex specialised medical care, the patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated. By this time, no active oncological treatment was possible. The patient was delegated to local hospice for palliative care six months after the surgery and died three weeks later. Conclusions Our patient was surgically treated at the age of 20 for AST and died four years later of metastatic NRAS-mutant melanoma most likely of different occult origin. Molecular characterization, as well as the close clinical follow-up should be always precisely performed in patients with uncertain skin lesions, such as AST.

TI  - [Influence of different anastomotic methods on gastric function].
T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Segmental gastrectomy is a common function preserving operation, and its combination with sentinel lymph node navigation technology shows a broad prospect in the treatment of early gastric cancer. Commonly anastomosis methods include the follows: (1) Hand-sewn anastomosis: this method is relatively simple, reduces the use of stapler, and can effectively reduce surgical cost. However, laparotomy or small-incision assisted laparoscopic surgery is required to accomplish anastomosis, so the surgical wound is relatively large. (2) Delta anastomosis: this anastomosis is entirely endoscopic, requiring no small incision with less surgical trauma. However, due to the presence of residual cavities in the small curvature of the side-to-side anastomosis, and the possibility of excessive incision of the posterior wall of the stomach, which may shorten the pyloric sleeve, there is an increased risk of gastric stasis after the operation. (3) Hybrid technique: this anastomosis method is safe and effective. However, it requires total endoscopic gastric anterior wall suture, which represents higher requirements for surgeons. Therefore, surgeons experienced in minimally invasive surgeries are recommended to perform this anastomosis. (4) Puncture technique: this anastomotic method is end-to-end anastomosis with low risk of gastric stasis, and is applicable for entirely endoscopic anastomosis. However, the stapler is not typically used for gastrointestinal surgery, which brings certain limitations to clinical promotion. These anastomoses have their own advantages and disadvantages, and their effects on gastric function are also controversial. In conclusion, the development of segmental gastrectomy is still in its infancy, and prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials are awaited to confirm the safety of oncology and standardize the techniques.

T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing amount of LEO remote sensing satellite observation data,the ability of data transmission has become a factor to restrict the efficiency of satellite. Variable coding modulation (VCM) can be used to make full use of the system link margin, based on the dynamic evaluation of the satellite-ground data transmission channel conditions. And on the premise of ensuring the bit error rate and link margin, the optimal coding and modulation mode switching under the current channel conditions arc carried out adaptively, so as to improve the satellite data transmission efficiency. Using this method, the efficiency of log link was simulated and analyzed. Compared with the constant coding modulation (CCM) with the same symbol rate, the transmission efficiency was increased by 42.1% on average, which can provide a reference for the design of data transmission channel of remote sending satellite.

TI  - [Combined laparoscopy-endoscopy local resection for early gastric cancer].
T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The surgical treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) is undergoing the development of minimally invasive, precise and individualized treatment. The concept is changing from simple emphasis on radical treatment to giving consideration to both radical treatment and functional preservation. Combined laparoscopy-endoscopy local resection can achieve accurate resection of the lesions of EGC and solve the problem of lymph node dissection which cannot be performed in endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). At present, there are several methods of combined laparoscopy-endoscopy local resection for EGC, such as laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR), endoscopy-assisted wedge resection (EAWR), combined laparoscopic and endoscopic approach for neoplasia with a non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET), and non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS). These methods of local resection have the advantages of minimal invasion, shorter operation time, and less blood loss compared to conventional gastrectomy. Concerning the issue of lymph node dissection in combined laparoscopy-endoscopy surgery, sentinel node navigation can be the solution, although cumbersome intraoperative lymph node tracing, operative failure and false negative still exist. As a developing treatment for EGC, combined laparoscopy-endoscopy local resection will have a good application prospect in the future.
AB  - 早期胃癌的手术治疗正经历着微创化、精准化、个体化的发展，从单纯强调根治到根治与功能保留并重的理念方向改变。腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术可以做到早期胃癌病灶精准切除，因为相对于内镜黏膜下剥离术（ESD），内镜下胃壁的全层切除保障了肿瘤的垂直切缘的可靠性，而腹腔镜技术不但可以起到辅助内镜下进行全层切除，缝合胃壁缺损，更解决了ESD所欠缺的淋巴结清扫问题。目前，腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术有腹腔镜辅助的内镜下全层切除、内镜辅助的腹腔镜楔形切除术、非暴露技术腹腔镜-内镜联合入路肿瘤切除术和非暴露内镜下胃壁翻转术等。尽管每种双镜联合的治疗方法都存在缺陷，但是相较传统胃切除手术，具有创伤小、手术时间较短、术中出血较少等特点。淋巴结清扫问题是早期胃癌腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术的另一个重要问题，然而，现阶段的前哨淋巴结可能仍然存在术中淋巴结示踪操作略显繁琐的问题，并存在一定失败率，而且术中淋巴结活检存在一定比例的假阴性率等因素，限制了其在早期胃癌手术治疗的临床应用。但作为一种发展中的早期胃癌精准治疗手段，相信器械设备技术的发展会使腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术方法操作性更强，其应用前景值得期待。.

TI  - Wild black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i> Linnaeus, 1758) as zoomonitor of genotoxicity and systemic toxicity induced by hazardous emissions from Abule Egba unsanitary landfill, Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild black rats (Rattus rattus) inhabiting Abule Egba landfill (AEL) were used as zoomonitor to assess health risk associated with exposure to hazardous chemicals from landfills. Twenty five R. rattus (16 male and 9 female) captured within AEL and 15 (9 male and 6 female) (control) caught from Iyano Ipaja (10 km away from AEL) were examined for bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) and polychromatic erythrocytes/normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE/NCE) ratio, abnormal sperm morphology, alterations in hematological indices and erythrocyte morphology, and histopathology of the viscera using standard protocols. There was significant (p < 0.05) increase in MNPCE but decrease PCE/NCE ratio in bone marrow cells of exposed rats than the reference site. MNPCE was insignificantly higher in male than females. Cauda epididymal sperms from exposed rats showed significant high frequency of teratozoospermia. Erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentrations, percentage hematocrits, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, leucocyte count, and lymphocytes decreased while mean corpuscular volume, neutrophils, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin increased in the exposed rats compared to the control. Also, abnormal erythrocyte morphology: acanthocytes, codocytes (target cells), schizocytes, and tear drops significantly increased in the exposed rats. Marginal sexual dimorphism was observed between males and females in the incidence of hematological indices. Histopathological lesions including interstitial edema, hemorrhage, lymphoid depletion, cellular infiltrations, proliferation of the alveolar pneumocytes, necrosis, tissue degeneration, and reduced germinal epithelium were observed in the testes, liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and spleen from the exposed rats compared to the control. Some physicochemicals and metals analyzed in leachates from the landfill are capable of inducing genome instability and systemic toxicity in the exposed rats. Rattus rattus exposed to hazardous chemicals from AEL harbored somatic and germ cell mutations, and tissue damage compared to the control rats. We suggest that R. rattus are useful sentinel for genotoxicity and system toxicity assessment of landfill-polluted sites.

TI  - A phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an mRNA-based RSV prefusion F protein vaccine in healthy younger and older adults
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory tract infections that can be severe and sometimes fatal. The risk for severe RSV infection is highest in infants and older adults. A safe and effective RSV vaccine for older adults represents a serious unmet medical need due to higher morbidity and mortality in this age group. In this randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine encoding the RSV fusion protein (F) stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The study was conducted in healthy younger adults (ages >= 18 and <= 49 years) and healthy older adults (ages >= 60 and <= 79 years). Participants received mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo as a single intramuscular dose. For each dose level, three sentinel participants were administered open-label mRNA-1777 (V171). Seventy-two younger adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, or 200 mu g mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo, and 107 older adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, 200 or 300 mu g mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability and secondary objectives included humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity. All dose levels of mRNA-1777 (V171) were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported. Immunization with mRNA-1777 (V171) elicited a humoral immune response as measured by increases in RSV neutralizing antibody titers, serum antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, D25 competing antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, and cell-mediated immune responses to RSV-F peptides.

TI  - Understanding the social and cultural bases of Brexit*
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We use data from a large scale and nationally representative survey to evaluate two narratives about the social bases of Brexit. The first narrative sees Brexit as a revolt of the economically left-behinds. The second narrative attributes Brexit to the resurgence of an English nationalism. There is some, albeit not always consistent, evidence that people in relative poverty or those living in areas that have seen greater Chinese import penetration are slightly more pro-Leave. People living in economically deprived neighborhoods are not more pro-Brexit. Using the Weberian class-status distinction, it is social status, not social class, which stratifies Brexit support. Individuals for whom being British is important are more pro-Leave. But those who see themselves as British rather than English, and those reporting omnivorous cultural consumption are less supportive of Brexit. Overall, there is empirical support for both narratives. But the weight of the evidence suggests a strong cultural dimension in Brexit support.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes in the Urban Heat Island Intensity of Distinct Local Climate Zones: Case Study of Zhongshan District, Dalian, China
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensified due to rapid urbanization and global warming-induced high temperature extremes, the urban heat island effect has become a major environmental concern for urban residents. Scientific methods used to calculate the urban heat island intensity (UHII) and its alleviation have become urgent requirements for urban development. This study is carried out in Zhongshan District, Dalian City, which has a total area of 43.85 km(2) and a 27.5 km-long coastline. The mono-window algorithm was used to retrieve the land surface temperatures (LSTs), employing Landsat remote sensing images, meteorological data, and building data from 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2019. In addition, the district was divided into local climate zones (LCZs) based on the estimated intensities and spatiotemporal variations of the heat island effect. The results show that, from 2003 to 2019, LCZs A and D shrank by 3.225 km(2) and 0.395 km(2), respectively, whereas LCZs B, C, and 1-6 expanded by 0.932 km(2), 0.632 km(2), and 2.056 km(2), respectively. During this period, the maximum and minimum LSTs in Zhongshan increased by 1.365 degrees C and 1.104 degrees C, respectively. The LST and UHII levels of all LCZs peaked in 2019. The average LSTs of LCZs A-C increased by 1.610 degrees C, 0.880 degrees C, and 3.830 degrees C, respectively, and those of LCZs 1-6 increased by 2 degrees C-4 degrees C. The UHIIs of LCZs A, C, and D increased by 0.730, 2.950, and 0.344, respectively, and those of LCZs 1-6 increased from 1.370-2.977 to 3.744-5.379. Overall, the regions with high LSTs are spatiotemporally correlated with high building densities. In this study, the land cover was then classified into four types (LCZs A-D) using visual interpretation and object-oriented classification, including forested land, low vegetation, bare ground, and water. Besides, the buildings were categorized as LCZs 1-6, which, respectively, represented low-density low-rises buildings, low-density high-rises buildings, low-density super high-rises buildings, high-density low-rises buildings, high-density high-rises buildings, and high-density super high-rises buildings.

TI  - Leveraging Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy to Minimize the Burden of Axillary Surgery: a Review of Current Strategies and Surgical Techniques
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Axillary nodal disease is significantly less likely in both clinically node-negative (cN0) and node-positive (cN+) breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). There have thus been significant efforts to "de-escalate" axillary surgery in this setting. This review discusses modern axillary surgical paradigms and techniques after NAC. Recent Findings In cN0 patients, the accuracy and feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC is well-established, with prospective evidence supporting its oncologic safety. SLNB is also acceptable in select cN+ patients when certain criteria are met. There is mounting "real-world" evidence for the technical feasibility of this approach, including various methods of localizing and excising biopsy-proven nodes, with the ability to avoid axillary lymph node dissection in a substantial proportion of patients. However, outcome data is limited to small retrospective series. In appropriately selected patients, there is increasing opportunity to leverage the benefits of NAC to minimize the burden of axillary surgery.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability in Snow Parameters from MODIS Data Using Spatially Distributed Snowmelt Runoff Model (SDSRM): a Case Study in Dibang Basin, Arunachal Pradesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow parameters play a very important role in hydrological cycle, local weather pattern, and climate change, eventually influencing total runoff, river flows, and water availability through the amount and timing of snow melt. In this paper, the spatiotemporal variations of snow parameters in Dibang basin, Arunachal Pradesh, India, for a period of 10 years (2006-2015) were analyzed using Spatially Distributed Snowmelt Runoff Model (SDSRM) coupled with remote sensing and GIS techniques. SDSRM was selected due of its capability to simulate snow parameters in scarcely/un-gauged basin where observed data are not available. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo at 500 m resolution from Terra satellite was used to obtain daily snow albedo for the study area. The analysis of 10 years showed that maximum average snow density occurred in the month of June and minimum in the month of December; maximum average snow depth in January and minimum in July; maximum average snow water equivalent (SWE) in January and minimum in July and August; maximum average degree-day factor (DDF) in June and minimum in December; maximum average snowmelt depth in July and minimum in the month of January. Considering the yearly maximum and minimum average, snow density ranged from 404.84 to 522.84 kg/m(3) with an average of 461.76 kg/m(3); snow depth ranged from 0.01 to 0.68 m with an average of 0.24 m; SWE ranged from 0.01 to 0.29 m with an average of 0.11 m; DDF ranged from 0.45 to 0.58 cm/ degrees C-day with the average of 0.51 cm/ degrees C-day; and snowmelt depth ranged from 0.02 to 0.11 m/day with the average of 0.06 m/day. From the yearly temporal analysis, only snow density showed a slight decreasing trend, while the other snow parameters like snow depth, SWE, DDF, and snowmelt depth had a slight increasing trend. Based on yearly temporal analysis of each month, March and November showed an increasing trend for all the snow parameters out of which snow density and DDF showed a significant increasing trend in the month of March, while a slight decreasing trend was observed in the month of August, September, and October. The modeled SWE was compared with the observed SWE, and it was found that they were in good agreement with each other. The other snow parameters were also found to be within comparable ranges reported by other studies. Thus, this study demonstrated the capability of SDSRM to simulate snow parameters over an alpine watershed in Eastern Himalaya and can be recommended for use in un-gauged/scarcely gauged basins over the Himalayan region.

TI  - Mapping and modeling mangrove biophysical and biochemical parameters using Sentinel-2A satellite data in Bhitarkanika National Park, Odisha
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are Earth's most active and diversified saline wetlands, which play an essential role in protecting coastal communities from storm surge, cyclonic winds, tsunami, and tidal waves. Space-borne satellite data provide vital information for monitoring mangrove and retrieving health-related parameters. The objective of this study is to map and model biophysical and biochemical parameters of mangrove forests over the Bhitarkanika reserve forest located on the eastern coast of Odisha. The present study has employed Sentinel-2A sensor's red-edge bands to derive both the aforementioned parameters. Furthermore, the near-proximal sensor (NPS) data were integrated with satellite data for mapping leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen contents with the help of an empirical model. The key findings indicate that EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and measured leaf chlorophyll were significantly and positively correlated (R-2 = 0.78). EVI showed a stronger relationship with foliage pigments, such as leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen. Leaf area index (LAI) of mangrove ranged between 1 and 4, with healthy dense mangrove depicted LAI more than 2.5. Leaf chlorophyll content for dense mangrove forests showed between 40 and 90 mu g/cm(2) as estimated from satellite-based (i.e. NAOC index) and empirical model. However, the NAOC (Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve) index has relatively overestimated the chlorophyll. A similar pattern was also obtained for leaf nitrogen. Nevertheless, integrating both satellite and handheld NPS instruments has provided a robust and dynamic way to monitor mangrove forests' health conditions. Satellite-derived biophysical and biochemical parameters offer vital information on mangrove, which could be crucial towards conservation, plantation, and mangrove management.

TI  - Water quality assessment in a wetland complex using Sentinel 2 satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was carried out in a wetlands complex of great environmental and socioeconomic importance located in the north of Colombia, highly impacted by different anthropic activities that take place in the region, e.g., livestock, agriculture and urban wastewater disposal. Field measurements of pH, temperature, turbidity, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were performed at 22 sites located in the Bajo Sinu wetlands complex. This wetlands complex includes Cienaga Guatinaja, Cienaga Momil and Cienaga Sopal. Through a linear regression analysis between field-measured variables and the reflectance values of the Sentinel 2 image, models to represent the spatial variability of the different water quality parameters were obtained. In addition, water quality maps for drinking and aquatic protection life use were created based on Colombian standards. All generated models have a determination coefficient (R-2) > 0.7, except for temperature with R-2 approximate to 0.6. The five models are characterized by having correspondence in the electromagnetic spectrum with the areas belonging to the near infrared and the visible spectrum. These models, obtained from Sentinel 2 images in combination with GIS tools, allowed a complete analysis that contributes to the spatial-temporal monitoring of the studied aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Spatial distribution of GDP based on integrated NPS-VIIRS nighttime light and MODIS EVI data: a case study of Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived nighttime light data have been increasingly used as a proxy measure for investigating economic activity. However, there are few studies focusing on the spatialised mapping of the GDP at pixel level and further analysis of the economic differences in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors for the different regions using the VIIRS-NPP data. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature through developing a pixel-level agricultural and non-agricultural GDP map for Turkey in 2015 by combining the VIIRS-NPP nighttime imagery, Terra MODIS-Enhanced Vegetation Index, and land use/cover data from CORINE. The inclusion of vegetation indices and land cover data would significantly improve the estimates of sectorial GDP for Turkey where agriculture is one of the dominating sectors in the Country. GDP density map offers a significant database for both researchers and policy makers in the analysis of regional economic dynamics that will assist in formulating sustainable regional growth strategies.

TI  - Evaluating the reliability of time series land cover maps by exploiting the hidden Markov model
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series land cover maps are important materials for the work related to land use and land cover change. Satellite remote sensing images prove advantageous in fast mapping with low cost. In most time series land cover products yielded by the satellite remote sensing images, a number of illogical transitions exist between different time phases. The time series land cover products cannot exactly reflect the real land cover types and land cover changes for each pixel. The accuracy evaluation based on the limited ground truth cannot well guide the users because the reliability of different pixels of the land cover products is unknown. A generic model for the reliability evaluation of time series land cover products should be developed based on a strong theoretical frame. In order to better guide the use of the land cover products, this paper proposed an approach to evaluate the reliability of time series land cover products by exploiting the joint probability of hidden Markov model (HMM), in which the classification performance and the spatio-temporal relationships were taken into account. We applied the proposed evaluation method on the time series land cover maps of Poyang Lake Eco-economic Region in China. The reliability of the land cover products was presented by the grading of the joint probability of HMM. The results effectively reflected the classification performance, the spatio-temporal relationships and even the quality of the data source.

TI  - An Evaluation of 20-m ESA-CCI S2 Prototype LC Product
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural production estimate represents a key element in food security analysis, but before the agricultural statistics services process and release the data some precious early warning time is lost. While many remote sensing derived yield estimation methods are used operationally we're still in search of a robust remote sensing based cropped area estimate. ESA-CCI (European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative) released in late 2016 the S2 prototype Land Cover map at 20 m for Africa the first high resolution product of its kind. The objective of the current study is to evaluate how well the 20-m ESA-CCI S2 prototype LC represents cropland; in case the results turn out satisfactory the cropland class could be used as a crop mask that could be used along with yield estimate to assess crop production. The assessment method consisted of (1) selecting six equal size polygons so that the Sahelian and Sudanian zones of West Africa are represented at each of the three basins of the Sahel (Western, Central and Eastern), (2) generating four hundred dots randomly overlaid on the sample polygon (3) using Sentinel 2A 10 m or Google Earth images as ground truth. A dot count is then obtained for each one of the map being assessed and the reference. The process is repeated 10 times bringing the total number of dots used to four thousand for each of the 6 sample polygons. The number of classes is reduced to two (cropland and other). Binary confusion matrices are build and the accuracy, the precision and the sensitivity or recall calculated. Since our main goal is to see how good the classification of cropland is, the analysis focuses on the precision and the recall. Values for both indicators are almost similar for the Sudanian zone, but significantly different for the Sahelian zone, where the higher values of the recall are not an indication of cropland classification performance but rather the result of the relatively small proportion of the actual cropland dots. Therefore, the precision remains here the privileged cropland classification performance indicator. Analysis of the precision indicates that the S2 prototype LC cropland in the Sahelian zone is <3% correct in East Sahel, <7% in West Sahel and about a third of the time correct for the Center Sahelian. This is easily explained by the fact that the S2 prototype LC has mistaken the sand dunes and degraded land that makes up a significant part of the cropland. Even in the Sudanian zone where the analysis shows a better cropland classification performance, the highest precision indicates that the cropland classification is incorrect for a little over 28% of cases. Therefore, the ESA-CCI S2 prototype land cover map can't be used as a crop mask.

AB  - The coastal zones of northern Odisha coast, western Bay of Bengal, are highly exposed to natural forcing. These regions are vulnerable due to natural hazards such as cyclones, tsunamis, floods, shoreline/beach erosion and sea-level rise. Further, the increased intensity and density of the extreme events in the recent decades have contributed more to the coastal vulnerability, thereby causing floods and inundation. Therefore, there is a need of sustainable use of the coastal zone with proper management practices. In this context, coastal vulnerability index (CVI) has been proved as an effective method for assigning the vulnerability status to any coastal zone. The present research work aims to develop a CVI by integrating risk values of nine input variables and to segment them into low, moderate, high and very high vulnerability categories as per their degree of vulnerability. The study area exhibits a long 273.8 km coastal tract, and about 9.6% of the coastal tract is under very high vulnerability category, followed by 29.7% under high vulnerability, 46.3% under medium vulnerability and rest 14.3% under low vulnerability.

TI  - Detecting the Carotenoid Pigmentation due to <i>Haloarchaea</i> Microbes in the Lonar Lake, Maharashtra, India Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lonar Lake of Maharashtra is a crater based-saline lake. During the month of June 2020, this lake suddenly changed its colour and turned to pink due to the presence of Haloarchaea microbes, and this species have a unique adaptation style to survive in high saline condition. The salinity of this lake is increasing due to less rainfall, low human intervention, and an increase in the temperature of this region. These microbes produce fantastic bloom, which can be sensed from outer space because of red-orange carotenoids production. In this work, Sentinel 2A datasets have been used for the duration of January 2020 to June 2020. These datasets have been processed in Google Earth Engine platform and several indices like Salinity Index, Surface Algal Bloom Index, and Normalized Difference Haloarchaea Index have been calculated. With the help of these indices, it has been found that the appearance of these microbes has happened in the early part of June 2020, and in more precise terms, it can be stated that between May 31 and June 5, these microbes have appeared in the lake.

TI  - Evaluating the rate of change and predicting the future scenario of spatial pattern using Markov chain model: a study from Baghmundi CD Block of Purulia district, West Bengal
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the era of twenty-first century, the endless demands of human have promoted land use land cover (LULC) change, and its understanding is more essential for proper management and future planning towards the sustainable development. An analysis of LULC is made for the Baghmundi Community Development (C.D.) Block of Purulia district of West Bengal, India to observe the changes over time. The Landsat images of 1972, 1992, 1999, 2009 and 2019 are taken to prepare the LULC maps using RS and GIS techniques. Moreover, the Markov chain model is computed to estimate LULC change of 2039. Thematic maps of different years show several changes in LULC. An accuracy assessment of the classifications of LULC of the years 1999, 2009 and 2019 is calculated as 81.32%, 81.36% and 80.16% respectively. The kappa coefficient is also computed for the same years to understand the level of agreement between classified LULC type and ground level LULC type. The values of kappa coefficient are 0.76 for 1999, 0.77 for 2009 and 0.75 for 2019. Within the time frame of 1972 to 2019, the vegetation cover declined to 44.79 km(2), while the built-up area increased to 40.21 km(2). Based on the predicted model, the vegetation cover may lose 33.60 km(2) in 2039 from the year 2019, and it may mainly be acquired by the agricultural land (21.94 km(2)) and built-up area (7.93 km(2)).

TI  - COV-OBS.x2: 180 years of geomagnetic field evolution from ground-based and satellite observations
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the geomagnetic field model COV-OBS.x2 that covers the period 1840-2020. It is primarily constrained by observatory series, satellite data, plus older surveys. Over the past two decades, we consider annual differences of 4-monthly means at ground-based stations (since 1996), and virtual observatory series derived from magnetic data of the satellite missions CHAMP (over 2001-2010) and Swarm (since 2013). A priori information is needed to complement the constraints carried by geomagnetic records and solve the ill-posed geomagnetic inverse problem. We use for this purpose temporal cross-covariances associated with auto-regressive stochastic processes of order 2, whose parameters are chosen so as to mimic the temporal power spectral density observed in paleomagnetic and observatory series. We aim this way to obtain as far as possible realistic posterior model uncertainties. These can be used to infer for instance the core dynamics through data assimilation algorithms, or an envelope for short-term magnetic field forecasts. We show that because of the projection onto splines, one needs to inflate the formal model error variances at the most recent epochs, in order to account for unmodeled high frequency core field changes. As a by-product of the core field model, we co-estimate the external magnetospheric dipole evolution on periods longer than 2 years. It is efficiently summarized as the sum of a damped oscillator (of period 10.5 years and decay rate 55 years), plus a short-memory (6 years) damped random walk.

TI  - Longitudinal Sediment Profiling and Capacity Lost in Reservoir Using Multidate Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodical monitoring is needed for reservoirs to ensure proper management against sedimentation. The amount of sediment retained by the reservoir or the amount of volume lost is the major factor to be assessed during monitoring. This study assesses the reservoir sedimentation of the Wellington Reservoir using Satellite Remote Sensing. The analysis was carried out using eight sentinel 2 images for the hydrologic years 2016-2017. The water spread area was acquired from satellite data based on supervised classification. The water level was found to be in fluctuation between 1.94 and 4.94 m in the period of data. Polynomial regression equations were used in finding the relation between the depths: water spread area and volume of reservoir. From the study, it was found that due to sedimentation, the gross storage capacity of the Wellington Reservoir has reduced from 73.05 to 52.56 Mm(3) and the loss due to sedimentation is 28.04% in 92 years.

TI  - Improving precision of field inventory estimation of aboveground biomass through an alternative view on plot biomass
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We contrast a new continuous approach (CA) for estimating plot-level above-ground biomass (AGB) in forest inventories with the current approach of estimating AGB exclusively from the tree-level AGB predicted for each tree in a plot, henceforth called DA (discrete approach). With the CA, the AGB in a forest is modelled as a continuous surface and the AGB estimate for a fixed-area plot is computed as the integral of the AGB surface taken over the plot area. Hence with the CA, the portion of the biomass of in-plot trees that extends across the plot perimeter is ignored while the biomass from trees outside of the plot reaching inside the plot is added. We use a sampling simulation with data from a fully mapped two hectare area to illustrate that important differences in plot-level AGB estimates can emerge. Ideally CA-based estimates of mean AGB should be less variable than those derived from the DA. If realized, this difference translates to a higher precision from field sampling, or a lower required sample size. In our case study with a target precision of 5% (i.e. relative standard error of the estimated mean AGB), the CA required a 27.1% lower sample size for small plots of 100 m(2) and a 10.4% lower sample size for larger plots of 1700 m(2). We examined sampling induced errors only and did not yet consider model errors. We discuss practical issues in implementing the CA in field inventories and the potential in applications that model biomass with remote sensing data. The CA is a variation on a plot design for above-ground forest biomass; as such it can be applied in combination with any forest inventory sampling design.

TI  - Recognition method for high-resolution remote-sensing imageries of ionic rare earth mining based on object-oriented technology
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ion-absorbing-type rare earth ore is a precious mineral resource of China. The situation of rare earth mining in rare earth mining areas can be monitored precisely with remote-sensing image object-oriented classification methods. The high spatial resolution of remote-sensing technology provides a solution to this issue. This study developed an object-oriented identification method using high spatial resolution remote-sensing imageries to supervise ionic rare earth mining, beginning with the sedimentation tank stage of the mining process and its spatial aggregation distribution relationship. Then, the method was tested using Pleiades satellite remote-sensing imageries of the Lingbei rare earth mining area in Dingnan County of Ganzhou City and aerial remote-sensing imageries of the Heling rare earth mining area in Xunwu County of Ganzhou City. The results showed that the identification accuracy of the satellite and aerial imageries for sedimentation tanks was 94.17% and 90.03%, respectively. Thus, this method can provide a rapid, accurate, and dynamic technology for monitoring illegal rare earth mining.

TI  - Evaluation of Topographic Correction Effects for Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper Images with Complex Lighting Conditions
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of methods are available for topographic correction of remote sensing data, and various approaches have been proposed for the evaluation of topographic correction effects. However, few studies have evaluated the topographic correction effects for images obtained under all possible sun elevation conditions. This study employed three correction methods, namely, Statistical-Empirical (SE), C-correction (C), and the Sun-Canopy-Sensor + C-correction (SCS + C) methods. These were used for topographic correction of 11 images obtained by the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper sensor from June to December. An evaluation of the effectiveness of these three methods was carried out based on five evaluation indices, with the goal of investigating the variation in the topographic correction effect with changes in lighting conditions and the adaptability of topographic correction methods to those conditions. The results showed that the SE method effectively reduced the dependence of surface reflectance on the terrain when the solar elevation was greater than 46 degrees, yielding a very stable surface reflectance and a low proportion of outliers. At sun elevation below 46 degrees, the SCS + C method has good correction effect. After topographic correction using these three methods, the correction effect was compromised as the lighting conditions weakened. Within areas where the topographic and geographical conditions are similar to that of this study, the correction effect can be divided into three levels based on the solar elevation while obtaining the images, i.e., > 60 degrees, 50-60 degrees and < 50 degrees. Caution should be taken when conducting quantitative research on images obtained when the solar elevation is < 50 degrees.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of ENSO on Agriculture Over Africa Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the strongest drivers of climate variability that directly influences agricultural production. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of ENSO on agriculture in Southern and Eastern Africa by (1) exploring the association between ENSO, vegetation condition and soil moisture, and (2) analyzing the difference in soil moisture and vegetation conditions for two extreme ENSO phases (El Nino and La Nina). Our results indicate that vegetation conditions are strongly associated with ENSO and show a clear dipole pattern that is reversed between El Nino and La Nina. Lagged correlation analysis confirms the ability of soil moisture and ENSO to predict vegetation conditions with 1-3 months of lead-time. The temporal and spatial evolution of soil moisture and vegetation responses showed the expected dipole pattern during the El Nino and subsequent La Nina events. Results indicate that ENSO impact on crop yield varies with geographical location, crop types, and ENSO phases. For example, yields in La Nina years have been higher in Southern Africa but lower in Eastern Africa. Maize yield decreases associated with El Nino events were usually larger than corresponding yield increases during La Nina events over Southern Africa. Our findings highlight the impact of ENSO on agricultural production, which has significant potential to enhance the early warning system for agriculture and food security.

TI  - Oncologic Safety of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Alone After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The oncologic safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone for clinically node-positive (cN1-2) patients who convert to pathologic node-negativity (ypN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is not well established. Methods This study retrospectively identified 244 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of cT1-3cN0-2 breast cancer who underwent NAC followed by SLNB at the authors' institution between 2013 and 2018. The patients were categorized as clinically node-negative (cN0) or cN1-2 before the onset of NAC, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare locoregional and distant recurrence rates after SLNB alone for ypN0 patients. Results Among 244 patients who underwent NAC followed by surgery with SLNB for axillary staging, 112 (45.9%) were cN0 at presentation, whereas 132 (54.5%) had biopsy-proven cN1-2 disease and converted to cN0 after treatment. Of the patients presenting with cN0 disease, 102 (91.1%) were ypN0 on SLNB pathology compared with 60 cN1/2 patients (45.5%; p < 0.001). Regional nodal irradiation was administered to 5% of the cN0/ypN0 patients compared with 70.7% of the cN1-2/ypN0 patients (p < 0.001). Overall, 211 patients were treated with SLNB alone and had a median follow-up period of 36 months (interquartile range [IQR], 24-53 months). For 101 cN0/ypN0 patients who underwent SLNB alone, the 5-year local and regional recurrence rates were respectively 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-13.8) and 1% (95% CI 0.1-7.0). For 58 cN1-2/ypN0 patients who underwent SLNB alone, the 5-year local and regional recurrence rates were respectively 4.1% (95% CI 1.0-15.5) and 0%, with no axillary recurrences noted. Conclusion For ypN0 patients, SLNB alone after NAC is associated with low and acceptable short-term axillary recurrence rates. Additional follow-up data from prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm long-term oncologic safety and define optimal local therapy recommendations.

TI  - Utility of Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging in Gynecologic Surgery: Systematic Review and Consensus Statement
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background This study aimed to review the current knowledge on the utility of intraoperative fluorescence imaging in gynecologic surgery and to give evidence-based recommendations to improve the quality of care for women who undergo gynecologic surgery. Methods A computer-based systematic review of the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Pubmed, EMBASE, and SciSearch databases as well as institutional guidelines was performed. The time limit was set at 2000-2019. For the literature search, PRISMA guidelines were followed. A modified-Delphi method was performed in three rounds by a panel of experts to reach a consensus of conclusions and recommendations. Results Indocyanine green (ICG) is used primarily in gynecology for sentinel node-mapping. In endometrial and cervical cancer, ICG is a feasible, safe, time-efficient, and reliable method for lymphatic mapping, with better bilateral detection rates. Experience in vulvar cancer is more limited, with ICG used together with Tc-99 m as a dual tracer and alone in video endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy. In early ovarian cancer, results are still preliminary but promising. Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging also is used for ureteral assessment, allowing intraoperative ureteral visualization, to reduce the risk of ureteral injury during gynecologic surgery. Conclusions For most gynecologic cancers, ICG fluorescence imaging is considered the tracer of choice for lymphatic mapping. The use of this new technology expands to a better ureteral assessment.

TI  - Extraction of mangrove forest through Landsat 8 Mangrove Index (L8MI)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A research study is conducted to develop remote sensing index(s) for mapping mangrove forest on regional scale using Landsat 8 dataset and to compare with the available vegetation indices. The study proposes a new forest indexing technique, i.e., Landsat 8 Mangrove Index (L8MI), with its two variants, namely L8MI_1 and L8MI_2, that are used to enhance the separability of mangrove forest from other vegetation lands by utilizing the Advanced Slope-based Indexing Technique (ASIT) and performing the classification of mangrove forest with the help of Otsu's thresholding method. Furthermore, modification in available Normalized Difference Mangrove Index (NDMI) has been proposed by combining it with Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). In this research study, a comparative analysis is performed between six vegetation indices and three proposed mangrove indices in order to explore the potential of mangrove forest mapping technique along the coastal region of Karachi, Pakistan. To evaluate the accuracy of proposed mangrove indices, 2000 reference points are selected to determine producer's accuracy (PA), user's accuracy (UA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K). The comparative analysis shows an overall accuracy of greater than 95% with kappa coefficient greater than 0.85, which is greater classification accuracy than available vegetation indices compared in this study.

TI  - Characterizing the evolution life cycle of the Sunkoshi landslide in Nepal with multi-source SAR data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A catastrophic landslide disaster happened on 2 August 2014 on the right bank of Sunkoshi River in Nepal, resulting in enormous casualties and severe damages of the Araniko highway. We collected multi-source synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to investigate the evolution life cycle of the Sunkoshi landslide. Firstly, Distributed Scatterers SAR Interferometry (DS-InSAR) technology is applied to analyze 20 ALOS PALSAR images to retrieve pre-disaster time-series deformation. The results show that the upper part, especially the top of the landslide, has long been active before collapse, with the largest annual LOS deformation rate more than -30 mm/year. Time series deformations measured illustrate that rainfall might be a key driving factor. Next, two pairs of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X bistatic data are processed to identify the landslide affected area by intensity change detection, and to generate pre-and post-disaster DSMs. Surface height change map showed maximum values of -150.47 m at the source region and 55.65 m in the deposit region, leading to a debris volume of 5.4785 +/- 0.6687 million-m(3). Finally, 11 ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and 82 Sentinel-1 SAR images are analyzed to derive post-disaster annual deformation rate and long time series displacements of the Sunkoshi landslide. The results illustrated that the upper part of the landslide were still in active deformation with the largest LOS displacement velocity exceeding-100 mm/year.

TI  - An approach for multi-dimensional land subsidence velocity estimation using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR datasets by applying persistent scatterer interferometry technique
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques has the potential of estimating the land subsidence at a high accuracy of nearly in millimeter scale. The major limitation of the present InSAR methods like persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is that they measure land deformation velocities only in the direction of the radar line of sight (LOS). Hence, the real prospects of the deformation velocity, i.e. the horizontal and vertical components of velocity remain uncertain. This study is focusing on retrieving PSI based multi-dimensional land deformation velocity along horizontal and vertical directions in an urban region by using ascending and descending pass Sentinel-1 datasets. The area for this study is Lucknow city in Uttar Pradesh state of India. The estimated LOS velocity vectors from ascending and descending pass time-series datasets are utilized for retrieving multidimensional subsidence velocity. Further, the retrieved time-series land subsidence is correlated to the groundwater level variation during the considered time span.

TI  - Monetising the savings of remotely sensed data and information in Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER) wildfire assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a value of information approach to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of using satellite imagery as part of the Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER), a US federal program that identifies imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property and critical natural or cultural resources. We compared the costs associated with producing a Burn Area Reflectance Classification map and implementing a BAER when imagery from satellites (either Landsat or a commercial satellite) was available to when the response team relied on information collected solely by aerial reconnaissance. The case study included two evaluations with and without Burn Area Reflectance Classification products: (a) savings of up to US$51 000 for the Elk Complex wildfire incident request and (b) savings of a multi-incident map production program. Landsat is the most cost-effective way to input burn severity information into the BAER program, with savings of up to US$35 million over a 5-year period.

TI  - Large-scale early-wilting response of Central European forests to the 2018 extreme drought
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of drought and heat affects forest ecosystems by deteriorating the health of trees, which can lead to large-scale die-offs with consequences on biodiversity, the carbon cycle, and wood production. It is thus crucial to understand how drought events affect tree health and which factors determine forest susceptibility and resilience. We analyze the response of Central European forests to the 2018 summer drought with 10 x 10 m satellite observations. By associating time-series statistics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with visually classified observations of early wilting, we show that the drought led to early leaf-shedding across 21,500 +/- 2,800 km(2), in particular in central and eastern Germany and in the Czech Republic. High temperatures and low precipitation, especially in August, mostly explained these large-scale patterns, with small- to medium-sized trees, steep slopes, and shallow soils being important regional risk factors. Early wilting revealed a lasting impact on forest productivity, with affected trees showing reduced greenness in the following spring. Our approach reliably detects early wilting at the resolution of large individual crowns and links it to key environmental drivers. It provides a sound basis to monitor and forecast early-wilting responses that may follow the droughts of the coming decades.

TI  - Using ForeStereo and LIDAR data to assess fire and canopy structure-related risks in relict <i>Abies pinsapo</i> Boiss. forests
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we combine information from aerial LIDAR and hemispherical images taken in the field with ForeStereo-a forest inventory device-to assess the vulnerability and to design conservation strategies for endangered Mediterranean fir forests based on the mapping of fire risk and canopy structure spatial variability. We focused on the largest continuous remnant population of the endangered tree species Abies pinsapo Boiss. spanning 252 ha in Sierra de las Nieves National Park (South Andalusia, Spain). We established 49 sampling plots over the study area. Stand structure variables were derived from ForeStereo device, a proximal sensing technology for tree diameter, height and crown dimensions and stand crown cover and basal area retrieval from stereoscopic hemispherical images photogrammetry. With this information, we developed regression models with airborne LIDAR data (spatial resolution of 0.5 points.m(-2)). Thereafter, six fuel models were fitted to the plots according to the UCO40 classification criteria, and then the entire area was classified using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm on Sentinel imagery (overall accuracy of 0.56 and a KIA-Kappa Coefficient of 0.46). FlamMap software was used for fire simulation scenarios based on fuel models, stand structure, and terrain data. Besides the fire simulation, we analyzed canopy structure to assess the status and vulnerability of this fir population. The assessment shows a secondary growth forest that has an increasing presence of fuel models with the potential for high fire spread rate fire and burn probability. Our methodological approach has the potential to be integrated as a support tool for the adaptive management and conservation of A. pinsapo across its whole distribution area (<4,000 ha), as well as for other endangered circum-Mediterranean fir forests, as A. numidica de Lannoy and A. pinsapo marocana Trab. in North Africa.

TI  - Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) in Breast Cancer Patients: An Application Analysis of 163 Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsies
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Literature shows platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to improve overall outcomes in orthopedics, dermatology, ophthalmology, gynecology, and plastic surgery. Data on oncological patients is very limited. Only one publication is available on PRP in breast cancer patients. This work evaluated PRP in sentinel node biopsy procedures for breast cancer patients in terms of complication rates and oncological short-term follow-up. Methods. The evaluated PRP was ACP (R), i.e., autologous conditioned plasma by Arthrex (R). Between 2015 and 2018, 163 patients were offered to receive an ACP (R)/PRP injection in their lymph node biopsy site. Recruitment resulted in an approximate one-to-one ratio for analysis. Endpoints were major (revision) and minor (seroma, hematoma, and infection) complications rates as well as distant metastases, local recurrence, and overall survival. Median follow-up was 30 months. Results. Complication rates and oncological follow-up showed PRP to be applicable to use in a sentinel node biopsy scenario in breast cancer patients. There were 0 revisions in the ACP (R)/PRP group and 1.2% revisions in the control group (not significant). Oncological follow-up showed zero (0) distant metastases and local recurrences as well as a 100% 30-month overall survival. Conclusions. This is the first analysis of ACP (R)/PRP used in breast cancer patients in a sentinel node biopsy setting worldwide. PRP does not seem to increase rates of local recurrence within this 30-month follow-up time frame. Also, trend towards decreasing complication rates could be shown.

TI  - Mapping spatiotemporal variability of the urban heat island across an urban gradient in Worcester, Massachusetts using in-situ Thermochrons and Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-8 derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) is used to measure Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) patterns and intensity in Worcester, MA, USA. Additionally, near-surface air temperature variability is measured using in-situ sensors to further contextualize the urban-to-rural land-cover driven thermal patterns in the study area. Despite the widespread applicability of thermal data, many SUHI studies do not compare LST with in-situ information. Comparisons between satellite-based and in-situ measurements of land surface temperature (LST) are important for establishing confidence in the utility of remotely sensed information to monitor and help improve the lived experience in cities. The objective of this study is to determine the capability of Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Scanner (TIRS) to measure fine-scale temperature variation in a moderately sized urban area with a mixture of land-cover types. Ground-Level Temperature (GLT) was measured at 13 sites using iButton (R) Thermochron (R) temperature sensors from 13 June 2013 to 28 October 2014. Landsat-derived LST was compared to in-situ GLT using 30 Landsat-8 TIRS images for the commensurate time period. Sites with 1) eastern solar exposure; 2) low tree canopy coverage; and 3) proximity to impervious surfaces have higher annual temperature and greater offset from Landsat-derived LST. Sites with more than 47% tree canopy coverage have a more consistent LST and GLT relationship, (e.g. MAE < 3.74 degrees C), show lower annual variability (e.g. r(2) > 0.85), and also experienced low LST variability over the time series (e.g. coefficient of variation 0.007). Results indicate that site characteristics and land-cover type affect the offset between in-situ air temperature measurements and satellite-derived LST.

TI  - A statistical approach to white-nose syndrome surveillance monitoring using acoustic data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional pathogen surveillance methods for white-nose syndrome (WNS), the most serious threat to hibernating North American bats, focus on fungal presence where large congregations of hibernating bats occur. However, in the western USA, WNS-susceptible bat species rarely assemble in large numbers and known winter roosts are uncommon features. WNS increases arousal frequency and activity of infected bats during hibernation. Our objective was to explore the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring as a surveillance tool for WNS. We propose a non-invasive approach to model pre-WNS baseline activity rates for comparison with future acoustic data after WNS is suspected to occur. We investigated relationships among bat activity, ambient temperatures, and season prior to presence of WNS across forested sites of Montana, USA where WNS was not known to occur. We used acoustic monitors to collect bat activity and ambient temperature data year-round on 41 sites, 2011-2019. We detected a diverse bat community across managed (n = 4) and unmanaged (n = 37) forest sites and recorded over 5.37 million passes from bats, including 13 identified species. Bats were active year-round, but positive associations between average of the nightly temperatures by month and bat activity were strongest in spring and fall. From these data, we developed site-specific prediction models for bat activity to account for seasonal and annual temperature variation prior to known occurrence of WNS. These prediction models can be used to monitor changes in bat activity that may signal potential presence of WNS, such as greater than expected activity in winter, or less than expected activity during summer. We propose this model-based method for future monitoring efforts that could be used to trigger targeted sampling of individual bats or hibernacula for WNS, in areas where traditional disease surveillance approaches are logistically difficult to implement or because of human-wildlife transmission concerns from COVID-19.

TI  - Surface velocity of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS): assessment of interior velocities derived from satellite data by GPS
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) extends around 600 km upstream from the coast to its onset near the ice divide in interior Greenland. Several maps of surface velocity and topography of interior Greenland exist, but their accuracy is not well constrained by in situ observations. Here we present the results from a GPS mapping of surface velocity in an area located approximately 150 km from the ice divide near the East Greenland Ice-core Project (EastGRIP) deep-drilling site. A GPS strain net consisting of 63 poles was established and observed over the years 2015-2019. The strain net covers an area of 35 km by 40 km, including both shear margins. The ice flows with a uniform surface speed of approximately 55 m a(-1) within a central flow band with longitudinal and transverse strain rates on the order of 10(-4) a(-1) and increasing by an order of magnitude in the shear margins. We compare the GPS results to the Arctic Digital Elevation Model and a list of satellite-derived surface velocity products in order to evaluate these products. For each velocity product, we determine the bias in and precision of the velocity compared to the GPS observations, as well as the smoothing of the velocity products needed to obtain optimal precision. The best products have a bias and a precision of similar to 0.5 m a(-1). We combine the GPS results with satellite-derived products and show that organized patterns in flow and topography emerge in NEGIS when the surface velocity exceeds approximately 55 m a(-1) and are related to bedrock topography.

TI  - Study of cutaneous melanoma recurrences after sentinel node biopsy: Patterns of dissemination and use of complementary test in follow-up
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the patterns of melanoma recurrence in the local population, including factors that may influence in this event and timing of relapse, and to determine the mode of detection of them.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at the Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Spain) from 2002 to 2012. The following data were collected of each patient: age, gender, date of diagnosis, location of melanoma, histological subtype, Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitosis, sentinel node status, AJCC 8th edition stage, site of first diagnosed metastasis, mode of relapse, date of first relapse and time of death.Results: Of 308 patients, 30% people suffered metastasis. The mean follow-up time was 68.63 months. 51.1% of relapses were locoregional and 48.9% haemato-visceral. Sentinel node status was the only variable associated with higher risk of haematovisceral metastasis (p < 0.001). The mean time between diagnosis of melanoma and recurrence was 2.7 years. Most recurrences were detected by the patient himself or had any type of symptoms and were consequently selected for a complementary test.Conclusion: It is important to follow-up all patients with diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma, essentially during the first 5 years after diagnosis.

TI  - Indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node detection in early breast cancer: Prospective evaluation of detection rate and toxicity-The FLUOBREAST trial
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Detection of sentinel lymph node in early breast cancer is commonly based on the combination of patent blue dye and a radioisotope 99m Technetium. Each of these two tracers has advantages and disadvantages leading to the development of the use of indocyanine green.Methods We conducted a prospective clinical trial to compare the detection rate of indocyanine green with 99mTe. Each patient undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy for an early breast cancer received both indocyanine green and radioisotopes. The trial was registered: FLUOBREAST EudraCT N 2015-000698-11, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02875626.Results Among a total of 88 patients, 77 were assessable for a total of 205 nodes. Detection rates were 93% for the isotope and 96% for the indocyanine green. The combined detection rate was 99%. The overall concordance rate per patient was 91%. The median number of excised sentinel nodes was 2.3 for each tracer and 2.7 for the combined method (P = .21). All the macrometastatic nodes were detected by both indocyanine green and radioisotopes. The median time between incision of the axilla and removal of the last node was 14 minutes. There was neither allergy nor radio-sensitization linked with the use of indocyanine green.Conclusions Indocyanine green delivers a high detection rate and sensitivity for the sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer, with short operative time and a normal number of excised sentinel lymph nodes. Allergy is extremely rare and there is no toxicity. Indocyanine green could be an alternative to radioisotopes to provide an accurate staging of the axilla. Its routine use should be approved.

TI  - Time-lapse sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has drastically affected the world economy, raised public anxiety, and placed a substantial psychological burden on the governments and healthcare professionals by affecting over 4.7 million people worldwide. As a preventive measure to minimise the risk of community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in India, a nationwide lockdown was imposed initially for 21 days to limit the movement of 1.3 billion people. These restrictions continue in most areas, with a conditional relaxation occurring in a few Indian states. In an attempt to assess the emerging mutants of SARS-CoV-2 and determine their spread in India, we analysed 112 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in a time-lapse manner. We found 72 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes, defined by 143 polymorphic sites and high haplotype diversity, suggesting that this virus possesses a high evolutionary potential. We also demonstrated that early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into India was from China, Italy and Iran and observed signs of community spread of the virus following its rapid demographic expansion since its first outbreak in the country. Additionally, we identified 18 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and a few selected mutations showed to increase stability, binding affinity, and molecular flexibility in the overall tertiary structure of the protein that may facilitate interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The study provides a pragmatic view of haplotype-dependent spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India which could be important in tailoring the pharmacologic treatments to be more effective for those infected with the most common haplotypes. The findings based on the time-lapse sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 will aid in the development of a real-time practical framework to tackle the ongoing, fast-evolving epidemic challenges in the country.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an innovative model has been developed for wind speed estimation through the Deep Learning method using hourly wind speed data from the measurement stations of the General Directorate of Meteorology in Van and Hakkari provinces in Turkey in conjunction with simultaneous satellite images from Eumetsat. Obtained satellite images were used during the introduction of the model, while wind speed data were used at the output stage. As a result of the findings, it was found that 85% accuracy performance could be achieved to provide sufficient insight for systems that are widely established worldwide. The model, developed as a result of the study, eliminates the need to install wind measuring stations for any region on earth within the satellite field in terms of determining wind potential. Since the field of view of the Meteosat 7 satellite covers the whole of Eastern Europe, it was determined that it could predict a high rate of up to 6 hours later by the method used in image analysis. The systems to be controlled with this method will be able to examine the weather events instantly at each point in the satellite field of view and make more accurate decisions. Also, companies will be able to perform a more detailed and rapid field scan compared to existing limited methods, and reduce initial investment costs and operating costs in terms of renewable energy resources investments.

TI  - Mapping winter-wheat biomass and grain yield based on a crop model and UAV remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurately estimates of crop biomass and grain yield estimation are crucial for agricultural management. Optical remote sensing techniques can provide crop parameters (e.g., biomass, fractional vegetation cover (FVC)) at regional and larger scales. However, such techniques saturate at high crop canopy cover and cannot detect biomass stored in reproductive organs. The AquaCrop model can be used to estimate FVC, biomass, and grain yield output based on crop growth environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, rainfall, irrigation). In this work, we developed a method for estimating and mapping crop biomass and grain yield using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images and AquaCrop. The combination of low-cost UAV remote sensing data and AquaCrop can be used to map wheat biomass and grain yield before harvest. This work investigated whether biomass and grain yield can be predicted using measurements of biomass and FVC in several winter-wheat fields at an early growing stage using ground-based and remote sensing-based methods. FVC, biomass, and grain yield were measured at several key growing stages (jointing (S1), heading (S2), flowering (S3), grain filling (S4)) and harvest (H) during 2014-2015. We specifically evaluated the performances of using field- and UAV-based FVC and biomass measurements from different growing-stage combinations (e.g., S1-S4, S1-S3, and S1-S2) to calibrate the AquaCrop model and estimate biomass and grain yield. The results indicate that winter-wheat biomass and grain yield can be estimated by calibrating AquaCrop using (i) biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results also reveal that the biomass and grain yield estimated using FVC and AquaCrop have poor accuracy compared with the biomass and grain yield estimated using (i) only biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results suggest that the combined use of UAV remote sensing and AquaCrop can be used to obtain maps of biomass and biomass yield. When estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one month (13 May) before harvest (11 June), the predicted biomass and grain yield agreed with the measured values (biomass: n = 96, coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.61, mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.69 t ha(-1), root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 2.10 t ha(-1), normalized RMSE (nRMSE) = 18.5%; grain yield: n = 48, R (2) = 0.63, MAE = 0.96 t ha(-1), RMSE = 1.16 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 21.9%). When estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one and a half months (26 April) before harvest (11 June), the predicted biomass and grain yield was lower than when estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one month before harvest (biomass: n = 144, R (2) = 0.55, MAE = 2.52 t ha(-1), RMSE = 3.34 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 23.6%; grain yield: n = 48, R (2) = 0.34, MAE = 1.68 t ha(-1), RMSE = 2.17 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 35.7%).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characterization of Land Subsidence in Guandu (China) Revealed by Multisensor InSAR Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive groundwater exploitation has brought about severe ground subsidence in Guandu (China), threatening the stability of urban infrastructure. Mapping of the spatiotemporal variations of ground deformation is urgently needed for disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, multisensor interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations were applied to Guandu to derive the time series deformation from 2007 to 2019. The annual deformation velocity revealed three severe subsiding regions in Guandu. Based on the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images with overlapping temporal and spatial coverage, two-dimensional vertical and horizontal east-west deformation was calculated and indicated that the deformation in Guandu was dominated by vertical direction. After connecting the multisensor results, long-term ground deformation spanning from January 9, 2007, to September 1, 2019, was produced and showed that the north subsiding region experienced fast followed by slow subsidence, whereas the south subsiding region experienced slow followed by fast subsidence. This difference was due to the changes of groundwater pumping centers and rates. The cumulative maximum subsidence reached 400 mm during the period of 2007-2019. The similar variations in temporal domain between the change of groundwater level and ground deformation suggested that groundwater exploitation accounted for the severe subsidence in Guandu. Our results may provide scientific evidence regarding the sound management of groundwater exploitation to mitigate potential damage to infrastructure and the environment.

TI  - Assessing the Burden of Nodal Disease for Breast Cancer Patients with Clinically Positive Nodes: Hope for More Limited Axillary Surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is accepted for patients with one or two positive sentinel nodes, and studies are focusing on clinically node-positive patients who have been downstaged with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Evidence is lacking for patients with positive nodes who undergo surgery upfront. These patients are assumed to have a higher burden of nodal disease such that ALND remains the standard of care. Methods Patients who underwent ALND for breast cancer between 2010 and 2019 at the authors' institution were retrospectively identified. Those with clinical N1 disease were included in the study. Patients who received NAC and those who had surgery for sentinel node positive disease or axillary recurrence were excluded. Clinical and pathologic factors associated with nodal stage were evaluated. Results Of 111 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 61.3% had a palpable node on exam, and 41.4% ultimately had pN1 disease. Most of the tumors were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (91.5%), and 21.7% of the tumors were invasive lobular cancers. Lobular histology, tumor size, and metastasis size were associated with higher nodal stage. In the multivariable analysis, the patients with nodal metastasis larger than 10 mm had significantly lower odds of having pN1 disease (odds ratio 0.12; 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.69;p = 0.02). In a subset analysis of patients with palpable nodes, tumor size and histology remained significantly associated with nodal stage. Conclusion More than 40% of breast cancer patients with clinically positive nodes had minimal nodal disease (pN1) at surgery. Additionally, palpable nodes on exam did not predict higher nodal stage. A subset of patients with clinically positive nodes may be identified who can potentially be spared the morbidity of ALND.

TI  - A comparative assessment of the accuracies of split-window algorithms for retrieving of land surface temperature using Landsat 8 data
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important physical parameters examined in modeling the land surface processes. There are several algorithms for estimating the LST using satellite imagery. The present study aims to evaluate the accuracy of ten split-window algorithms in estimating the LST using Landsat 8 images in the arid lands. The split-window algorithms were validated by employing the two methods of temperature-based (T-based) and cross-validation. In the T-based validation method, soil temperatures at depth of 5 cm within three meteorological stations were used at 6:30, 12:30, and 18:30 (local time). The land surface temperature was predicted at the moment when satellite overpass by implementing Fourier series. Results of the T-based validation indicated that the Li and Coll algorithms with RMSE values of 5.83 and 8.94 and MADE of 4.60 and 8.04 degrees C, have the lowest and highest errors, respectively. To conduct the cross-validation and prepare the RMSE statistical index images, the LST images associated with MODIS sensor and those of various split-window algorithms obtained via Landsat images were compared. Results of land-use analysis showed that areas with the RMSE of more than 5 degrees C, are located in valleys and regions with high humidity. The results of cross-validation showed that the Li and Jimenez's split-window algorithms are the most accurate methods with RMSEs of 3.65 and 3.57 degrees C, respectively. The Parata, Price, Sobrino, Uliverii, Mcclain, Vidal, Kerr, and Coll algorithms are in the next grades, respectively. In general, using atmospheric water vapor increases the accuracy of retrieval LST in a split-window algorithm.

TI  - Trends in forest cover change and degradation in Duguna Fango, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest is one of the vital resources that determine the livelihood, environmental stability, and societal development. Duguna Fango is biologically diverse and deeply threatened in the region. The area has undergone extensive environmental changes since 1980s due to shifting cultivation, deforestation, urbanization, growing human population and drought. Thus, this research was conducted to investigate the status of forest change and degradation by using available satellite imageries at Duguna Fango Woreda. It was based on the corrected optical satellite data (Landsat 7 ETM of 2000, 2009, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS of 2018); available from the Global Land Cover Facility acquired in the drier seasons of the years was used for forest cover change analysis. Besides, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) indicators like (NDVI minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation) were also computed for the year 2000, 2009 and 2018 to determine the density of vegetation. The results showed in the period between 2000 and 2018, built up and cultivated lands increased with a mean annual rate of 92.18 and 366.96 ha/year, respectively. Followed by the reduction in dense forest with the mean annual rate of -228.27 ha/year. The NDVI minimum value showed a slight reduction from -0.09 in the year 2009 to -0.11 in the year 2018. The mean values are also decreased from 0.29 in 2009 to 0.16 in 2018. As indicated in the result of NDVI value, despite there is restoration, vegetation cover in general was reduced and the forests in particular were depleted from time to time.

TI  - Spatial-temporal analysis of net primary production (NPP) and its relationship with climatic factors in Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluctuations of the climate variables have increased in the recent years. These fluctuations are different in each climatic region. Net primary production (NPP) indicating the plant growth and carbon stabilization over period of time is influenced by these fluctuations. Investigation of the variations in the NPP and analysis of its relationship with the climatic and environmental variables can play a key role in determining the effects of fluctuations of climatic variables on the NPP. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in the NPP and its correlation with precipitation rate and temperature during 2000-2014 based on the annual NPP estimates determined by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and precipitation and temperature data of the synoptic stations in eight climate regions in Iran. The slope of variations in the NPP was calculated in these climatic regions, and then, the changes in the NPP trend at two confidence levels of 95 and 99% were investigated based on the pixel-based method using the Mann-Kendall test. The sensitivity of NPP to climatic variables of temperature and precipitation was also estimated by calculating the correlation. The results showed the significant spatial distribution of NPP in the whole region under study indicating a declining trend from north to south and from west to east directions. The results also indicated the nonlinear variations in the temporal distribution of NPP. The annual mean NPP was found to follow the climatic boundaries in the climatic regions except for climate region 2, and region with the higher annual mean precipitation had higher annual mean NPP. Analysis of the trend by the Mann-Kendall method revealed that 3.2% of the pixels in the whole region followed a certain trend. Among the pixels, 70% of them followed a negative trend and the remaining 30% followed a positive trend. The greatest number of pixels with a certain trend was found in the Gulf of Oman coast climate region so that 93% of the pixels had a positive trend. The lowest number of pixels with a certain trend was observed in eastern Alborz foothills so that 87% of the pixels showed a negative trend. Slope variations of the NPP in the whole region varied from - 35 to 46 gC m(2)year(-1). The eastern plateau had the highest negative slope variations among the climate regions, and the highest positive slope variation of 42% was observed in the highlands climate region. In general, the precipitation rate and temperature showed a mean partial coefficient of 0.22 and 0.02, respectively, and the correlation between the NPP and temperature and precipitation was different in each climatic region. The temperature was negatively correlated with the NPP in four climatic regions with higher annual mean temperatures and in other climatic regions; it had a weak positive correlation. Therefore, the sensitivity of NPP to precipitation and temperature was different in each climatic region.

TI  - Land cover/use change analysis and mapping of Borg El-Arab City, Egypt
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the essential steps for agricultural development planning is the recognition of land cover and land use LCLU classes and the associated changes with time, in which LCLU avails as one of the major input criteria. The North coastal region of Egypt is exposed to significant spatial and temporal changes in LCLU classes (urban, agriculture, and water bodies) that basically affect any kind of development programs. Borg El-Arab City represents a potential community and new industrial site for future development in the region. The supervised classification of Landsat satellite images and computation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are applied as effective tools in the study area to observe the LCLU changes. Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images were used and four images dated in 1986, 1999, 2006, and 2017 were selected. The area under consideration was classified into seven main classes ,e.g., Mediterranean Sea, salt marshes, agriculture, urban, bare land, swamps and wet land, and shoreline strip. The area was subjected to significant changes in the last three decades as a result of the reclamation projects growing and industrial effectiveness as well. Taking the whole period (1986-2017) into consideration, results show that the study area is exposed to a wide range of gain or loss in the area of different land cover classes, particularly in regard to the agriculture area, urban land, and bare land. The surface area of urban land, agriculture land, and water bodies increased on the expense of decreasing the bare land, where it lost 31.3%. The urban area expanded into much of the agricultural and the agricultural land expanded into bare land. In light of the recognized change causes, approach policy suggestions for better management of LCLU can be established.

TI  - Effects of temperature variability and extremes on spring phenology across the contiguous United States from 1982 to 2016
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Warming climate and its impact on vegetation phenological trends have been widely investigated. However, interannual variability in temperature is considerably large in recent decades, which is expected to trigger an increasing trend of variation in vegetation phenology. To explore the interannual phenological variation across the contiguous United States (CONUS), we first detected the onset of vegetation greenup using the time series of the daily two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) observed from the AVHRR Long-Term Data Record (1982-1999) and the MODIS Climate Modeling Grid (2000-2016). We then calculated the interannual variation in greenup onset during four decadal periods: 1982-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009 and 2010-2016. Further, the trend of interannual variation in greenup onset from 1982 to 2016 was analyzed at pixel and state levels. Extreme phenological events were also determined using a greenup onset anomaly for each pixel. Similar approaches were applied to spring temperatures to detect extreme years and to the temporal trend of interannual variation to explain the phenological variation. The results revealed that 62% of pixels show an increasing interannual variation in greenup onset, and in 44% of pixels, this variation could be explained by the temperature. Although extreme phenology occurred locally in different years, three nationwide extreme phenological years were distinguished. The extreme warm spring that occurred in 2012 resulted in the occurrence of greenup onset as much as 20 days earlier than normal in large parts of the CONUS. In contrast, greenup onset was much later (up to 30 days) in 1983 and 1996 due to cool spring temperatures. These findings suggest that interannual variation in spring phenology could be much stronger in the future in response to climate variation, which could have more significant impacts on terrestrial ecosystems than the regular long-term phenological trend.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study deals with the assessment of the spatial distribution of PM(2.5)over a decade in Jharkhand state of eastern India, which is a prominent site for mining and industries. Since there are very few monitoring stations on the ground to monitor the air quality of the entire state, satellite data have been utilised. The study period is from the year 2005 to 2016. The selection of the study period is based on the availability of satellite as well as ground station data. Multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was employed to predict the concentration of PM(2.5)spatially, and the results were compared with the help of Akaike information criterion to identify the better representative model. Results showed that the GWR model performed better in predicting the spatial distribution of PM2.5. PM(2.5)concentration of this state exceeds the permissible limit set by the world health organisation. The north-eastern districts of the state (29.36% of the total area) had exceeded even the Indian national ambient air quality standard. The identification of the possible reasons for high concentration was made through visual examination of satellite imageries over the study period. Also, possible health effects were discussed.

TI  - Impacts of satellite data assimilation with different model vertical levels on QPFs downstream of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements from various sounding instruments onboard polar-orbiting meteorological satellites quantify contributions to the total radiation at various microwave or infrared frequencies from different levels of the atmosphere. Satellite data assimilation adjusts model profiles of temperature and water vapor by minimizing the differences between observations and model simulations to search for the maximum likelihood estimate of the atmospheric states. The accuracy and precision of satellite data assimilations depend on the model vertical resolution. Sensitivity studies are carried out to compare the data assimilation and forecast results over a domain centered on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using three different model vertical resolutions: 43, 61, and 92 vertical levels from the surface to similar to 1 hPa. The NCEP Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis system and the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW) model are used with a domain size of 600 x 500 grid boxes at a 15-km horizontal resolution. It is shown that the ARW/GSI system with the coarsest (highest) model vertical resolution outperforms the remaining two for the 24-h short-range (48-h medium-range) quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) downstream of the TP. The satellite data assimilation at the highest model vertical resolution produced more significant positive impacts on the 36-h forecasts of a mid-tropospheric trough located to the northeast of the TP that lead to a localized precipitation event. Improvements in the QPFs with the 92-vertical-level configuration come mainly from the best match of rainfall distributions between observations and forecasts.

TI  - Vertical fluxes of nutrients enhanced by strong turbulence and phytoplankton bloom around the ocean ridge in the Luzon Strait
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Steep oceanic ridges and tidal currents in the Luzon Strait generate some of the world's strongest turbulent mixing. To evaluate the impacts of the turbulence intensity on the marine ecosystem, we carried out measurements of microstructure turbulence and biogeochemical hydrography along 21 degrees N in the Luzon Strait during the R/V Hakuho Maru cruise, KH-17-5-2, in November 2017. We found a turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate exceeding O(10(-7)) W kg(-1) and vertical eddy diffusivity exceeding O(10(-3)) m(2) s(-1), two orders of magnitude larger than those in the open ocean, above a shallow sub-ridge on the eastern ridge of the Luzon Strait. In addition, a clear chlorophyll a bloom was identified in the surface layer above the sub-ridge from in situ measurements and satellite observations. High values of nitrate (4.7 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)) and phosphate (0.33 mmol P m(-2) d(-1)) fluxes estimated near the base of the surface chlorophyll a bloom strongly suggest that enhanced turbulent mixing promotes nutrient supply to the euphotic zone and generates new production within the surface layer, contributing to the formation of a quasi-permanent local chlorophyll a bloom north of Itbayat Island on the eastern ridge.

TI  - Plant community diversity in the Chobe Enclave, Botswana: Insights for functional habitat heterogeneity for herbivores
T2  - KOEDOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise vegetation descriptions and maps are essential tools for the management of natural areas, as well as for understanding animal habitat use. The Chobe Enclave (CE), adjacent to the Chobe National Park and the Chobe Forest Reserve, forms a critical dry season range for many large herbivores. As a tool for future management and studies about wildlife habitat use and migration, this study proposed to describe the plant communities in the CE and to study their relationships with microtopography and soils. Plant species were inventoried in 82 sampling plots (40 x 20 m), covering the vegetation diversity recognised by an unsupervised classification (Landsat images, 30-m resolution). A hierarchical clustering classified the inventories in eight plant communities, mapped with a supervised classification. This study was conducted in parallel with a soil study. Soil variations and degree of flooding largely determine community composition. Floodplains along the Linyanti River and dambos (concentrating local run off from rainfall) provide reliable green forage for wildlife during the dry season. Adjacent to floodplains, riverine forests also maintain green browse and grazing well into the dry season. In drylands, vegetation is largely determined by soil texture. Forests dominated by Baikiaea plurijuga occupy the acidic, red sands in the east, while sandveld vegetation grows on deep sands in paleo-river channels. These habitats support dominant grasses, which provide important forage for grazers during the wet season. Finally, woodlands dominated by Colophospermum mopane, characterised by sodium-rich and alkaline soils, enable herbivores to meet their mineral requirements during reproduction.Conservation implications: Our soil and vegetation studies provide important insights into factors determining plant communities. Their diversity and close vicinity play a critical role in enabling herbivores to adapt to seasonal variations in forage quantity and quality. Results will enable researchers to gain insights into animal habitat seasonal use in the Chobe Enclave.

TI  - Modeling on approximation of fluvial landform change impact on morphodynamics at Madhumati River Basin in Bangladesh
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to investigate fluvial Landform characteristics and background causes of dynamic changes at Madhumati River Basin and to evaluate the impact of morphodynamics on the hydrology, agriculture systems, and ecosystems services and people livelihoods. To accomplish the research goal, the present study considered to evaluate bank line shifting, course change direction, change of channel patterns, change in channel width, rate of erosion, accretion and sedimentation, fluvial and floodplain landforms transformation, as well as hydrological dynamics. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal scale of morphological change were linked with drivers. For understanding the complex morphological process and response of the river, reliable historical time-series satellite images, and hydrological data were analyzed; as well as taking expert judgment and local knowledge into account. GIS and remote sensing (RS) tools, techniques and models were applied to process, analyze, and extract fluvial parameters from multitemporal Landsat satellite imagery. The results of the study demonstrate that erosion, accretion and historical migrated area significantly increased during the flooding period of 1988 and 1998 and that these hydromorphological hazards badly impacted on flood plain resources, agricultural systems, aquatic, and terrestrial biodiversity. Also, human interference, such as bridge construction and business purpose dredging badly impacted on the hydromorphological characteristics of this river. The results also reveal that Madhumati River had very low sinuosity in the time span 1973-2020. Gradually, the sinuosity value of this river is increasing over time. Sinuosity values of this river ranged between 0.98 (1973) and 1.11 (2020) with an average value 1.04 designating straight to sinuous nature. The scope of this research will suggest possible morphological adjustment for future management strategies of climate change, fluvial disasters, and develop resilience capability to the rural community.

TI  - Sex and sex-related differences in gamete development progression impinge on biomarker responsiveness in sentinel mussels
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In marine pollution monitoring, the biomarkers recorded in sentinel organisms are influenced by natural confounding factors that may jeopardise their interpretation. Among these confounding factors, little is known about the influence of sex along the annual reproductive cycle. The present investigation aims at contributing to understand how sex and sex-related differences in gamete development progression impinge on biomarker baseline values and on biomarker responsiveness to pollution in sentinel mussels. Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected from a relatively clean locality and from a chronically polluted site in the Basque Coast (Bay of Biscay) in January, April, August and November. Sex and gametogenesis stages were determined for each mussel. Tissue concentration of metals and PAHs was analysed. A battery of biomarkers was investigated: cylochrome coxidase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase enzyme activities; levels of protein carbonyls, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; lysosomal enlargement and membrane stability; intracellular neutral lipid accumulation; cell type composition and thinning of the digestive gland epithelium; and survival-in-air. Sex- and reproductive stage-related differences were found in bioaccumulation and in the values and responsiveness of most of the biomarkers. However, the patterns of sex-related differences were not consistent across all biomarkers. The differences in the biomarker responses between females and males also depended on the season, reflecting the progression of the gametogenesis cycle. Thus, selecting mussels of one specific sex does not seem to be a crucial requisite to carry out biomarker-based monitoring; yet, it is highly recommended to identify sex condition and gamete developmental stage of each mussel to test for the potentially confounding effects of sex, reproductive status and sex-related variability along the reproductive cycle.

TI  - Use of GRACE time-series data for estimating groundwater storage at small scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study integrates the time series of satellite data, i.e. (terrestrial water storage (TWS) extracted from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), soil moisture (SM) from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), rainfall from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)) within-situdata, i.e. (groundwater (GW) observatory well data and surface water (SW) as reservoir level from Tamil Nadu Public Work Department (TN PWD)) to estimate the water storage of the study area for the period from 2002 March to 2016 December. The study area encompasses three districts of Tamil Nadu State - Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. It was previously observed that the groundwater level in this study area is decreasing at an alarming rate. Trends and residuals of the times series of all the previously stated components were analyzed. Negative trends were observed in the case of Delta SW,Delta SM,Delta GW,Delta TWS-GRACE, but rainfall shows a slight positive trend. Rainfall, being the input for water storage, a marginal increase in rainfall cannot affect the variability of Delta SM,Delta SW,Delta GW and Delta TWS-GRACE.Delta TWS decreases approximately 0.12 cm yr(-1)averaged water level equal to a total volume -7.5 km(3). The result of this study shows a decrease in the total storage of groundwater in the study area during the study period from 2002 March to 2016 December. Seawater intrusion due to an increase in sea surface height also shows an impact on Delta TWS derived from grace, in the form of anomalously elevated Delta TWS. A good agreement between increment TWS-GRACE and increment TWS-in-situis found except where sea-water intrusion occurs.

TI  - A risk assessment method for remote sensing of cyanobacterial blooms in inland waters
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread occurrence of Cyanobacterial blooms (CABs) in inland waters is a typical and severe challenge for water resources management and environment protection. An accurate and spatially continuous risk assessment of CABs is critical for prediction and preparedness in advance. In this study, a multivariate integrated risk assessment (MIRA) method of CABs in inland waters was proposed. MIRA was simplified with the trophic levels, cyanobacterial and other aquatic plant condition using remote sensing indexes, including the Trophic State Index (TSI), Floating Algae Index (FM) and Cyanobacteria and Macrophytes Index (CMI). First, the dates of risk assessment were carefully selected based on TSI. Then, we obtained the trophic levels, cyanobacterial, and other aquatic plant condition of water using TSI, CMI and FM on the selected date, and further scored them pixel by pixel to quantify the risk value. Finally, the risk of CABs in water was accurately assessed based on the pixel risk value. Based on Landsat 8 OLI dataset, MIRA was executed and validated in three different lakes of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) with different trophic states. The results demonstrated that the risk of CABs in Lake LongGan was overall higher than that in Lake LiangZi and Lake FuTou. And the risk of CABs in the east part of Lake LongGan was higher than the other parts. Seasonally, the risk level ranking in Lake LiangZi was the highest in summer, while lowest in winter. However, the seasonal risk ranking was spring, summer, autumn, and winter in Lake LongGan. Based on the comparisons with monthly water quality classification data and results of the existing study, including trophic level. ecology risk, and algal extent, the MIRA method was valuable for accurate and spatially continuous identifying the risk of CABs in inland waters with potential eutrophication trends.

TI  - [Analysis of baseline characteristics and treatment status of hepatitis C in sentinel hospitals from 2017 to 2019].
T2  - Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the hepatitis C diagnosis type, progression and treatment in medical institutions. Methods: Monitoring posts were set up in the secondary and tertiary-level hospitals in some parts of the country. Reported infectious diseases cases of hepatitis C in sentinel hospitals during the three consecutive years from 2017 to 2019 were investigated to understand their general demographic characteristics, diagnosis, liver fibrosis degree, and treatment. The diagnosis, treatment and related factors were analyzed by chi square test and trend. Results: A total of 16 241 cases of hepatitis C were investigated in three years. Among them, 7 538 cases were clinically diagnosed (46.41%) and 8703 cases (53.59%) were confirmed as hepatitis C. Among the confirmed cases, 60 cases (0.69%) were acute and 8643 cases (99.31%) were chronic. In the past three years, the proportion of cases diagnosed by liver diseases related departments decreased from 62.23% to 40.01%, while the proportion of medical and surgical cases of non-liver diseases increased from less than 30% to nearly 60%. The proportion of confirmed cases in secondary hospitals (26.27%) was significantly lower than that in tertiary hospitals (62.48%), and the difference was statistically significant (chi (2) = 1594.833, P < 0.001). There were also differences in the proportion of confirmed cases in different regions (P < 0.001). The cases with FIB-4 > 3.25 accounted for 35.78%, and the proportion was increased significantly with age (chi (2) trend = 1159.624, P < 0.001). The average proportion of antiviral treatment was less than 10%, and the proportion of antiviral treatment in secondary hospitals was very low (2.13%); however, the proportion of liver-protective monotherapy treatment was decreased from 30.40% in 2017 to 11.14% in 2019, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The large-scale screening of hepatitis C by medical institutions is increasing year by year, but only about half of the cases can be diagnosed, and the diagnostic capacity of secondary hospitals is particularly unsatisfactory. Most of the confirmed cases are chronic hepatitis C, and more than one third of them have abnormal liver fibrosis indicators, and the proportion increases with age. The proportion of antiviral treatment for hepatitis C is lower in secondary than tertiary-level hospitals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to raise the attention of both parties (doctors and patients) to enhance diagnostic capabilities and expand the coverage of antiviral treatment for hepatitis C.
AB  - 目的： 了解医疗机构诊断的丙型肝炎（简称"丙肝"）病例的诊断类型、疾病进展及治疗等情况。 方法： 在全国部分地区的二、三级医院设立监测哨点，对在哨点医院2017-2019年连续3年就诊中传染病报告的丙肝病例进行调查，了解其一般人口学特征、丙肝诊断、肝纤维化程度及治疗等情况。采用chi(2)检验及chi(2)趋势检验对其诊断、治疗等情况及有关因素进行分析。 结果： 3年共调查丙肝病例16 241例，其中临床诊断病例7 538例（占46.41%），确诊丙肝病例8 703例（占53.59%）；确诊病例中，急性60例（占0.69%），慢性8 643例（占99.31%）。3年间肝病相关科室诊断病例的占比由62.23%下降至40.01%,而非肝病的内科及外科病例占比由不足30%提升至接近60%。二级医院确诊病例比例（26.27%）显著低于三级医院（62.48%），差异有统计学意义（chi(2) = 1 594.833，P < 0.001），不同地区确诊比例也存在差异（P值均< 0.001）。FIB-4 > 3.25的病例占35.78%，且该比例随年龄增加趋势明显（chi(2)(趋势)= 1 159.624，P < 0.001）。抗病毒治疗比例平均不足10%，二级医院抗病毒治疗比例极低（2.13%）；但单纯保肝治疗的比例从2017年的30.40%下降到2019年11.14%，差异有统计学意义（P < 0.001）。 结论： 医疗机构就诊人群丙肝筛查发现力度逐年增加，但仅半数左右病例可以确诊，二级医院确诊能力尤其不足。确诊病例中绝大多数为慢性丙肝病例，肝纤维化指标异常者超过1/3，且该比例随年龄增加。丙肝抗病毒治疗比例低，二级医院远低于三级医院。亟需提高医患双方对丙肝的重视，加强丙肝确诊能力，提高丙肝抗病毒治疗覆盖面。.

TI  - Hyperspectral field spectroscopy and SENTINEL-2 Multispectral data for minerals with high pollution potential content estimation and mapping
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining in Tunisia generates a large amount of tailings charged with toxic minerals. As these tailings have a wide spread distribution, it is important to characterize and estimate their impact on soil contamination.This study examines the potential of field hyperspectral spectroscopy and SENTINEL-2 Multispectral data in estimating and mapping seven minerals content, including three toxic minerals (fluorite, barite and sphalerite), within soils around Hammam Zriba mine in Northen Tunisia. 69 soil and dike surface samples were collected, field Visible, Near InfraRed (VNIR) and Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) reflectance spectra were measured on these surfaces. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) method was used to identify the types of mineral and their associated contents on each collected soil samples. The mineral contents were predicted using the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method using i) field VNIR-SWIR spectra at raw spectral resolution, ii) field VNIR-SWIR spectra aggregated to the SENTINEL-2 spectral resolution and then iii) SENTINEL-2 spectra.This study shows 1) an accurate prediction of four of the seven minerals using field VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy, 2) a slight decrease of performances due to spectral resolution degradation (SENTINEL-2 simulated spectra) and 3) a significant decrease of performances due to spatial resolution degradation, except for fluorite. This work paves the way for large-scale mapping of minerals with high pollution potential using SENTINEL-2 data. In addition, the high frequency of SENTINEL-2 data may be used to monitor the spatial distribution of some minerals with high pollution potential in soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Land Use-Land Cover Change and Its Relationships with the Groundwater Table and the Plants' Altitudinal Zones: A Case Study of Arsanjan County, Iran
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing dynamics in the land use-land cover change (LULCC) is an effective approach for analyzing alterations in the physical and natural features of the farmlands and rangelands. Fifteen Landsat images are utilized to perform the LULCC analysis over Arsanjan County, Iran, for the period of 1987-2017. After dividing the study area into five classes of NDVI, time series of the areas associated with these classes are constructed. The fitted trend lines showed that the extent of dense and moderate vegetation classes has an increasing or decreasing trend over the period of 1987-2003 or 2003-2017, respectively. By comparing trends in the extent of vegetated areas and groundwater table, the mentioned increasing or decreasing trends are attributed to the ever-increasing trends in the groundwater exploitation prior to and after 2003. The post-classification and NDVI differencing methods detect changes between 2003 and 2017. Compared to the NDVI differencing method, the accuracy coefficients are found greater for the post-classification approach. The decrease in the extent of cultivated and swampy lands is mostly counterbalanced by an increase in the areas of barren soils and poor vegetation classes. Application of the differencing method proved that the 2 center dot sigma and 0.5 center dot sigma levels are the appropriate thresholds for detecting changes in farmlands and rangelands, respectively. Compared to low-elevation farmlands, decline in the extent of vegetated-areas is much less for the high-elevation rangelands. The largest or smallest net decrease in highlands' vegetation was observed for the elevations between 1750 and 2000 or 2250 and 2500 m above mean sea level, respectively.

TI  - Recent trends in land-use and cover change and deforestation in south-west Nigeria
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and cover change reflects choices in natural resource governance. Despite heavy targets on the forest and woodland, the southwest Nigeria states have little quantitative information on the magnitude and direction of land-use change across the states. This drives unsustainable land management and deforestation. This study utilized vegetation sampling and enumeration, GIS mapping and analyses of base maps and multi-temporal Landsat imageries to generate current vegetation status and time-series land-use and cover change for the southwest Nigeria. The results suggest that the woody species density in the forest plots ranges from 512 to 1040/ha with mean density of about 770.67/ha and species diversity values range from 2.014 to 2.911. The woody species in the savanna woodland ranged from 624 to 1232/ha in density and species diversity varies between 1.189 and 2.737. Relatively fewer number of trees of larger diameter at breast height in forest and low number of species per family in savanna reflect the influence of selective forest logging and woodland degradation. The study area experienced a historical net deforestation rate of - 1.1% per annum between 1986 and 2016 with deforestation rate of the primary forest at - 3.3% between 1986 and 2016 and - 10% between 2006 and 2016. Savanna woodland grew 0.8% annually from 1986 to 2016. The states recorded net deforestation rate ranging from - 2.63 to - 7.41% between 2006 and 2016. Reforestation through exotic Teak and Gmelina plantation grew at 43% annually between 1986 and 2016.

TI  - On the cooling potential of irrigation to mitigate urban heat island
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban overheating is the most documented phenomenon of climate change, causing severe energy problems. The study aims to evaluate the mitigation potential of irrigation as a response to the urban overheating and heatwaves in large cities, using simulation-based techniques. Mesoscale simulations are conducted for a 32.5 km x 22.5 km metropolitan region of Sydney, Australia, and it is modelled based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500 m resolution land surface dataset. To better represent the Sydney metropolitan area, the New South Wales Land Zoning dataset is used to remap the land surface. The weather research forecast model (WRF) combined with the urban canopy model (UCM) is used as the simulation tool. The results show that a daily irrigation scheme results in a maximum daily temperature drop of approximately 1.3 degrees C and an average daily air temperature decrease close to 0.5 degrees C. It is also found that the cooling effect due to the additional irrigation is strongly correlated to the ambient temperature, urban fraction, and the soil moisture state before irrigation. The irrigation induced cooling effect tends to be higher in the urban areas where the soil is drier before irrigation, or in a larger portion of the area that is covered with vegetation, or where the ambient temperature is higher.

TI  - Postseismic deformation following the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake detected by ALOS-2/PALSAR-2
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - I have been conducting a study of postseismic deformation following the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 acquired till 2018. I apply ionospheric correction to interferograms of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2. L-band SAR gives us high coherence enough to reveal surface deformation even in vegetated or mountainous area for pairs of images acquired more than 2 years. Postseismic deformation following the Kumamoto earthquake exceeds 10 cm during 2 years at some spots in and around Kumamoto city and Aso caldera. Westward motion of similar to 6 cm/year was dominant on the southeast side of the Hinagu fault, while westward shift was detected on both sides of the Futagawa fault. The area of latter deformation seems to have correlation with distribution of pyroclastic flow deposits. Significant uplift was found around the eastern Futagawa fault and on the southwestern frank of Aso caldera, whose rate reaches 4 cm/year. There are sharp changes across several coseismic surface ruptures such as Futagawa, Hinagu, and Idenokuchi faults. Rapid subsidence between Futagawa and Idenokuchi faults also found. It is confirmed that local subsidence continued along the Suizenji fault, which newly appeared during the mainshock in Kumamoto City. Subsidence with westward shift of up to 4 cm/year was also found in Aso caldera. Time constant of postseismic decay ranges from 1 month to 600 days at selected points, but that postseismic deformation during the first epochs or two is dominant at point in the Kumamoto Plain. This result suggests multiple source of deformation. Westward motion around the Hinagu fault may be explained with right lateral afterslip on the shallow part of this fault. Subsidence along the Suizenji fault can be attributed to normal faulting on dipping westward. Deformation around the Hinagu and Idenokuchi faults cannot be explained with right lateral afterslip of Futagawa fault, which requires other sources. Deformation in northern part of Aso caldera might be the result of right lateral afterslip on a possible buried fault.

TI  - A modified trapezoid framework model for partitioning regional evapotranspiration
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - While evapotranspiration (ET) is normally measured as one hydrologic component, evaporation (E), and transpiration (T) result from different physical-biological processes. Using a two-source model, a trapezoid framework has been widely applied in recent years. The key to applying the trapezoid framework model is the determination of the dry/wet boundaries of the land surface temperature-fractional vegetation coverage trapezoid (LST-f(c)). Although algorithms have been developed to characterize the two boundaries, there remains a significant uncertainty near the wet boundary which scatters in a discrete and uneven manner. It is therefore difficult to precisely locate the wet boundary. To address this problem, a Wet Boundary Algorithm (WBA) was developed in this study with the algorithm applied in the region of Huang-Huai-Hai plain of China, using the Pixel Component Arranging and Comparing Algorithm (PCACA) to retrieve ET from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Data. The eddy covariance (EC) measurements from Yucheng station was used to verify the modified model where the root mean square error (RMSE) of 17.8 W/m(2), Bias of -7.2 W/m(2)for latent heat flux (LE) simulation in 28 cloudless test days. The ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET) varied between 0.48 and 0.81 over the Huang-Huai-Hai plain. The spatial and temporal distribution of ET revealed that agriculture practices have a significant influence on the hydrological cycle, where crop growth promotes the magnitude of ET. Likewise, harvesting activities significantly reduce ET. The proposed WBA algorithm significantly reduces the uncertainty of the trapezoid ET model caused by wet edge positioning. The analysis of the impact of agricultural activities on ET provide a better understanding how human activities change the hydrological cycle at regional scales.

TI  - The use of 2-, 5-, and 10-year probabilities to characterize fracture risk after a recent sentinel fracture
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in fracture risk associated with a recent fragility fracture is more appropriately captured using a 10-year fracture probability than 2- or 5-year probabilities. Introduction The recency of prior fractures affects subsequent fracture risk. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of a recent sentinel fracture, by site, on the 2-, 5-, and 10-year probability of fracture. Methods The study used data from the Reykjavik Study fracture register that documented prospectively all fractures at all skeletal sites in a large sample of the population of Iceland. Fracture probabilities were determined after a sentinel fracture (humeral, clinical vertebral, forearm and hip fracture) occurring within the previous 2 years and probabilities for a prior osteoporotic fracture irrespective of recency. The probability ratios were used to adjust fracture probabilities over a 2-, 5-, and 10-year time horizon. Results As expected, probabilities decreased with decreasing time horizon. Probability ratios varied according to age and the site of sentinel fracture. Probability ratios to adjust for a prior fracture within the previous 2 years were higher the shorter the time horizon, but the absolute increases in fracture probabilities were much reduced. Thus, fracture probabilities were substantially lower with time horizons less than 10 years. Conclusion The 10-year probability of fractures is the appropriate metric to capture the impact of the recency of sentinel fractures. The probability ratios provide adjustments to conventional FRAX estimates of fracture probability for recent sentinel fractures, adjustments which can readily inform clinical decision-making.

TI  - Summer season sea surface temperature changes in the Aegean Sea based on 30 years (1989-2019) of Landsat thermal infrared data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, sea surface temperature (SST) variability for the summer season in the Aegean Sea was analysed over a period of 30 years by using the Landsat thermal infrared bands. A total of 88 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 thermal infrared satellite images from June, July, and August were used for each year from 1989 to 2019. To estimate SST from the thermal infrared band data, thermal infrared sensor at-sensor spectral radiance, and thermal infrared sensor top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures were used. SST pixel values were extracted from thermal images for the 3-month summer season of each year. In order to validate the findings, regression analysis was performed between the Mediterranean Sea Ultra High Resolution SST L4 data and Landsat data for the 2008-2019 period. Regression constantR-squared values were found to be 0.9672 for June, 0.9550 for July, 0.9634 for August, and 0.9634 for all summer seasons. It was calculated that the minimum value of the average SST was 18.44 +/- 2.87 degrees C in 1992, and the maximum value of the average SST was 23.45 +/- 0.70 degrees C in 2018. According to the Landsat data, over the past 30 years, the annual average SST changes were estimated to be 0.11 degrees C, and the total changes of average SST were estimated to be 3.19 +/- 1.26 degrees C. As a result of the analysis and the validation, we can see that there is a rising trend in sea surface temperature in the Aegean Sea. However, it is difficult to determine whether this upward trend is related to global climate change.

TI  - Revisiting: "prevalence of and factors associated with sarcopenia among multi-ethnic ambulatory older Asians with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary care setting"
T2  - BMC GERIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSarcopenia is an age-related clinical syndrome characterized by loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle function. Diseases that contribute to sarcopenia include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and cancer and others. Fung FY et al. (BMC Geriatrics. 2019;19(1):122) conducted a single-center study aimed to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia among older patients with T2DM and to identify factors which mitigate sarcopenia. Their study entitled "Prevalence of and factors associated with sarcopenia among multi-ethnic ambulatory older Asians with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary care setting" suggested that the prevalence of sarcopenia in older patients with T2DM was 27.4%, and that Chinese ethnicity was associated with a greater risk of sarcopenia in the study population.DiscussionDeficiency in scientific research and analysis of other diseases associated with sarcopenia such as COPD, may contribute to misestimation of the prevalence of sarcopenia in older patients with T2DM. We are concerned that the conclusions of this single-center study with a small study population might be unreliable.SummaryThe prevalence of sarcopenia in older patients with T2DM in a single-center study with a small sample size may be misestimated due to the lack of strict exclusion criteria and detailed analysis of other diseases that contribute to sarcopenia. In addition, it is inappropriate to draw the conclusion that Chinese ethnic group was associated with a greater risk of sarcopenia among the study population.

TI  - Occurrence and genotypes of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp., <i>Giardia duodenalis</i>, and <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. in household, shelter, breeding, and pet market dogs in Guangzhou, southern China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, and Blastocystis sp. are common intestinal protozoans that infect humans and animals worldwide. A survey that assessed the prevalence, molecular characteristics, and zoonotic potential of these pathogens was conducted on a variety of dogs in Guangzhou, southern China. A total of 651 canine stool samples from household (n=199), shelter (n=149), breeding (n=237), and pet market dogs (n=66) were collected from eight districts in Guangzhou. Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, and Blastocystis sp. were detected by PCR amplification of the SSU rRNA gene. Giardia duodenalis-positive specimens were further assigned into assemblages using the glutamate dehydrogenase gene. Cryptosporidium spp., G. duodenalis, and Blastocystis sp. were found in 21 (3.2%), 20 (3.1%), and 35 (5.4%) samples, respectively. The overall prevalence of shelter dogs (40.28%, 60/149) was significantly higher than that of household (3.0%, 6/199), breeding (2.1%, 5/237), and pet market dogs (7.5%, 5/66) (chi (2)=154.72, df=3, P<0.001). Deworming in the past 12 months had a strong protective effect on the risk of contracting parasite infections (P<0.001). No significant differences were detected between age or sex groups (P>0.05). Dog-specific C. canis (n=19) and zoonotic C. parvum (n=2) were the only two Cryptosporidium species. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of three G. duodenalis assemblages: dog-specific assemblages D (n=14) and C (n=5), and cat-specific F (n=1). Zoonotic Blastocystis ST3 (n=28) was the dominant subtype, followed by ST1 (n=6) and ST10 (n=1). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale investigation on the occurrence and molecular characteristics of Blastocystis sp. in dogs in China. Our results indicated that the dogs seemed to play a negligible role as reservoirs for Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis transmission to humans, but they are potential novel suitable hosts of Blastocystis sp. A strict sentinel surveillance system of dogs should be established to minimise the zoonotic risk of spreading blastocystosis among humans and dogs.

TI  - Health-related quality of life outcomes for the LEAP study-CALGB 70305 (Alliance): A lymphedema prevention intervention trial for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymphedema is an adverse effect of breast cancer treatment that causes swelling and pain in the arm and hand. We tested 2 lymphedema prevention interventions and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a group-randomized trial at 38 cooperative group sites within the United States. Methods Patients were recruited before breast surgery. Sites were randomly assigned to education-only (EO) lymphedema prevention or education plus exercise and physical therapy (LEAP). Lymphedema was defined as a >= 10% difference in arm volume at any time from baseline to 18 months postsurgery. HRQOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast plus 4 lymphedema items (FACT-B+4). Longitudinal mixed model regression analysis, adjusting for key demographic and clinical variables, examined participants' HRQOL by intervention group and lymphedema status. Results A total of 547 patients (56% LEAP) were enrolled and completed HRQOL assessments. The results revealed no differences between the interventions in preventing lymphedema (P= .37) or HRQOL (FACT-B+4 total score;P= .8777). At 18 months, the presence of lymphedema was associated with HRQOL at borderline significance (P= .0825). However, African American patients reported greater lymphedema symptoms (P= .0002) and better emotional functioning (P= .0335) than patients of other races or ethnicities. Lower HRQOL during the intervention was associated with younger age (P <= .0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >0 (P= .0002), >= 1 positive lymph nodes (P= .0009), having no education beyond high school (P< .0001), having undergone chemotherapy (P= .0242), and having had only axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy versus both (P= .0007). Conclusion The tested interventions did not differ in preventing lymphedema or in HRQOL outcomes. African American women reported greater HRQOL impacts due to lymphedema symptoms than women of other races or ethnicities.

TI  - The challenge of reproducing remote sensing data from satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the context of management zones and precision agriculture
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the within-field variability of crop status is of great importance in precision agriculture, which seeks to balance agronomic inputs with spatial crop demands. Satellite imagery and the delineation of management zones based on remote sensing plays a key role. However, satellite imagery is dependent on a cloud-free view, which is especially challenging in temperate regions such as Northern Europe. This disadvantage can be overcome with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which provide an alternative to satellites. An investigation was conducted to establish whether UAV imagery can generate similar crop heterogeneity maps to satellites (Sentinel 2) and the extent to which crop heterogeneity and management zones can be reproduced by repeated data collection within short time intervals. Three winter wheat fields were monitored during the growing season. Two vegetation indices (NDVI and MSAVI2) based on red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance were calculated to delineate fields into five management zones based on NDVI raster maps using quintiles. The Pearson correlation coefficient, the Nash-Sutcliffe agreement coefficient and the smallest real difference coefficient (SRD), also called the reproducibility coefficient were used to evaluate the reproducibility. NDVI and MSAVI2 gave similar results, but NDVI was a slightly better descriptor of crop heterogeneity after canopy closure and NDVI was used for the remainder of the study. The results showed that substitution of satellite data with UAV data resulted in an average reclassification of 10 m by 10 m management zones corresponding to 58% of the total field area. Reclassification means that management pixels were classified differently according to origin of images. Repeated satellite and UAV imagery resulted in 39% and 47% reclassification, respectively. The results showed that the reproduction of remote sensing data with different sensor systems added more measurement error to measurements than was the case with repeated measurements using the same sensor systems. In this study, SRD averaged 2.5 management zones, which means that differences up to 2.5 management zones were within the measurement error. This paper discusses the practical aspects of these findings and clarifies that the reclassification of management zones is depending on the heterogeneity of the studied fields. Therefore, the achieved results may not be generalized but the presented methodology can be used in future studies.

TI  - Population Trends in All-Cause Mortality and Cause Specific-Death With Incident Atrial Fibrillation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Limited studies have evaluated population-level temporal trends in mortality and cause of death in patients with contemporary managed atrial fibrillation. This study reports the temporal trends in 1-year overall and cause-specific mortality in patients with incident atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with incident atrial fibrillation presenting to an emergency department or hospitalized in Ontario, Canada, were identified in population-level linked administrative databases that included data on vital statistics and cause of death. Temporal trends in 1-year all-cause and cause-specific mortality was determined for individuals identified between April 1, 2007 (fiscal year [FY] 2007) and March 31, 2016 (FY 2015). The study cohort consisted of 110 302 individuals, 69 +/- 15 years of age with a median congestive heart failure, hypertension, age (>= 75 years), diabetes mellitus, stroke (2 points), vascular disease, age (>= 65 years), sex category (female) score of 2.8. There was no significant decline in the adjusted 1-year all-cause mortality between the first and last years of the study period (adjusted mortality: FY 2007, 8.0%; FY 2015, 7.8%; P for trend=0.68). Noncardiovascular death accounted for 61% of all deaths; the adjusted 1-year noncardiovascular mortality rate rose from 4.5% in FY 2007 to 5.2% in FY 2015 (P for trend=0.007). In contrast, the 1-year cardiovascular mortality rate decreased from 3.5% in FY 2007 to 2.6% in FY 2015 (P for trend=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Overall 1-year all-cause mortality in individuals with incident atrial fibrillation has not improved despite a significant reduction in the rate of cardiovascular death. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing and managing concomitant noncardiovascular conditions in patients with atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in acral melanoma: A Korean single-center experience with 107 patients (2006-2018)
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of primary cutaneous melanoma as an important staging method has not been popularly undertaken in Korea and only a few studies with small patient numbers have been published. Aim: We examined the clinical feasibility and overall outcomes of SLNB in acral melanoma (AM) of Korean in Kyungpook National University Hospital (KNUH) over the past 13 years. Methods: SLNB in AM patients during 2006-2018 were analyzed retrospectively for sentinel lymph node (SLN) harvesting rate, positivity rate, positivity-relevant overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and its side effects. Results: A total of 109 AM patients who underwent SLNB were enrolled. Harvested nodes were identified from 107 patients and SLN harvesting rate was 98.2%. The mean Breslow thickness (+/- standard deviation) was 3.38 +/- 3.03 mm, and the proportion of ulcerated melanomas was 64%. Twenty-two (20.6%) had a tumor-positive SLN and, among them, 82% (18/22) underwent immediate complete lymph node dissection (CLND). The metastasis-positive nodal basin after CLND was detected in 16.7% of cases (3/18). Tumor-negative SLN cohorts showed significantly better OS and DFS than tumor-positive ones (P = 0.006 andP < 0.001 for each). Two side effects, one seroma and one lymphocele, were observed without major sequelae. Conclusion: SLNB, crucial management of melanoma, proved its efficacy to predict patients' prognosis and could be performed successfully and safely in Korean AM patients by interdisciplinary cooperation between dermatology and other surgical departments. SLN(-) showed significantly better OS and DFS than SLN(+). Significant risk factors for DFS were Breslow thickness, the presence of ulceration and the presence of SLN metastasis. SLNB should be encouraged in order to stage melanoma accurately and direct the proper management in Korean AM.

TI  - The role of sediment-induced light attenuation on primary production during Hurricane Gustav (2008)
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduced a sediment-induced light attenuation algorithm into a biogeochemical model of the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system. A fully coupled ocean-atmospheric-sediment-biogeochemical simulation was carried out to assess the impact of sediment-induced light attenuation on primary production in the northern Gulf of Mexico during the passage of Hurricane Gustav in 2008. When compared with model results without sediment-induced light attenuation, our new model showed a better agreement with satellite data on both the magnitude of nearshore chlorophyll concentration and the spatial distribution of offshore bloom. When Hurricane Gustav approached, resuspended sediment shifted the inner shelf ecosystem from a nutrient-limited one to a light-limited one. Only 1 week after Hurricane Gustav's landfall, accumulated nutrients and a favorable optical environment induced a posthurricane algal bloom in the top 20m of the water column, while the productivity in the lower water column was still light-limited due to slow-settling sediment. Corresponding with the elevated offshore NO3 flux (38.71 mmol Nm(-1) s(-1)) and decreased chlorophyll flux (43.10 mg m(-1) s(-1)), the outer shelf posthurricane bloom should have resulted from the cross-shelf nutrient supply instead of the lateral dispersed chlorophyll. Sensitivity tests indicated that sediment light attenuation efficiency affected primary production when sediment concentration was moderately high. Model uncertainties due to colored dissolved organic matter and parameterization of sediment-induced light attenuation are also discussed.

TI  - Assessing the relationship between ground levels of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) with coronavirus (COVID-19) in Milan, Italy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the correlation between the high level of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerated transmission and lethality, and surface air pollution in Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region in Italy. For January-April 2020 period, time series of daily average inhalable gaseous pollutants ozone (O-3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), together climate variables (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation rate, atmospheric pressure field and Planetary Boundary Layer) were analyzed. In spite of being considered primarily transmitted by indoor bioaerosols droplets and infected surfaces or direct human-to-human personal contacts, it seems that high levels of urban air pollution, and climate conditions have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. Exhibited positive correlations of ambient ozone levels and negative correlations of NO2 with the increased rates of COVID-19 infections (Total number, Daily New positive and Total Deaths cases), can be attributed to airborne bioaerosols distribution. The results show positive correlation of daily averaged O-3 with air temperature and inversely correlations with relative humidity and precipitation rates. Viral genome contains distinctive features, including a unique N-terminal fragment within the spike protein, which allows coronavirus attachment on ambient air pollutants. At this moment it is not clear if through airborne diffusion, in the presence of outdoor and indoor aerosols, this protein "spike" of the new COVID-19 is involved in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host during the highest nosocomial outbreak in some agglomerated industrialized urban areas like Milan is. Also, in spite of collected data for cold season (winter-early spring) period, when usually ozone levels have lower values than in summer, the findings of this study support possibility as O-3 can acts as a COVID-19 virus incubator. Being a novel pandemic coronavirus version, it might be ongoing during summer conditions associated with higher air temperatures, low relative humidity and precipitation levels. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Inversion and distribution of total suspended matter in water based on remote sensing images-A case study on Yuqiao Reservoir, China
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, Yuqiao Reservoir is taken as the research object. The total suspended matter (TSM) produced by the economic development in the upper reaches of the reservoir and its surrounding areas has brought great ecological harm to the safe operation of the reservoir. Satellite remote sensing technology provides a good way to obtain the temporal and spatial variation of TSM in the study area. Two field surveys were carried out in the Yuqiao Reservoir, a total of 44 sampling points collected in the two tests. The spectral data and concentration of TSM were obtained. We developed and validated a robust empirical model to estimate the concentration of TSM in the water of the Yuqiao Reservoir for the first time. The TSM distribution map of the Yuqiao Reservoir in 2013-2018 is retrieved based on Landsat 8 OLI images. This paper analyzes the spatial distribution characteristics of TSM concentration in the Yuqiao Reservoir for several years, as well as the interannual, seasonal, and monthly variation laws and development trends. The results show that the spatial distribution of TSM in Yuqiao Reservoir shows a decreasing trend from the periphery to the center; the interannual changes are mainly as follows: The annual change trend of TSM in Yuqiao Reservoir is not obvious; the seasonal changes are significant: the highest in summer (higher than 40 mg/L), the second in autumn, and the lowest in spring and winter (lower than 15 mg/L); and the monthly changes show regular fluctuations: In a year cycle, the concentration of TSM generally shows an inverted V-shaped trend; that is, TSM increases gradually from January to August and decreases gradually from August to December. The research results of this paper can be applied to other similar types of land water bodies, which will promote the wide application of Landsat 8 OLI images in the monitoring of TSM in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs in different regions across China, and provide data support for the scientific management of the safe operation of research areas. Practitioner pointsThe monitoring model of TSM in Yuqiao Reservoir was built for the first time. Temporal and spatial analysis of TSM concentration in Yuqiao Reservoir for the first time. The concentration of TSM is in Yuqiao Reservoir greatly affected by wind speed and precipitation.

TI  - Combing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series for invasive <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> mapping on Google Earth Engine: a case study in Zhangjiang Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most threatening invasive alien species to mangroves in China, Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) has broadly existed along the Chinese tropical and subtropical coasts. Monitoring S. alterniflora with remote sensing is urgent and requisite for scientific invasive plant control and management. However, given the spectral similarity between S. alterniflora and other wetland types, such as mud covered by algae and the optical image coverage gaps due to cloud and tidal inundation in coastal areas, accurate and timely mapping of S. alterniflora is challenging. Using the extended Jeffries-Matusita distance (J(Bh)), we first explored the best time window for detecting S. alterniflora with satellite data in Zhangjiang Estuary, Fujian, China. Then we presented a hierarchical classification framework to alleviate the spectral confusion problem, combining cost-free Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral image time series on the Google Earth Engine platform. Specifically, we integrated the inundation frequency map derived from the SAR time series, elevation, and slope criteria to calculate the potential areas of S. alterniflora and mangroves, then used the random-forest classification algorithm to identify S. alterniflora, and finally refined the classified map with a yearlong water mask. The optimal time windows of one month, two months, and three months identified by J(Bh) were January, November and January, and November, January, and August, respectively; we got the high classification accuracies with corresponding overall accuracies of 99.35%, 99.63%, and 99.63%, respectively. The results suggested classification accuracy could be improved with a wider temporal window, but would saturate with 3-month imagery. The generated 10-m mangrove and S. alterniflora maps of 2017 and 2018 clearly showed the relatively stable spatial pattern of mangroves and the rapid expansion of S. alterniflora. The thriving S. alterniflora in Zhangjiang Estuary suggests the necessity of high-frequency and large-scale monitoring of invasive species along the coastal estuaries of China. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Lymphatic Vessel on a Chip with Capability for Exposure to Cyclic Fluidic Flow
T2  - ACS APPLIED BIO MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lymphatic system is a complex organ system that is essential in regulating the development of host immune responses. Because of the complexity of the lymphatic system and the existence of few in vitro models that replicate human lymphatic vessels, there is a need for a primary cell-based lymphatic model that can provide a better understanding of the effects of flow parameters, therapeutics, and other stimuli on lymphatic vessel behavior. In this report, a fluidic device models the cyclical lymphatic flow under normal and disease conditions. The device utilizes a pumpless design, operating with gravitational forces to simulate normal conditions with a shear of 0.092 Pa (0.92 dyn/cm(2)) as well as disease conditions with an increased shear of (0.67 Pa, 6.7 dyn/cm(2)). The cyclical pumping present in lymphatic vessels is replicated by applying shear stress for a period of 10 s multiple times per minute. Primary human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) cultured in the device for 10 days produce less interleukin 8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) per cell than cells cultured under static conditions. The results are consistent with previously published in vivo measurements, indicating that the fluidic device mimics conditions for IL-8 and TNF-alpha expression well. Data obtained with the devices also indicate that primary HLECs proliferate faster under high-shear than under low-shear conditions.

TI  - The American Meritocracy Myth Stress: Scale Development and Initial Validation
T2  - COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop the American Meritocracy Myth Stress Scale (AMMSS), capable of assessing college students' psychological stress within the context of the pervasive myth of meritocracy. This psychological stress stems from the association between their perceptions of their own hard work and social class mobility. Underpinned by the social class worldview model-revised, American meritocracy myth stress is conceptualized as the psychological stress that individuals experience when disequilibrium exists between the dominant and pervasive meritocracy ideology and their efforts to climb the social ladder through hard work. Three substudies were conducted for exploratory factor analysis (Study 1: n = 887); confirmatory factor analysis, validity, and measurement invariance (Study 2: n = 903); and 2-week test-retest reliability (Study 3: n = 37). The results of these studies provide empirical support for the AMMSS. We discuss implications for practice, advocacy, training, and future research.

TI  - Classification of Clustered Snow Off Dates Over British Columbia, Canada, from Mean Sea Level Pressure
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmosphere-ocean teleconnections influence the accumulation and melt of snow in western Canada and can be useful in seasonal forecasting of snowmelt and runoff. Interannual variation in these atmosphere-ocean modes has been shown to influence the accumulation and melt of snow within British Columbia (BC), Canada. We investigate fall mean sea level pressure (MSLP) globally as a predictor of remotely sensed snowmelt dates within BC. We use the last day of continuous snow cover (SDoff) detected from time series satellite imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer for the hydrological years 2000-2018. It has been shown that SDoff is correlated with continuous snow duration and is also of interest to seasonal forecasters. Global MSLP from the Fifth major global reanalysis produced by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts was obtained over hydrological years 1979-2018. An S-mode (time versus location) principal component analysis was carried out on both datasets. The SDoff principal component scores were grouped using a k-means clustering routine. Using evolutionary feature selection, the subset of MSLP principal components that provided good linear discrimination of the SDoff clusters were found. We explore the atmospheric MSLP principal components that influence the timing of snowmelt over BC and use them to predict the SDoff clusters at a seasonal lead time.

TI  - Comparison of Aerosol Properties in the Korean Peninsula Between AERONET Version 2 and 3 Data Set
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the consistency and difference between AERONET version 2 and 3 data set in the Korean peninsula, we compared several aerosol optical properties for 12 Korean AERONET sites having at least 2-year measurement records. Generally, both version products have similar patterns, but we sometimes found a little regional difference. While the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is analogous between version 2 and 3, the version difference of single scattering albedo (SSA) is the largest. angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) and fine mode fraction (FMF) values are sometimes different in maritime conditions. Two AERONET sites in Seoul (Seoul_SNU and Yonsei_Univ) have some differences between version 2 and 3, probably related to the higher sensitivity of version 3 data to the fine mode particle. Since parameters revealing the aerosol radiative property (e.g., SSA) and size information (e.g., AE and FMF) show some version differences regionally, we compared the result of aerosol type classification using these parameters. As a result, we found that the version difference of aerosol size and radiative property can induce the different diagnosis of locally dominant aerosol types. In spite of these findings, consistency between version 2 and 3 is quite large. Thus, regional patterns of aerosol optical properties previously found based on AERONET version 2 look still valid in the Korean peninsula.

TI  - Modelling the impact of climate change on the distribution and abundance of tsetse in Northern Zimbabwe
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Climate change is predicted to impact the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Tsetse flies (Glossina) transmit species of Trypanosoma that cause human and animal African trypanosomiasis. A previous modelling study showed that temperature increases between 1990 and 2017 can explain the observed decline in abundance of tsetse at a single site in the Mana Pools National Park of Zimbabwe. Here, we apply a mechanistic model of tsetse population dynamics to predict how increases in temperature may have changed the distribution and relative abundance of Glossina pallidipes across northern Zimbabwe.Methods: Local weather station temperature measurements were previously used to fit the mechanistic model to longitudinal G. pallidipes catch data. To extend the use of the model, we converted MODIS land surface temperature to air temperature, compared the converted temperatures with available weather station data to confirm they aligned, and then re-fitted the mechanistic model using G. pallidipes catch data and air temperature estimates. We projected this fitted model across northern Zimbabwe, using simulations at a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution, between 2000 to 2016.Results: We produced estimates of relative changes in G. pallidipes mortality, larviposition, emergence rates and abundance, for northern Zimbabwe. Our model predicts decreasing tsetse populations within low elevation areas in response to increasing temperature trends during 2000-2016. Conversely, we show that high elevation areas (> 1000 m above sea level), previously considered too cold to sustain tsetse, may now be climatically suitable.Conclusions: To our knowledge, the results of this research represent the first regional-scale assessment of temperature related tsetse population dynamics, and the first high spatial-resolution estimates of this metric for northern Zimbabwe. Our results suggest that tsetse abundance may have declined across much of the Zambezi Valley in response to changing climatic conditions during the study period. Future research including empirical studies is planned to improve model accuracy and validate predictions for other field sites in Zimbabwe.

M3  - Article
AB  - One of the many faces of Islam in Indonesia is the abangan Muslims or the abangans. As one of the most populous Muslim groups in the country, it is important to know them. To understand Indonesian Islam or Muslims, one cannot overlook them. The article argues that, amid recent escalating Muslim-Christian tension in the country, this majority Muslim group can play a significant role in enhancing Muslim-Christian relations in the future, on account of their worldview that emphasizes and maintains cosmic harmony and balance of all existence. Their open and syncretic attitudes toward other religions may foster religious tolerance and coexistence. These are attested in the author's personal engagement with them. It is suggested that Christians be more inclusive toward them, but, at the same time, be critical in engaging their worldview. These attitudes are necessary for building a mutual and peaceful Muslim-Christian relationship in the region.

TI  - Space and time variability of meteorological drought in Syria
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the spatial and temporal characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity, spatial extent) of meteorological drought in Syria. Specifically, drought was characterized using the observed rainfall data from 36 rain gauges spanning the period between 1990 and 2010 and covering the main climatic regions in Syria (i.e., Mediterranean, arid, semiarid and mountainous). Meteorological drought was assessed using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) at 12-month timescale, allowing for detecting the impacts of climate variability on agricultural droughts. The dominant modes of drought were defined using an S-mode of the principal component analysis. To assess the links between meteorological drought evolution and vegetation greening in Syria, the time series of SPI were correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Time series of NDVI were retrieved from the remotely sensed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (NOAA/AVHRR) sensor at a spatial resolution of 25 km for the common period 1990-2010. Trend analysis suggests a statistically significant increase in the frequency and intensity of drought at 12-month timescale. The observed intensification of meteorological drought is mostly associated with the increase in mild and moderate droughts, relative to extremes and very extreme droughts. Results also suggest a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in vegetation greening over Syria during the study period, especially in the eastern parts of the country. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in vegetation cover can directly be linked to the anomalous drought events, with Pearson' r coefficients generally above 0.6. This dependency was more highlighted during wintertime for the Mediterranean vegetation and in northeastern portions of the country. Overall, the increase in the frequency and intensity of meteorological drought, combined with a series of unrest and political instability, have drastic impacts on the agricultural sector in Syria, with serious implications for crop yield.

TI  - Riparian and in-channel habitat properties linked to dragonfly emergence
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In freshwater ecosystems, habitat alteration contributes directly to biodiversity loss. Dragonflies are sentinel species that are key invertebrate predators in both aquatic (as larvae) and terrestrial ecosystems (as adults). Understanding the habitat factors affecting dragonfly emergence can inform management practices to conserve habitats supporting these species and the functions they perform. Transitioning from larvae to adults, dragonflies leave behind larval exoskeletons (exuviae), which reveal information about the emergent population without the need for sacrificing living organisms. Capitalizing on Atlantic Canada's largest freshwater wetland, the Grand Lake Meadows (GLM) and the associated Saint John/Wolastoq River (SJWR), we studied the spatial (i.e., across the mainstem, tributary, and wetland sites) and temporal (across 3 years) variation in assemblages of emergent dragonflies (Anisoptera) and assessed the relative contribution of aquatic and terrestrial factors structuring these assemblages. The GLM complex, including the lotic SJWR and its tributaries and associated lentic wetlands, provided a range of riparian and aquatic habitat variability ideal for studying dragonfly emergence patterns across a relatively homogenous climatic region. Emergent dragonfly responses were associated with spatial, but not temporal, variation. Additionally, dragonfly communities were associated with both aquatic and terrestrial factors, while diversity was primarily associated with terrestrial factors. Specific terrestrial factors associated with the emergence of the dragonfly community included canopy cover and slope, while aquatic factors included water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and baseflow. Our results indicate that management of river habitats for dragonfly conservation should incorporate riparian habitat protection while maintaining aquatic habitat and habitat quality.

TI  - A New Approach for Dust Storm Detection Using MODIS Data
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms which are considered as a cause of climatic and public health concerns are induced by natural and anthropogenic activities. In this paper, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images, a new algorithm is developed to automatically detect dust storms over water body and land surfaces. The proposed method applies two different strategies for dust storm detection over water and land surfaces through the combination of various dust indices extracted from reflectance and thermal MODIS channels. It overcomes the disadvantages of previously developed algorithms taking into account the MODIS spectral band 7 (2105-2155 nm) to discriminate between dark and bright land surfaces. Different newly defined dust indices using proper thresholds are then employed for dust storm detection over two land surface classes as well as the water body. The proposed algorithm is applied to six dust-contaminated MODIS images covering southwestern Iran, northeastern Saudi Arabia, and southeastern Iraq. The results show that the proposed dust storm detection method performs well over areas covering features such as bright land surfaces and clouds whose spectral behavior is similar to that of the dust plumes. The results are compared to those obtained from two widely used previously developed dust storm detection algorithms. The comparison of the results with those achieved from visual inspections demonstrates that the proposed method detects the dust storm with the accuracy of similar to 95%, whereas the other two methods result in the dust detection accuracies of similar to 69% and similar to 68%. Furthermore, the proposed approach is found to be promising for dust storm detection over the study area.

TI  - Geospatial applications in delineating groundwater prospect zones in a hard rock terrain: an integrated approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study involved the application of geospatial techniques to delineate groundwater potential zones in a hard rock terrain of Oban Massif and environs. This goal was achieved using satellite remote sensing imagery and geographic information system techniques. The method mapped groundwater-controlling factors such as geology, geomorphology, lineament density, slope, land use and land cover and drainage density. The study covered a total area of 677,298 km(2). Landsat ETM(+)imagery, Shuttle Radar Transmission Mission (SRTM), topographic and geological maps and ASTER DEM were used in the analysis. Software used for image processing, digitizing and lineament density computation are ArcGIS10.1, ENVI 4.2 and PCI Geomatica, respectively. Supervised classification method was applied in land use and land cover mapping. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that band 4 was the best for showing textural features for lineament extraction. The method of multi-criteria evaluation by assigning relative weights to each groundwater-controlling factor was used to produce their corresponding thematic maps. The thematic maps were produced by weighted linear combination; each class individual weight was multiplied by the map scores and then adding the results. Overlay analysis of the thematic maps produced the groundwater potential map. Results show four groundwater prospect zones classified into very good (38,365 km(2)), moderately good (230,999 km(2)), fair (381,865 km(2)) and poor (26,068 km(2)). From this study, it is evident that lineament mapping is not the overriding factor in groundwater occurrence; other groundwater controlling factors are necessary for a more credible groundwater potential modeling. Lineament, slope, geology and geomorphology are the most influential groundwater controlling factors in the study. Comparison of the results of this study with the collected sample data shows reasonable accuracy. These findings are useful for borehole siting and environmental management strategies for groundwater potential investigation in both Nigeria and other parts of world.

TI  - The construction of awe in science communication
T2  - PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Awe is a frequently represented and commonly experienced emotion in science communication. According to a popular account of this emotion, awe is an innate and universal human affective experience that occurs when a person evaluates a target as vast, forcing a shift in their worldview. This shift is portrayed in science communication as resulting in an enhanced interest in the scientific material at hand. Based on the latest research in affective science, however, we challenge this narrow version of awe in science communication and instead advocate a broader account of this emotion in line with a constructionist perspective. We argue that there are a variety of awe types in science communication, each with different forms and functions in relation to the mandates within the multiplicity of contexts in this cultural space. We also contend that people's awe experiences result from their previous interactions with this emotion and the unique affordances provided by the science communication situation.

TI  - Improved NDVI based proxy leaf-fall indicator to assess rainfall sensitivity of deciduousness in the central Indian forests through remote sensing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the leaf-fall dynamics in the tropical deciduous forest will help in modeling regional energy balance and nutrient recycle pattern, but the traditional ground-based leaf-fall enumeration is a tedious and geographically limited approach. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable spatial proxy leaf-fall (i.e., deciduousness) indicator. In this context, this study attempted to improve the existing deciduousness metric using time-series NDVI data (MOD13Q1; 250 m; 16 days interval) and investigated its spatio-temporal variability and sensitivity to rainfall anomalies across the central Indian tropical forest over 18 years (2001-2018). The study also analysed the magnitude of deciduousness during extreme (i.e., dry and wet) and normal rainfall years, and compared its variability with the old metric. The improved NDVI based deciduousness metric performed satisfactorily, as its observed variations were in tandem with ground observations in different forest types, and for different pheno-classes. This is the first kind of study in India revealing the spatio-temporal character of leaf-fall in different ecoregions, elevation gradients and vegetation fraction.

TI  - To Evaluate the Accuracy of Axillary Staging Using Ultrasound and Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (USG-FNAC) in Early Breast Cancer Patients-a Prospective Study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In breast cancer, axillary lymph node involvement directly impacts the patient survival and prognosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a procedure of choice for axillary staging in early breast cancer. Currently, management options for axilla management are axillary lymph node dissection and sentinel node biopsy in node positive and in node negative respectively. Accuracy of current clinical methods for evaluating axilla is low. Hence, to select patients for appropriate procedure, ultrasound (USG) combined with fine-needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC) using vascular pedicle-based nodal mapping method is emerging as a good tool to address above issues. We evaluated the feasibility of ultrasound and needle aspiration cytology in a tertiary care center. All early breast cancer patients with clinically node-negative axilla and having palpable nodes with less than or equal to 5 cm tumor size in breast were screened by ultrasound of axilla to categorize the nodes as suspicious or non-suspicious based on radiological features and vascular pedicle-based nodal mapping method of axilla. Patients having suspicious nodes underwent ultrasound of axilla and needle aspiration; if found positive, patient underwent axillary node dissection. Sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) performed in all patients found negative on needle aspiration and in all patients having non-suspicious nodes on ultrasound axilla. Final histopathology was taken as gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for ultrasound (USG) and ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (USG-FNAC). A total of 100 patients were included in which 58 had non-suspicious and 42 had suspicious nodes on ultrasound of axilla. Among suspicious group, 24 were positive on ultrasound-guided needle aspiration cytology and 18 were negative. In non-suspicious nodes, sentinel node biopsy was performed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for ultrasound were 61.5%, 75.6%, 69.5%, and 68.5% respectively. For ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (USG-FNAC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value are 83%, 100%, 100%, and 72.6% respectively. The accuracy of ultrasound (USG) and ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (USG-FNAC) was 69% and 88.1%. The result of our study indicates the feasibility of USG and USG-FNAC in a high-volume center with good accuracy of around 70-80%. Approximately one-fourth (24%) of the total patients were taken up for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) without performing SLNB.

TI  - Evaluating Drought Impact on Postfire Recovery of Chaparral Across Southern California
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chaparral shrubs in southern California may be vulnerable to frequent fire and severe drought. Drought may diminish postfire recovery or worsen impact of short-interval fires. Field-based studies have not shown the extent and magnitude of drought effects on recovery, which may vary among chaparral types and climatic zones. We tracked regional patterns of shrub cover based on June-solstice Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index series, compared between the periods 1984-1989 and 2014-2018. High spatial resolution ortho-imagery was used to map shrub cover in distributed sample plots, to empirically constrain the Landsat-based estimates of mature-stage lateral canopy recovery. We evaluated precipitation, climatic water deficit (CWD), and Palmer Drought Severity Index in summer and wet seasons preceding and following fire, as regional predictors of recovery in 982 locations between the Pacific Coast and inland deserts. Wet-season CWD was the strongest drought-metric predictor of recovery, contributing 34-43% of explanatory power in multivariate regressions (R-2 = 0.16-0.42). Limited recovery linked to drought was most prevalent in transmontane chamise chaparral; impacts were minor in montane areas, and in mixed and montane chaparral types. Elevation was correlated negatively to recovery of transmontane chamise; this may imply acute drought sensitivity in resprouts which predominate seedlings at higher elevations. Landsat Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (sensitive to live-fuel moisture) was evaluated as a landscape-scale predictor of recovery and explained the greatest amount of variance in a multivariate regression (R-2 = 0.53). We find that drought severity was more closely related to recovery differences among twice-burned sites than was fire-return interval. Summarily, drought has a major role in long-term shrub cover reduction within xeric chaparral ecotones bounding the Mojave Desert and Colorado Desert, likely in tandem with other global change stressors.

TI  - MRI-based predictive factors of axillary lymph node status in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in combination with conventional MRI in predicting metastatic axillary lymph nodes (ALN) in breast cancer (BC). We reviewed pathological findings and clinical breast MRI examinations of 169 patients with invasive BC who were evaluated at the Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital in 2009-2015. Morphological parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were compared with pathological nodal status. Independentt-test/chi-square test and a Pearson correlation analysis were used. With pathological diagnosis as reference, MRI-based interpretations were 87.5% specific and 70.3% sensitive. On conventional MRI, the round shape of lymph nodes (LNs), loss of fatty hilum, irregular margins and hypo-intensity/heterogeneous intensity on T2-weighted sequence were statistically significantly different between metastatic and nonmetastatic groups (P < .001, each). Mean size of metastatic ALN was larger compared with negative ALN (13.9 mm vs. 10.9 mm,P < .001). LNs >= 12 mm were associated with higher risk of metastasis (P < .001). ADC value was not significantly different between both groups (P = .862). Conventional MRI using the ALN shape, signal intensity in T2-weighted sequences, loss of fatty hilum, regularity of the margins and size of the LNs can evaluate the axilla with high specificity. ADC value could not be used as a reliable parameter.

TI  - Assessment of urban sprawl using landscape metrics and Shannon's entropy model approach in town level of Barrackpore sub-divisional region, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A city has expanded from the core to peripheral areas through the growth of urbanization process and based on criteria, such as economic development, social, political forces as well as morphological characteristics. Due to increases in the population and anthropogenic activities in a city, the spatial boundary has also extended to provide accommodation along with the fringe areas that lead to fragmentation of urban morphology and influence the local ecology. From the historical past to present conditions and future predictions of urban growth would be able to visualize by space-borne remote sensing techniques to plan the appropriate infrastructure of the city. The present study analyzed the spatio-temporal land-use patterns in the town level in the Barrackpore sub-division area of West Bengal, which has become very compact urban areas in the eastern zone of the country. The spatial assessment of the urban growth pattern of 16 municipalities has been analyzed using remotely sensed data for the year of 1972, 2001 and 2016 with the spatial landscape metrics approach and Shannon's entropy model. The overall scenario of land use changes reveals that the non-urban areas (vegetation, agriculture, wetland and water bodies) have been decreasing, on the other hand, built-up areas are increasing during the decades. Spatial landscape metrics indicate the nature of the fragmentation of the urban landscape, compactness of the towns and provided the intensity about the sprawl characteristics. The results show that the whole urban landscapes of every town are aggregating into a large patch in the recent years (2016) as compared to the past years. The fragmentation of landscape into small patches happened from 1972 to 2001 on a large scale that indicates sprawl; the conversion of small patches to large single urban patches can be seen from 2001 to 2016 pointed out the maximally aggregation of town which would affect the ecological environment. Shannon's entropy model was applied to understand the level of urban growth at every corner of municipalities by the zoning of each town. The value of Shannon's model confirms the dispersed random urbanization in the outskirt of the towns. The spatio-temporal urban sprawl monitoring through these two methods would help the towns' administration, planners to manage and take better planning to build sustainability for livelihood.

TI  - Peatland leaf-area index and biomass estimation with ultra-high resolution remote sensing
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in key vegetation properties including leaf-area index (LAI) and biomass in treeless northern peatlands, and hyperspectral drone data with high spatial and spectral resolution could detect the spatial patterns with high accuracy. However, the advantage of hyperspectral drone data has not been tested in a multi-source remote sensing approach (i.e. inclusion of multiple different remote sensing datatypes); and overall, sub-meter-level leaf-area index (LAI) and biomass maps have largely been absent. We evaluated the detectability of LAI and biomass patterns at a northern boreal fen (Halssiaapa) in northern Finland with multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data and assessed the benefit of hyperspectral drone data. We measured vascular plant percentage cover and height as well as moss cover in 140 field plots and connected the structural information to measured aboveground vascular LAI and biomass and moss biomass with linear regressions. We predicted both total and plant functional type (PFT) specific LAI and biomass patterns with random forests regressions with predictors including RGB and hyperspectral drone (28 bands in a spectral range of 500-900 nm), aerial and satellite imagery as well as topography and vegetation height information derived from structure-from-motion drone photogrammetry and aerial lidar data. The modeling performance was between moderate and good for total LAI and biomass (mean explained variance between 49.8 and 66.5%) and variable for PFTs (0.3-61.6%). Hyperspectral data increased model performance in most of the regressions, usually relatively little, but in some of the regressions, the inclusion of hyperspectral data even decreased model performance (change in mean explained variance between -14.5 and 9.1%-points). The most important features in regressions included drone topography, vegetation height, hyperspectral and RGB features. The spatial patterns and landscape estimates of LAI and biomass were quite similar in regressions with or without hyperspectral data, in particular for moss and total biomass. The results suggest that the fine-scale spatial patterns of peatland LAI and biomass can be detected with multi-source remote sensing data, vegetation mapping should include both spectral and topographic predictors at sub-meter-level spatial resolution and that hyperspectral imagery gives only slight benefits.

TI  - Small water bodies mapped from Sentinel-2 MSI (MultiSpectral Imager) imagery with higher accuracy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Small water bodies have always been an important part of water ecology systems. In the past, due to the limitations of satellite spatial resolution and recognition method precision, there have been few satisfactory remote sensing small water bodies extraction methods. In this article, a method based on index composition and HSI (hue, saturation, and intensity) colour space transformation is proposed to precisely extract small water bodies. An easy-to-deploy, fast, universal, and effective algorithm is used to accurately identify paddy fields and exclude shadows. This method is tested and verified with Sentinel-2 MSI (MultiSpectral Imager) images in seven cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Compared with the traditional modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and enhanced water index (EWI) water extraction methods, the proposed HSI method has shown a better performance in small water bodies mapping with a kappa coefficient of 0.94, overall accuracy of 97%, producer's accuracy of 96%, and user's accuracy of 98% in test regions, which is significantly higher than the benchmarking water extraction methods. It provides a powerful supplement for the remote sensing monitoring of water resources in surface water bodies. The method proposed in this study exhibits extendibility, it also has the potential to extract other small features with minor modifications of the method.

TI  - Variability in glacier albedo and links to annual mass balance for the gardens of Eden and Allah, Southern Alps, New Zealand
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The gardens of Eden and Allah (GoEA) are two of New Zealand's largest ice fields. However, their remote location and protected conservation status have limited access and complicated monitoring and research efforts. To improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal changes in mass balance of these unique ice fields, observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors are used to monitor annual minimum glacier-wide albedo ((alpha) over bar (min)(yr)) over the period 2000-2018. The (alpha) over bar (min)(yr) for 12 individual glaciers ranges between 0.42 and 0.70 and can occur as early as mid-January and as late as the end of April. The evolution of the timing of indicates a shift to later in the summer over the 19-year period on 10 of the 12 glaciers. However, there is only a weak relationship between the delay in timing and the magnitude of a (alpha) over bar (min)(yr), which implies that albedo is not necessarily lower if it is delayed. The largest negative departures in (alpha) over bar (min)(yr) (lower-than-average albedo) are consistent with high snowline altitudes (SLAB) relative to the long-term average as determined from the End of Summer Snowline (EOSS) survey, which has been the benchmark for monitoring glaciers in the Southern Alps for over 40 years. While the record of (alpha) over bar (min)(yr) for Vertebrae Col 25, an index Yr glacier of the EOSS survey and one of the GoEA glaciers, explains less than half of the variability observed in the corresponding EOSS SLA (R-2 = 0.43, p = 0.003), the relationship is stronger when compared to other GoEA glaciers. Angel Glacier has the strongest relationship with EOSS observations at Vertebrae Col 25, accounting for 69 % of its variance (p < 0.001). A key advantage in using the <(alpha)over bar>(min)(yr) approach is that it enables variability in the response of individual glaciers to be explored, revealing that topographic setting plays a key role in addition to the regional climate signal. The observed variability in individual glacier response at the scale of the GoEA contrasts with the high consistency of responses found by the EOSS record across the Southern Alps and challenges the suggestion that New Zealand glaciers behave as a unified climatic unit. MODIS imagery acquired from the Terra and Aqua platforms also provides insights about the spatial and temporal variability in clouds. The frequency of clouds in pixels west of the Main Divide is as high as 90 % during summer months and reaches a minimum of 35 % in some locations in winter. These complex cloud interactions deserve further attention as they are likely a contributing factor in controlling the spatial and temporal variability in glacier response observed in the GoEA.

TI  - Remote estimation of total phosphorus concentration in the Taihu Lake using a semi-analytical model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is a severe environmental problem in the most inland lakes. Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater lake in China, is one of the most eutrophic lakes. Increased phosphorus concentration is thought to be the primary cause of water eutrophication. Proper total phosphorus (TP) monitoring is essential to effectively manage eutrophication in the Taihu Lake. In this study, 216 sample points with 172 modelling points and 44 verification points acquired from 5 field experiments in Taihu Lake, a semi-analytical model was established for estimating the TP concentration based on the absorption coefficient, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as 16.8% and 0.04 mg L-1, respectively. The application of the model on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data proved the suitability of the model for satellite image with the MAPE and RMSE as 28.56% and 0.05 mg L-1. The OLCI derived TP concentration in the Taihu Lake shown the unique temporal and spatial distribution: TP concentration in Zhushan Bay, Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay, and the western coastal regions was significantly higher than the eastern, the southern, and the centre areas. The concentration of TP in Taihu Lake was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. Furthermore, the versatility of this method was validated by applying in the Hongze Lake and Qiandao Lake, which is a water body dominated by inorganic suspended matter and a clean water body in China with the MAPE and RMSE as 24.10%, 19.35% and 0.004 mg L-1, 0.014 mg L-1. The results of this study could provide a reference for future remote sensing estimation of TP concentration and inland water eutrophication researches.

TI  - A new mathematical formulation for remote sensing of soil moisture based on the Red-NIR space
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing of earth surface processes commonly relies on the red, green, blue (RGB), near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) electromagnetic bands. Most of the optical sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites provide the RGB and NIR bands, but only a few offer SWIR output. The Red-NIR reflectance space has been widely applied for remote sensing of various land surface variables including soil moisture. The linear relationship between the Red-NIR reflectance of bare soil is established as the base and then moisture isolines are assumed perpendicular to the soil line. In this study, we show that this assumption is not consistent with the actual Red-NIR space geometry, which in many cases introduces soil moisture estimation errors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new mathematical transformation to the original Red-NIR space followed by newly defined soil moisture isolines that are more consistent with the actual observations. This new Transformed Red-NIR (TRN) model is compared with the Conventional Red-NIR (CRN) model using data from a sugarcane field located in southwestern Iran. Twelve Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat)-8 images were acquired during the sugarcane growth season. For validation of the remotely sensed data, ground reference soil moisture was determined at 22 locations at five different depths via core sampling and oven-drying. Our results indicate that the TRN model significantly improves the accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture.

TI  - Can we avoid axillary lymph node dissection in N2 breast cancer patients with chemo-sensitive tumours such as HER2 and TNBC?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To find a group of cN2 patients or patients with high axillary burden who become ypN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and who may benefit from avoiding a lymphadenectomy. Methods A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted with 221 clinically staged N2 patients or patients with at least 3 suspicious lymph nodes found by ultrasound at diagnosis. The predictive factors for ypN0 analysed were age, MRI-determined tumour size, histological subtype, the Nottingham histologic grade, surrogate molecular subtype, ki-67 and vascular invasion when present. Clinical and radiological responses after NACT were also evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses by logistic regression were performed. Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was calculated in relation to the status of the axillary lymph nodes after NACT. Results After NACT, 89 patients (40.3%) had axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) (ypN0) and 132 (59.7%) had residual axillary disease (ypN+). Molecular surrogate subtype, Ki-67 expression, and the clinical and radiological responses to NACT were the only independent factors associated with ypN0. Axillary pCR was observed more often in HER2-positive and triple-negative tumours than in luminal ones (OR 7.5 and 3.6, respectively). DDFS was 88.7% (95% CI 80.7-96.7%) for ypN0 and 56.2% (95% CI 32.1-80.3%) for ypN+ (p= 0.09). Conclusions In HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer patients staged as cN2 or with high axillary burden before NACT, a sentinel lymph node biopsy after NACT could be recommended if there is a clinical and radiological response.

TI  - Mapping plastic-mulched farmland by coupling optical and synthetic aperture radar remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic Mulching (PM) is criticized for causing environmental problems in spite of the benefits to increase crop yield. Accurate map of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) is demanded to monitor the usage of plastic mulches and to mitigate its environmental damages. However, mapping PMF with remote sensing data over large scale is still technically challenging due to its variable spectral characteristic. This paper proposed a Random Forest (RF) workflow to map PMF by coupling multi-resource satellite observations, including high- and medium- resolution optical imageries and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries. Under the context of two typical PMF regions, Jizhou and Guyuan, China, we test the performance of the proposed method. Results indicated that coupling optical and SAR remote sensing data improved the mapping accuracy significantly. There were different strategies for optimal data coupling. Coupling of three data, which are the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) data, Landsat-8 data and Radarsat-2 data, generated the highest mapping accuracy. Besides, coupling the GF-1 data with SAR data produced better accuracy than coupling the Landsat-8 data with SAR data. Compared with the accuracies derived from the coupling of two data (such as coupling GF-1 data with Radarsat-2 data and coupling Landsat-8 data with Radarsat-2 data), coupling the three data improved the overall accuracies by 0.39 to 4.93%. Compared with the mapping accuracy produced from Radarsat-2 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling increased by 20.96 and 26.06%, respectively, in Jizhou and Guyuan. When compared with the mapping accuracy of GF-1 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling improved by 4.77% both in Jizhou and Guyuan. In general, contribution of optical remote sensing data was greater than that of SAR data for mapping PMF. Whereas, the SAR data also made great contribution to improve the mapping accuracy of PMF.

TI  - Multiple-feature-driven co-training method for crop mapping based on remote sensing time series imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing time series imagery (RSTSI) provides a useful tool for crop mapping, as it provides crucial spectral, temporal, and spatial (STS) features. However, its high dimensionality coupled with the limited number of training samples leads to an ill-posed classification problem and the Hughes phenomenon. To solve this problem, this study presents a multiple-feature-driven co-training method (MFDC) for accurately mapping crop types based on RSTSI with a limited number of training samples. In MFDC, four complementary pre-defined views, which represent STS features, are generated for the utilization of multiple features. Then, to enhance the classifier's generalization ability, a novel labelled sample augmentation method that combines the Breaking Tiles algorithm and co-training is proposed. Third, to ensure the effectiveness of ensemble learning in co-training as well as to further speed up the learning process, a multi-view semi-supervised feature learning algorithm that expands the single view semi-supervised learning algorithm to multiple views is proposed and embedded in co-training. Finally, a weighted majority vote method is utilized to obtain the classification results. The experimental results for study areas in the United States indicate that the proposed method can accurately map crop types with a limited number of labelled training samples without a significant computational cost.

TI  - Study of urban heat island index methods for urban agglomerations (hilly terrain) in Chongqing
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the urban heat island (UHI) effect in the mountainous areas of Chongqing, the UHI indexes for the Chongqing urban agglomerations were investigated in the present study. This study is based on data from 34 national weather stations and more than 2000 regional automated weather stations in Chongqing, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light data, and 30-m high-resolution land use data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature remote sensing data for Chongqing in 2015. Moreover, the influences of three background temperature calculation methods on the UHI effect were compared. The results showed that, if only the land use data and the city clustering algorithm (CCA) were used to divide the urban and suburban areas, the strong UHI index of Chongqing exhibited an abnormal increase in the years with extremely high temperatures, and the corresponding divided suburban and urban areas had relatively large differences in altitudes, thereby overestimating the UHI index. Therefore, in the present study, a new method for dividing the urban and suburban areas based on the combined CCA and light intensity data and a division method with the altitudes calibrated on this basis were designed. Both methods were able to satisfactorily reduce the influence of extreme climate years and excessively large differences in altitudes on the UHI index calculations and provide a new approach for future studies of the UHI index for mountainous areas with large altitude differences.

TI  - Land change syndromes identification in temperate forests of Hindukush Himalaya Karakorum (HHK) mountain ranges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed time series of a vegetation index to identify land-cover/land-use changes in HHK mountain regions administered by Pakistan. Monthly MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) series were decomposed to retrieve changes in long-term mean, peaking magnitude and seasonal characteristics. Resulting linear trend patterns were used as a baseline to map syndromes over the study area. To address non-linear changes, inter-annual variation (IAV) and short-term variation (STV) was also computed. Distributed lag-models (DLM) were used to determine significant correlation between GIMMS (Global Inventory Monitoring and Mapping) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and rainfall as an additional syndrome to highlight climate sensitive regions. Our results indicate that land use is mainly controlled by two factors: elevation and river network. Based on that, there is a particular spatial distribution of agricultural intensification because of deforestation, forest degradation from unsustainable use, forest regeneration and human settlements near rivers. Most of the trends observed showed a persistent greening pattern compared to small groups of pixels with negative trends. Outcomes of DLM do not provide plausible links between rain and forest biomass. It does however suggest a positive response of crops to rainfall events in the arid zones of the study area. High short-term fluctuation in EVI residuals occurred in areas that experienced considerable land modification and where land-use patterns are not stable. IAV was high in regions around rivers and water works and its impact on forest dynamics could not be substantiated. Land change patterns described here can be used by decision makers for forest restoration programmes.

TI  - Monitoring land use land cover changes in the Eastern Himalayan landscape of Nagaland, Northeast India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The escalating demand for anthropic needs and urban development has highlighted the importance of monitoring and change detection of land use land cover (LULC). With an increase in agricultural expansion and infrastructural development, every land surface on earth calls for a long-term investigation of land modification patterns and their underlying contributory factors. The present investigation monitors the LULC changes and assesses the process controls in Kohima and Dimapur districts of Nagaland, India. Currently, these two districts encompassing the main urban cities of the hilly state are experiencing rapid urbanization and unplanned developmental activities. Alike any other LULC changes observed in unplanned and developing cities, these districts are likely to face environmental degradation, and particularly, the occurrence of frequent landslides and flash floods. The study has three objectives-(i) LULC mapping of Kohima and Dimapur districts for three periods (1998, 2008, and 2018), (ii) comparative analysis of LULC change patterns in the two districts during the three epochs (1998-2008, 2008-2018, and 1998-2018), and (iii) assessment of the contributory factors. For the study, remotely sensed LANDSAT images (TM and OLI) in Geographical Information System (GIS) platform were utilized along with field surveys. Supervised classification technique was employed and four major LULC classes were identified using Landsat level-1 classification system. The overall accuracy of the classification varied between 91 and 98%. Results showed that Built Up areas have increased significantly in both the districts at the rate of 322.6 ha/year in Kohima and 301.9 ha/year in Dimapur during 1998-2018. On the other hand, Agricultural Land and Forest Land declined in both districts. Changes in LULC were mainly due to marginalization of shifting cultivation, deforestation, infrastructural development, urban migration, and flourishing of aquaculture farming. This study furnishes baseline information on LULC in the data-scarce region of Northeast India and is an insinuation to the policy-makers to ensure sustainable land use planning in the face of rapid urbanization.

TI  - Integration of synthetic aperture radar and multispectral data for aboveground biomass retrieval in Zagros oak forests, Iran: an attempt on Sentinel imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of freely accessible Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (S-1 SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (S-2 MSI) data are currently a feasible way of mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) over large areas. Despite the extensive mapping of forest AGB by remote sensing, how to effectively combine different sensors data, selecting the proper statistical modelling method, and variable screening are still poorly understood. This paper presents a framework for Sentinel-based AGB estimation through the use of four variable screening techniques, namely, genetic algorithm (GA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), boruta, and removal-based; and three statistical modelling methods including multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF). These methods were examined across two forested sites with different levels of human activity (highly-degraded: HD and minorly-degraded: MD) in Zagros coppice oak forests. We used backscatter coefficients and texture metrics of S-1 SAR, in addition to raw bands, simple band ratios, vegetation indices and texture metrics of S-2 MSI to extract 53 explanatory variables. Our findings showed that GA and removal-based variable screening techniques outperformed the others and RF and MLR statistical modelling methods obtained the best results. The use of different variable screening techniques and modelling methods demonstrated higher accuracies of AGB estimates for the MD site compared to the HD site. S-2 MSI (Coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.76 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 35.08% of the mean) provided a higher accuracy than S-1 SAR (R-2 = 0.42 and RMSE = 52.94% of the mean). Overall, the study demonstrates encouraging results in the retrieval and predictive mapping of the AGB of Zagros forests using the freely accessible Sentinel imagery.

TI  - Assessing the use of cross-orbit Sentinel-1 images in land cover classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is the easiest detectable indicator of human intervention on land. Urban, peri-urban and agriculture areas present a complex combination of land cover, which makes classification challenging. Getting more detailed information is the aim of any classification method. In this study, improving land cover type classification using cross-orbit Sentinel-1 images is evaluated. To avoid uncertainties, three sites in different weather conditions and locations but approximately the same land cover is selected. For each study area, three datasets including polarimetric features extracted from (1) ascending orbit image, (2) descending orbit image, and (3) combined ascending and descending orbit images are produced and used for classification. Land cover classification is performed following a supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) exploiting all three datasets. Consequently, the radar cross-orbit integrated dataset produced the most accurate land cover map. Classifications show overall accuracies (OA) of 84%, 85%, and 75%, and Kappa coefficients (K) of 0.67, 0.75, and 0.55 for Skane, Tehran, and Sherbrooke regions, respectively. Fortunately, the accuracy results are at least 4% better than single-orbit classification. In other words, the proposed mapping approach has proved that using information from both the ascending and descending dual-polarized images could achieve a more accurate classification map than using a single-orbit image individually.

TI  - Machine learning approaches for rice crop yield predictions using time-series satellite data in Taiwan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the most important food crop in Taiwan, directly feeding more than 23 million people in the country. Information on rice production is thus crucial for crop management and food policymaking. This study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) approach for predicting rice crop yields in Taiwan using time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We processed the data for the period from 2000 to 2018, following three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to generate smooth time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, (2) establishment of models for yield predictions using the heading date (HD) NDVI value, and the accumulated NDVI value of the dates from heading to maturity (DHM). The data from 2000 to 2017 were used for building predictive models using the random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM), leaving the 2018 data for model assessment, and (3) evaluation of model performance. The results compared with the government's yield statistics indicated good predictions, with the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 7.1% and 11.8%, and Willmott's index of agreement (d) values between 0.81 and 0.84 for the first crop, and 5.6% and 11.3% anddvalues between 0.91 and 0.95 for the second crop, respectively. A slight underestimation of yield predictions was observed for both crops, with the relative error (RE) values of -6.5% to -8.2% and -3.8% to -6% for the first and second crops, respectively. The results of regression analysis also confirmed a close agreement between these two datasets, with the correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.84 (p-value <0.05), in both cases. Although some factors, including mixed-pixel issues, boundary effects, and cloud cover potentially affected the modelling results, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of ML methods for regional rice yield predictions from MODIS NDVI data in Taiwan.

TI  - Consistent retrieval of multiple parameters from GOES-R top of atmosphere reflectance data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current remote sensing products are mainly generated from polar-orbiting satellite data using parameter-specific algorithms. These products lack physical consistency and cannot accurately characterize intra-day variations of parameters, such as the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and surface albedo. In this study, a multi-parameter consistent retrieval method is proposed to simultaneously retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD), leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), FAPAR, surface albedo, and incident shortwave radiation (ISR) from top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data acquired by the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series (GOES-R). The retrieved parameter values were evaluated through comparisons with corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the second version of the Geoland2 (GEOV2), and GOES-R products and ground measurements over five surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that the retrieved AOD, PAR, ISR, and surface albedo values have consistent intra-day variations with the ground measurements, and the retrieved parameter values achieve good performance against the ground measurements for all the five SURFRAD sites. The root mean square errors of the retrieved AOD, shortwave albedo, ISR, and PAR values against the ground measurements are 0.071, 0.032, 50.943 W m(-2), and 27.975 W m(-2), respectively.

TI  - An improved dust identification index (IDII) based on MODIS observation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing may serve as an ideal technique to detect dust storms for high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we propose an improved dust identification index (IDII) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. The IDII algorithm was used to monitor 129 dust storm events over the West Asia region from 2016 to 2018. Ground-based observations of synoptic stations, RGB images, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were implemented for validating IDII algorithm. In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with the Global Dust Detection Index (GDDI). The results show that the accuracy (Ac), Probability Of Correct positive Detection (POCD), and Probability Of False-positive Detection (POFD) for the IDII and GDDI are 82%, 85%, 33%, and 71%, 74%, 27%, respectively. Also over the water as a challenging object, it is clearly seen that the IDII performs much better than GDDI method. Our results suggest that the proposed approach can deal with the common limitations of dust detection algorithms, i.e. dust detection over different surfaces (land and water), seasonal changes, and similarity between dust and other objects like clouds.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research aims to investigate the association amid weather and the most recent pandemic of COVID-19 in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. The source of COVID-19 surveillance data for the secondary data analysis was the Pakistan's Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination. The weather data obtained from the Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) was exercised in this research. The components of weather include wind speed (m/s), precipitation level (mm), normal, mean, maximum, and minimum temperature (degrees C). For data analysis, a non-parametric correlation test was used due to the reason that normality was not satisfied. Precipitation level (r = - 0.285;p =0 .022), normal temperature (r = 0.293;p = 0.019) as well as the maximum temperature (r = 0.347;p = 0.005) were very much associated with COVID-19 virus. Pollution data (showing the concentration of NO2) of the specific region comprising the study area extracted from the Sentinel-5P satellite was also compared for the two years (2019 and 2020). Since the country will be entering to a new weather season, the conclusions may well assist the strategy and decision-makers in the deterrence of COVID-19.

AB  - BackgroundIvermectin-based preventive chemotherapy (PC) is distributed annually to all at-risk populations eligible for ivermectin treatment to control and/or eliminate onchocerciasis. Information on the impact of mass ivermectin administration on onchocerciasis transmission is scanty, and it is tricky to appreciate the progress towards elimination and engage corrective measures. To fill that gap in the Centre Region in Cameroon, the current onchocerciasis endemicity level in the Ndikinimeki Health District after about two decades of mass treatments was assessed.MethodsA cluster-based cross-sectional survey was carried out in the Ndikinimeki Health District and all volunteers aged >= 5 years were (i) interviewed on their compliance to ivermectin over the past five years and (ii) underwent clinical (nodule palpation and visual search for onchocercal lesions) and parasitological examinations (skin snip) for onchocerciasis.ResultsThe overall Onchocerca volvulus prevalence was 7.0% (95% CI: 5.2-9.3%). The prevalence of the disease was significantly higher in the communities Kiboum 1 and Kiboum 2 compared to the other communities (highest prevalence in Makenene Town Water: 8.5%; 95% CI: 2.3-20.4%) (chi (2) = 51.314, df = 11, P = 0.0001). The proportion of systematic non-compliers to ivermectin was 23.3% (95% CI: 19.9-27.1%) among individuals interviewed. In the sentinel sites (Kiboum communities), onchocerciasis prevalence decreased from 95.2% (95% CI: 88.3-98.1%) to 23.7% (95% CI: 14.7-36.0%).ConclusionsThis study has revealed that the Ndikinimeki Health District is hypo-endemic for onchocerciasis after about two decades of preventive chemotherapy. However, transmission is ongoing, with potential hotspots in the Kiboum 1 and Kiboum 2 communities, which are known as first-line communities (closest to the breeding sites of the vector). Alternative or complementary strategies to annual ivermectin appear compulsory to accelerate the momentum towards onchocerciasis elimination.

TI  - Role of Flooding Patterns in the Biomass Production of Vegetation in a Typical Herbaceous Wetland, Poyang Lake Wetland, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is an important factor influencing the biomass production of vegetation in natural wetland ecosystems. However, how biomass production is linked to flooding patterns in wetland areas remains unclear. We utilized gauging station data, a digital elevation model, vegetation survey data, and a Landsat 8 image to study the effects of average inundation depth (AID) and inundation duration (IDU) of flooding on end-of-season biomass of vegetation in Poyang Lake wetland, in particular, after operation of Three Gorges Dam. The end-of-season biomass of wetland vegetation showed Gaussian distributions along both the AID and IDU gradients. The most favorable flooding conditions for biomass production of vegetation in the wetland had an AID ranging from 3.9 to 4.0 m and an IDU ranging from 39% to 41%. For sites with a lower AID (<3.9 m; IDU < 39%), the end-of-season biomass values were positively related, whereas for sites with a higher AID (4.0 m; IDU > 41%), the end-of-season biomass values were negatively related. After the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, flooding patterns characterized by AID and IDU of the Poyang Lake wetland were significantly alleviated, resulting in a mixed changing trend of vegetation biomass across the wetland. Compared with 1980-2002, the increase of end-of-season biomass in lower surfaces caused by the alleviated flooding pattern far exceeded the decrease of end-of-season biomass in higher surfaces, resulting in an end-of-season biomass increase of 1.0%-6.7% since 2003. These results improved our understanding of the production trends of vegetation in the wetland and provided additional scientific guidance for vegetation restoration and wetland management in similar wetlands.

AB  - Digital elevation model, acquired and generated using manual field survey, stereo pairs, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and light detection and ranging techniques to characterize terrain topography, plays a dynamic role in geological and hydrological applications. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are subjected to comprise ineradicable faults owing to acquirement techniques and pre-processing methodologies. Experiencing non-uniform variation in accuracy, it is mandatory to assess the accuracy of DEMs before employing it for numerous purposes. Considering the fact, assessment of vertical and horizontal accuracies of open-access DEMs and InSAR-derived DEM is performed with Survey of India (SOI) toposheets as reference. Results concluded that Cartosat DEM and SRTM DEM of 30 m resolution with NRMSE as 10.5% and 10%, respectively, and PBIAS as - 0.3% and - 0.5% respectively highly correlated with the toposheet elevation when compared with other DEMs. Horizontal assessment of pixel offset concluded that Cartosat and SRTM DEM experience an offset of 0.1% along X-axis and 0.33% along Y-axis. Assessment of vertical accuracy and pixel offset concluded that CartoDEM and SRTM DEM are highly recommended for research purposes over Kodagu District, Karnataka, India. InSAR-derived DEM experiences massive variation and are not suggested over hilly terrains.

TI  - NOx Emissions Reduction and Rebound in China Due to the COVID-19 Crisis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the COVID-19 lockdown (24 January-20 March) in China low air pollution levels were reported in the media as a consequence of reduced economic and social activities. Quantification of the pollution reduction is not straightforward due to effects of transport, meteorology, and chemistry. We have analyzed the NO(x)emission reductions calculated with an inverse algorithm applied to daily NO(2)observations from TROPOMI onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. This method allows the quantification of emission reductions per city and the analysis of emissions of maritime transport and of the energy sector separately. The reductions we found are 20-50% for cities, about 40% for power plants, and 15-40% for maritime transport depending on the region. The reduction in both emissions and concentrations shows a similar timeline consisting of a sharp reduction (34-50%) around the Spring festival and a slow recovery from mid-February to mid-March.Plain Language Summary During the COVID-19 lockdown in China, air quality had strongly improved. Here we study what sources were reduced and how much the reduction per city was. We used TROPOMI observations of the Sentinel-5P satellite, which monitors the Earth's atmosphere daily. We focused on observations of the pollutant "nitrogen dioxide," an important precursor of air pollution in the atmosphere. With our novel methodology we are able to calculate the pollution back to the sources of the emissions, whether these are big cities, industrial regions, power plants, or busy shipping lanes. We applied this method to East China, where the 36 biggest Chinese cities are located. Almost all those cities showed strong emission reductions of 20-50% during the lockdown in February 2020. Besides urban China, we found an average emission reduction of 40% over coal power plants and a reduction in maritime transport by 15-40% depending on the region. The period of reduced emissions lasted until around the end of February, and the emissions slowly returned to normal during the month March 2020. Exception is the region Wuhan, the center of the COVID-19 crisis, where emissions started to rebound since 8 April, the end of their lockdown period.

TI  - The Evolution of Icelandic Volcano Emissions, as Observed From Space in the Era of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanoes are natural phenomena that have global environmental impacts. Satellite remote sensing can help classify volcanic eruptions and track the dispersion of emissions. We assess multiple volcanic eruptions in Iceland (Eyjafjallajokull 2010, Grimsvotn 2011, and Holuhraun 2014-2015), using space-borne observations to infer information about the geological dynamics of each volcano and the properties and evolution of plume particles. We derive qualitative constraints on plume particle size, shape, and light-absorption characteristics from Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) space-borne imagery. With the MISR Research Algorithm (RA), we distinguish sulfate/water-dominated volcanic plumes from Holuhraun and ash-dominated plumes from Eyjafjallajokull and Grimsvotn, and even identify subtler changes in ash particle size and light-absorption within plumes. Additionally, plume heights are retrieved geometrically from MISR. These are combined with surface thermal anomalies from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SO(2)concentrations derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to synthesize eruption remote-sensing chronologies. Signals related to differences in particle properties are identified and linked to evolving magma composition at Eyjafjallajokull. The results illustrate the potential to distinguish qualitative differences in eruptive magma composition based on particle light absorption and plume profile from remote-sensing. For the sulfate-rich Holuhraun plumes, the influence of aerosol hygroscopic growth during transport is inferred from such data. Three processes appear to dominate plume evolution in Iceland: downwind aerosol formation, particle hydration, and particle deposition. This work demonstrates enhanced MISR capabilities and, more generally, remote-sensing analysis that can be applied globally, especially where suborbital volcano observations are limited or entirely absent.

TI  - Subpixel image registration regularised by <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> norms
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the authors propose a subpixel image registration framework that detects and matches feature points. Rigid and nonrigid registration models are employed to solve the problem of subpixel image registration problem. A rigid registration model based on the l(2) norm is proposed to regularise the rotation coefficients using the indicator function to estimate the rigid transformation parameters. The latter estimation simplified is made easy by the reduction in the rigid transformation from two dimensions to one dimension. Furthermore, a non-rigid registration model based on the l(1) and l(2) norms is proposed to estimate the elastic coefficients of the compact support radial basis functions. Due to the linear representation of the transformation function, the rigid and nonrigid subpixel image registration models can be solved efficiently using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. Experiments on a demosaicing data set, the ocean of remote sensing data set, a brain data set and the fundus image registration data set show that the proposed rigid and non-rigid registration models can accurately perform subpixel image registration.

TI  - Can satellite-based weather index insurance improve the hedging of yield risk of perennial non-irrigated olive trees in Spain?*
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Olive oil yields fluctuate strongly due to their dependence on sufficient precipitation. An interesting option to hedge the yield risk in olive cultivation could be satellite-based weather index insurance. Therefore, we implement index insurance as a hedging alternative for non-irrigated olive groves using MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. For this purpose, we focus on the Spanish region of Andalusia, given its importance in olive production at the international level. We calculate three satellite indices: the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and the Vegetation Health Index (VHI). Meteorological indices related to temperature and precipitation are used as benchmarks. Firstly, we estimate the periods that have the greatest influence on the critical vegetative phase of olives, which extends from March to September. Based on the indices, insurance contracts are designed using a copula approach, which is then employed to evaluate their hedging effectiveness. On average, the hedging effectiveness of VCI-, VHI- and TCI-based weather index insurance contracts amounts to 38 per cent, 38 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively. Moreover, VCI- and VHI-based weather index insurance contracts outperform traditional weather index insurance contracts based on precipitation (by 29 per cent) and temperature (by 16 per cent) indices.

TI  - Defining the advantages and exposing the limitations of endoscopic variceal ligation in controlling acute bleeding and achieving complete variceal eradication
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDBleeding esophageal varices (BEV) is a potentially life-threatening complication in patients with portal hypertension with mortality rates as high as 25% within six weeks of the index variceal bleed. After control of the initial bleeding episode patients should enter a long-term surveillance program with endoscopic intervention combined with non-selective beta-blockers to prevent further bleeding and eradicate EV.AIMTo assess the efficacy of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) in controlling acute variceal bleeding, preventing variceal recurrence and rebleeding and achieving complete eradication of esophageal varices (EV) in patients who present with BEV.METHODSA prospectively documented single-center database was used to retrospectively identify all patients with BEV who were treated with EVL between 2000 and 2018. Control of acute bleeding, variceal recurrence, rebleeding, eradication and survival were analyzed using Baveno assessment criteria.RESULTSOne hundred and forty patients (100 men, 40 women; mean age 50 years; range, 21-84 years; Child-Pugh grade A = 32; B = 48; C = 60) underwent 160 emergency and 298 elective EVL interventions during a total of 928 endoscopy sessions. One hundred and fourteen (81%) of the 140 patients had variceal bleeding that was effectively controlled during the index banding procedure and never bled again from EV, while 26 (19%) patients had complicated and refractory variceal bleeding. EVL controlled the acute sentinel variceal bleed during the first endoscopic intervention in 134 of 140 patients (95.7%). Six patients required balloon tamponade for control and 4 other patients rebled in hospital. Overall 5-d endoscopic failure to control variceal bleeding was 7.1% (n = 10) and four patients required a salvage transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Index admission mortality was 14.2% (n = 20). EV were completely eradicated in 50 of 111 patients (45%) who survived > 3 mo of whom 31 recurred and 3 rebled. Sixteen (13.3%) of 120 surviving patients subsequently had 21 EV rebleeding episodes and 10 patients bled from other sources after discharge from hospital. Overall rebleeding from all sources after 2 years was 21.7% (n = 26). Sixty-nine (49.3%) of the 140 patients died, mainly due to liver failure (n = 46) during follow-up. Cumulative survival for the 140 patients was 71.4% at 1 year, 65% at 3 years, 60% at 5 years and 52.1% at 10 years.CONCLUSIONEVL was highly effective in controlling the sentinel variceal bleed with an overall 5-day failure to control bleeding of 7.1%. Although repeated EVL achieved complete variceal eradication in less than half of patients with BEV, of whom 62% recurred, there was a significant reduction in subsequent rebleeding.

TI  - Biased and unbiased estimation of the average length of stay in intensive care units in the Covid-19 pandemic
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The average length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU_ALOS) is a helpful parameter summarizing critical bed occupancy. During the outbreak of a novel virus, estimating early a reliable ICU_ALOS estimate of infected patients is critical to accurately parameterize models examining mitigation and preparedness scenarios. Methods Two estimation methods of ICU_ALOS were compared: the average LOS of already discharged patients at the date of estimation (DPE), and a standard parametric method used for analyzing time-to-event data which fits a given distribution to observed data and includes the censored stays of patients still treated in the ICU at the date of estimation (CPE). Methods were compared on a series of all COVID-19 consecutive cases (n = 59) admitted in an ICU devoted to such patients. At the last follow-up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. A simulation study investigated the generalizability of the methods' patterns. CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID-19 estimates reported to date. Results LOS >= 30 days concerned 14 out of the 59 patients (24%), including 8 of the 21 deaths observed. Two months after the first admission, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged, with corresponding DPE and CPE estimates of ICU_ALOS (95% CI) at 13.0 days (10.4-15.6) and 23.1 days (18.1-29.7), respectively. Series' true ICU_ALOS was greater than 21 days, well above reported estimates to date. Conclusions Discharges of short stays are more likely observed earlier during the course of an outbreak. Cautious unbiased ICU_ALOS estimates suggest parameterizing a higher burden of ICU bed occupancy than that adopted to date in COVID-19 forecasting models.

TI  - SNPP VIIRS RSB on-orbit radiometric calibration algorithms Version 2.0 and the performances, part 2: the performances
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In part I (Lei et al., J. Appl. Remote Sens., Vol. 14, Issue 4), we gave detailed reviews of the algorithms Version 2.0 used for the on-orbit radiometric calibration of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) of the first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. These algorithms improve the accuracy of the measured on-orbit change factor of the solar diffuser bidirectional reflectance distribution function, the H-factor, and reveal that the H-factor is angle dependent. With the help of lunar observations and the improved H-factor, the algorithms give more accurate values for the RSB detector on-orbit F-factor changes (F-factor is a correction factor to the initially retrieved scene spectral radiance). We review the RSB radiometric calibration performances. We show the H-factor temporal trend, the estimated uncertainty of the retrieved H-factor, and the F-factor temporal trend. Additionally, we show the detector signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the estimated uncertainty of the top-of-the-atmosphere solar spectral reflectance, the reflectance temporal trend for the Libya 4 desert, and the differences in the reflectances among the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and the NOAA-20 VIIRS and the Aqua Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our results show that, although the SNRs trend downward, they exceed the requirements by large margins. The reflectances from the Libya 4 desert show that the SNPP VIIRS' reflectance is higher than those of the Aqua MODIS and the NOAA-20 VIIRS.

TI  - Increased Surface Broadband Emissivity Driven by Denser Vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau Grassland Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global changes are profoundly affecting the global terrestrial ecosystems, especially for the vegetation. Simultaneously, the affected vegetation gives feedback to the climates. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of the most sensitive areas to global changes, has undergone extraordinary changes on its ecosystem processes. In the multitudinous land surface ecosystem processes affecting the climate, the process of land surface energy balance affecting by vegetation activity is one of the most important and still has not been well recognized. The spatial and temporal patterns of the broadband emissivity (BBE) on the TP and its relations to the vegetation activity and land surface temperature were examined in this research. We find that elevated BBE is regulated by increasing vegetation activity for grasslands over the TP from 2000 to 2015. The spatial patterns of BBE and its interannual changes are highly correlated with vegetation activity. The BBE changing rate generally declines along rising elevation, due to the shrunk effects from vegetation activity. A greater sensitivity of BBE to vegetation activity occurs in the sparse vegetation area or high elevation zone than in the dense vegetation area or low elevation zone. Increasing BBE has a cooling effect on the land surface, especially at night. This cooling effect is related to wind speed. The growing season BBE trend as regulated by vegetation activity highlights the importance to take mounting notice of the growing season long-wave energy fluxes of surface energy balance studies in the future.

TI  - Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node dissection followed by open radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer: A pilot study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To propose a treatment algorithm, after the LACC trial, of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy with frozen section, followed by immediate open radical hysterectomy in node-negative cases, for early stage cervical cancer. Methods We retrospectively collected all cases of cervical cancer that were surgically treated between 2019-2020. In all cases, surgery began with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy +/- ovarian transposition. Node-negative cases continued with open radical hysterectomy. In node-positive cases, surgery was discontinued, sparing the patient a laparotomy incision. Results Nine patients with cervical cancer were referred for surgery. Laparoscopic bilateral lymph node identification was achieved in all. In two cases, sentinel lymph nodes were positive for metastatic cancer and surgery was discontinued. For the other seven, node-negative patients, open radical hysterectomy was completed. Four patients had laparoscopic ovarian transposition. There were no cases where nodes were negative on frozen section but positive on final pathology. Conclusion Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy before open radical hysterectomy may spare a considerable number of laparotomies on the one hand and bi-modal treatment with surgery and radiation on the other, for node-positive patients. The oncological safety of this approach is yet to be determined.

TI  - Fast multi-spectral image super-resolution via sparse representation
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse reconstruction is used to solve the inverse problem of single image super-resolution (SR) as a patch-based sparsity promoting regularisation problem. A coupled trained overcomplete dictionary from high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) image patches containing significant features is proposed using sparse representation to produce HR patches from their LR counterparts. In this study, the authors develop a multi-core single image SR technique for LR multi-spectral images based on patch-wise sparse representation coupled with morphological component analysis driven feature extraction. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the proposed method using real remote sensing images of a few Indian satellites, RESOURCESAT-2 and CARTOSAT-2, as well as other satellites, such as QuickBird etc. Results are also compared with other existing SR methods to establish the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both objective metrics and visual analysis.

TI  - Cardiac doses of accelerated partial breast irradiation with perioperative multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To quantify mean heart dose (MHD) and doses to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left ventricle (LV) in a retrospective series of patients who underwent perioperative accelerated partial breast irradiation with multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy (MIB-APBI). Methods Sixty-eight patients with low-risk left breast cancer were treated with MIB-APBI at our institution between 2012 and 2017. Interstitial tubes were inserted during the tumorectomy and sentinel node biopsy and APBI was started 6 days later. The prescribed dose was 34Gy in 10 fractions (twice a day) to the clinical target volume (CTV). The heart, LAD, and LV were contoured and the distance between each structure and the CTV was measured. The MHD, mean and maximum LAD doses (LAD mean/max), and mean LV doses (LV mean) were calculated and corrected to biologically equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractionation (EQD2). We also evaluated the impact of the distance between the cardiac structures and the CTV and of the volume receiving the prescribed dose (V100) and high-dose volume (V150) on heart dosimetry. Results Mean EQD2 for MHD, LAD mean/max, and mean LV were 0.9 +/- 0.4Gy (range 0.3-2.2), 1.6 +/- 1.1Gy (range, 0.4-5.6), 2.6 +/- 1.9Gy (range, 0.7-9.2), and 1.3 +/- 0.6Gy (range, 0.5-3.4), respectively. MHD, LAD mean/max, and LV mean significantly correlated with the distance between the CTV and these structures, but all doses were below the recommended limits (German Society of Radiation Oncology; DEGRO). The MHD and LV mean were significantly dependent on V100. Conclusion Perioperative MIB-APBI resulted in low cardiac doses in our study. This finding provides further support for the value of this technique in well-selected patients with early-stage left breast cancer.

TI  - A multi-criteria decision analysis for groundwater potential evaluation in parts of Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis based on Saaty's analytical hierarchy processing technique has been used to establish groundwater potential distribution pattern across some highly populated parts of Ibadan metropolis in southwestern Nigeria. The technique weighted and ranked seven sets of thematic hydrological parameters derived from Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery, 143 vertical electrical sounding (VES) geophysical data, and geological and topographical data. Filtered and enhanced Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery, quality-checked and inverted VES data, and categorized geological and other ancillary data were analyzed and used to generate lineaments, subsurface geoelectric parameters and other terrain information employed to extract thematic hydrogeological parameters used to characterize the subsurface in terms of groundwater potential. Weighted, normalized and ranked derived thematic hydrogeological parameters (lineament density, drainage density, coefficient of anisotropy, aquifer thickness, overburden thickness, aquifer resistivity and lithology) were employed to generate groundwater resource potential map. The map delineates the study area into very low (6.5%), low (41.0%), medium (38.1%), high and very high (14.4%) groundwater resource potential zones. Regions underlain by quartzite/quartz schist rocks present medium-to-high groundwater resource potential, while regions underlain by migmatite and granite gneiss rocks mostly have very low-low groundwater resource potential. This study indicates that variation in groundwater resource potential across Ibadan situated within the basement complex terrain is mostly influenced by the heterogeneity of subsurface geology which varies rapidly in terms of rock distribution and associated hydrogeological indices.

TI  - Highly sensitive remote biosensor for the determination of lead (II) ions by using nanoporous anodic alumina modified with DNAzyme
T2  - SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we have designed a biosensor based on interferometric reflectance spectroscopy (IRS) for the lead (II) ion (Pb2+) ions sensing. For this purpose, the electrochemically fabricated nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) was fabricated and then functionalized with amino-containing silane (NAA-NH2). After that, the amino-terminal G rich DNA single strands were immobilized into the pores of NAA-NH2 by using glutaraldehyde (Glu). Finally, the NAA modified with G-rich DNA single strands was immersed in a solution containing hemin and potassium ions, fabricating a DNAzyme sensor (NAA-NH-Glu-NH-DNAzyme). The proposed biosensor oxidized 2,2 '-azino-bis(3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution to green color ABTS(center dot-) anion radical solution in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The generated green color ABTS(center dot-) anion radical solution absorbed the white light and therefore the intensity of the reflected light from NAA to the CCD decreased. However, in the presence of Pb2+ ions, the catalytic property of the proposed biosensor decreased. In the presence of Pb2+ ions, the concentration of the generated green color ABTS(center dot-) anion radical solution decreased because of releasing the hemin cofactor during the transformation of the K+-stabilized hemin-G-quadruplex DNAzyme into the Pb2+ stabilized G-quadruplex. Therefore, the intensity of the reflected light to the detector increased. This increase in the intensity of the reflected light to the detector consequent on the increase in the peak area of the IRS. The biosensor exhibited a good response to Pb2+ ions with a linear range from 50 to 3200 nM with a low detection limit of 12 nM (2.6 ppb).

TI  - Simulation of green roofs and their potential mitigating effects on the urban heat island using an artificial neural network: A case study in Austin, Texas
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing number of densely populated cities has resulted in a decrease in vegetation coverage, which in turn, has resulted in a temperature increase in urban areas. This phenomenon is known as urban heat island (UHI). Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate the effect of urban heat islands in recent years, including usage of green roof coverage. However, there is a need for a rigorous analysis of the relationship between UHI and different urban characteristics using advanced models for urban planners to make policy-decisions to mitigate the UHI effect. In this study, the cooling effect of the green roof strategy in the city of Austin, considering 2D/3D urban characteristic parameters was investigated. To begin with, land surface temperature (LST) was estimated from Landsat 8 TIRS data in July 2016. Also, 3D urban morphology parameters derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. To simulate the green roof strategy, Sentinel 2A satellite images were used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index and the normalized difference built-up index because of higher spatial resolution than Landsat 8 OLI. Then a multilayer feed-forward neural network was applied as a nonlinear model to find a relationship between LST and various urban characteristic parameters simultaneously. Furthermore, the importance of the variables in LST modeling was evaluated using sensitivity analysis. After that, some downtown residential and office buildings, which had the potential to become a green roof, were selected to implement the green roof strategy. Finally, by analyzing the relationship between LST reduction due to green roof simulation and urban indicators, the best buildings for green roof implementation were determined. Results showed that the accuracy of the LST modeling was reached to R-2 = 0.786 and RMSE = 0.956 degrees C. In addition, by greening 3.2% of total building roofs, the average of LST decreased by 1.96 degrees C. Moreover, the results indicated that the building green roofs with (i) heights of 15-25 m, (ii) the highest values of sky view factor and solar radiation, and (iii) the lowest distance to the water body, had the greatest cooling effects on LST. Consequently, these findings indicated that the green roof has a significant effect on tem-perature reduction, especially by selecting the buildings with the above mentioned characteristics.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil parent material in a heterogeneous tropical area
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parent material is one of the five factors in soil formation. Studies on parent material allow interpreting soil genesis processes and improve our knowledge of specific soil attributes. However, soil parent material maps at detailed cartographic scale (finer than 1:100,000) are rare in tropical areas and it is usually inferred from poorly detailed geological data, which generally group different lithologies into single units. Thus, we propose a methodology to map soil parent material based on remote sensing and machine learning in a geologically very complex area. The study site covers 1378 km(2) in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Prediction models used data from 280 geological observation points, a digital elevation model (spatial resolution of 5 m, upscale to 30 m) and multitemporal Landsat images in a range of 30 years. We evaluated six classification algorithms, namely random forest, decision tree, support vector machine, multinomial logistic regression, K-means (unsupervised classification), and object-based image analysis with maximum likelihood classification. Environmental covariates were grouped to create different scenarios combining terrain derivatives, hydrologic covariates, topsoil spectral reflectance, and spatial coordinates. A bare soil image, elaborated using 30 years of Landsat data, was evaluated as a covariate to predict soil parent material. Predictions were validated using three different strategies: crossvalidation, separate validation dataset (20%), and comparison with legacy geological maps (information from two areas with geological maps at fine scale). We also assessed the correspondence between the map of predicted soil parent material and data of soil particle size from 571 soil sampling points. Random forest algorithm presented the best validation performance, whereas the group of terrain derivatives and hydrologic covariates explained most of model variation. The produced parent material map was coherent with the spatial distribution of soil particle size across the study area. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The long-term evolution of landslide activity near the epicentral area of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wenchuan earthquake triggered numerous landslides and damaged vast areas of vegetation. Strong mountain earthquakes have long-term impacts on the activities of subsequent landslides. It is crucial for long-term geohazard risk assessment to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of post-earthquake landslides. We used multi-year images from 2008 to 2018 to track the reactivation of coseismic landslides and newly occurring landslides to evaluate the influence of the Wenchuan earthquake on subsequent rain-induced landslides. With the aid of a GIS platform combined with field investigations, we analyzed the temporal and spatial evolutions of landslide activities over the past ten years and the factors controlling these changes. In addition, the process of vegetation recovery at landslide sites in the epicentral area was detected based on multi-year Landsat TM data after the Wenchuan earthquake. We observed that the total area of active landslides decreased significantly with time. In the first 5 years (2008-2013), the vegetation recovered quickly but was not well rehabilitated, and post-seismic landslides generally maintained high activity levels. Due to progressive revegetation and consolidation, most of the coseismic deposits along the hillslopes gradually stabilized. Subsequently (2013-2018), landslide activity weakened and mainly occurred in high and steep areas with poor vegetation recovery, particularly in proximity to the drainage network. Decreasing occurrence of rain-induced landslides was closely related to vegetation recovery in both time and space, and vegetation recovery could promote the reduction in post-earthquake landslide activities. We also proposed a quantitative model for the landslide rate in the epicentral area of the Wenchuan earthquake, which shows that the enhanced landslide rate reached its peak after the earthquake and will decrease to the pre-earthquake level in 25 years. The evolution of the post-seismic landslide activity can be categorized into four stages: high active period (2008-2013), low active period (2013-2018), recovery period (2018-2033), and stable period (after 2033).

TI  - Change in forest condition: Characterizing non-stand replacing disturbances using time series satellite imagery
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective information is required to monitor and characterize disturbances and disturbance regimes as related to changing climate and anthropogenic pressures. Forest disturbances occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales, with varying extent, severity, and persistence. To date, most of our understanding of detecting forest disturbances using remotely sensed imagery has been based on detecting abrupt and rapid, stand replacing disturbances, such as those related to wildfire and forest harvesting. Conversely, more continuous, subtle, and gradual non-stand replacing (NSR) disturbances, such as those related to drought stress or insect infestation have been subject to less focus. This can be attributed to the variability of NSR in space and time, as well as detection difficulties due to their often-subtle alterations to forest canopies and structure. Time series remote sensing techniques offer new opportunities for the capture and characterization of NSR disturbances. In this research, we investigate NSR disturbances as detected using a Landsat time series-based disturbance detection algorithm, Composite2Change (C2C) applied to the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. We first examined three key characteristics of the spectral trajectory of NSR disturbances: pre-disturbance conditions, disturbance severity and disturbance persistence. From these characteristics, we defined seven typical NSR patterns (exemplars) for Canada's forested ecosystems. Using annual information on predicted stand-level cover and biomass, we found that all NSR exemplars resulted in a loss of canopy cover, ranging from an average loss of between 5 and 31%. For instance, the most common exemplar was linked to a 15% reduction in canopy cover and a 13 Mg/ha reduction in biomass. While stands lost biomass, over the duration of the NSR, most stands increased slightly in stand height likely due to growth of the remaining trees or release from competition from the remaining stems. Comparing exemplars across Canada with independent data on NSR disturbance events confirmed that NSR exemplars that had larger severities, and shorter disturbance persistence times, were more commonly associated with insect infestations (e.g. mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)), whereas exemplars with a lower severity, and longer persistence were more commonly associated with drought events. Developing a nomenclature around remote sensing based characteristics of NSR disturbances provides an approach to both map NSR disturbances and better understand their impact on forest attributes, as well as provide tools to assess if these disturbanes are changing over space and time.

TI  - Distance-based emission factors from vehicle emission remote sensing measurements
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vehicle emission remote sensing has the potential to provide detailed emissions information at a highly disaggre-gated level owing to the ability to measure thousands of vehicles in a single day. Fundamentally, vehicle emission remote sensing provides a direct measure of the molar volume ratio of a pollutant to carbon dioxide, from which fuel-based emissions factors can readily be calculated. However, vehicle emissions are more commonly expressed in emission per unit distance travelled e.g. grams per km or mile. To express vehicle emission remote sensing data in this way requires an estimate of the fuel consumption at the time of the emission measurement. In this paper, an approach is developed based on vehicle specific power that uses commonly measured or easily obtainable vehicle information such as vehicle speed, acceleration and mass. We test the approach against 55 independent comprehensive PEMS measurements for Euro 5 and 6 gasoline and diesel vehicles over a wide range of driving conditions and find good agreement between the method and PEMS data. The method is applied to individual vehicle model types to quantify distance-based emission factors. The method will be appropriate for application to larger vehicle emission remote sensing databases, thus extending real-world distance-based vehicle emissions information. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - The formation of a giant collapse caprock sinkhole on the Barda Negra plateau basalts (Argentina): Magnetic, mineralogical and morphostructural evidences
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1.5-km-wide, 40-m-deep, crater-like structure in the 10 Ma old Barda Negra basaltic plateau in Central Argentina was discovered in the early 2000s. Based on remote sensing surveys and on its morphological characteristics, similar to those of the Barringer crater in Arizona, the structure is described to be originated by an impact. In this study we ran several fieldwork campaigns and collected and analysed samples, in order to find more evidences to endorse or reject this hypothesis.We observe a circular depression not generally surrounded by raised rims, in contrast to craters produced either by a meteorite impact or phreatomagmatic eruption (maars). Mineralogical investigations of rocks and sediments do not show high pressure and temperature minerals, such as coesite or stishovite, or any remnants of an impactite or impact melt/glass. Likewise, no textural evidences for impact-related fracturing or stress are observed. A detailed geomorphological mapping indicates a successive crater development which invokes local stepwise subsidence. Magneticmapping performed with the EU-funded NEWTON multisensor novel instrument shows a similar to 2000 nT field anomaly associated to the edges of the crater, and susceptibility measurements cast an important contrast between the basaltic rims and plateau, and the crater interior. Therefore, we propose a sink-hole origin for the crater, with a former collapse of the plateau basalts and a latter infill with sedimentary material. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the 40 to 85 m thick and 14 to 15 Ma old carbonate-bearing Collon Cura Formation, underneath the 100 to 150 m thick basaltic plateau lava sheet, represents ideal rocks for dissolution and karst formation; remote sensing data show other nearby sinkholes (20 km westward), with extensions of 3 x 6 km and 100 m depth, which are emplaced within a cogenetic neighboring basaltic plateau with a similar underlying lithology; and the consistence of the magnetic model computed with this scheme and on measured rock remanence and susceptibilities of the structure and surroundings.These giant collapse sinkholes, up to 6 km in diameter, within caprocks of very thick plateau basalts, represent unique examples for planetary surface shaping processes which also occur on Mars and comets in areas with basalts or rigid caprocks.

TI  - Integration of satellite data and spatial decision models for zoning new urban communities in El-Fayoum Desert
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study adopts a spatial multidisciplinary approach for applying allocation models in zoning new urban sustainable communities in El-Fayoum Desert. Landsat 8 OLI imageries acquired in 2016, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data, and thematic maps were utilized. Three spatial multicriteria sub-models were designed to create three criteria themes, namely, land resources, infrastructure, and environmental protection. The analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy sets were used for infrastructure and resources themes. The infrastructure theme was combined using weighted linear combination (WLC). The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) low-risk "AND" was used to combine the resources theme. The environmental protection theme was combined using the Boolean overlay model. The three themes (sub-models) were finally combined using equal weights to produce suitability index maps. OWA model was run on the combined (index) to test the different level of risk and trade-off between the factors. Results reveal that OWA model with minimum risk (AND) resulted in most optimum zones with total area equivalent to 58.33 km(2). The WLC model (OWA medium risk) resulted in optimum zones of total area equivalent to 102.77 km(2). The OWA maximum risk (OR) resulted in optimum zones with total area equivalent to 329.84 km(2). The resultant maps were compared with the zones for new urban communities proposed by the General Organization for Physical Planning in its strategy for sustainable urban development of El-Fayoum. The comparison pointed out a reasonable agreement; in addition, results revealed more suitable locations that are recommended for future urban development.

TI  - Oxidative stress ecology on Pacific oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> from lagoon and offshore Italian sites
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crassostrea gigas is a sentinel species along the Italian coast. In mussels, the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers can be modulated by several environmental pollutants or pathogens and also fluctuate in response to reproductive stages and seasonal changes. In this study, adult Crassostrea gigas were sampled during summer and autumn from two lagoon and two offshore sites along the Adriatic coast of Italy in order to investigate the influence of seasonality on oxidative stress biomarkers. Trace elements load of Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn suggests low contamination for lagoon and offshore sites. Levels of total glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase were analyzed in digestive gland and gills of the Pacific oysters in June, July, September and October. OsHV-1 and Vibrio aestuarianus were detected in lagoon sites, but both pathogens did not affect the biomarkers levels in both tissues. Although several biological responses were found different among the four sites in the same month, principal component analysis revealed similar trend in biomarkers levels between sites during the whole sampling period. On the other hand, a different biochemical pattern through the months emerged, suggesting that the level of oxidative stress biomarkers in both tissues may be related to seasonal progress and biological cycle of oysters sampled from the two lagoons and offshore sites along the Italian coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Satellite-detected tropospheric nitrogen dioxide and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Northern Italy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) last December 2019 in China, Italywas the first European country to be severely affected, with the first local case diagnosed on 20 February 2020. The virus spread quickly, particularly in the North of Italy, with three regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) being the most severely affected. These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdownwas established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO2 tropospheric levels using satellite data available at the European Space Agency before the lockdown. Using a multivariable restricted cubic spline regression model, we compared NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence rate at different time points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, in the 28 provinces of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. We found little association of NO2 levelswith SARS-CoV-2 prevalence up to about 130 mu mol/m(2), while a positive association was evident at higher levels at each timepoint. Notwithstanding the limitations of the use of aggregated data, these findings lend some support to the hypothesis that high levels of air pollution may favor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Investigating the relationship between aerosol and cloud optical properties inferred from the MODIS sensor in recent decades over East China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, we have analyzed the spatiotemporal distributions and trends of aerosol optical depth observed at 550 nm (AOD(550)), and its relation with the optical properties of clouds over East China. For this purpose, we have used the long-term (2000-2017) data obtained from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite to examine and understand the existing relationship between them. The spatial gradient of AOD(550) showed an increase from the South to the North of the study domain. However, the seasonal variation of AOD(550) was found high in summer and low during the winter. We have noticed a significant increasing trend in AOD over the northern part of the study area, especially in autumn and winter seasons. The study also investigated the spatial and temporal changes to understand the relationship between AOD and cloud properties, namely cloud fraction (CF), cloud top temperature (CTT), Cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud top pressure (CTP), respectively. Besides, the linear regression analysis was conducted to estimate the time series trend for the aerosol and cloud properties during the study period. Further, the regional correlation maps were adopted to improve our understanding of the existing relationship between aerosol and cloud properties. A positive correlation between AOD and CF and CER is evident in most of the places in East China.

TI  - Dual template synthesis of SAPO-18/34 zeolite intergrowths and their performances in direct conversion of syngas to olefins
T2  - MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - SAPO-18/34 zeolite intergrowths are synthesized in dual-template method with TEAOH and TEA as co-templates. The physical and chemical properties of the zeolite intergrowths are characterized by using XRD, ICP-AES, N-2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, TEM and FT-IR. Moreover, the catalytic performances of the zeolite intergrowths in the conversion of syngas to olefins (STO) are studied by combining with ZnCrOx oxide to construct bi-functional catalysts. Equal amount of TEA and TEAOH in the synthesis mixture and proper silicon content (0.02<SiO2/Al2O3 < 0.20) favor the crystallization of nanosized SAPO-18/34 zeolite intergrowths with AEI units dominating. Otherwise, varying template compositions or raising the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios makes CHA units grow preferentially. Well crystallizations make the zeolite intergrowths of high microporosities, large surface areas and enhanced acidity properties. STO reaction results reveal that very high C2-4 olefins selectivity of 87.6% and CO conversion of 26.7% at space velocity of 6000 ml/h/g(catal) can be achieved over catalyst ZnCr&Z(y-0.02) with zeolite intergrowth of low acidity. The selectivity of by-products C2-4 paraffins can be strictly constrained to 2.2% with olefins/paraffins (O/P) ratio of 40.4. Catalyst ZnCr&Z(y-0.10) with improved acidity (SiO2/Al2O3 = 0.10) in zeolite intergrowth exhibits higher CO conversion of 31.5% with C2-4 olefins selectivity of 81.4% and no obvious deactivation can be observed during a 160 h test. Furthermore, by tuning the weight ratios of ZnCrOx oxides to zeolites in the catalysts, it shows excessive strong acid sites in zeolites lead to more C2-4 paraffins formed.

TI  - Spatial characteristics and temporal evolution of the relationship between PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth over the eastern USA during 2003-2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has proposed use of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) to generate geospatial assessments of near-surface PM2.5 mass concentrations and potentially to provide air quality forecasts. Spatiotemporal variability in PM2.5-AOD relationships over the eastern United States of America are analyzed using surface observations, satellite data, reanalysis data, and WRF-Chem simulations. Three primary metrics are analyzed: eta (eta, the ratio of PM2.5 to AOD), the correlation coefficient (rho) between daily values of PM2.5 to AOD, and hit rate (theta, defined as co-occurrence of high PM2.5 and AOD). It is shown that mean daily eta exhibits substantial geospatial variability and a pronounced seasonal cycle. eta computed for 301 EPA stations ranges from 21 to 155 mu g mxe1af; 3 and has a domain-wide median value of 70 mu g mxe1af; 3. Larger values of eta occur in winter and fall. There is also evidence of diurnal variability in eta. Lower values are derived in analyses using AOD from Terra (i.e. the morning overpass) than when AOD from the MODIS instrument onboard Aqua (i.e. the afternoon overpass). The spatial median eta from Terra is 70 vs. 93 mu g mxe1af; 3 from Aqua. A majority of sites exhibit statistically significant lower values of eta, rho, and theta during 2013-2017 than 2003-2007, indicating a declining association between AOD and PM2.5. This has implications for the potential to use remotely-sensed AOD to generate geospatial estimates of near-surface PM2.5. The spatial distribution of eta across the 301 locations exhibits a negative dependence on planetary boundary layer height and 10 m wind speed and a positive dependence on integrated humidity in lower troposphere, urban fraction, 2 m temperature, and vegetation coverage. Simulations with WRF-Chem indicate model-derived estimates of eta, rho, and theta are highly dependent on the aerosol scheme employed but the model captures some of the spatial variability and the correct dependence of eta on meteorological and land use causes of that variability.

TI  - Advancing methodologies for applying machine learning and evaluating spatiotemporal models of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) using satellite data over large regions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructing the distribution of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in space and time, even far from ground monitoring sites, is an important exposure science contribution to epidemiologic analyses of PM2.5 health impacts. Flexible statistical methods for prediction have demonstrated the integration of satellite observations with other predictors, yet these algorithms are susceptible to overfitting the spatiotemporal structure of the training datasets. We present a new approach for predicting PM2.5 using machine-learning methods and evaluating prediction models for the goal of making predictions where they were not previously available. We apply extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) modeling to predict daily PM2.5 on a 1 x 1 km(2) resolution for a 13 state region in the Northeastern USA for the years 2000-2015 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth and implement a recursive feature selection to develop a parsimonious model. We demonstrate excellent predictions of withheld observations but also contrast an RMSE of 3.11 mu g/m(3) in our spatial cross-validation withholding nearby sites versus an overfit RMSE of 2.10 mu g/m(3) using a more conventional random ten-fold splitting of the dataset. As the field of exposure science moves forward with the use of advanced machine-learning approaches for spatiotemporal modeling of air pollutants, our results show the importance of addressing data leakage in training, overfitting to spatiotemporal structure, and the impact of the predominance of ground monitoring sites in dense urban sub-networks on model evaluation. The strengths of our resultant modeling approach for exposure in epidemiologic studies of PM2.5 include improved efficiency, parsimony, and interpretability with robust validation while still accommodating complex spatiotemporal relationships.

TI  - A spatial finer electric load estimation method based on night-light satellite image
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a fundamental parameter of the electric grid, obtaining spatial electric load distribution is the premise and basis for numerous studies. As a public, world-wide, and spatialized dataset, NPP/VIIRS night-light satellite image has been long used for socio-economic information estimation, including electric consumption, while little attention has been given to the electric load estimation. Additionally, most of the previous studies were performed at a large spatial scale, which could not reflect the electric information inner a city. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to estimate electric load density at a township-level spatial scale based on NPP/VIIRS night-light satellite data. Firstly, we reveal the different fitting relationships between EC (Electric Consumption)-NLS (Night-Light Sum) and EL (Electric Load)-NLI (Night Light Intensity). Then, we validated the spatial-scale's influence on the estimation accuracy by experiment via generating a series of simulated datasets. After working out the super-resolution night-light image with the SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm, we established a finer spatial estimation model. By taking a monthly data of Shanghai as a case study, we validate the model we established. The result shows that estimating electric load at township-level based on night light satellite data is feasible, and the SRCNN algorithm can improve the performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - DMNet: A Network Architecture Using Dilated Convolution and Multiscale Mechanisms for Spatiotemporal Fusion of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Since remote sensing images cannot have both high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution, spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing images has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Additionally, with the successful application of deep learning in various fields, spatiotemporal fusion algorithms based on deep learning have also gradually diversified. We propose a network framework that is based on deep convolutional neural networks that incorporate dilated convolution and multiscale mechanisms, we refer to this network framework as DMNet. In this method, we concatenate the feature maps that need to be fused to avoid using complex fusion methods to introduce noise. Then, the multiscale mechanism can extract the context information of the image at various scales, and make the image details more abundant. By adding skip connections, feature maps in shallow convolutional layers can be obtained to avoid losing important features of the image during the convolution. Additionally, dilated convolution expands the receptive field of the convolution kernel, which is conducive to the extraction of small detail features. To evaluate the robustness of our method, we conduct experiments on two datasets and compare the results with those obtained by six representative spatiotemporal fusion methods. Both intuitive and objective results demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

TI  - Detecting and modelling alien tree presence using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in Chile's temperate forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Chile's temperate forest is a global biodiversity hotspot. An upsurge in alien forest plantations has disturbed and fragmented the landscape, promoting biological invasions. The invasion process is not fully understood since monitoring large and inaccessible areas can be prohibitively expensive and logistically challenging using field based methods alone. Here, a remote sensing approach using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, fragmentation analysis, and random forest modelling is applied to detect alien tree stands and describe their extent in relation to fragmentation and landscape structure in study areas around Malalcahuello National Reserve and Villarrica National Park. Detailed vegetation maps are produced, with classification accuracies > 81% and including four forest classes, two native and two alien. An altitudinal pattern was observed in both sites. At lower altitudes, there was greater total area covered by alien trees and more fragmented native forests than at higher altitudes. However, Villarrica had less alien tree cover than Malalcahuello, but was a more fragmented landscape. Random forest modelling identified that alien pine tree mean patch area was positively correlated with both land cover diversity and Araucaria araucana forest mean patch area in both sites. Given their conservation and cultural relevance, the locations of protected areas need reconsidering to strengthen the protection of A. araucana, which could be outcompeted by alien trees in a context of increasing productive forestry. This is especially urgent in Villarrica, where protected areas already have a substantial presence of alien trees, with most A. araucana found outside protected areas.

TI  - Satellite validation strategy assessments based on the AROMAT campaigns
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Airborne ROmanian Measurements of Aerosols and Trace gases (AROMAT) campaigns took place in Romania in September 2014 and August 2015. They focused on two sites: the Bucharest urban area and large power plants in the Jiu Valley. The main objectives of the campaigns were to test recently developed airborne observation systems dedicated to air quality studies and to verify their applicability for the validation of space-borne atmospheric missions such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)/Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P). We present the AROMAT campaigns from the perspective of findings related to the validation of tropospheric NO2, SO2, and H2CO. We also quantify the emissions of NOx and SO2 at both measurement sites.We show that tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) measurements using airborne mapping instruments are well suited for satellite validation in principle. The signal-to-noise ratio of the airborne NO2 measurements is an order of magnitude higher than its space-borne counterpart when the airborne measurements are averaged at the TROPOMI pixel scale. However, we show that the temporal variation of the NO2 VCDs during a flight might be a significant source of comparison error. Considering the random error of the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCD (sigma), the dynamic range of the NO2 VCDs field extends from detection limit up to 37 sigma (2.6 x 10(16) molec.cm(-2)) and 29 sigma (2 x10(16) molec.cm(-2)) for Bucharest and the Jiu Valley, respectively. For both areas, we simulate validation exercises applied to the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 product. These simulations indicate that a comparison error budget closely matching the TROPOMI optimal target accuracy of 25% can be obtained by adding NO2 and aerosol profile information to the airborne mapping observations, which constrains the investigated accuracy to within 28 %. In addition to NO2, our study also addresses the measurements of SO2 emissions from power plants in the Jiu Valley and an urban hotspot of H2CO in the centre of Bucharest. For these two species, we conclude that the best validation strategy would consist of deploying ground-based measurement systems at well-identified locations.

TI  - Rapid shoreline flooding enhances water turbidity by sediment resuspension: An example in a large Tibetan lake
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid water level rise due to climate change has the potential to remobilize loose sediments along shorelines and increase the turbidity of nearshore waters, thereby impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. Siling Lake is one of the largest and most rapidly expanding lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. Between 2000 and 2017, this lake experienced an increase in water level of about 8 m and a doubling in water turbidity. Here, using this lake as a study site, we used a wave model and high-resolution remote sensing of turbidity (Landsat-8) to assess the potential connection between water-level rise, enhanced wind-driven sediment resuspension and water turbidity. Our analysis revealed that strong bottom shear stresses triggered by wind-generated waves over newly flooded areas were related to an increase in water turbidity. The spatial variability of Siling Lake turbidity showed a strong dependence on local wind characteristics and fetch. Two factors combined to drive the increase in turbidity: (1) high wave energy leading to high bottom shear stresses, and (2) flooding of unvegetated shallow areas. Using a new relationship between wave energy and turbidity developed here, we expect the increase in turbidity of Siling Lake to taper off in the near future due to the steep landscape surrounding the lake that will prevent further flooding. Our results imply that rising water levels along the coast are not only expected to influence terrestrial ecosystems but could also change water quality. The methodology presented herein could be applied to other shorelines affected by a rapid increase in water level. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Sensitivity of PolSAR decomposition to forest disturbance and regrowth dynamics in a managed forest
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Managed forests, dynamic with activities of harvest and afforestation, have become an area of imminent research opportunity to understand the effects of these disturbances and regrowth dynamics. As low frequency polarized radar signals have the ability to penetrate forest canopies, the fully polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data gives an ideal representation of conditions in the forest. However, this valuable information has not been optimally utilized in understanding the forest disturbances and regrowth dynamics. Several forest change monitoring studies have been performed using single or dual polarization SAR data, whereas limited studies utilized full polarimetric information. In this study, L-band ALOS/PALSAR and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 fully polarimetric data is used to study and understand the behavioural dynamics of homogeneous and heterogeneous forest compartments having single and multiple species composition, respectively. Radar scattering pattern of different species, and its variation with respect to phenology, disturbances, harvesting and plantation regrowth are analysed to understand the trend in scattering components with respect to above said forest changes. Based on the scattering properties and their analyses, a two stage rule based classifier has been developed to categorize the forest based on its disturbance and regrowth status into disturbed, re-growth, stable/no change and non forest classes. The classifier performed with, considerably, high accuracy having an overall accuracy of 85.39% and a kappa coefficient of 0.8. The classifier developed in this work presents the potential of fully polarimetric data in understanding the level and extent of disturbances and regrowth dynamics of a forest. (c) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - Extraction of urban built-up surfaces and its subclasses using existing built-up indices with separability analysis of spectrally mixed classes in AVIRIS-NG imagery
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the urban environments and their spatio-temporal behavior is necessary for local and regional planning along with environmental management. For monitoring and analyzing the urban environment, remote sensing imagery has been widely used due to its ability for repetitive coverage over large geographical areas. Compared with conventional per-pixel and sub-pixel analysis of remote sensing imagery, spectral indices have noticeable advantages because of their easy implementation and fast execution. However, most of the spectral indices are designed for multispectral imagery to extract only one land cover class, and confusion between other land cover classes still persists. This research explores the most significant spectral bands in AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral imagery for detection of built-up surfaces and its subclasses i.e. roads and roofs. Further, this study utilizes existing built-up indices for detection of urban built-up surfaces in the first level followed by its subcategories in the second level. Finally, a separability analysis between spectrally mixed urban land cover classes using various measures is also addressed. Results of the analysis indicate that BSI, NBI, and BAEI can prove to be effective for extraction of built-up surfaces with an overall accuracy (OA) of 93.89%, 90.11%, and 85.15%, respectively. Further, REI with OA of 94.40% appears to be suitable for extraction of road surfaces while NBAI with 95% OA can prove its efficacy for extraction of rooftops in AVIRIS-NG imagery. It also concludes that, for aforesaid indices, built-up surfaces (Level-1 and 2) can be effectively separated from the bare soil in hyperspectral imagery with slight confusion between road and roof surfaces.

TI  - Use of hedgerows by mammals in an intensive agricultural landscape
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification causes habitat modification, sometimes leading to habitat loss and subsequent loss of connectivity. Remaining species in these agriculture-dominated landscapes often use hedgerows, such as windbreaks or riparian strips, as movement corridors or even as habitats. However, the understanding of the use of these hedgerows by mammals is limited and could be improved with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, which are unbiased, detailed and repeatable. The aim of this study was to assess the attributes that affect medium- and large-sized mammals' use of hedgerows, with in situ and remotely sensed data (including LiDAR and multispectral images) in an agriculture-dominated landscape in southern Quebec. Twenty-three hedgerows were selected and characterized with both field surveys and remote sensing analyses, like LiDAR metrics and vegetation indices. Wildlife frequentation of each hedgerow was measured using camera traps, from late spring to early fall in 2018. 431 mammal detections were obtained among all 23 hedgerows. From this, seven species were recorded, all of them opportunistic and well adapted to agricultural environment. Results showed significant differences in mammal use of hedgerows. Coefficients of the better-ranked models based on AICc indicated a positive relationship between hedgerow length and their use by mammals, and a negative relationship with the hedgerow width. Hedgerow use by mammals also increased as tree cover and understory density increased, and as human disturbance decreased. These results characterized for the first time the variables influencing hedgerow use by a broad set of medium- and large-sized mammal species and confirmed their use as movement corridors and/or habitat. This study also confirmed the complementary usefulness of variables derived from remote sensing combined with field data. The low explanatory power of variables often cited in the literature (e.g. NDVI, gappiness) also highlights the need to further explore their specific influence on mammals. The information provided by this study supports the beneficial role played by hedgerows for wildlife conservation in intensive agricultural landscapes. Management guidelines are provided as well as future research avenues.

TI  - Foraging ecology of the common dolphin <i>Delphinus delphis</i> revealed by stable isotope analysis
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dolphins are among the largest and most diverse predators in marine ecosystems, but our understanding of their foraging ecology, which is crucial for ecosystem management, is poor. Delphinus delphis (common dolphins) are found in tropical and temperate waters globally. Stomach content studies indicate they are opportunistic predators that feed locally on abundant small pelagic schooling fish, but information is lacking on how their diet may vary seasonally and with ontogeny. We investigated effects of body length, sex, season, and year on D. delphis diet in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analysis of 56 skin samples collected during 13 years (2004-2016). Dolphin delta N-15 values changed with body length, suggesting ontogenetic dietary variation. Nitrogen isotope values were higher in austral autumn/winter compared to spring/summer, whilst delta C-13 values decreased throughout the study period, suggesting temporal changes in primary productivity likely affecting the dolphins' diet. Sex had a minor effect on dolphin delta C-13 values, with male and female isotopic niches overlapping by 62.6% and 45.2% (respectively). Our results provide a baseline for detecting future changes in the trophic ecology of D. delphis in a key habitat in New Zealand and highlight their role as a sentinel species in this coastal ecosystem.

TI  - Estimation of daily CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and of the components of the carbon budget for winter wheat by the assimilation of Sentinel 2-like remote sensing data into a crop model
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Croplands contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but also have the potential to mitigate climate change through soil carbon storage. However, there is a lack of tools based on objective observations for assessing cropland C budgets at the plot scale over large areas. Such tools would allow us to more precisely establish the contribution of an agricultural plot to net CO2 emissions according to the plot management and identify levers for improving the C budget. In this study, we present a diagnostic regional modelling approach, called SAFY-CO2, that assimilates high spatial and temporal resolution (HSTR) optical remote sensing data in a simple crop model and evaluate the performance of this approach in quantifying crop production and the main components of the annual carbon budget for winter wheat.The SAFY-CO2 model simulates daily crop development (biomass, partition to leaves, etc.), the components of net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and the annual yield and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB).Multi-temporal green area index (GAI) maps derived from HSTR data from the Formosat-2 and SPOT satellites were used to calibrate the light-use efficiency and phenological parameters of the model. Data from the literature were used to set a priori values for a set of model parameters, and a large dataset of in situ data was used for model validation. This dataset includes 8 years of eddy-covariance net CO2 flux measurements and GAL biomass and yield data acquired at 2 instrumented sites in southwest France. Biomass and yield data from 16 fields in the study area between 2005 and 2014 were also used for validation.The SAFY-CO2 model is able to reproduce both GAI dynamics (RRMSE = 14%, R-2 = 0.97) and biomass production and yield (RRMSE of 27% and 21%, respectively) with high precisions under contrasting climatic, environmental and management conditions. Additionally, the net CO2 flux components estimated by the model generally agreed well with in situ data and presented very good and significant correlations (RMSE of 1.74, 1.13 and 1.29 gC.m(-2).d for GPP, R-eco and NEE, respectively; R-2 of 0.90, 0.75 and 0.85 for GPP, R-eco and NEE, respectively) over the 8 studied years. This study also highlights the importance of accounting for post-harvest vegetative events (spontaneous re-growth, weed development and cover crops) for an accurate calculation of the annual net CO2 flux. This approach requires a limited number of input parameters for estimating yield and net CO2 flux components, which is promising for regional/global-scale applications based on Sentinel 2-like data; however, the approach requires plot-scale data concerning organic amendments and straw management (exportation) in animal farming systems to calculate field C budgets.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess land use dynamics of Southwestern coastal Bangladesh using multi-temporal Landsat images. Future trend was done by CA-ANN model. Hybrid image classification method and estimation of land surface temperature along with field survey were accomplished. This study revealed that vegetation decreased significantly (11.75%) and converted mostly into wetlands whereas built-up area slightly increased (1.44%) during 2000 to 2016. According to FGD (focused Group Discussion), a major occupational transformation (from agriculture to shrimp cultivation) and internal migration towards nearby Cities are prominent here. Besides, maximum land surface temperature increased by 12.5 degrees C during this period as a result of land use change. Simulated land use model of 2024 revealed that 2.49% of settlement would diminish especially from southern region if any natural calamity occurs. Finally, a comprehensive land use management plan has been suggested in this study to establish a balanced and diversified use of coastal land.

AB  - The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image interpretation methods such as colour composite images (false colour composite, true colour composite) were adapted to capture the image for interpreting the visible and shortwave infrared raw bands and thus generating the mapping for the ultramafic terrain. ASTER colour composite image generated from shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands 8 and 4 and NIR band 3 shows contrast signature for the presence of rock types in the ultramafic terrain. The low and high silica percentages to be interpreted through the absorption features of the spectral range from 8.1 to 12 mu m. The combinations used to map silica index are of bands 10, 11 and 7 as RGB. PCA was applied to SWIR and visible and near-infrared spectral bands and from PCA output PC 6, 2 and 1 used in the generation of RGB colour composite. Hence, the results of PCA processed image highlights the magnesite mining area by dark red colour. The minimum noise fraction transform (B1, B2, B4) in RGB applied to ASTER image to focus on the overlapped rock types inclusive of magnesite and the same achieved as sharp image output. ASTER band ratios (R3/1, G4/5 and B6/8) in RGB calculated in which the numerator represents shoulders of absorption, and the denominator represents nearest absorption band. Thus, this combination indicates clearly the magnesite mining area in blue colour. The relative band depth in thermal infrared (TIR) bands (B13 and B14) correlated to find the carbonate index is high, medium and low through the pixel ratio output of the ultramafic terrain. Preprocessing of ASTER data involved atmospheric correction using FLAASH algorithm. The minimum noise fraction transform reduces the spectral dimensionality of data in a linear combination of bands. Spectral angle mapper and support vector machines are supervised classification technique adopted that are key learning models with the aid of analyse and categorization of data. The classification defends user, producer, overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The magnesite mining area and adjust rock samples were field observed, and the mapping of the ultramafic terrain supports the output achieved through chosen ASTER band colour composite, band ratios, relative band depth, silica index, PCA, minimum noise fraction and pixel classification. Thus, a more informative lithological map for the ultramafic terrain generated to discriminate magnesite-mining region.

AB  - Fire is among the major disasters leading to biodiversity loss and climate change. Analysing high temporal resolution data over space and time can provide critical inputs for environmental management. The present study attempted to analyse fire occurrences to determine the distribution of vegetation fire hotspots in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar. The spatial statistics and space-time pattern mining tools are used for investigating fire trends that occurred across vegetated landscapes over a period of 16 years. This study found a total of 2,352,063 active vegetation fire locations using daily MODIS data from 2003 to 2018. Mann-Kendall test has identified the statistically significant trend of fire hotspots across forests, scrub, grasslands, agriculture, and plantations. The emerging hotspot analysis detected considerable spatial variation across fire hotspots and identified the geographical clusters of fire hotspots across the South Asian countries and Myanmar. The fires showed variations with an increasing or decreasing trend or no statistically significant trend in different land cover types across the eight countries. The emerging hotspot analysis found the dominance of sporadic hotspots and persistent hotspots.

TI  - Significant contribution of small icebergs to the freshwater budget in Greenland fjords
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Icebergs represent nearly half of the mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and provide a distributed source of freshwater along fjords which can alter fjord circulation, nutrient levels, and ultimately the Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here we present analyses of high resolution optical satellite imagery using convolutional neural networks to accurately delineate iceberg edges in two East Greenland fjords. We find that a significant portion of icebergs in fjords are comprised of small icebergs that were not detected in previously-available coarser resolution satellite images. We show that the preponderance of small icebergs results in high freshwater delivery, as well as a short life span of icebergs in fjords. We conclude that an inability to identify small icebergs leads to inaccurate frequency-size distribution of icebergs in Greenland fjords, an underestimation of iceberg area (specifically for small icebergs), and an overestimation of iceberg life span. Small icebergs comprise a significant fraction of icebergs in Greenland fjords and have fallen below the detection and resolution limit of earlier satellite data, suggest analyses of high-resolution imagery with deep neural networks.

AB  - Comprehensive observational experiments on atmospheric aerosol particles were conducted over Nanjing. Aerosol particles were detected vertically in real time by polarization micro pulse lidar (PMPL). To improve the accuracy of the lidar ratio, we combined observational data from ground-based polarization lidar and a sun photometer. Furthermore, the influence of meteorological conditions on vertically-resolved aerosol optical properties was analyzed. On the other hand, sources of aerosol pollution were analyzed using backward air mass trajectory, the potential and source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) models. Aerosol types were identified from PMPL data, sun photometer and cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations (CALIPSO). Accordingly, a large number of coarse-mode aerosol particles (pure sand-dust particles predominate) from North China appeared in spring, and smoke aerosol particles were generated from biomass combustion in autumn. The study shows that the local emission and regional transport are both important contributors to aerosol pollution events.

AB  - The severe haze pollution episode from December 1 to 10, 2013 occurred in Shanghai area, and seriously threatened human health and transportation safety. As regional air pollution, it is practical significance to the rapid monitoring and comprehensive analysis for haze treatment. Based on the moderate resolution imaging spectro- radiometer (MODIS) and cloud-aerosol LiDAR with orthogonal polarization (CALIOP) data, via combing with meteorological features during the haze pollution period, the current study analyzed and explored the spatial distribution, aerosol vertical structure, source and migration path of haze pollution. The results showed that: (1) There are obvious aerosol layers over Shanghai area, aerosol optical depth (AOD) fluctuates frequently and has distinctive features such as complexity, regionality and seasonality. (2) The aerosol layer is mainly at the heights ranging from 0 to 2 km and composed mostly of spherical aerosol but there is also non-spherical aerosol. (3) The total backscattering intensity of aerosol is centralized at the heights ranging from 0 to 1 km, especially at the heights ranging from 0 to 0.5 km. (4) The haze pollution episode was affected by both specific meteorological factors and migration of the non-local particles in the surrounding areas and northern China.

TI  - A multiscale approach to identifying spatiotemporal pattern of habitat selection for red-crowned cranes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective conservation measures largely depend on knowledge of habitat selection of target species. Little is known about the scale characteristics and temporal rhythm of habitat selection of the endangered red-crowned crane, limiting the habitat conservation. Here, two red-crowned cranes were tracked with Global position system (GPS) for two years in Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR). A multiscale approach was developed to identify the spatiotemporal pattern of habitat selection of red-crowned cranes. The results revealed that Red-crowned cranes preferred to select Scirpus mariqueter, ponds, Suaeda salsa, and Phragmites austrolis, and avoid Sparlina oltemiflora. In each season, habitat selection ratio for Scirpus mariqueter and ponds was the highest during the day and night, respectively. Further multiscale analysis showed that the percent coverage of Scirpus mariqueter at the 200-m to 500-m scale was the most important predictor for all habitat selection modeling, emphasizing the importance of restoring a large area of Scirpus mariqueter habitat for red-crowned crane population restoration. Additionally, other variables affect habitat selection at different scales, and their contributions vary with seasonal and circadian rhythm. Furthermore, habitat suitability was mapped to provide a direct basis for habitat management. The suitable area of daytime and nighttime habitat accounted for 5.4%-19.0% and 4.6%102% of the study area, respectively, implying the urgency of restoration. The study highlighted the scale and temporal rhythms of habitat selection for various endangered species that depend on small habitats. The proposed multiscale approach applies to the restoration and management of habitats of various endangered species. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of dominating aerosol properties and their long-term trend in the Pan-Third Pole region: A study with 10-year multi-sensor measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pan-Third Pole (PTP), stretching from Eastern Asia to Middle-central Europe, has experienced unprecedented accelerated warming and even retreat of glaciers. Absorbing aerosols reduce snow and ice albedo and radiative forcing, consequently enhancing a great melting of snow cover and ice sheet in the PTP. Employing the 10-year (2007-2016) space-based active and passive measurements, this study investigated the distribution, optical properties and decadal trends for dominating aerosols at a seasonal scale in the PTP divided into six subregions. Results showed that the sub-regions of PTP were mainly dominated by dust, polluted dust and elevated smoke. The Taklimakan Desert (TD) and the Iranian Plateau (IP) were dominated by mineral dust, accounting for 96% and 86% of the total aerosol extinction while the Central Europe (CE), Indo-China (IC) and Anatolia Plateau (AP) were dominated by the mixture of the dominating aerosol types. The mean aerosol extinction coefficient (MAEC) showed an obvious variability depending on the sub-regions and a tendency of decreasing with an increase in the topographic height. The strongest extinction layer (>0.1 km(-1)) mainly occurred below 4 km and the weak extinction layers (>0.001 km(-1)) were mainly distributed between 5 km and 8 km, indicating pronounced vertical transport in the region. The decadal trends of columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed a relation with the contributions of the dominating aerosol types. For example, significant upward or downward trends of total aerosol loading in the IC region were driven by elevated smoke while the AOD trends of total aerosol loading for the CE, the AP and the IP were driven by the dominating aerosol types. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), the cleanest region in the PTP, has been regularly exposed to polluted air masses with significant amounts of absorbing aerosols. Therefore, understanding the dominating aerosol types, properties and decadal trends in the PTP region will contribute considerably to assessing their effects on radiative forcing, climate change, and even snowmelt and glacier retreat.

TI  - Design and Calibration of a Dual-Frame Force and Torque Sensor
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a dual-frame six-axis force and torque (F/T) sensor is proposed. The dual-frame F/T sensor consists of inner and outer elastic parts for simultaneously measuring F-x, F-y, and T-z as well as T-x, T-y, and F-z. Load-strain equations were derived according to beam theory and structure theory. These equations and optimization methods were used to establish the parameter design process of the F/T sensor. A calibration machine is proposed to generate a large number of multiaxis training and testing F/T sets for sensor calibration. The calibration results from the least square method and neural network (NN) model revealed the coupling and nonlinearity of the multiaxis F/T sensor. The dual-frame structure reduced the coupling effect between the inner-frame and outer-frame measuring F/Ts. Therefore, the calibration process could be simplified using two tri-axis F/T sets with NN models. The calibration process was verified using six-axis testing F/T sets, and a mean calibration error of 0.25% was observed.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Yangtze River Delta region of China using random forest model and the Top-of-Atmosphere reflectance
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies that have used remote sensing data to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations mainly focused on the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) with moderate-to-low spatial resolution. However, the complex process of retrieving AOD from satellite Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance always generates the missingness of AOD values due to the limitation of AOD retrieval algorithms. This study validated the possibility of using satellite TOA reflectance for estimating PM2.5 concentrations, rather than using conventional AOD products retrieved from remote sensing imageries. Given that the TOA-PM2.5 relationship cannot be accurately expressed by simple linear correlation, we developed a random forest model that integrated satellite TOA reflectance from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 1B product, meteorological fields and land-use variables to estimate the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The highly-polluted Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of eastern China was employed as our study case. The results showed that our model performed well with a site-based and a time-based CV R-2 of 0.92 and 0.88, respectively. The derived annual and seasonal distributions of PM2.5 concentrations exhibited high PM2.5 values in northern YRD region (i.e., Jiangsu province) and relatively low values in southern region (i.e., Zhejiang province), which shared a similar distribution trend with the observed PM2.5 concentrations. This study demonstrated the outstanding performance of random forest model using satellite TOA reflectance, and also provided an effective method for remotely sensed PM2.5 estimation in regions where AOD retrievals are unavailable.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in global vegetation growth and its drivers during recent decades have been well studied with satellite data, ecosystem models and field experiments. However, a systematic understanding of how global vegetation will respond to projected changes in climate and atmospheric composition is still lacking. Here, we analyze changes in projected global leaf area index (LAI) from 16 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) and 17 phase 6 (CMIP6) Earth System Models (ESMs) during the 21st century under future scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and future scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. In addition to the widely-used mull-model ensemble mean (MME) method, we employed the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) strategy to integrate the modeled results. The REA integration weights were determined by combining the performance of the ESMs in simulating present-day LAI changes, which was based on a comparison with three long-term remote sensing LAI data sets, with their convergence of future predictions. The results suggest that global LAI will increase under all seven future scenarios with both integration methods. The magnitude of LAI growth is expected to increase with the forcing levels of the scenarios. The ESMs integrated with the REA weights predicted significantly smaller magnitudes and lower uncertainties in global LAI growth by the end of the 21st century than those integrated with the MME method. Both REA and MME results suggest that the growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration is the main positive driver of the projected increment of global LAI, which is partly offset by the negative effects of global warming. Our improved comprehensive prediction based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 ESMs using the REA integration strategy provides a more robust estimation of global vegetation change during the 21st century, and is expected to help better understand the state of the planet in the coming decades.

TI  - A modified SWAP model for soil water and heat dynamics and seed-maize growth under film mulching
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model fails to consider the impacts of plastic film mulching on soil moisture and heat regimes, and crop growth and yield. In this study, SWAP model was modified in the modules of precipitation interception, soil evaporation, soil temperature, and crop growth to accommodate the changes of soil moisture and soil temperature caused by film mulching and the consequent variation of crop growth. The modified SWAP model was compared with original SWAP model. Here, the original model showed the case where there was no film mulching effect under the same input conditions as the modified model. The models were calibrated and validated by a field experiment of seed-maize conducted in the Shiyang River Basin of Northwest China in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The experiment included three drip irrigation treatments under film mulching conditions, i.e., WF (full irrigation), WM (medium irrigation, 70%WF), WL (low irrigation, 40%WF). Results showed the normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs) for soil water storage (SWS), soil temperature at 0, 5, 10, 20 cm soil depths, leaf area index (LAI), aboveground dry biomass (ADB) and yield under different irrigation treatments for the three seasons by the modified model were 14.8%, 43.5% (an averaged value for the 4 soil depths), 70.5%, 56.4% and 82.1% lower than those of the original model, respectively, which demonstrated higher simulation accuracy of the modified model for mulched field. The modified model could more accurately depict the changes of the SWS and LAI caused by the film mulching at various growth stages. It could also reveal the enhanced soil temperature by film mulching especially at the early stage (0-60 day after sowing (DAS)). We analyzed the film mulching effects by comparing the simulation results of the modified model and the original model which could represent the difference between film mulching and no mulching. Results showed that soil evaporation and evapotranspiration under film mulching conditions were 60.7% and 10.1% lower while crop transpiration was 20.2% higher compared with no mulching. The yield and water use efficiency (WUE) under film mulching conditions improved by 38.9% and 54.3% compared with no mulching. Film mulching had more significant influence on the SWS, LAI, ADB, yield, crop transpiration and WUE under WL treatment than under WF and WM treatments.

TI  - Understanding deep learning in land use classification based on Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of deep learning (DL) approaches for the analysis of remote sensing (RS) data is rapidly increasing. DL techniques have provided excellent results in applications ranging from parameter estimation to image classification and anomaly detection. Although the vast majority of studies report precision indicators, there is a lack of studies dealing with the interpretability of the predictions. This shortcoming hampers a wider adoption of DL approaches by a wider users community, as model's decisions are not accountable. In applications that involve the management of public budgets or policy compliance, a better interpretability of predictions is strictly required. This work aims to deepen the understanding of a recurrent neural network for land use classification based on Sentinel-2 time series in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This permits to address the relevance of predictors in the classification process leading to an improved understanding of the behaviour of the network. The conducted analysis demonstrates that the red and near infrared Sentinel-2 bands convey the most useful information. With respect to the temporal information, the features derived from summer acquisitions were the most influential. These results contribute to the understanding of models used for decision making in the CAP to accomplish the European Green Deal (EGD) designed in order to counteract climate change, to protect biodiversity and ecosystems, and to ensure a fair economic return for farmers.

TI  - Social and Economic Political Ideology Consistently Operate as Mutual Suppressors: Implications for Personality, Social, and Political Psychology
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Right-left political views can be decomposed into distinct economic and social dimensions that bear differing relations with external criteria. In three community samples (totalN= 1,487), we identified replicable suppressor situations in which statistically controlling for either social or economic political ideology increased the other ideology dimension's relations with variables reflecting cognitive rigidity, authoritarianism, dangerous worldview, and lethal partisanship. Specifically, positive bivariate relations between social conservatism and these outcomes were enhanced after controlling for economic conservatism, whereas, after controlling for social conservatism, positive bivariate relations between economic conservatism and external criteria became negative and negative bivariate relations were enhanced. We identified similar, albeit less consistent, suppressor phenomena for general personality. Taken together, our results suggest that social and economic conservatism differ substantially in their psychological implications, and that following statistical control, these differences emerge in samples in which social and economic conservatism are highly positively correlated.

TI  - Vehicle Emission Detection in Data-Driven Methods
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental protection is a fundamental policy in many countries, where the vehicle emission pollution turns to be outstanding as a main component of pollutions in environmental monitoring. Remote sensing technology has been widely used on vehicle emission detection recently and this is mainly due to the fast speed, reality, and large scale of the detection data retrieved from remote sensing methods. In the remote sensing process, the information about the fuel type and registration time of new cars and nonlocal registered vehicles usually cannot be accessed, leading to the failure in assessing vehicle pollution situations directly by analyzing emission pollutants. To handle this problem, this paper adopts data mining methods to analyze the remote sensing data to predict fuel type and registration time. This paper takes full use of decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, XgBoost, and their fusion models to successfully make precise prediction for these two essential information and further employ them to an essential application: vehicle emission evaluation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The microwave region for remote sensing is more capable than the optical region due to its active mode of remote sensing techniques. Active remote sensing is usually an independent remote sensing technique which can operate anytime, and in all weather conditions like rain to provide information about the object. The error propagates or multiplies while we acquire or transform the data into various formats. Radar images face several errors like calibration error, geometric error, speckle noise, and to remove these, some efficient techniques for preprocessing of radar images are required. The speckle noise occurs due to the addition of unwanted echoes from the earth surface, which decreases the quality of the image, which causes difficulty in image interpretation. Moreover, interpretation is the main reason behind describing the key features to extract some valuable information for societal applications. As, speckle noise can destroy edge information, shapes, and tone of the features, therefore, there is a requirement to work on the speckle noise removal to reduce/remove with various techniques for various applications.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements follow the growth and senescence of vegetation aid in monitoring crop development within and across growing seasons. For example, identifying when crops reach their peak growth stage or modeling the seasonal growing cycle is useful for agronomists and climatologists. In this paper, we analyze remote sensing data from an intensively cultivated agricultural region in the Midwest to provide new information about crop phenology. There is both a temporal and spatial dimension to the data as they are collected every 12 - 36 hours over regions approximately the size of a 45 km diameter circle. We represent the measurements using a functional data approach and account for spatial dependence between locations through the functional curve coefficients. Modeling across multiple growing years, and including growing degree days as a covariate, we estimate the timing for when crops reach their peak each season and make predictions at unobserved locations. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

AB  - Corroboration of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-17 (GOES-17) wildland fire detection capabilities occurred during the 24 October 2019 (evening of 23 October LST) ignition of the Kincade Fire in northern California. Post-analysis of remote sensing data compared to observations by the ALERTWildfire fire surveillance video system suggests that the emerging Kincade Fire hotspot was visually evident in GOES17 shortwave infrared imagery 52 s after the initial near-infrared heat source detected by the ground-based camera network. GOES-17 Advanced Baseline Imager Fire Detection Characteristic algorithms registered the fire 5 min after ignition. These observations represent the first documented comparative dataset between fire initiation and satellite detection, and thus provide context for GOES-16/17 wildland fire detections.

TI  - Leveraging spatial textures, through machine learning, to identify aerosols and distinct cloud types from multispectral observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Current cloud and aerosol identification methods for multispectral radiometers, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), employ multi-channel spectral tests on individual pixels (i.e., fields of view). The use of the spatial information in cloud and aerosol algorithms has been primarily through statistical parameters such as nonuniformity tests of surrounding pixels with cloud classification provided by the multispectral microphysical retrievals such as phase and cloud top height. With these methodologies there is uncertainty in identifying optically thick aerosols, since aerosols and clouds have similar spectral properties in coarse-spectral-resolution measurements. Furthermore, identifying clouds regimes (e.g., stratiform, cumuliform) from just spectral measurements is difficult, since low-altitude cloud regimes have similar spectral properties. Recent advances in computer vision using deep neural networks provide a new opportunity to better leverage the coherent spatial information in multispectral imagery. Using a combination of machine learning techniques combined with a new methodology to create the necessary training data, we demonstrate improvements in the discrimination between cloud and severe aerosols and an expanded capability to classify cloud types. The labeled training dataset was created from an adapted NASA Worldview platform that provides an efficient user interface to assemble a human-labeled database of cloud and aerosol types. The convolutional neural network (CNN) labeling accuracy of aerosols and cloud types was quantified using independent Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and MODIS cloud and aerosol products. By harnessing CNNs with a unique labeled dataset, we demonstrate the improvement of the identification of aerosols and distinct cloud types from MODIS and VIIRS images compared to a per-pixel spectral and standard deviation thresholding method. The paper concludes with case studies that compare the CNN methodology results with the MODIS cloud and aerosol products.

TI  - Contrasting stripes are a widespread feature of group living in birds, mammals and fishes
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Grouping is a widespread form of predator defence, with individuals in groups often performing evasive collective movements in response to attack by predators. Individuals in these groups use behavioural rules to coordinate their movements, with visual cues about neighbours' positions and orientations often informing movement decisions. Although the exact visual cues individuals use to coordinate their movements with neighbours have not yet been decoded, some studies have suggested that stripes, lines, or other body patterns may act as conspicuous conveyors of movement information that could promote coordinated group movement, or promote dazzle camouflage, thereby confusing predators. We used phylogenetic logistic regressions to test whether the contrasting achromatic stripes present in four different taxa vulnerable to predation, including species within two orders of birds (Anseriformes and Charadriiformes), a suborder of Artiodactyla (the ruminants), and several orders of marine fishes (predominantly Perciformes) were associated with group living. Contrasting patterns were significantly more prevalent in social species, and tended to be absent in solitary species or species less vulnerable to predation. We suggest that stripes taking the form of light-coloured lines on dark backgrounds, orvice versa,provide a widespread mechanism across taxa that either serves to inform conspecifics of neighbours' movements, or to confuse predators, when moving in groups. Because detection and processing of patterns and of motion in the visual channel is essentially colour-blind, diverse animal taxa with widely different vision systems (including mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrachromats) appear to have converged on a similar use of achromatic patterns, as would be expected given signal-detection theory. This hypothesis would explain the convergent evolution of conspicuous achromatic patterns as an antipredator mechanism in numerous vertebrate species.

TI  - Breast Ultrasound Versus MRI in Prediction of Pathologic Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer: A systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL SONOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is widely used to treat breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection in patients who convert to node-negative status, after NAC. However, few studies have evaluated the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in determining axillary lymph node status after NAC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of breast US and MRI in predicting a response to NAC, for breast cancer.Methods: A systematic search, in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, for original studies was performed. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Patient, study, and imaging characteristics were extracted, and sufficient data were used to reconstruct 2 x 2 tables. Data pooling, heterogeneity testing, forest plot construction, meta-regression analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed using Meta-DiSc and Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).Results: Nine studies met all the eligibility criteria and were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 0.78 and 0.92, while the corresponding values for US were 0.80 and 0.90, respectively. The prevalence of pathologic complete response (pCR), among breast cancer patients, after neoadjuvant therapy was 26%. The prevalence of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-, and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive tumors were 65%, 22%, and 37%, respectively.Conclusion: These results showed that MRI and US have almost the same accuracy in predicting pCR in patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant surgery. There is still a need for further investigations to prove that US is not inferior to MRI for this diagnosis.

Anvil clouds appear as broad areas of highly reflective and cold pixels relative to the darker and warmer clear sky background, often with embedded textured and colder pixels that indicate updrafts and gravity waves. These characteristics would suggest that creating automated anvil cloud detection products useful for weather forecasting and research should be straightforward, yet in practice such product development can be challenging. Some anvil detection methods have used reflectance or temperature thresholding, but anvil reflectance varies significantly throughout a day as a function of combined solar illumination and satellite viewing geometry, and anvil cloud top temperature varies as a function of convective equilibrium level and tropopause height. This paper highlights a technique for facilitating anvil cloud detection based on visible observations that relies on comparative analysis with expected cloud reflectance for a given set of angles, thereby addressing limitations of previous methods. A 1-year database of anvil-identified pixels, as determined from IR observations, from several geostationary satellites was used to construct a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to quantify typical anvil reflectance across almost all expected viewing, solar, and azimuth angle configurations, in addition to the reflectance uncertainty for each angular bin. Application of the BRDF model for cloud optical depth retrieval in deep convection is described as well.

TI  - The impact of axillary node surgery on outcomes following immediate breast reconstruction
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) has become the most common method for postmastectomy reconstruction. Axillary lymph node dissection is performed for the staging of patients, but the impact of IBR with nodal surgery on postoperative complications remains elusive. The present study aims to investigate the impact of concomitant axillary lymph node surgery on postoperative complications. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent IBR from 2000 to 2014. We recorded and analyzed patient data to determine the association between nodal surgery and postsurgical complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to elucidate the risk of a complication given nodal surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and type of incision for nodal access. A total of 986 breast reconstructions were included for analysis. Overall incidence of postoperative complications per breast that received nodal surgery was 35.9% (n = 230/642), compared to 25.6% (n = 88/344) in breasts that did not have concomitant nodal surgery (P = .001). Nodal surgery was found to increase risk of all complications with an odds ratio of 1.62 (P = .001). Moreover, complications were significantly higher in patients whose nodes were accessed via mastectomy incision (39.4%) when compared to a separate incision (33.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that nodal sampling through the mastectomy incision is a significant risk factor for seroma, with an odds ratio of 3.60 (P = .002). We did not observe differences in breast complications in patients who underwent SLNB vs ALND. These factors should be taken into account in the approach to breast reconstruction during lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Awaking to Mutual, Reciprocal Need in Plague and Epidemic Disease: The Origins of Early Christian Health Care
T2  - LINACRE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the early Christian Church demonstrates a deep desire to relieve physical suffering, the Greco-Roman world in which it developed lacked the same impetus to respond to human need, especially in the context of epidemic or communicable disease. Christianity's dedication to health care, and its belief that assisting the sick constituted an absolute obligation, distinguished early Christianity from its contemporary cultural milieu which regularly ignored and excluded the sick. The novelty of the Christian approach to healing can be traced to the early church's unique recognition of human need. This vision of human need, which ultimately replaced the secular Greco-Roman emphasis on reciprocal philanthropy and providing assistance only to the worthy, is clearly exemplified in the life of Christ, in responses to plague and in the writings of John Chrysostom and the Cappadocian Fathers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus. An analysis of these sources demonstrates that the early Christian Church viewed the sick not only as persons to be assisted insofar as they shared a common human nature but also individuals necessary for the salvation of the broader community as a whole. The early church's emphasis on reciprocal interdependence between healthy and sick eliminated the boundaries traditionally established between these two groups and transformed long-standing notions of contagious disease. Ultimately, the development of these attitudes toward the sick originates in a deeper truth which underlies the Christian healthcare tradition both in the ancient world and in the modern era: humanity's profound and mutual need of God, before whom all are spiritually ill.

TI  - Monitoring of Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection Using Multi-temporal Remote Sensing and Time Series Analysis of Qena-Luxor Governorates (QLGs), Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, rapid land use land cover (LULC) changes have continuously taken place in many regions all over the world as a result of human activities. In the present study, the changes in LULC were analyzed by means of multi-temporal remote sensing of Qena-Luxor Governorates in Egypt between 1984 and 2018. In order to map and monitor the land use land cover changes, several remotely sensed data were applied to create multi-maps using (1) the normalized difference vegetation index and (2) supervised classification of Landsat images using field chick and accuracy assessment, including field verification and Google Earth Professional. Therefore, the lands in the study area can be classified as follows: (1) agricultural lands, (2) built-up areas, (3) water bodies, (4) reclaimed lands, and (5) desert lands. The results indicate that agricultural lands grew from an average of 1238.7 km(2)(9.8%) in 1984 to 1707.04 km(2)(13.40%) in 2018 and urban lands increased from 345.2 km(2)(2.7%) in 1984 to 445.28 km(2)(3.5%) in 2019. Furthermore, the reclaimed lands increased approximately from 4379.7 km(2)in 1984 (i.e., 34.4% of the total study area) to 4521.05 km(2)in 2000 (35.507%). However, this class was followed by a marked decline to 4373.51 km(2)(34.35%) between 2000 and 2010 and then increased to approximately 4442 km(2)(34.89%) between 2010 and 2018. Desert lands (limestone plateau and some lowland desert fringes) decreased from 6635.4 km(2)(52.2%) to 6003.5 km(2)(47.15%). The results showed that the overall accuracy of the supervised classification of Landsat satellite images ranges from 87 to 92.5% while kappa statistics were from 0.83 to 90.

TI  - Langer's arch: A rare but important consideration for axillary surgery with implications for training
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Langer's arch (LA), although rare, is an important anatomical anomaly in the axilla that may be encountered during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Failure to recognize this anomaly may cause disorientation during ALND, resulting in inadequate clearance, with implications for local disease recurrence and inaccurate staging. Here, we present a case that highlights the confusion LA can cause even in experienced surgeons. With indications for ALND decreasing, resulting in lower operative numbers, surgeons are less likely to be exposed to this structure during their training. Improving knowledge and understanding of LA is important to ensure breast surgeons' preparedness for axillary surgery.

TI  - Estimation of ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub>concentration using MODIS AOD and corrected regression model over Beijing, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - To establish a new model for estimating ground-level PM(2.5)concentration over Beijing, China, the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground-level PM(2.5)concentration was derived and analysed firstly. Boundary layer height (BLH) and relative humidity (RH) were shown to be two major factors influencing the relationship between AOD and ground-level PM(2.5)concentration. Thus, they are used to correct MODIS AOD to enhance the correlation between MODIS AOD and PM2.5. When using corrected MODIS AOD for modelling, the correlation between MODIS AOD and PM(2.5)was improved significantly. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface temperature (ST) and surface wind speed (SPD) were introduced as auxiliary variables to further improve the performance of the corrected regression model. The seasonal and annual average distribution of PM(2.5)concentration over Beijing from 2014 to 2016 were mapped for intuitively analysing. Those can be regarded as important references for monitoring the ground-level PM(2.5)concentration distribution. It is obviously that the PM(2.5)concentration distribution over Beijing revealed the trend of "southeast high and northwest low", and showed a significant decrease in annual average PM(2.5)concentration from 2014 to 2016.

TI  - Mannan activates tissue native and IgE-sensitized mast cells to proinflammatory response and chemotaxis in TLR4-dependent manner
T2  - JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mast cells take part in host defense against microorganisms as they are numerous at the portal of infection, exert several essential mechanisms of pathogen destruction, and they express pattern recognition receptors. Accumulating evidence indicates that these cells are involved in the control and clearance of bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, but much less is known about their contribution in defense against fungi. The study was aimed to establish whether mannan, which comprises an outermost layer and major structural constituent of the fungal cell wall, may directly stimulate tissue mast cells to the antifungal response. Our findings indicate that mannan activates mast cells isolated from the rat peritoneal cavity to initiate the proinflammatory response. We found that mannan stimulates mast cells to release histamine and to generate cysteinyl leukotrienes, cytokines (IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, TNF), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3). It also increased the mRNA expression of various cytokines/chemokines. We also documented that mannan strongly activates mast cells to generate reactive oxygen species and serves as a potent chemoattractant for these cells. Furthermore, we established that mannan-induced activity of mast cells is mediated via TLR4 with the involvement of the spleen tyrosine kinase molecule. Taking together, our results clearly support the idea that mast cells act as sentinel cells and crucially determine the course of the immune response during fungal infection. Additionally, presented data on IgE-coated mast cells suggest that exposure to fungal mannan could influence the severity of IgE-dependent diseases, including allergic ones.

TI  - Study on the spatial-temporal variation in evapotranspiration in China from 1948 to 2018
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance for the efficient utilization of water resources and the construction of the ecological environment in China to fully understand the evolution process of the spatial-temporal pattern of evapotranspiration (ET). With the use of the v2.0 and v2.1 ET data sets combined with the Global Land Data Assimilation System and Noah model, this paper selects pixels as the basic research object to analyse the spatial-temporal variation in ET in China during the 71 years from 1948 to 2018. We first applied the TFPW-MK test to study the annual ET trend in China throughout the 71-year period, including the ET trend of each month from January to December and the annual total ET trend. Moreover, we examined the spatial variation in these trends. In addition, we calculated the variation coefficient of the time series of each pixel's ET throughout the 71-year period and the variation coefficient of the spatial distribution of ET in each year to analyse the spatial-temporal fluctuations in ET in the study area. Finally, the Hurst index was adopted to evaluate the future ET trend. Based on these analyses, we observed the following novel spatial-temporal characteristics of ET: from 1948 to 2018, (1) the ET in most regions covered by 89.5% of all pixels in China exhibits an increasing trend. (2) The ET trend in China varies greatly with the change in months, and many regions show the most or least obvious increasing trend (or decreasing trend) at different times. (3) The area with an increasing trend is the largest in May and the smallest in December, and more than half of the pixels in all months of a year reveal an increasing trend. (4) In the northeast, west and south regions of China, the monthly fluctuation in the ET trend is relatively large, which indicates that the ET trend in these regions is greatly affected by the month. (5) The fluctuation in ET in China is larger in the north than it is in the south and larger in the west than it is in the east. The most stable fluctuation occurs in East China. (6) The ET trend of almost all the pixels in the study area remains consistent from 1948 to 2018, and there are large areas with a notable continuity. This results in the spatial variation in ET in the study area increasing.

AB  - Every interreligious encounter produces a cross-fertilization of ideas and values. To what extent is the Christian-African indigenous religious encounter mutually impacting? And what aspects of the African worldview make it receptive to Christianity? This article addresses these questions by engaging the underexplored phenomena of African literature, music, and prayer as sources of African values and spirituality, as well as of Christian theology. Through in-depth interviews, focused group discussions, participant-observation, along with archival data and African literary works, it argues that the wealth of African metaphors and values therein richly express African spirituality, values, and Christian theology.

TI  - Children's Narratives of Family Life in Ghana: A Cultural Lens via Story Stems
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A Western worldview pervades the social and psychological study of children. The current study employed a story-stem method to qualitatively explore the daily and family life experiences of young Ghanaian primary school children in urban Ghana through their story narratives. The recorded narratives of 69 5- to 8-year-old children were elicited through presenting stems of common child-caregiver scenarios and thematically analysed. Five overarching themes were identified: daily routines and concerns, child-caregiver interactions, spirituality, death-related fears and depictions, and responses to injury. The narrative themes reveal the likely mental and physical occupations of these children, as characterized by household chores, financial concerns and school concerns, as well as underlying cultural values through their portrayals of parenting values, parental discipline and spiritual beliefs. Story stems depicting common childhood problems (e.g. knee injury) sometimes evoked death and hospitalization subthemes following an escalation of health problems. Possible interpretations for these findings are discussed, taking into account cultural, developmental and emotional factors. Story stems are a promising and developmentally appropriate tool for qualitative analysts to investigate the experiences and worldview of young children in non-Western cultures.

TI  - New insights into Rossby wave packet properties in the extratropical UTLS using GNSS radio occultations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study describes Rossby wave packet (RWP) properties in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) with the use of Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements. This global study covering both hemispheres' extratropics is the first to tackle medium- and synoptic-scale waves with GNSS-RO. We use 1 decade of GNSS-RO temperature and pressure data from the CHAMP, COSMIC, GRACE, Metop-A, Metop-B, SAC-C and TerraSAR-X missions, combining them into one gridded dataset for the years 2007-2016. Our approach to extract RWP anomalies and their envelope uses Fourier and Hilbert transforms over longitude without pre- or post-processing the data. Our study is purely based on observations, only using ERA-Interim winds to provide information about the background wind regimes.The RWP structures that we obtain in the UTLS agree well with theory and earlier studies, in terms of coherent phase or group propagation, zonal scale and distribution over latitudes. Furthermore, we show that RWP pressure anomalies maximize around the tropopause, while RWP temperature anomalies maximize right above the tropopause height with a contrasting minimum right below. RWP activity follows the zonal-mean tropopause during all seasons.RWP anomalies in the lower stratosphere are dynamically coupled to the upper troposphere. They are part of the same system with a quasi-barotropic structure across the UTLS. RWP activity often reaches up to 20 km height and occasionally higher, defying the Charney-Drazin criterion. We note enhanced amplitude and upward propagation of RWP activity during sudden stratospheric warmings.We provide observational support for improvements in RWP diagnostics and wave trend analysis in models and reanalyses. Wave quantities follow the tropopause, and diagnosing them on fixed pressure levels (which the tropopause does not follow) can lead to aliasing. Our novel approach analyzing GNSS-RO pressure anomalies provides wave signals with better continuity and coherence across the UTLS and the stratosphere, compared to temperature anomalies. Thus, RWP vertical propagation is much easier to analyze with pressure data.

TI  - The scale of the whale: using video-tag data to evaluate sea-surface ice concentration from the perspective of individual Antarctic minke whales
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Advances in biologging technology allow researchers access to previously unobservable behavioral states and movement patterns of marine animals. To relate behaviors with environmental variables, features must be evaluated at scales relevant to the animal or behavior. Remotely sensed environmental data, collected via satellites, often suffers from the effects of cloud cover and lacks the spatial or temporal resolution to adequately link with individual animal behaviors or behavioral bouts. This study establishes a new method for remotely and continuously quantifying surface ice concentration (SIC) at a scale relevant to individual whales using on-animal tag video data.Results: Motion-sensing and video-recording suction cup tags were deployed on 7 Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) around the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March of 2018. To compare the scale of camera-tag observations with satellite imagery, the area of view was simulated using camera-tag parameters. For expected conditions, we found the visible area maximum to be similar to 100m(2) which indicates that observations occur at an equivalent or finer scale than a single pixel of high-resolution visible spectrum satellite imagery. SIC was classified into one of six bins (0%, 1-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80%, 81-100%) by two independent observers for the initial and final surfacing between dives. In the event of a disagreement, a third independent observer was introduced, and the median of the three observer's values was used. Initial results (n=6) show that Antarctic minke whales in the coastal bays of the Antarctic Peninsula spend 52% of their time in open water, and only 15% of their time in water with SIC greater than 20%. Over time, we find significant variation in observed SIC, indicating that Antarctic minke occupy an extremely dynamic environment. Sentinel-2 satellite-based approaches of sea ice assessment were not possible because of persistent cloud cover during the study period.Conclusion: Tag-video offers a means to evaluate ice concentration at spatial and temporal scales relevant to the individual. Combined with information on underwater behavior, our ability to quantify SIC continuously at the scale of the animal will improve upon current remote sensing methods to understand the link between animal behavior and these dynamic environmental variables.

TI  - Estimating the expansion of urban areas and urban heat islands (UHI) in Ghana: a case study
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research is focused on identifying urban sprawl pattern and extent in two rapidly growing major Ghanaian cities (Accra and Kumasi) and how urban expansion affected heat island effect over the period of 2002-2017 using remote sensing imagery. The research employed remotely sensed images from Landsat 7 and 8 missions for mapping the urban sprawl. Land cover classification was done by using object-based image analysis, and for land surface temperature estimation single-channel algorithm was used. The intensity and magnitude of urban heat island were estimated. The results showed that urban expansion was more dominant process than densification in both cities. A significant area of bare soils and sparsely vegetated lands became built-up accompanied by total disappearance of forest belt of Kumasi. The intensity and magnitude values indicated the presence and expansion of urban heat island in both cities. However, there was a significant amount of bare lands and sparsely vegetated areas with relatively high surface temperature in and around these cities. From the results of this work, we note that bare or sparsely vegetated land cover types in urban areas located in tropical climates can escalate overall urban temperatures. The urban heat island magnitude values were relatively higher compared to values for European cities during the heat wave of 2016. Although urban configurations and climatic conditions may be the reason for the differences, this shows how alarming and dangerous urban heat islands could be in tropical cities.

AB  - Background Amelanotic melanoma is an extremely rare subtype of cutaneous melanoma. The tumor characteristics are still not well understood, especially for those located in the head and neck. Methods Tumor characteristics of patients diagnosed with amelanotic melanoma of the head and neck (AMHN) from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2015, were analyzed by querying the National Cancer Database. Characteristics of AMHN were subsequently compared with common malignant melanoma of the head and neck (CMMHN). Results Three hundred and sixty-eight patients were diagnosed with AMHN, and 69,267 were diagnosed with CMMHN. Of those with AMHN, 128 (34.8%) had melanoma located on the scalp and neck, and 172 (46.7%) were diagnosed with an early disease stage (i.e., 0, I, or II). When compared with CMMHN, patients with AMHN were more likely to be diagnosed after 80 years of age (25.3% vs. 18.2%; odds ratio [OR], 3.28; 95% CI, 1.09-9.84;P = 0.03), when Breslow depth was between 2.01 and 4.00 mm (28.5% vs. 6.5%; OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.15-3.19;P = 0.01), when ulceration was present (36.7% vs. 9.0%; OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.34-2.97;P = 0.001), and when mitotic count was 1 or more/mm(2)(40.5% vs. 12.8%; OR; 2.53; 95% CI, 1.09-5.89;P = 0.03). No statistical difference was found for sex, specific location, stage, or lymph node involvement. Conclusion Our study determined that AMHN is associated with older age, increased Breslow depth, presence of ulceration, and greater mitotic count when compared with CMMHN.

TI  - The nonlocal universe.
T2  - Communicative & integrative biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We propose that the universe is nonlocal and that the appropriate worldview or paradigm for this understanding is nonlocal realism. Currently the worldview of local realism guides and frames the understanding and interpretations of science. Local realism was the worldview employed by Einstein in his relativity theories, but the principles of this paradigm have operated as the guiding framework for the rest of classic science for more than a century. This paper points to incoherencies in local realism and to the violation of its principles by recent experiments; it suggests that these negative effects have undermined the credibility and legitimacy of this worldview. We offer a more inclusive worldview for the future of science called nonlocal realism. Unlike local realism, the worldview of nonlocal realism encompasses meaning, mind and universal consciousness.

TI  - Spatial modeling of land-use change in a rapidly urbanizing landscape in central Iran: integration of remote sensing, CA-Markov, and landscape metrics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, land use/land cover (LULC) change was predicted in the Greater Isfahan area (GIA), central Iran. The GIA has been growing rapidly in recent years, and attempts to simulate its spatial expansion would be essential to make appropriate decisions in LULC management plans and achieve sustainable development. Several modeling tools were employed to outline sustainable scenarios for future dynamics of LULCs in the region. Specifically, we explored past LULC changes in the study area from 1996 to 2018 and predicted its future changes for 2030 and 2050. For this purpose, we performed object-oriented and decision tree techniques on Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The CA-Markov hybrid model was utilized to analyze past trends and predict future LULC changes. LULC changes were quantitatively measured using landscape metrics. According to the results, the majority of changes were related to increasing residential areas and decreasing irrigated lands. The results indicated that residential lands would grow from 27,886.87 ha to 67,093.62 ha over1996-2050 while irrigated lands decrease from 99,799.4 ha to 50,082.16 ha during the same period of time. The confusion matrix of the 2018 LULC map was built using a total of 525 ground truth points and yielded a Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of 78% and 82%, respectively. Moreover, the confusion matrix constructed base on the Sentinel-2 map, as a reference, to judge the predicted 2018 LULC map with a Kappa coefficient of 88%. The results of this study provide useful insights for sustainable land management. The results of this research also proved the promising capability of remote sensing algorithms, CA-Markov model and landscape metrics future LULC planning in the study area.

TI  - Structural changes of vegetation and its association with microclimate in a successional gradient of low thorn forest in northeastern Mexico
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how microclimate and vegetation are associated during secondary succession is of primary importance for plant conservation in the face of the increasing land cover modification. However, these patterns are still unstudied for many plant communities. This study aimed to evaluate the structure (species richness, Shannon's diversity index, Simpson ' s dominance index, abundance of each species, average height of species, species cover (%), species composition, and indicator values) of a low thorn forest fragment and to analyze its relation with microclimate along a successional gradient. Four stages of succession were delimited by the analysis of Landsat images, in the state of Tamaulipas, northeast Mexico. Statistical models incorporated species richness, diversity indices, abundance, height, and cover, as variables for searching differences between stages, or to evaluate microclimate associations. A total of 70 species, 54 genera, and 27 families were determined. Height of tree layer was the most important variable for discrimination of the successional stages. Conserved areas differed floristically from other stages, associated mainly with the lowest values of wind speed originated by tree layer characteristics. A significant association between species and microclimate was found, being wind speed and relative humidity the most important variables. Some species, due to their high importance values and their patterns of association with microclimate, may be considered as key taxa for low thorn forest, which is a threatened semitropical community in northeast Mexico. Conserved and late successional areas account for climatic regulation of this plant community, and the importance of these forest patches may be considered when establishing biodiversity protection areas.

TI  - Crop-specific phenomapping by fusing Landsat and Sentinel data with MODIS time series
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural production and food security highly depend on crop growth and condition throughout the growing season. Timely and spatially explicit information on crop phenology can assist in informed decision making and agricultural land management. Remote sensing can be a powerful tool for agricultural assessment. Remotely sensed data is ideally suited for both large-scale and field-level analyses due to the wide variability of datasets with diverse spatiotemporal resolution. To derive crop-specific phenometrics, we fused time series from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 with Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Using a linear regression approach, synthetic Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data were created based on MODIS imagery. This fusion-process resulted in synthetic imagery with radiometric characteristics of original Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data. We created four different time series using synthetic data as well as a mix of original and synthetic data. The extracted time series of phenometrics consisting of both synthetic and original data showed high detail in the final phenomaps which allowed intra-field level assessment of crops. In-situ field reports were used for validation. Our phenometrics showed only a few days of deviation for most crops and datasets. The proposed data integration method can be applied in areas where data from a single high-resolution source is scarce.

TI  - Estimation of land surface evapotranspiration using the METRIC model in Nepal
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic and atmospheric properties vary significantly within a small area for a topographically diverse region like Nepal. Remote sensing can be used for large-scale monitoring of atmospheric parameters in such diverse terrains. This work evaluates the Landsat-based METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) model for estimating Evapotranspiration (ET) in Nepal. The slope and aspect of terrain are accounted for in our implementation, making the model suitable for regions with topographical variations. The estimations obtained from the model were compared with ground-based measurements. The root-mean-square error for hourly ET (daily ET) was 0.06 mm h(-1)(1.24 mm d(-1)), while the mean bias error was 0.03 mm h(-1)(0.29 mm d(-1)). These results are comparable with results from other studies in the literature that have used the METRIC model for different regions of the world. Thus, this work validates the applicability of the METRIC model for ET estimation in a mountainous area like Nepal. Further, this implementation provides ET estimation at a very high resolution of 30 m compared to the best available resolution of 5 km in earlier works, without compromising on the accuracy. ET estimation with high resolution over a large region in Nepal has applications in agricultural planning and monitoring, among others.

TI  - Teachers' personal worldviews and RE in England: a way forward?
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Teachers' worldviews may impact their practice in terms of pedagogy, curriculum choices, and the value they assign to, or enthusiasm for, a curriculum subject. In England, Religious Education (RE) involves the teaching of religious and non-religious worldviews. RE teachers often lack training, subject knowledge, confidence or even desire to teach the subject. This article develops a working definition of 'worldview' as an individual's frame of reference, held consciously and subconsciously, that evolves due to life experiences, enabling them to make sense of the world. Hermeneutical tools employed in training sessions with teachers enabled them to identify aspects of their worldviews and the narratives which have formed these. Research was undertaken through semi-structured interviews with 10 Primary school teachers in the South West of England. Findings revealed variations between teachers' worldview-consciousness and the impact of their worldviews on their teaching of RE: notions of 'good life' varied and determined their teaching of, choices within and rationale for RE alongside growing confidence. Depth of understanding was facilitated for some by overseas travel or working and living in an ethnically diverse area. Greater self-understanding for teachers was evident in their acknowledgement of the impact of their own worldviews on their teaching of RE.

TI  - Analysis of a large spatiotemporal groundwater quality dataset, Ontario 2010-2017: Informing human health risk assessment and testing guidance for private drinking water wells
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately 15 million individuals in Ontario are supplied by private water wells (private groundwater supplies). Unlike municipal supplies, private well water quality remains unregulated, with owners responsible for testing, treating, and maintaining their own water supplies. The primary goal of this study was to assess the effect of repeat sampling of private well water in Ontario and investigate the efficacy of geographically- and/or temporally specific testing recommendations and health risk assessments. The current study combines the Well Water Information System Dataset and the Well Water Testing Dataset from 2010 to 2017, inclusive. These two large existing province-wide datasets collated over an eight-year period were merged using an integrated spatial fuzzy logic and (next)- nearest neighbour approach. Provincial sampling data from 239,244 wells (702,861 samples) were analyzed for Escherichia coil to study the relationship between sampling frequency and Escherichia coil detection. Dataset variables were delineated based on hydrogeological setting (e.g. aquifer type, overburden depth, well depth, bedrock type) and seasonality to provide an in-depth understanding of Escherichia coil detection in private well water. Findings reveal differences between detection rates in consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers (p = 0.0191), and across seasons (p < 0.0001). The variability associated with Escherichia coil detection rates was explored by estimating sentinel sampling rates for private wells sampled three times, twelve times and twenty-four times per year. As sample size increases on an annual basis, so too does detection rate, highlighting the need to address current testing frequency guidelines. Future health risk assessments for private well water should consider the impact of spatial and temporal factors on the susceptibility of this drinking water source, leading to an increasingly accurate depiction of private well water contamination and the estimated effects on human health.

TI  - On the Use of Satellite Remote Sensing to Detect Floods and Droughts at Large Scales
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Hydrological extremes, in particular floods and droughts, impact all regions across planet Earth. They are mainly controlled by the temporal evolution of key hydrological variables like precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture, groundwater storage, surface water storage and discharge. Precise knowledge of the spatial and temporal evolution of these variables at the scale of river basins is essential to better understand and forecast floods and droughts. In this article, we present recent advances on the capability of Earth observation (EO) satellites to provide global monitoring of floods and droughts. The local scale monitoring of these events which is traditionally done using high-resolution optical or SAR (synthetic aperture radar) EO and in situ data will not be addressed. We discuss the applications of moderate- to low-spatial-resolution space-based observations, e.g., satellite gravimetry (GRACE and GRACE-FO), passive microwaves (i.e. SMOS) and satellite altimetry (i.e. the JASON series and the Copernicus Sentinel missions), with supporting examples. We examine the benefits and drawbacks of integrating these EO datasets to better monitor and understand the processes at work and eventually to help in early warning and management of flood and drought events. Their main advantage is their large monitoring scale that provides a "big picture" or synoptic view of the event that cannot be achieved with often sparse in situ measurements. Finally, we present upcoming and future EO missions related to this topic including the SWOT mission.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Axillary Surgery and Nodal Irradiation on Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema and Local Tumor Control: Long-Term Results From a Prospective Screening Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSETo independently evaluate the impact of axillary surgery type and regional lymph node radiation (RLNR) on breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) rates in patients with breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODSFrom 2005 to 2018, 1,815 patients with invasive breast cancer were enrolled in a lymphedema screening trial. Patients were divided into the following 4 groups according to axillary surgery approach: sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone, SLNB+RLNR, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) alone, and ALND+RLNR. A perometer was used to objectively assess limb volume. All patients received baseline preoperative and follow-up measurements after treatment. Lymphedema was defined as a >= 10% relative increase in arm volume arising > 3 months postoperatively. The primary end point was the BCRL rate across the groups. Secondary end points were 5-year locoregional control and disease-free-survival.RESULTSThe cohort included 1,340 patients with SLNB alone, 121 with SLNB+RLNR, 91 with ALND alone, and 263 with ALND+RLNR. The overall median follow-up time after diagnosis was 52.7 months for the entire cohort. The 5-year cumulative incidence rates of BCRL were 30.1%, 24.9%, 10.7%, and 8.0% for ALND+RLNR, ALND alone, SLNB+RLNR, and SLNB alone, respectively. Multivariable Cox models adjusted for age, body mass index, surgery, and reconstruction type showed that the ALND-alone group had a significantly higher BCRL risk (hazard ratio [HR], 2.66; P = .02) compared with the SLNB+RLNR group. There was no significant difference in BCRL risk between the ALND+RLNR and ALND-alone groups (HR, 1.20; P = .49) and between the SLNB-alone and SLNB+RLNR groups (HR, 1.33; P = .44). The 5-year locoregional control rates were similar for the ALND+RLNR, ALND-alone, SLNB+RLNR, and SLNB-alone groups (2.8%, 3.8%, 0%, and 2.3%, respectively).CONCLUSIONAlthough RLNR adds to the risk of lymphedema, the main risk factor is the type of axillary surgery used.

TI  - Assessment of vertical ozone profiles from INSAT-3D sounder over the Central Himalaya
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical distribution of ozone has been obtained for the first time using INSAT-3D for the period 2013-2017 over the central Himalaya and validated utilizing balloon-borne observations from a high- altitude site in Nainital (29.4 degrees N, 79.5 degrees E, 1793 m amsl). The INSAT-3D retrieved ozone profiles captured ozone gradient and ozone peak altitude successfully, despite only one IR channel for ozone. This demonstrates the capability of the INSAT-3D Sounder in capturing the observed features, with a smaller bias in the stratosphere and somewhat larger bias in the troposphere. Total ozone column from INSAT-3D showed maximum difference of 8% with ozonesonde- derived total ozone column. Larger ozone bias in the lower troposphere could be attributed to lower reliability of regression coefficient and INSAT- 3D channel constraints itself, whereas high variability near the tropopause is possibly due to low ozone, poor temperature retrieval near the tropopause and stratosphere-troposphere transport process in the Himalayan region.

TI  - Forest Change Detection Using an Optimized Convolution Neural Network
T2  - IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plays a pivotal role in maintaining the ecological balance. It is necessary to detect the changes in forest cover as the forests have a significant role in promoting carbon cycle. Remote sensing domain has shown a promising potential for monitoring forest degradation. However, the problem arising due to missing satellite images in temporal domain and problems due to artefacts such as clouds need to be addressed. To detect the changes in the forest area, an index for mapping forest cover known as Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) has been used. NDFI is calculated for three satellite images (Landsat7, Landsat8, and Sentinal2) and for the fusion of all these satellite images. Following this, the missing image is predicted by applying regression methods and the best regression method was identified. For change detection problem, optimal values for Convolution Neural Network (CNN) parameters were obtained using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Later, various filters were applied for the optimal CNN and best filter was identified.

TI  - A multi-year and high-resolution inventory of biomass burning emissions in tropical continents from 2001-2017 based on satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning in the tropics significantly impacts the regional and global atmospheric budget, climate change, and air pollution. This study developed a multi-year (2001-2017), high-resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees), monthly biomass burning emissions inventory covering all land types in tropical continents (Americas, Africa, and Asia). The emissions inventory was based on the updated MCD64A1 burned area product, MODIS fire radiative power (FRP) data, satellite and observational data of aboveground biomass density, spatiotemporal variable combustion efficiency, a conversion ratio, and emission factors. The results showed that the average annual emissions in tropical continents for 2001-2017 were 1.73 Tg BC, 10.85 Tg CH4, 261.41 Tg CO2, 6083.69 Tg CO2, 3.60 Tg NH3, 39.75 Tg NMOC, 11.99 Tg NOx, 18.40 Tg OC, 29.63 Tg PM2.5, and 2.19 Tg SO2. Taking CO2 as an example, woody savanna/shrubland fire was the largest contributor, accounting for 52% (3.16 x 10(3) Tg a(-1)) of total CO2 emissions, followed by fires in savanna/grassland (27%), forest (17%), cropland (3%), and peatland (1%). Africa was the largest emitter (3.77 x 10(3) Tg a(-1)), larger than Asia (1.20 x 10(3) Tg a(-1)) and the Americas (1.11 x 10(3) Tg a(-1)). The dominant fire types of vegetation burning were savanna/grassland in the Americas, woody savanna/shrubland in Africa, and forest in Asia. Moreover, biomass burning CO2 emissions exhibited considerable interannual variations, with high values in 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2015. Extensive savanna/grassland burning in the Americas in September and woody savanna/shrubland fires in Africa in August jointly led to peak CO2 emissions in August-September. This multi-year and high-resolution inventory for biomass burning emissions could be used in studies on global and regional biogeochemical circulation, atmospheric simulation, and air quality modeling.

TI  - Emissions of toxic gases and aerosols in southern Africa observed during the 2019 JJASO period
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are several different types of sources responsible for the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and aerosols in Africa. These emissions make the African continent vulnerable to the impacts on climate change, human health and the environment. It has been shown that the southern African emissions are dominant in the winter season (JJA). However, few studies have been done to study the winter and spring season in unison to understand these emissions. Therefore, in this study, both satellite data, such as Sentinel-5P and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), and reanalysis data from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), were used to study emissions in the 2019 JJASO period. Furthermore, the sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test was used to study the trends of SO2, CO, Angstrom exponent and UV aerosol index data during the 2019 JJASO period. The results from sentinel-5P showed the dominance of CO and NO2 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and dominance of SO2 and NO2 in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). These emissions were largely from wildfires and coal-fired power stations, respectively. However, an SO2 hot spot was also observed over the DRC region which was found to be from an active volcano. CALIPSO data agreed with these observations and further showed the maximum vertical distribution of these aerosols and gases to be at similar to 2 km. The SQMK test of Angstrom exponent and UV aerosol index showed that aerosol dominance from emissions change during the JJASO period. Therefore, studying the JJASO period does give a better understanding of emissions in southern Africa.

TI  - Assessing the relationship between surface levels of PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter impact on COVID-19 in Milan, Italy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic, transmittable and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 and January 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China and fast spread later on the middle of February 2020 in the Northern part of Italy and Europe.This study investigates the correlation between the degree of accelerated diffusion and lethality of COVID-19 and the surface air pollution in Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region, Italy. Daily average concentrations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) in two size fractions PM2.5, PM10 and maxima PM10 ground level atmospheric pollutants together air quality and climate variables (daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure field and Planetary Boundary Layer-PBL height) collected during 1 January-30 April 2020 were analyzed. In spite of being considered primarily transmitted by indoor bioaerosols droplets and infected surfaces, or direct human-to-human personal contacts, it seems that high levels of urban air pollution, weather and specific climate conditions have a significant impact on the increased rates of confirmed COVID-19 Total number, Daily New and Total Deaths cases, possible attributed not only to indoor but also to outdoor airborne bioaerosols distribution. Our analysis demonstrates the strong influence of daily averaged ground levels of particulate matter concentrations, positively associated with average surface air temperature and inversely related to air relative humidity on COVID-19 cases outbreak in Milan. Being a novel pandemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) version, COVID-19 might be ongoing during summer conditions associated with higher temperatures and low humidity levels. Presently is not clear if this protein "spike" of the new coronavirus COVID-19 is involved through attachment mechanisms on indoor or outdoor airborne aerosols in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host in some agglomerated urban areas like Milan is.

TI  - Regional Lymph Node Involvement Among Patients With De Novo Metastatic Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for node-positive breast cancer reduces distant metastases and improves survival, albeit with limited reduction in regional nodal recurrences. The mechanism by which RNI robustly reduces distant metastases while modestly influencing nodal recurrences (ie, the presumed target of RNI) remains unclear. Objective To determine whether some distant metastases putatively arise from occult regional nodal disease and whether regional recurrences otherwise remain largely undetected until an advanced cancer presentation. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study examined patients presenting with de novo stage IV breast cancer to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, New York, from 2006 to 2018. Medical records were reviewed to ascertain clinicopathological parameters, including estrogen receptor status and survival. Pretreatment positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging was reviewed to ascertain the extent of regional nodal involvement at metastatic diagnosis using standard nodal assessment criteria. A subset underwent regional lymph node biopsy for diagnostic confirmation and served to validate the radiographic nodal assessment. Data analysis was performed from October 2019 to February 2020. Exposures Untreated metastatic breast cancer. Main Outcome and Measures The primary outcome was the likelihood of regional nodal involvement at the time of metastatic breast cancer presentation and was determined by reviewing pretreatment PET-CT imaging and lymph node biopsy findings. Results Among 597 women (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [44-65] years) with untreated metastatic breast cancer, 512 (85.8%) exhibited regional lymph node involvement by PET-CT or nodal biopsy, 509 (85%) had involvement of axillary level I, 328 (55%) had involvement in axillary level II, 136 (23%) had involvement in axillary level III, 101 (17%) had involvement in the supraclavicular fossa, and 96 (16%) had involvement in the internal mammary chain. Lymph node involvement was more prevalent among estrogen receptor-negative tumors (92.4%) than estrogen receptor-positive tumors (83.6%). Nodal involvement at the time of metastatic diagnosis was not associated with overall survival. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that a majority of patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer harbor regional lymph node disease at presentation, consistent with the hypothesis that regional involvement may precede metastatic dissemination. This is in alignment with the findings of landmark trials suggesting that RNI reduces distant recurrences. It is possible that this distant effect of RNI may act via eradication of occult regional disease prior to systemic seeding. The challenges inherent in detecting isolated nodal disease (which is typically asymptomatic) may account for the more modest observed benefit of RNI on regional recurrences. Alternative explanations of nodal involvement that arises concurrently or after metastatic dissemination remain possible, but do not otherwise explain the association of RNI with distant recurrence.This cohort study examines whether and why regional node irradiation in patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer has different levels of effectiveness for preventing recurrences of cancer in regional nodes and distant mestastases.Question Following resection of a localized breast cancer, why does adjuvant regional nodal irradiation (RNI) reduce distant recurrences to a greater extent than regional recurrences, despite only targeting the regional lymph nodes? Findings In this cohort study of 597 patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer, 85.8% harbored regional disease at the time of metastatic presentation. The consistent detection of concurrent regional and metastatic disease, along with the reduction in distant recurrences observed following RNI, is consistent with the hypothesis that regional nodal disease may precede metastatic dissemination. Meaning These findings suggest that RNI may reduce distant recurrences by sterilizing occult regional nodal disease prior to systemic seeding.

TI  - Combining low-cost, surface-based aerosol monitors with size-resolved satellite data for air quality applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor air quality is the world's single largest environmental health risk, and air quality monitoring is crucial for developing informed air quality policies. Efforts to monitor air pollution in different countries are uneven, largely due to the high capital costs of reference air quality monitors (AQMs), especially for airborne particulate matter (PM). In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, few cities operate AQM systems. It is thus important to examine the potential of alternative monitoring approaches. Although PM measurements can be obtained from low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs), data quality can be an issue.This paper develops a new method using raw aerosol size distributions from multiple, surface-based low-cost OPCs to constrain the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) component-specific, column aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, which contain some particle-size-resolved information. The combination allows us to derive surface aerosol concentrations for particles as small as similar to 0.1 mu m in diameter, which MISR detects but are below the OPC detection limit of similar to 0.5 mu m. As such, we obtain better constraints on the near-surface particulate matter (PM) concentration, especially as the smaller particles tend to dominate urban pollution.We test our method using data from five low-cost OPCs deployed in the city of Nairobi, Kenya, from 1 May 2016 to 2 March 2017. As MISR passes over Nairobi only once in about 8 d, we use the size-resolved MISR AODs to scale the more frequent Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-derived AODs over our sites. The size distribution derived from MISR and MODIS agrees well with that from the OPCs in the size range where the data overlap (adjusted-R-2 similar to 0.80). We then calculate surface-PM concentration from the combined data. The situation for this first demonstration of the technique had significant limitations. We thus identify factors that will reduce the uncertainty in this approach for future experiments. Within these constraints, the approach has the potential to greatly expand the range of cities that can afford to monitor long-term air quality trends and help inform public policy. that from the OPCs in the size range where the data overlap (adjusted- R-2 similar to 0.80).

TI  - Spatiotemporal snow cover characterization and its linkage with climate change over the Chenab river basin, western Himalayas
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of snow cover variability is crucial because it is closely linked with mountain water resources, ecosystems, and climate change. For this, moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products (SCPs, version 6) were used over the Chenab river basin (CRB) during 2001-2017. In these data, cloud cover is a significant problem that produces a discontinuity in spatial and temporal scale for long-term snow cover monitoring. Therefore, a sequential non-spectral composite methodology (with five successive steps) was applied to reduce cloud obscuration. Further, the cloud gap-filled SCPs were validated with the indirect method as well as high-resolution satellite data (Landsat-8). Results indicate that the cloud-removed SCPs show an overall efficiency of 92.81.6% with an indirect approach, while an overestimation (9.3%) was observed between Landsat and MODIS snow cover area (SCA) along with higher correlation (R = 0.99,p ). The result shows an increasing trend (0.25%) of mean annual SCA during 2001-2017, while it is slightly decreasing since 2009 and was statistically insignificant. Moreover, the Snow Cover Day and nine indexes (from snow depletion curves) were derived for snow cover characterization, indicating that a shift or change in the snow accumulation period in terms of the seasonal snow cover in the recent decade. Furthermore, the linear relationships between SCA and climatic variables were established to identify the influence of snow cover distribution and its related snowmelt onset. The analysis demonstrated that the precipitation and net shortwave radiation (SWN) were increasing in the north-eastern region of the basin. However, the air temperature () and wind speed showed a declining trend. Furthermore, associated uncertainty and sensitivity analyzes were performed, suggesting that the SCA is more sensitive to. However, it may be less susceptible to precipitation during the melt season. Overall, this finding indicates the potential importance of climatic variables on the snow cover distribution that is essential for proper management of the hydrological system.

TI  - Watershed characteristics and physico-chemical analysis of lakes and reservoirs in North Western, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the physico-chemical characteristics of Lakes and reservoirs in relation to the watershed condition of North Western Ethiopia. A mosaic image from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) path/ row 169/052, 169/053, 170/052, and 170/053 for March, 2018 is used for land cover analysis. Physico-chemical parameters including Surface water temperature, pH, Turbidity, Electrical conductivity, Total dissolved solid (TDS), and Nitrate concentration have been measured using Thermometer, pH meter, Turbidity meter, Conductivity /TDS meter, and Photometer, respectively. The findings revealed that the higher areal coverage of the catchments was recorded for Gudera-Geray-Tikurwuha catchments (3371 km(2)) where all these three water bodies are found within the same catchment followed by Tirba Catchment (1395 km(2)). Other water bodies such as Zengena and Bahire Giyorgis are within independent catchment area 684 km(2)and 278 km(2)), respectively. High levels in physico-chemical properties (turbidity, TDS and conductivity) were observed in Lake Bahire Giyorgis, Geray and Tikurwuha reservoirs whereas, these levels were considerably lower in the highland water bodies of Tirba and Zengena. These findings indicated clear differences in watershed and physico-chemical characteristics among the water bodies under consideration. These differences could be attributed to the different patterns of land use, source of pollution, vegetation cover and geochemistry of the catchments areas. Moreover, it has been noticed that the water use and abstraction by local community is not in proper management. Most of the agricultural practices such as irrigation, farming, and fishing, are implemented without considering sustainable management of the water bodies. Municipal wastes are also affecting the water bodies particularly the Tikur Wuha reservoir. Therefore, it is demanding to conduct further research on water quality, sediment load, trends in water volume and detailed study on biological components to come up with sustainable solution for the lakes and reservoirs.

TI  - The utility of fused airborne laser scanning and multispectral data for improved wind damage risk assessment over a managed forest landscape in Finland
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messageThe potential of airborne laser scanning (ALS) and multispectral remote sensing data to aid in generating improved wind damage risk maps over large forested areas is demonstrated. This article outlines a framework to generate such maps, primarily utilizing the horizontal structural information contained in the ALS data. Validation was done over an area in Eastern Finland that had experienced sporadic wind damage.ContextWind is the most prominent disturbance element for Finnish forests. Hence, tools are needed to generate wind damage risk maps for large forested areas, and their possible changes under planned silvicultural operations.Aims(1) How effective are ALS-based forest variables (e.g. distance to upwind forest stand edge, gap size) for identifying high wind damage risk areas? (2) Can robust estimates of predicted critical wind speeds for uprooting of trees be derived from these variables? (3) Can these critical wind speed estimates be improved using wind multipliers, which factor in topography and terrain roughness effects?MethodsWe first outline a framework to generate several wind damage risk-related parameters from remote sensing data (ALS + multispectral). Then, we assess if such parameters have predictive power. That is, whether they help differentiate between damaged and background points. This verification exercise used 42 wind damaged points spread over a large area.ResultsParameters derived from remote sensing data are shown to have predictive power. Risk models based on critical wind speeds are not that robust, but show potential for improvement.ConclusionOverall, this work described a framework to get several wind risk-related parameters from remote sensing data. These parameters are shown to have potential in generating wind damage risk maps over large forested areas.

TI  - Contributions of Space Missions to Better Tsunami Science: Observations, Models and Warnings
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most tsunamis occur after large submarine earthquakes, particularly in the Pacific Ocean. However, following the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, tsunami hazard awareness was significantly raised at the global scale, and warning systems were developed in many other regions, where large tsunamis are rarer but can also produce large catastrophes. Here we first review the basic physics of a tsunami, from its triggering to its coastal impact, and we offer a review of the geophysical and sea-level data that can describe the various processes operating during a tsunami. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data have a key role in better describing the ground deformation following a tsunamigenic earthquake close to the coast. The GNSS observations complement seismological data to constrain the rupture model rapidly and robustly. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) also contributes to this field, as well as optical imagery, relevant to monitoring elevation changes following subaerial landslides. The observation of the sea-level variations, in the near field and during the propagation across the ocean, can also increasingly benefit from GNSS data (from GNSS buoys) and from robust satellite communication: pressure gauges anchored on the seafloor in the deep ocean contribute to warning systems only by data continuously transmitted through satellites. The sounding of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) variations through GNSS, altimetry, or a ground-based airglow camera, is a promising way to record tsunami initiation and propagation indirectly. Finally, GNSS, optical and SAR imagery are essential to map and quantify the damage following tsunami flooding. Satellite data are expected to contribute more to operational systems in the future provided they are reliably available and analysed in real time.

TI  - Seasonal and transient surface displacements in the Kumamoto area, Japan, associated with the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake: implications for seismic-induced groundwater level change
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence on April 14 (M(w)6.2) and April 16 (M(w)7.0) altered the regional groundwater level. To better understand the relationship between groundwater level change and surface displacement, we estimated surface displacement in the Kumamoto area (Japan) using persistent scatterer interferometry from 19 ALOS/PALSAR images acquired between January 7, 2007 and March 5, 2011, 28 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images acquired between April 17, 2016 and December 10, 2018, and 113 Sentinel-1 images acquired between May 26, 2016 and December 30, 2018. Our estimation shows that transient surface displacement occurred following the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence, together with seasonal surface displacement that was not detected from the 2007-2011 images. We suggest that a portion of the transient displacement occurred via groundwater drawdown through new ruptures that formed owing to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence and sediment compaction. Seasonal surface displacements detected after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence are linked to groundwater level variations.

TI  - Wildfires in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania: Burned areas, underlying causes and management challenges
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Arc Mountains are one of the most important ecosystems that conserve biodiversity in the world. These ecosystems are threatened by the increasing occurrence of wildfires. Nevertheless, there is inadequate information useful for the development of effective strategies to prevent or respond to future fires. This paper analyses the current extent of dry season fires, underlying causes and the effectiveness of the fire management strategy being implemented in and around the Uluguru Nature Forest Reserve (UNFR) between 2016 and 2021. Differenced Normalised Burn Ratio derived from Landsat satellite images was applied to determine the extent of burned areas, and focus group discussions were held to determine the underlying causes of fires and the extent of implementation of fire management strategies. About 2% (472 ha) of reserved UNFR and 5% (2,854 ha) of unreserved forests were burned in 2017. Some of the fires impacted on 60% (370 ha) of the grassyLukwanguleplateau, which is home to a fire-sensitive endemic species. The underlying causes of fires varied spatially across the mountains but generally, fire escaping from farm preparation and hunting activities were found to be the most prevalent. On average, survey participants perceived that fire management strategy objectives were achieved by only 29% mainly constrained by a shortage of financial and human resources. Our findings suggest that ignitions and fire spread in UNFR could be prevented or controlled through sustainable funding of fire management activities and the effective engagement of local communities in the management of the reserve.

TI  - Syndromic Surveillance Insights from a Symptom Assessment App Before and During COVID-19 Measures in Germany and the United Kingdom: Results From Repeated Cross-Sectional Analyses
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Unprecedented lockdown measures have been introduced in countries worldwide to mitigate the spread and consequences of COVID-19. Although attention has been focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to the limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools.Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real-time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers.Methods: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an assessment within the Ada app in Germany and the United Kingdom was conducted between two periods, namely before and after the implementation of "Phase One" COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using a Pearson chi-square test and reported as log2 fold changes.Results: Overall, 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Overall, 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the United Kingdom reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany: 68,600/103,200, 66.52%; United Kingdom: 51,200/71,600, 72.74%). The majority were aged 10-29 years (Germany: 68,500/100,000, 68.45%; United Kingdom: 50,900/68,800, 73.91%), and about one-quarter were aged 30-59 years (Germany: 26,200/100,000, 26.15%; United Kingdom: 14,900/68,800, 21.65%). Overall, 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures period as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were reported in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (log2 fold change, P value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. In total, 14 of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables.Conclusions: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.

TI  - Ecohydrological responses to surface flow across borders: Two decades of changes in vegetation greenness and water use in the riparian corridor of the Colorado River delta
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological and bioclimatic processes that lead to drought may stress plants and wildlife, restructure plant community type and architecture, increase monotypic stands and bare soils, facilitate the invasion of non-native plant species and accelerate soil erosion. Our study focuses on the impact of a paucity of Colorado River surface flows from the United States (U.S.) to Mexico. We measured change in riparian plant greenness and water use over the past two decades using remotely sensed measurements of vegetation index (VI), evapotranspiration (ET) and a new annualized phenology assessment metric (PAM) for ET. We measure these long-term (2000-2019) metrics and their short-term (2014-2019) response to an environmental, pulse flow in 2014, as prescribed under Minute 319 of the 1944 Water Treaty between the two nations. In subsequent years, small-directed flows were provided to restoration areas under Minute 323. We use 250 m MODIS and 30 m Landsat imagery to evaluate three vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2). We select EVI2 to parameterize an optical-based ET algorithm and test the relationship between ET from Landsat and MODIS by regression approaches. Our analyses show significant decreases in VIs and ET for both the 20-year and post-pulse 5-year periods. Over the last 20 years, EVI(Landsat)declined 34% (30% by EVIMODIS) and ET(Landsat-EVI)declined 38% (27% by ETMODIS-EVI), overall ca. 1.61 mm/day or 476 mm/year drop in ET; using PAM ET(Landsat-EVI)the drop was from 1130 to 654 mm/year. Over the 5 years since the 2014 pulse flow, EVI(Landsat)declined 20% (13% by EVIMODIS) and ET(Landsat-EVI)declined 23% (4% by ETMODIS-EVI) with a 0.77 mm/day or a 209 mm/year 5-year drop in ET; using PAM ET(Landsat-EVI)the drop was from 863 to 654 mm/year. Data and change maps show the pulse flow contributed enough water to slow the rate of loss, but only for the very short-term (1-2 years). These findings are critically important as they suggest further deterioration of biodiversity, wildlife habitat and key ecosystem services due to anthropogenic diversions of water in the U.S. and Mexico and from land clearing, fires and plant-related drought which affect hydrological processes.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is needed in a range of applications in hydrology, climatology, ecology, and agriculture. Remote sensing-based estimation is the only viable and economical method for ET estimation over large areas. The current Landsat satellites provide images every 16 days limiting the ability to capture biophysical changes affecting ET. Thus, we explored the potential integration of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for estimating ET using a surface energy balance model. The results indicate the proposed Landsat-Sentinel data fusion approach substantially reduced relative errors from 48% to 10% on area-wide and from 49% to 17% on pixel-wide compared to linear interpolation between two Landsat images. The proposed approach had a better agreement with expected actual ET maps across high-vegetation conditions than in low-vegetation conditions. The finer temporal resolution and better accuracy of ET maps based on Landsat-Sentinel integration is of great importance in managing limited water resources.

AB  - The present study examined whether a mismatch between sex and gender in transgender women in Israel affects their internal worldview as expressed in gender role ideology (liberal-feminist vs. conservative-chauvinistic views), and their perception of body image. 40 cisgender men, 40 cisgender women, and 41 transgender women (total of 121). Both in relation to gender roles and body image, transgender women perceived their inner world as more compatible with that of cisgender women, and different from that of cisgender men. The inner world of transgender women is affected more by the gender they associated with than by the gender of birth, an important and relevant finding for professionals who treat this population or work with them.

TI  - Geo-Environmental Changes and Their Impact on the Development of the Limestone Plateau, West of Assiut, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the important projects that the Egypt country seeks to implement is the desert areas development, which contributes significantly to agricultural and urban development. Development of desert areas, especially agricultural development, should be carried out scientifically in terms of the use of available water resources, irrigation methods according to the type of soil and taking the geo-environmental risks into consideration. The objective of this research is to assess the geo-environmental impact in the region under consideration and their effect on their natural components during their development phases. Estimating the rate of land-use/land-cover changes in the area is extremely important for the management of natural resources. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have been used to process the geological, topographical, land-use/land-cover and also locating high-risk areas that could be affected by flash flooding. This study showed that the study area comprises three land-cover classes: urban, agricultural and barren land. The expansion in the agricultural and residential areas was estimated from the Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2018. The results had deduced the reasons for increasing the agricultural area and the validity of the western plateau lands for agricultural reclamation as well as land investment for residential projects such as Nasser city. The results indicate that the vegetated land increased by 9.68% and urban land by 3.17% after reclamation efforts were initiated.

TI  - Using emergency department syndromic surveillance to investigate the impact of a national vaccination program: A retrospective observational study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Rotavirus infection is a common cause of gastroenteritis in children worldwide, with a high mortality burden in developing countries, particularly during the first two years of life. Rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the United Kingdom childhood vaccination schedule in July 2013, with high coverage (>90%) achieved by June 2016. We used an emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance system to assess the impact of the rotavirus vaccination programme, specifically through the demonstration of any immediate and continuing impact on ED gastroenteritis visits in England. Methods This retrospective, observational study used syndromic surveillance data collected from 3 EDs in the two years before (July 2011-June 2013) and 3 years post (July 2013-June 2016) introduction of rotavirus vaccination. The weekly levels of ED visits for gastroenteritis (by age group and in total) during the period before rotavirus vaccination was first described alongside the findings of laboratory surveillance of rotavirus during the same period. An interrupted time-series analysis was then performed to demonstrate the impact of rotavirus vaccination introduction on gastroenteritis ED visit levels. Results During the two years before vaccine introduction ED visits for gastroenteritis in total and for the 0-4 years age group were seen to rise and fall in line with the seasonal rotavirus increases reported by laboratory surveillance. ED gastroenteritis visits by young children were lower in the three years following introduction of rotavirus vaccination (reduced from 8% of visits to 6% of visits). These attendance levels in young children (0-4years) remained higher than in older age groups, however the previously large seasonal increases in children were greatly reduced, from peaks of 16% to 3-10% of ED visits per week. Conclusions ED syndromic surveillance demonstrated a reduction in gastroenteritis visits following rotavirus vaccine introduction. This work establishes ED syndromic surveillance as a platform for rapid impact assessment of future vaccine programmes.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Candidate Serotypes of<i>Enterovirus</i>Vaccines Among Korean Children
T2  - VIRAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a pediatric public health concern in Asia. Surveillance data on the circulating serotypes of HFMD suggest thatEnterovirusA71 (EV-A71) and coxsackieviruses A6, A10, and A16 (CVA6, CVA10, and CVA16) are the major serotypes causing HFMD. Asian countries, including Korea, are currently developing a multivalent vaccine targeting these serotypes. However, the immunity of children against specific serotypes, indicating past infection, should also be considered while selecting candidate serotypes for vaccine development. Therefore, we aimed to identify the age-stratified serological statuses of Korean children to determine candidate serotypes for HFMD vaccine development. This study included 220 participants, categorized into four age groups, 7 months-2 years, 3-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11-15 years. A neutralization test was performed to quantitate the neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) in the sera of the participants. Only EV-A71 and CVA6 were found suitable as candidate serotypes for vaccine development, whereas further study is needed for CVA10 and CVA16. The highest seropositivity and NtAb titer ranges were observed for CVA6 in all age groups, suggesting that the participants had been predominantly exposed to CVA6. For EV-A71, seropositivity and NtAb titer ranges steadily increased with age, suggesting that children were currently exposed to EV-A71. For CVA10, the 3-5 years group showed the highest seropositivity rate and higher NtAb titer ranges than the older age groups, indicating that the exposure to CVA10 had mainly occurred in recent years. Future studies will identify whether the exposure to CVA10 was transient or will continue. For CVA16, seropositivity and NtAb titer ranges were generally low, indicating that only a few participants had been exposed to CVA16. We identified discrepancies between the sentinel surveillance data and our findings. This study provides a new perspective for HFMD vaccine development and policy making in Asian countries.

TI  - An improved trend vegetation analysis for non-stationary NDVI time series based on wavelet transform
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to improve trend analysis for non-stationary Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series (TS) over different areas in Tunisia based on the wavelet transform (WT) multi-resolution analysis (MRA-WT), statistical test, and meteorological data. The MRA-WT was applied in order to decompose the TS into different components. However, the most challenge for TS analysis using MRA-WT laid in the selection of two optimum parameters: the level of decomposition and mother wavelet (MW). In this work, both factors were investigated. Firstly, the level of decomposition was calculated for 18 different MWs, and secondly the energy to Shannon entropy ratio criterion was investigated to choose the most suitable MW. The Mann-Kendall test (MK) and Sen's slope were applied to the last approximation component in order to analyze long-term vegetation changes. Finally, the influence of meteorological data for trend was analyzed. The results were first computed for different sites in Tunisia using MODIS NDVI TS from 2001 to 2017. The obtained results proved the importance of MW selection. Level 5 was considered for the TS as the best level of decomposition for long-term vegetation changes. The Daubechies and Symlets MWs (db9andsym4) showed the highest energy to entropy ratio for three selected vegetation canopies. A combination of the two MW was proposed to derive a trend vegetation analysis at image level. A degradation in the forest area and a few increases in cropland and vegetation area were presented.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Generation and Visualization of Virtual 3D City Model Using Open Source Libraries
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Virtual 3D city models are digital representation of terrain surfaces, sites, buildings, roads, waterways, etc. In general, these models are used for presenting, exploring and analyzing the urban areas. These models are also used in domains of smart city, virtual reality, infrastructure planning, telecommunication, disaster management, real estate services, education, tourism and change detection. There are various approaches and commercial packages to generate virtual 3D city models. In this novel approach, we have not used any commercial package or tool toward generation and visualization of city model but instead developed in-house routines and used libraries from open source domain to generate and visualize real-time virtual 3D city models. Generation of 3D city models involves the imagery from high-resolution satellite, high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and vector shape files from open street maps (OSM) (https://www.geofabrik.de/geofabrik/openstreetmap.html) as inputs. Over and above virtual 3D city models, OSM vector layers of road network, river network and important places have been overlaid for making the virtual city model more informative. Toward realism, virtual trees are placed in the open spaces (as per shape file markings), Sun position and day/night effects, ambient condition effects and building texture, has been incorporated. To achieve generation of city model, we mosaicked preprocessed DEM scenes and images, resampled given datasets using cubic-resampling algorithm, registered the image, DEM and vector layers using phase correlation algorithm, and extracted the height information by processing of DEM and shape files. Vector layers are registered using latitude and longitude and overlaid over the 3D city model for information about the places, roads and water bodies. For efficient visualization and rendering of the model, open scene graph library and tiling-based approach are used in which tiles are replaced in the main memory by its sub-tiles based on viewer's position. Mentioned approach is applicable to generate and visualize city model of any given area provided the DEM, imagery and OSM data. This paper mainly discusses the approach and advantages of this new cost-effective approach to develop virtual 3D city models using Indian Remote Sensing datasets.

T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing, with its relatively short history, is going to play a major role in the fields that encompass topics related to place and space. Through this innovation in technology, real-time monitoring and mapping of changing phenomena on the surface of the earth has been possible. The purpose of this study was to investigate and evaluate the Kaunas city air pollutants between 14 and 25 October 2019 using environmental station data and satellite data (Terra, Aqua, OMI, and Sentinel-5P). The data obtained from satellite and the pollutant data gathered from air quality monitoring stations located in different parts of Kaunas were used. The data was downloaded for days mentioned above for the geographical bound of Kaunas city. Each data file covered an area of the size of Lithuania; hence, we should have extracted data for the area of interest, which was Kaunas city. The overall results of this study confirmed the capability of Sentinel-5P data to be used in monitoring the air quality and air pollution over the Kaunas local area. The existence of strong and acceptable correlations between satellite data and in situ measurements was indicative of the ability of satellite images to monitor air pollution, particularly over Kaunas urban areas during the fire incident in the city of Alytus.

TI  - Toward omitting sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The nodal positivity rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ypN+) in patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer is low, especially in those with a pathological complete response of the breast. The aim of this study was to identify characteristics known before surgery that are associated with achieving ypN0 in patients with cN0 disease. These characteristics could be used to select patients in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy may be omitted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods This cohort study included patients with cT1-3 cN0 breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast surgery and sentinel node biopsy between 2013 and 2018. cN0 was defined by the absence of suspicious nodes on ultrasound imaging and PET/CT, or absence of tumour cells at fine-needle aspiration. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of ypN0. Results Overall, 259 of 303 patients (85.5 per cent) achieved ypN0, with high rates among those with a radiological complete response (rCR) on breast MRI (95 center dot 5 per cent). Some 82 per cent of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease, 98 per cent of those with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and all patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease who had a rCR achieved ypN0. Multivariable regression analysis showed that HER2-positive (odds ratio (OR) 5 center dot 77, 95 per cent c.i. 1 center dot 91 to 23 center dot 13) and TNBC subtype (OR 11 center dot 65, 2 center dot 86 to 106 center dot 89) were associated with ypN0 status. In addition, there was a trend toward ypN0 in patients with a breast rCR (OR 2 center dot 39, 0 center dot 95 to 6 center dot 77). Conclusion The probability of nodal positivity after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was less than 3 per cent in patients with TNBC or HER2-positive disease who achieved a breast rCR on MRI. These patients could be included in trials investigating the omission of sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Loss and vulnerability of lowland forests in mainland Southeast Asia
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Despite containing extraordinary levels of biodiversity, lowland (<200 m asl) tropical forests are extremely threatened globally. Southeast Asia is an area of high species richness and endemicity under considerable anthropogenic threat with, unfortunately, scant focus on its lowland forests. We estimated extent of lowland forest loss from 1998 to 2018, including inside protected areas and determined the vulnerability of this remaining forest. Maximum likelihood classification techniques were used to classify Landsat images to estimate lowland forest cover in 1998 and 2018. We used Bayesian belief networks with 20 variables to evaluate vulnerability of the forest that remained in 2018. Analyses were conducted at two spatial scales: landscape patch (analogous to ecoregion) and country level. Over 20 years, >120,000 km(2) of forest (50% of forest present in 1998) was lost. Of the 14 lowland forest patches, 6 lost >50% of their area. At the country scale, Cambodia had the greatest deforestation (>47,500 km(2)). In 2018, 18% of the lowlands were forested, and 20% of these forests had some formal protection. Approximately 50% of the lowland forest inside protected areas (c. 11,000 km(2)) was also lost during the study period. Most lowland forest remaining is highly vulnerable; eight landscape patches had >50% categorized as such. Our results add to a growing body of evidence that the presence of protected areas alone will not prevent further deforestation. We suggest that more collaborative conservation strategies with local communities that accommodate conservation concessions specifically for lowland forests are urgently needed to prevent further destruction of these valuable habitats.

AB  - Landsat data are increasingly used for ecological monitoring and research. These data often require preprocessing prior to analysis to account for sensor, solar, atmospheric, and topographic effects. However, ecologists using these data are faced with a literature containing inconsistent terminology, outdated methods, and a vast number of approaches with contradictory recommendations. These issues can, at best, make determining the correct preprocessing workflow a difficult and time-consuming task and, at worst, lead to erroneous results. We address these problems by providing a concise overview of the Landsat missions and sensors and by clarifying frequently conflated terms and methods. Preprocessing steps commonly applied to Landsat data are differentiated and explained, including georeferencing and co-registration, conversion to radiance, solar correction, atmospheric correction, topographic correction, and relative correction. We then synthesize this information by presenting workflows and a decision tree for determining the appropriate level of imagery preprocessing given an ecological research question, while emphasizing the need to tailor each workflow to the study site and question at hand. We recommend a parsimonious approach to Landsat preprocessing that avoids unnecessary steps and recommend approaches and data products that are well tested, easily available, and sufficiently documented. Our focus is specific to ecological applications of Landsat data, yet many of the concepts and recommendations discussed are also appropriate for other disciplines and remote sensing platforms.
